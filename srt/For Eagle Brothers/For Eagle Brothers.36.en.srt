00:00:02,539 --> 00:00:04,309
(Episode 36)

2
00:00:05,508 --> 00:00:08,368
You resented me a lot, didn't you?

3
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:12,608
I was really remorseful for what I did,

4
00:00:12,948 --> 00:00:15,048
and I regret everything too.

5
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:19,618
I'm sorry, Chun Soo.

6
00:00:23,188 --> 00:00:24,188
Kwang Sook.

7
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:27,128
I'm ashamed to face you.

8
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:28,258
"Kwang Sook?"

9
00:00:31,428 --> 00:00:33,068
I'm sorry to you all.

10
00:00:34,298 --> 00:00:35,398
My gosh.

11
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:39,308
I was too rash, and I didn't think things through.

12
00:00:40,008 --> 00:00:42,308
I did a lot of things I shouldn't have.

13
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:46,378
Give me a chance to make up for it.

14
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:47,948
Enough with that nonsense.

15
00:00:49,478 --> 00:00:50,518
Darling.

16
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:51,748
Who are you calling "darling?"

17
00:00:51,748 --> 00:00:52,988
I'm not your darling.

18
00:00:53,988 --> 00:00:56,258
We're still legally married.

19
00:00:56,388 --> 00:00:57,388
What?

20
00:00:58,788 --> 00:01:01,858
You made a huge scene demanding a divorce.

21
00:01:01,858 --> 00:01:03,658
Why are you changing your mind now?

22
00:01:03,658 --> 00:01:04,858
Exactly.

23
00:01:04,928 --> 00:01:07,168
Did something happen to your head in the last few months?

24
00:01:07,298 --> 00:01:09,498
The divorce isn't final yet.

25
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:11,668
Legally speaking,

26
00:01:12,768 --> 00:01:14,538
I'm still Chun Soo's wife.

27
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,178
- My gosh. - Honey.

28
00:01:16,308 --> 00:01:17,578
Chun Soo!

29
00:01:19,678 --> 00:01:21,408
What if he does something drastic?

30
00:01:21,508 --> 00:01:23,378
- Go after them. - Okay.

31
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:28,618
What is she up to? Is she a psycho?

32
00:01:29,358 --> 00:01:30,358
Wait.

33
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:33,328
What were you going to tell the whole family?

34
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:35,158
It seemed important.

35
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:39,098
Forget it. That's not important right now.

36
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:42,898
It's important to me.

37
00:01:47,868 --> 00:01:49,308
What are you doing?

38
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:50,438
Get out!

39
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:52,908
You have no right to be here.

40
00:01:54,148 --> 00:01:55,648
I know you're upset.

41
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,888
I was extra nasty to you to make you hate me.

42
00:02:00,848 --> 00:02:02,018
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:02,318 --> 00:02:03,658
Forgive me, darling.

44
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:10,998
Why are you doing this now?

45
00:02:13,398 --> 00:02:15,368
I want to start over with you.

46
00:02:15,998 --> 00:02:18,168
I came here to win you back.

47
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:19,168
What?

48
00:02:19,968 --> 00:02:22,238
We have Yeoung Ju.

49
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,478
For Yeoung Ju's sake,

50
00:02:26,478 --> 00:02:28,648
can we start over as a family?

51
00:02:29,018 --> 00:02:30,048
Gosh.

52
00:02:30,848 --> 00:02:32,688
Quit that crazy talk.

53
00:02:35,188 --> 00:02:38,058
Honey. Chun Soo!

54
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:41,358
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

55
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:44,158
To be honest,

56
00:02:44,828 --> 00:02:47,098
I can never find someone like Chun Soo.

57
00:02:49,768 --> 00:02:52,168
I must've been possessed for a while.

58
00:02:53,868 --> 00:02:56,138
You can't say that now!

59
00:02:56,138 --> 00:02:57,308
Exactly.

60
00:02:58,008 --> 00:02:59,748
You missed the bus long ago,

61
00:02:59,748 --> 00:03:01,548
and the bus is about to reach the last stop.

62
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:04,348
Chun Soo has already moved on.

63
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:05,618
Don't get your hopes up.

64
00:03:07,418 --> 00:03:08,918
Aren't you supposed...

65
00:03:08,918 --> 00:03:11,318
to stop Chun Soo at least for Yeoung Ju's sake?

66
00:03:17,898 --> 00:03:18,928
What?

67
00:03:19,428 --> 00:03:20,498
- Well... - What...

68
00:03:22,238 --> 00:03:23,398
My goodness.

69
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:26,908
Wait! Hang on a second!

70
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:28,908
Where are you going?

71
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,478
- My goodness. - Oh, dear.

72
00:03:38,988 --> 00:03:40,388
What are you doing?

73
00:03:40,518 --> 00:03:42,388
I should stay here...

74
00:03:42,658 --> 00:03:43,958
until Chun Soo changes his mind.

75
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:47,228
You have nothing to do with him now. Why are you staying in his room?

76
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,098
What do you mean, I have nothing to do with him?

77
00:03:50,358 --> 00:03:52,668
Nothing has changed legally yet.

78
00:03:52,668 --> 00:03:54,098
We're still legally married.

79
00:03:57,468 --> 00:04:00,168
Stop being ridiculous and get out of here now.

80
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,338
Let go of it!

81
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,408
- Get out! - No!

82
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,248
- Let go! - Stop!

83
00:04:12,148 --> 00:04:14,918
You might end up behind bars like last time.

84
00:04:15,718 --> 00:04:16,918
You should stop it, Kwang Sook.

85
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:22,928
My goodness.

86
00:04:33,638 --> 00:04:36,238
The call cannot be connected and will be transferred to voicemail.

87
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:37,638
Your call may be charged...

88
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:40,378
Today, I'm going to...

89
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:44,548
tell my brothers-in-law...

90
00:04:45,378 --> 00:04:46,448
about you and me.

91
00:04:49,218 --> 00:04:52,058
Is she still talking to her brothers-in-law?

92
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,428
(Eagle Brewery)

93
00:05:22,618 --> 00:05:23,658
Kwang Sook.

94
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:27,988
Are you sleeping here?

95
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,358
Well... Yes.

96
00:05:35,498 --> 00:05:36,598
You are...

97
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:39,138
going to the courthouse tomorrow, right?

98
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:41,138
Yes.

99
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,508
Tomorrow is the divorce confirmation date,

100
00:05:45,748 --> 00:05:47,548
so I was going to propose to Mi Sun...

101
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:50,248
after going to the courthouse.

102
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,748
It feels like she's stabbing me in the back.

103
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:55,448
I don't know what she's thinking.

104
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:57,988
It seems like...

105
00:05:59,428 --> 00:06:01,228
she wants to get back together with you.

106
00:06:01,688 --> 00:06:03,898
I'm not planning to do that at all.

107
00:06:04,928 --> 00:06:06,928
The past 3 months have felt like 30 years.

108
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:08,328
I understand.

109
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,468
It should never happen.

110
00:06:15,568 --> 00:06:16,908
By the way,

111
00:06:17,738 --> 00:06:19,648
So Yeon's sudden appearance...

112
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,048
put the dampers on your plan.

113
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,478
You were going to tell us about Mr. Han, right?

114
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,248
It's no big deal.

115
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:28,248
I can do that later.

116
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,818
By the way, if she gets in your way,

117
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:33,688
I swear I won't let it slide.

118
00:06:34,858 --> 00:06:37,258
I don't even care if I end up in jail again.

119
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:55,148
Come in.

120
00:06:58,148 --> 00:07:00,218
Is there anything you need?

121
00:07:01,148 --> 00:07:02,688
Everything is so comfortable and nice.

122
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:07,928
I'm just worried I might be making you uncomfortable.

123
00:07:08,388 --> 00:07:12,028
You speak just as beautifully as you look.

124
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:15,768
I was lonely living alone,

125
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,898
but now that I have you here, I feel like the house is full.

126
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,168
So don't worry about anything.

127
00:07:21,568 --> 00:07:22,638
Thank you for saying that.

128
00:07:23,238 --> 00:07:26,648
By the way, I have a favor to ask of you.

129
00:07:27,348 --> 00:07:28,708
What is it?

130
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:33,248
I have an important plan tomorrow evening,

131
00:07:33,248 --> 00:07:35,888
so I was wondering if you could move up your shift.

132
00:07:36,618 --> 00:07:37,788
Sure.

133
00:07:43,728 --> 00:07:44,798
Kwang Sook.

134
00:07:49,498 --> 00:07:50,598
Is she in the bathroom?

(LX Hotel Chairman Han Dong Seok)

136
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:02,678
LX Hotel Chairman Han Dong Seok?

137
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,218
Why is the chairman calling her this late at night?

138
00:08:14,128 --> 00:08:15,688
(LX Hotel Chairman Han Dong Seok)

139
00:08:18,058 --> 00:08:19,468
What are you doing in my room?

140
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:22,968
Oh, well...

141
00:08:24,798 --> 00:08:26,568
I'm here to give you this.

142
00:08:27,638 --> 00:08:28,808
What is this?

143
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,638
I bought this for you on the plane.

144
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,248
It's a facial cream.

145
00:08:33,548 --> 00:08:34,648
It's nothing big,

146
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:37,048
but please accept it as a token of my sincerity.

147
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:39,918
No.

148
00:08:40,248 --> 00:08:42,918
I have no reason to accept this from you.

149
00:08:43,488 --> 00:08:45,828
And why do you keep calling my name...

150
00:08:45,828 --> 00:08:47,158
as if you're my sister-in-law?

151
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:50,598
The last time we met, you were being so rude to me.

152
00:08:53,628 --> 00:08:55,868
I have no excuse for that.

153
00:08:56,998 --> 00:08:59,468
I made a lot of mistakes last time.

154
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:02,678
I understand that you're upset with me.

155
00:09:03,038 --> 00:09:04,708
Do you think it was a mistake?

156
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,148
Please forget about it for Chun Soo's sake.

157
00:09:09,378 --> 00:09:11,218
You got your alimony and left him.

158
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:14,288
What made you change your mind all of a sudden?

159
00:09:17,488 --> 00:09:19,258
I asked for a divorce in a fit of temper,

160
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:24,258
but I realized there was no one as good as Chun Soo.

161
00:09:26,168 --> 00:09:28,098
And Yeoung Ju's having a hard time.

162
00:09:32,908 --> 00:09:36,578
So please help me, Kwang Sook.

163
00:09:37,638 --> 00:09:39,008
You know...

164
00:09:39,148 --> 00:09:41,108
Chun Soo would do whatever you say.

165
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:47,988
Forget it.

166
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,318
I have...

167
00:09:49,858 --> 00:09:52,758
absolutely no intention of helping you.

168
00:09:53,158 --> 00:09:54,188
Get real.

169
00:09:55,258 --> 00:09:57,158
It's too late tonight,

170
00:09:57,328 --> 00:10:00,898
but I want you to leave as soon as the dawn breaks.

171
00:10:03,168 --> 00:10:04,698
And get out of my room.

172
00:10:13,008 --> 00:10:14,908
You got a call a moment ago.

173
00:10:22,858 --> 00:10:23,988

(LX Hotel Chairman Han Dong Seok)

175
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:43,838
Hello?

176
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:45,608
It's me.

177
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:48,678
I was worried because you didn't answer.

178
00:10:49,448 --> 00:10:52,648
Did you talk to your brothers-in-law?

179
00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:55,318
There was a commotion,

180
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,588
so I couldn't tell them about us.

181
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,328
Why?

182
00:11:00,628 --> 00:11:02,488
Did something happen at home?

Chun Soo's wife...

184
00:11:05,528 --> 00:11:07,498
suddenly showed up.

185
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,898
You mean the one whom he'll divorce?

186
00:11:11,268 --> 00:11:12,298
Yes.

187
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,668
Maybe she had a change of heart or something.

188
00:11:16,408 --> 00:11:19,008
The consideration period is over, so he'll go to the court tomorrow.

189
00:11:19,478 --> 00:11:21,448
But she's saying she won't get a divorce.

190
00:11:22,508 --> 00:11:25,548
She can't break her promise unilaterally like that.

191
00:11:27,718 --> 00:11:28,948
I know.

192
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:31,088
My goodness.

193
00:11:31,918 --> 00:11:34,888
You must have a lot on your mind now.

194
00:11:35,788 --> 00:11:36,928
I think...

195
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,798
I should tell them...

196
00:11:40,928 --> 00:11:43,568
about us a bit later.

197
00:11:44,238 --> 00:11:45,798
I was hoping...

198
00:11:46,738 --> 00:11:49,278
you'd feel relieved after telling them everything.

199
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:53,178
But I guess we'll have to take...

200
00:11:53,948 --> 00:11:55,278
some more time to think about it.

201
00:11:56,848 --> 00:11:59,288
All right. Good night.

202
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:05,618
My goodness.

203
00:12:06,488 --> 00:12:08,028
There's no rest for her family.

204
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:12,898
Kwang Sook must have a lot on her shoulders.

205
00:12:36,258 --> 00:12:38,588
Chun Soo had to sleep at the brewery because of you...

206
00:12:38,588 --> 00:12:40,088
and couldn't have breakfast.

207
00:12:40,588 --> 00:12:42,188
But you seem to have a good appetite.

208
00:12:44,928 --> 00:12:47,768
Make sure to leave after breakfast.

209
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:57,608
She's as stubborn as a mule.

210
00:13:00,508 --> 00:13:03,118
I have a 9am lecture, so I must leave.

211
00:13:03,318 --> 00:13:05,048
I have to leave for work too.

212
00:13:10,688 --> 00:13:12,688
I cooked and set the table.

213
00:13:12,758 --> 00:13:14,228
You can do the dishes.

214
00:13:37,348 --> 00:13:39,048
Put down that spoon and get up.

215
00:13:40,688 --> 00:13:41,688
What for?

216
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,088
Our court date is today.

217
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:45,488
Get changed and come with me.

218
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:53,468
I told you.

219
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:58,698
I came back because I wanted us to start over.

220
00:13:58,698 --> 00:13:59,738
You...

221
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:22,258
Who says we can start over?

222
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:25,858
I've decided to divorce you.

223
00:14:25,928 --> 00:14:27,568
I'll stand before the judge today,

224
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:29,098
confirm my decision,

225
00:14:29,098 --> 00:14:30,598
and finalize the legal procedure.

226
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:41,808
I don't have even the tiniest intent of divorcing you.

227
00:14:42,348 --> 00:14:44,248
Do you have to play dirty with me?

228
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:45,718
You said before...

229
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:48,218
that you didn't want a divorce.

230
00:14:49,118 --> 00:14:51,018
You clung and begged to avoid that.

231
00:14:51,018 --> 00:14:52,928
Why did you suddenly change?

232
00:14:52,928 --> 00:14:53,988
You made me feel...

233
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:57,258
a kind of humiliation I'd never experienced before.

234
00:14:58,058 --> 00:15:00,928
I felt ashamed and hopeless.

235
00:15:01,598 --> 00:15:04,668
I gave up on you both as a wife and as a person, okay?

236
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:07,068
So...

237
00:15:07,638 --> 00:15:09,508
I can't start over with you.

238
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:12,238
I'd rather chew off my own tongue.

239
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:14,848
I just can't do that.

240
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:23,588
Honey.

241
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:26,528
I'm really sorry.

242
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:30,258
I know I hurt you and made you sad.

243
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:34,228
I'll make up for it for the rest of my life.

244
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:37,498
For Yeoung Ju's sake,

245
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:40,338
please let it go this once.

246
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:45,038
If you abandon me,

247
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:50,118
I'll be left with no way to live.

248
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:02,188
Hello.

249
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,758
Se Ri. Hello.

250
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,268
Hi, Ha Ni.

251
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,238
You work part-time at the convenience store?

252
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:13,068
Yes.

253
00:16:13,768 --> 00:16:16,208
I can't help it because you're too stubborn,

254
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:17,338
but it's temporary.

255
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:18,938
You must go home.

256
00:16:19,748 --> 00:16:22,248
Okay. Give me a little time.

257
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,388
- Professor. - Yes?

258
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,448
Ms. Mun has plans this evening,

259
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:30,488
so I'm taking the afternoon shift.

260
00:16:31,358 --> 00:16:33,088
Can I watch Ha Ni today?

261
00:16:35,558 --> 00:16:37,758
Ha Ni, come to me.

262
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,868
Zoom.

263
00:16:46,868 --> 00:16:49,708
Get Se Ri as soon as breakfast is done.

264
00:16:51,138 --> 00:16:53,248
How can I when she doesn't want to come home?

265
00:16:53,908 --> 00:16:55,608
Tie her up and drag her home,

266
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:58,048
or break her legs and carry her home.

267
00:16:58,048 --> 00:16:59,278
Do what you can.

268
00:17:05,018 --> 00:17:06,688
Se Ri knows.

269
00:17:08,388 --> 00:17:09,388
Knows what?

270
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:12,558
That you and I...

271
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:15,498
stole money from Eagle Brewery.

272
00:17:16,028 --> 00:17:17,038
What?

273
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,968
She's massively disappointed in us.

274
00:17:22,438 --> 00:17:24,438
Would she want to come home?

275
00:17:26,448 --> 00:17:29,178
Who stole from whom?

276
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:30,918
I took what they owed...

277
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:33,088
for exploiting my youth and labor.

278
00:17:33,088 --> 00:17:34,818
That's what you think.

279
00:17:36,918 --> 00:17:38,858
What we did was a serious crime.

280
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,588
We'd have ended up in prison...

281
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:44,398
if old Mr. Oh had reported us.

282
00:17:45,428 --> 00:17:47,368
Must you ruin my morning?

283
00:17:49,368 --> 00:17:50,768
Where's my official seal?

284
00:17:51,268 --> 00:17:54,368
How would I know where your official seal is?

285
00:17:55,338 --> 00:17:56,808
Look for it yourself.

286
00:17:58,408 --> 00:18:00,148
Darn it.

287
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:24,468
What's this?

288
00:18:33,308 --> 00:18:34,478
Who's this?

289
00:18:35,248 --> 00:18:36,518
It's not Se Ri.

290
00:18:39,948 --> 00:18:41,588
(My dear Kang Soo)

291
00:18:43,018 --> 00:18:45,088
Why does she have this?

292
00:18:51,698 --> 00:18:53,228
Did you find your seal?

293
00:18:57,098 --> 00:18:58,998
Did you find your seal?

294
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:00,708
You look for it.

295
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:03,578
I have an early meeting and need to go.

296
00:19:04,438 --> 00:19:05,478
Okay.

297
00:19:17,275 --> 00:19:18,875
Did you just drop off a shipment?

298
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:20,068
Yes.

299
00:19:26,044 --> 00:19:27,044
Is it a gift?

300
00:19:27,474 --> 00:19:29,744
Keep it in the fridge and drink it cold.

301
00:19:30,144 --> 00:19:31,654
We poured it two days ago,

302
00:19:31,654 --> 00:19:33,484
so it's just right to drink.

303
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:35,954
I get all the makgeolli I can drink...

304
00:19:35,954 --> 00:19:38,294
thanks to my brewer girlfriend.

305
00:19:40,254 --> 00:19:41,324
Thank you.

306
00:19:41,524 --> 00:19:44,964
I feel bad this is all I can give you.

307
00:19:45,594 --> 00:19:48,904
You and the makgeolli are more than enough.

308
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:54,334
How is Vice-CEO Oh managing?

309
00:19:55,674 --> 00:19:57,874
Tell me if he needs a lawyer.

310
00:19:57,874 --> 00:19:59,174
I'll find him one.

311
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,884
You put yourself out there...

312
00:20:07,114 --> 00:20:10,284
and go through things others would say you don't have to.

313
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:13,454
It's upsetting and frustrating at times.

314
00:20:13,724 --> 00:20:15,864
But I like you and trust you more...

315
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:18,564
because that's the person you are.

316
00:20:19,694 --> 00:20:20,864
I'm sorry...

317
00:20:21,434 --> 00:20:23,234
for making you worry.

318
00:20:25,404 --> 00:20:29,104
So, due to some circumstances,

319
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:32,244
we must put off telling your brothers-in-law about us.

320
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:36,284
How about you tell your mother first?

321
00:20:38,184 --> 00:20:40,214
You know what she's like.

322
00:20:40,884 --> 00:20:43,024
If she finds out we're dating,

323
00:20:43,654 --> 00:20:45,124
she'll go way overboard.

324
00:20:46,324 --> 00:20:48,864
You're pretty good at going overboard yourself.

325
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:50,294
Who, me?

326
00:20:52,894 --> 00:20:56,464
Yes. I do go overboard sometimes.

327
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,274
Are you free this evening?

328
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:03,274
Let's eat out with your mother.

329
00:21:04,104 --> 00:21:08,044
I'm grateful to her for giving you to me.

330
00:21:08,384 --> 00:21:12,054
She should be the first to know we're together.

331
00:21:16,584 --> 00:21:17,584
Right.

332
00:21:19,954 --> 00:21:21,894
(3H Acupressure Bed)

333
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:24,294
Please deliver it next week.

334
00:21:24,294 --> 00:21:25,764
Sure. Don't worry.

335
00:21:25,764 --> 00:21:27,834
- Okay. Thank you. - Bye.

336
00:21:31,104 --> 00:21:33,174
- Here you go. - Thanks. Bye.

337
00:21:33,174 --> 00:21:34,774
Thank you very much.

338
00:21:37,674 --> 00:21:38,744
Mom.

339
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:40,174
Hey.

340
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:41,944
Why are you here out of the blue?

341
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:44,484
I dropped by on the way back...

342
00:21:44,484 --> 00:21:45,684
from a delivery.

343
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:47,484
I have something to tell you.

344
00:21:48,384 --> 00:21:50,454
What is it? Is it something serious?

345
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:54,824
Let's sit down somewhere so we can talk.

346
00:21:58,334 --> 00:21:59,694
Just don't be alarmed.

347
00:22:00,794 --> 00:22:04,364
Every time you act like this, my heart sinks.

348
00:22:05,274 --> 00:22:07,374
What did you get yourself into this time around?

349
00:22:08,804 --> 00:22:11,004
I guess you could say I've gotten myself into something.

350
00:22:13,474 --> 00:22:14,574
As in?

351
00:22:15,114 --> 00:22:16,644
Is something up at the brewery again?

352
00:22:17,714 --> 00:22:19,054
It's not like that.

353
00:22:19,754 --> 00:22:20,754
Well...

354
00:22:23,624 --> 00:22:24,624
I've...

355
00:22:28,154 --> 00:22:29,724
been seeing...

356
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:31,794
Chairman Han Dong Seok.

357
00:22:32,764 --> 00:22:34,164
My goodness!

358
00:22:34,294 --> 00:22:36,564
Thank you, my beloved deities!

359
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,404
Thank you so much.

360
00:22:39,374 --> 00:22:40,704
See?

361
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:43,004
What did I tell you?

362
00:22:43,074 --> 00:22:45,174
I said the chairman had feelings for you.

363
00:22:45,674 --> 00:22:46,674
I know.

364
00:22:47,374 --> 00:22:50,284
You're usually right about these things.

365
00:22:50,344 --> 00:22:51,954
Exactly!

366
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:54,054
I knew there was something going on.

367
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,754
Anyway, this is huge.

368
00:22:56,054 --> 00:22:57,984
They say every person holds a unique gift,

369
00:22:57,984 --> 00:22:59,224
but I had my doubts.

370
00:22:59,624 --> 00:23:01,154
Am I dreaming or what?

371
00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:04,624
My brothers-in-law don't know yet.

372
00:23:05,294 --> 00:23:06,994
I'll fill them in soon,

373
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,004
so keep it to yourself for now.

374
00:23:10,364 --> 00:23:13,574
I hear you. Don't worry about it.

375
00:23:14,004 --> 00:23:15,104
Also,

376
00:23:15,944 --> 00:23:17,274
the chairman...

377
00:23:17,674 --> 00:23:19,974
invited you to dinner today.

378
00:23:20,914 --> 00:23:22,114
Goodness me.

379
00:23:22,844 --> 00:23:24,744
Is he already treating me like his mother-in-law?

380
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:26,384
His mother-in-law?

381
00:23:26,954 --> 00:23:29,054
Don't get ahead of yourself...

382
00:23:30,624 --> 00:23:32,224
and watch what you say. Got it?

383
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:34,654
I'll be on my best behavior,

384
00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:35,794
so don't worry.

385
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:41,194
- Welcome. - Can we look around?

386
00:23:41,264 --> 00:23:42,264
Sure.

387
00:23:42,264 --> 00:23:44,564
- You should get going. Go on. - Right.

388
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:04,284
Hey!

389
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:06,754
How dare you?

390
00:24:08,354 --> 00:24:09,424
What is this?

391
00:24:10,364 --> 00:24:11,964
I clearly warned you not to hit on her...

392
00:24:11,964 --> 00:24:13,534
using the dog as an excuse.

393
00:24:13,764 --> 00:24:15,134
Are you going to keep this up?

394
00:24:17,404 --> 00:24:18,574
Unbelievable.

395
00:24:19,804 --> 00:24:21,104
Am I a joke to you?

396
00:24:24,644 --> 00:24:26,074
Gureum!

397
00:24:28,744 --> 00:24:30,014
I was out walking Gureum,

398
00:24:30,014 --> 00:24:31,854
and I thought you'd want to see him.

399
00:24:32,214 --> 00:24:33,614
I'm glad you did.

400
00:24:34,784 --> 00:24:36,154
Goodness.

401
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:38,594
There you are.

402
00:24:39,024 --> 00:24:41,794
Gureum, didn't you miss me?

403
00:24:43,724 --> 00:24:45,194
Please come in, Doctor Baek.

404
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:46,794
Sure.

405
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:57,504
Mr. Oh,

406
00:24:57,674 --> 00:25:00,314
stop leaving your store unattended and get back to work.

407
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:06,814
Why you...

408
00:25:07,954 --> 00:25:10,454
Did she just belittle me right to my face?

409
00:25:12,254 --> 00:25:13,394
Goodness.

410
00:25:14,024 --> 00:25:16,994
Gureum, who dressed you in this cute outfit?

411
00:25:17,694 --> 00:25:19,364
That womanizing jerk.

412
00:25:20,694 --> 00:25:22,604
He needs to be taught a lesson.

413
00:25:33,874 --> 00:25:35,914
Thank you for the drink.

414
00:25:37,644 --> 00:25:40,684
Se Ri got a part-time job at a convenience store.

415
00:25:41,854 --> 00:25:42,854
What?

416
00:25:43,024 --> 00:25:45,724
It's run by Chun Soo's close friend.

417
00:25:46,024 --> 00:25:47,954
I'll check in on her often,

418
00:25:47,954 --> 00:25:49,464
so don't worry too much.

419
00:25:49,964 --> 00:25:52,734
She's also staying with that friend of his.

420
00:25:55,164 --> 00:25:57,634
She can't even make a bowl of ramyeon,

421
00:25:57,634 --> 00:25:59,504
so how could she handle a job like that?

422
00:26:00,434 --> 00:26:01,874
It's not something she's done before,

423
00:26:01,874 --> 00:26:03,774
and she probably wanted to clear her head.

424
00:26:04,704 --> 00:26:06,174
I'll give her some space for now,

425
00:26:06,174 --> 00:26:08,474
but I'll get her to quit eventually, so don't worry too much.

426
00:26:12,884 --> 00:26:14,584
I abandoned Kang Soo,

427
00:26:15,754 --> 00:26:17,724
and now Se Ri's abandoning me.

428
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,094
I only have myself to blame and no one else.

429
00:26:30,664 --> 00:26:33,374
By the way, did Kang Soo tell you?

430
00:26:34,334 --> 00:26:35,374
Tell me what?

431
00:26:36,174 --> 00:26:37,344
My husband...

432
00:26:38,844 --> 00:26:40,944
told him something he shouldn't have.

433
00:26:42,044 --> 00:26:43,084
Don't tell me...

434
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:45,284
He told Kang Soo that he wasn't related...

435
00:26:45,284 --> 00:26:46,854
to the Oh family.

436
00:26:49,754 --> 00:26:50,984
When?

437
00:26:51,624 --> 00:26:53,524
Kang Soo must not have told you.

438
00:26:54,724 --> 00:26:55,964
He didn't say a thing.

439
00:26:56,424 --> 00:26:57,494
Does he also know...

440
00:26:58,264 --> 00:26:59,434
that you...

441
00:27:00,734 --> 00:27:02,234
Does he know that you're his birth mother?

442
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:03,634
No, not yet.

443
00:27:10,674 --> 00:27:12,674
He may seem unfazed on the outside,

444
00:27:16,944 --> 00:27:18,814
but he must be torn up inside.

445
00:27:22,854 --> 00:27:24,224
Professor Oh,

446
00:27:24,724 --> 00:27:27,024
can you make sure he's all right?

447
00:27:31,124 --> 00:27:33,464
My poor boy.

448
00:27:55,354 --> 00:27:56,524
What brings you here, Beom Soo?

449
00:27:56,984 --> 00:27:58,024
Hey.

450
00:27:58,084 --> 00:28:00,324
I was in the neighborhood and wanted to see you.

451
00:28:01,254 --> 00:28:02,724
Do you have time to talk?

452
00:28:03,324 --> 00:28:04,594
It's my lunch break.

453
00:28:04,764 --> 00:28:07,294
Our cafeteria serves the best food. Join me for a meal.

454
00:28:08,394 --> 00:28:10,564
I'll take a rain check on that.

455
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:12,174
For now, I'd just like to talk.

456
00:28:15,374 --> 00:28:16,404
Sure.

457
00:28:17,804 --> 00:28:19,314
Se Ri's mother...

458
00:28:20,214 --> 00:28:21,574
dropped by my office a little while ago.

459
00:28:24,014 --> 00:28:25,114
She told you about me.

460
00:28:25,884 --> 00:28:27,084
It must've deeply upset you.

461
00:28:30,324 --> 00:28:32,754
At first, it was a lot to stomach.

462
00:28:33,994 --> 00:28:35,394
But I'm not some teenage boy.

463
00:28:36,094 --> 00:28:37,524
I should be able to take it in stride.

464
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:42,164
I bet you resented us brothers.

465
00:28:44,104 --> 00:28:45,634
I'm sorry we kept it from you.

466
00:28:47,734 --> 00:28:49,304
If I had been in your shoes,

467
00:28:49,304 --> 00:28:50,744
I couldn't have said anything.

468
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,044
I would've kept it a secret too.

469
00:28:53,614 --> 00:28:56,214
You should've come to me as soon as he said it,

470
00:28:56,914 --> 00:28:58,414
rather than trying to deal with it yourself.

471
00:29:02,384 --> 00:29:04,324
At first, it didn't seem real.

472
00:29:06,154 --> 00:29:08,494
I wondered if I'd heard him wrong.

473
00:29:10,324 --> 00:29:12,094
It didn't feel real,

474
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,664
so I found it hard to accept.

475
00:29:16,304 --> 00:29:17,304
I see.

476
00:29:18,304 --> 00:29:19,304
Of course.

477
00:29:24,404 --> 00:29:25,544
Beom Soo,

478
00:29:25,714 --> 00:29:27,574
were you there when I was left...

479
00:29:28,144 --> 00:29:29,384
outside the brewery?

480
00:29:32,614 --> 00:29:33,614
Yes.

481
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:37,324
The others and I were heading home after playing outside.

482
00:29:37,624 --> 00:29:39,724
- Don't be silly. - You do.

483
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:40,954
- I do not. - What?

484
00:29:42,194 --> 00:29:44,094
(Eagle Brewery)

485
00:29:44,364 --> 00:29:46,634
You were wrapped in a baby blanket just outside the front gate.

486
00:29:48,294 --> 00:29:49,664
Do you know what was funny?

487
00:29:50,764 --> 00:29:53,734
You'd been wailing until just a moment ago,

488
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,844
but you stopped...

489
00:29:55,844 --> 00:29:57,844
the moment Jang Soo took you in his arms.

490
00:29:59,574 --> 00:30:01,574
After that, you went around,

491
00:30:01,574 --> 00:30:04,384
making eye contact with every brother and smiling.

492
00:30:05,614 --> 00:30:07,114
Though I was just a little boy,

493
00:30:08,184 --> 00:30:10,354
I believed the baby...

494
00:30:10,354 --> 00:30:12,654
was a blessing sent to us brothers.

495
00:30:14,494 --> 00:30:17,364
We took the little baby home...

496
00:30:17,364 --> 00:30:18,994
and told our parents.

497
00:30:20,064 --> 00:30:22,534
"Mom, Dad,"

498
00:30:22,664 --> 00:30:24,564
"we have a baby brother."

499
00:30:25,504 --> 00:30:27,204
What did Mom say to that?

500
00:30:27,474 --> 00:30:29,744
She was flustered by it at first.

501
00:30:30,474 --> 00:30:31,944
I remember this clearly.

502
00:30:33,344 --> 00:30:34,514
"Congratulations..."

503
00:30:35,414 --> 00:30:37,014
"on getting a sweet baby brother."

504
00:30:38,384 --> 00:30:39,414
That's what she said.

505
00:30:40,784 --> 00:30:42,284
Then Dad said,

506
00:30:42,284 --> 00:30:44,124
we were no longer Four Eagle Brothers,

507
00:30:44,124 --> 00:30:47,154
but Five Eagle Brothers.

508
00:30:47,594 --> 00:30:49,664
And with that, he named you on the spot.

509
00:30:52,124 --> 00:30:53,164
I see.

510
00:30:55,804 --> 00:30:56,834
Kang Soo.

511
00:30:58,204 --> 00:30:59,604
All your brothers, including me,

512
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:02,574
have never thought of you as someone else's child.

513
00:31:03,504 --> 00:31:05,644
Our parents didn't treat you that way either.

514
00:31:07,214 --> 00:31:10,214
I loved having you as my little brother,

515
00:31:10,914 --> 00:31:13,784
and the other brothers cared for you just as much, maybe even more.

516
00:31:18,724 --> 00:31:20,054
Do you remember...

517
00:31:20,694 --> 00:31:23,164
what the neighbors used to call you as a kid?

518
00:31:24,194 --> 00:31:25,294
A lucky charm?

519
00:31:25,964 --> 00:31:27,164
Yes, a lucky charm.

520
00:31:29,864 --> 00:31:31,604
You were our lucky charm.

521
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:33,874
The lucky charm of our family.

522
00:31:41,574 --> 00:31:42,684
Oh Kang Soo.

523
00:31:45,414 --> 00:31:47,484
You're an Oh, just like the rest of us.

524
00:31:51,224 --> 00:31:52,254
I know, Beom Soo.

525
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:55,094
I don't think I'm different from you or the other brothers.

526
00:31:56,294 --> 00:31:58,194
And that'll never change.

527
00:31:59,994 --> 00:32:00,994
So...

528
00:32:01,594 --> 00:32:03,834
don't say anything to Chun Soo or Heung Soo.

529
00:32:04,904 --> 00:32:06,604
It'll only make things awkward.

530
00:32:09,204 --> 00:32:11,044
Okay. I won't.

531
00:32:15,814 --> 00:32:16,814
Beom Soo.

532
00:32:18,884 --> 00:32:21,184
Am I not supposed to wonder...

533
00:32:21,184 --> 00:32:22,924
who my birth parents are?

534
00:32:25,994 --> 00:32:27,754
It's natural that you want to know.

535
00:32:28,194 --> 00:32:29,294
It is natural,

536
00:32:31,124 --> 00:32:33,434
but what difference would it make if you found out now?

537
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:40,904
You're right.

538
00:32:41,934 --> 00:32:43,174
Nothing will change.

539
00:32:51,014 --> 00:32:52,554
My goodness.

540
00:32:57,254 --> 00:32:59,194
Do you know what time it is now? Why are you late?

541
00:32:59,254 --> 00:33:00,894
We're supposed to be at court by 2pm.

542
00:33:01,994 --> 00:33:04,524
I told you. I'm not getting a divorce.

543
00:33:05,264 --> 00:33:07,094
I came to work things out with you.

544
00:33:07,764 --> 00:33:09,334
What on earth are you up to?

545
00:33:09,434 --> 00:33:10,564
It's not like that.

546
00:33:12,004 --> 00:33:13,874
I think I made a mistake.

547
00:33:14,634 --> 00:33:15,704
So I'm here...

548
00:33:16,474 --> 00:33:18,074
to apologize and sort things out.

549
00:33:18,074 --> 00:33:19,214
Are you kidding me?

550
00:33:19,614 --> 00:33:21,174
Do you think that makes sense?

551
00:33:21,274 --> 00:33:24,144
Married couples fight and make up all the time.

552
00:33:24,144 --> 00:33:26,054
And sometimes they fight again after making up.

553
00:33:26,214 --> 00:33:28,554
If all the couples got a divorce after a fight,

554
00:33:28,554 --> 00:33:31,484
there wouldn't be any couples left in the country.

555
00:33:31,484 --> 00:33:32,524
Hey!

556
00:33:35,024 --> 00:33:37,094
Why? What's going on?

557
00:33:37,094 --> 00:33:38,994
I can't believe what she's saying, Kwang Sook.

558
00:33:39,194 --> 00:33:41,434
Are you here to tease me or what? Is this a joke?

559
00:33:41,664 --> 00:33:43,004
Calm down, Chun Soo.

560
00:33:44,404 --> 00:33:45,974
Let's get out.

561
00:33:46,704 --> 00:33:48,074
I can't believe this.

562
00:33:54,414 --> 00:33:55,414
Darn it.

563
00:33:56,444 --> 00:33:58,014
Judging from how she's acting,

564
00:33:58,544 --> 00:34:00,384
she was quite determined when she came here.

565
00:34:01,654 --> 00:34:03,154
If you acted out on a whim,

566
00:34:03,154 --> 00:34:04,784
you might end up in a tough spot.

567
00:34:05,424 --> 00:34:07,194
She's not in her right mind now.

568
00:34:08,594 --> 00:34:11,324
I wish I could go head to head with her,

569
00:34:12,024 --> 00:34:14,634
but if I do, we'll be the ones to suffer.

570
00:34:16,834 --> 00:34:20,074
Maybe we should just coax her...

571
00:34:20,074 --> 00:34:23,044
into getting out of the house.

572
00:34:42,864 --> 00:34:44,324
What are you doing here? Go in.

573
00:34:46,734 --> 00:34:49,904
Are you sure you want me to stay here?

574
00:34:52,264 --> 00:34:53,534
If I hadn't given you the alimony,

575
00:34:53,534 --> 00:34:55,434
I would've gotten you a nice hotel room.

576
00:34:56,044 --> 00:34:57,204
But I don't have money.

577
00:34:59,214 --> 00:35:01,274
Can't I just stay at your place?

578
00:35:01,644 --> 00:35:03,014
Why would you stay at my place?

579
00:35:07,654 --> 00:35:09,124
Am I going in alone?

580
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:10,524
Of course.

581
00:35:12,024 --> 00:35:13,594
Come with me.

582
00:35:14,724 --> 00:35:16,394
You can't let a woman go in there alone.

583
00:35:18,594 --> 00:35:20,034
You said the gosiwon I was staying in stank.

584
00:35:21,594 --> 00:35:23,834
You didn't want to be in the same room with me.

585
00:35:26,004 --> 00:35:28,034
I just said that because I was upset.

586
00:35:32,774 --> 00:35:35,214
I'm scared to go in there alone.

587
00:35:41,984 --> 00:35:43,084
Don't be absurd.

588
00:35:43,824 --> 00:35:45,554
I know you're not the type of person to be scared of this.

589
00:35:51,264 --> 00:35:53,464
Do you have to be so cruel?

590
00:35:54,534 --> 00:35:55,864
Honey!

591
00:35:57,264 --> 00:35:58,264
Hey!

592
00:36:01,334 --> 00:36:02,874
(LX Hotel)

593
00:36:09,544 --> 00:36:11,344
- You're here. - Hello.

594
00:36:16,954 --> 00:36:19,554
Thank you for taking Gureum out for a walk.

595
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:21,554
Please let me buy you lunch.

596
00:36:24,024 --> 00:36:25,094
Thank you.

597
00:36:28,334 --> 00:36:30,504
I'll have two signature toasts, Mr. Oh.

598
00:36:33,004 --> 00:36:35,174
What are you doing now?

599
00:36:36,604 --> 00:36:38,344
I'm here to have lunch.

600
00:36:39,474 --> 00:36:40,474
Listen.

601
00:36:41,114 --> 00:36:44,244
Is there something going on between you and that sneaky vet?

602
00:36:44,544 --> 00:36:45,684
Be honest.

603
00:36:47,854 --> 00:36:48,854
Well...

604
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:52,794
Why do you even care about my love life?

605
00:36:52,824 --> 00:36:54,224
We're nothing more than friends.

606
00:36:54,224 --> 00:36:56,124
That's not true!

607
00:37:06,534 --> 00:37:08,274
If it's not true that we're nothing more than friends,

608
00:37:10,004 --> 00:37:11,044
what is it?

609
00:37:11,574 --> 00:37:12,644
Well...

610
00:37:14,144 --> 00:37:15,374
I see.

611
00:37:16,114 --> 00:37:18,084
We're an investor and a manager.

612
00:37:19,684 --> 00:37:21,584
Stop minding my business...

613
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:23,984
and just make sure to make my toasts delicious,

614
00:37:23,984 --> 00:37:25,454
Manager Oh.

615
00:37:29,794 --> 00:37:33,034
Why is she acting up like that?

616
00:37:34,894 --> 00:37:36,604
Is she the Ji Ok Bun I knew?

617
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:38,404
My goodness.

618
00:37:38,404 --> 00:37:39,574
Darn it.

619
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,544
I'm from LX Hotel.

620
00:37:43,704 --> 00:37:45,174
Hello.

621
00:37:45,704 --> 00:37:48,814
I finished packing everything and was waiting for you.

622
00:37:48,814 --> 00:37:50,114
Is your car outside the store?

623
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:51,144
- Yes. - All right.

624
00:37:53,914 --> 00:37:54,914
All right.

625
00:38:01,394 --> 00:38:04,124
As Chairman Han's mother-in-law,

626
00:38:04,124 --> 00:38:06,764
I should look elegant and intelligent.

627
00:38:14,934 --> 00:38:16,904
My goodness.

628
00:38:19,644 --> 00:38:20,874
Hello, Dr. Hwang.

629
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:23,844
Actually, I was going to call you.

630
00:38:24,614 --> 00:38:26,314
I have good news.

631
00:38:26,584 --> 00:38:29,484
I think I'll be going back to Golden Castle soon.

632
00:38:31,984 --> 00:38:33,394
Maybe I'll move back in...

633
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,154
as soon as my daughter gets remarried.

634
00:38:36,464 --> 00:38:37,464
My future son-in-law?

635
00:38:39,024 --> 00:38:41,434
It's someone you know.

636
00:38:42,634 --> 00:38:44,934
It's Chairman Han Dong Seok of LX Hotel.

637
00:38:45,834 --> 00:38:48,034
He'll soon be my son-in-law.

638
00:38:48,904 --> 00:38:50,344
Of course.

639
00:38:50,344 --> 00:38:52,444
He's really nice to me.

640
00:38:52,444 --> 00:38:54,044
He even said...

641
00:38:54,044 --> 00:38:57,214
he'd like to treat his future mother-in-law to dinner,

642
00:38:57,384 --> 00:38:58,884
so I'm going to his hotel tonight.

643
00:39:01,484 --> 00:39:02,584
- Yes. - My goodness.

644
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:04,624
I can't believe this.

645
00:39:10,033 --> 00:39:11,735
(Eagle Brewery)

646
00:39:11,759 --> 00:39:14,089
Ha Ni, do you want to take a picture with me?

647
00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:19,969
All right.

648
00:39:21,469 --> 00:39:23,339
Look at the camera.

649
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:26,439
One, two, three.

650
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:31,379
Let me see.

651
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:33,079
Ha Ni.

652
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,019
You and I have the same eyes.

653
00:39:38,749 --> 00:39:40,449
And the nose...

654
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:43,519
I think my nose stands out more.

655
00:39:44,089 --> 00:39:46,859
And our lips look the same, right?

656
00:39:58,569 --> 00:40:01,809
My gosh. The lipstick is too red.

657
00:40:15,459 --> 00:40:16,559
Hi, Chun Soo.

658
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:21,329
Where are we meeting today?

659
00:40:27,899 --> 00:40:30,099
Hello? Chun Soo?

660
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:33,269
Mi Sun.

661
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:35,579
Yes.

662
00:40:36,509 --> 00:40:38,079
I don't think we can meet today.

663
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:43,179
Oh, I see.

664
00:40:45,249 --> 00:40:47,549
Why? Did something happen?

665
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:49,389
Yes.

666
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:52,689
Something suddenly came up.

667
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:56,099
I should've called you sooner.

668
00:40:57,129 --> 00:40:58,169
Sorry.

669
00:40:58,429 --> 00:40:59,869
That's fine.

670
00:41:00,769 --> 00:41:02,639
I'm not at all ready to go out.

671
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:06,969
Chun Soo.

672
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:11,209
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

673
00:41:12,509 --> 00:41:13,849
I'll be in touch.

674
00:41:38,069 --> 00:41:39,939
You look amazing today.

675
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:41,779
Thanks.

676
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:44,709
Shouldn't you be on your way?

677
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:46,849
It's a dud.

678
00:41:48,149 --> 00:41:49,219
What?

679
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:51,619
My plans are off.

680
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,759
What a shame. You look so nice.

681
00:41:59,489 --> 00:42:00,559
Hello.

682
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,999
Hi, Beom Soo.

683
00:42:02,699 --> 00:42:04,999
Ha Ni, Dad's here.

684
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:07,569
Ha Ni. Did you have fun with Se Ri?

685
00:42:08,939 --> 00:42:09,939
Come here.

686
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:12,569
Beom Soo.

687
00:42:12,939 --> 00:42:13,939
Yes?

688
00:42:13,939 --> 00:42:15,639
Is something up with Chun Soo?

689
00:42:16,979 --> 00:42:18,909
He'd asked me...

690
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:21,749
to free my schedule this evening.

691
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,089
But he just called and said he couldn't make it.

692
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:28,359
Is something wrong?

693
00:42:31,629 --> 00:42:35,259
I think you should hear it from Chun Soo.

694
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:38,699
Okay.

695
00:42:39,469 --> 00:42:40,699
That's fine.

696
00:42:41,669 --> 00:42:43,269
I'll watch the store.

697
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,939
You three can go and have fun.

698
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:50,639
Se Ri.

699
00:42:51,979 --> 00:42:53,709
Your mother came to see me today.

700
00:42:56,149 --> 00:42:58,119
I won't go home, Professor.

701
00:42:58,449 --> 00:43:01,149
I don't want to send you back when you're not willing.

702
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:03,089
That's what I told your mother.

703
00:43:05,629 --> 00:43:07,729
Is she doing okay?

704
00:43:10,459 --> 00:43:11,969
She's not, is she?

705
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:13,869
You should call her.

706
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:17,399
It'd be even better if you spoke to her in person.

707
00:43:34,389 --> 00:43:35,389
What do you want?

708
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:37,359
Let's eat out tonight.

709
00:43:40,729 --> 00:43:43,299
It's not the time to eat out. Forget it.

710
00:43:43,759 --> 00:43:45,929
You haven't eaten much recently.

711
00:43:46,399 --> 00:43:49,039
I want to be a good husband for once.

712
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:52,409
I'll text you the address.

713
00:43:52,439 --> 00:43:54,909
Be there on time. I made a reservation.

714
00:43:55,579 --> 00:43:56,579
Why...

715
00:43:59,209 --> 00:44:01,719
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

716
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:18,329
Is something wrong?

717
00:44:20,229 --> 00:44:21,299
What?

718
00:44:21,739 --> 00:44:24,869
If you need someone to talk to,

719
00:44:24,969 --> 00:44:27,169
I can be a friend who listens.

720
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:30,779
Can you drink with me too?

721
00:44:31,779 --> 00:44:32,879
You bet.

722
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:40,449
Hello?

723
00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:45,989
What do you want?

724
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:56,339
He wants to eat out all of a sudden?

725
00:44:56,839 --> 00:44:57,899
How strange.

726
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:01,139
Your party is in here.

727
00:45:07,709 --> 00:45:08,749
Goodness.

728
00:45:09,619 --> 00:45:11,519
What are you doing here?

729
00:45:12,549 --> 00:45:15,119
Your husband invited me to dinner.

730
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,489
You're here too?

731
00:45:19,689 --> 00:45:22,199
Did my husband ask to meet you?

732
00:45:24,299 --> 00:45:25,599
You both got here before I did.

733
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:28,999
Hello, sir.

734
00:45:30,669 --> 00:45:32,069
What's going on?

735
00:45:32,809 --> 00:45:34,809
Wasn't this a dinner for the two of us?

736
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:39,609
I felt bad for running my mouth last time.

737
00:45:40,049 --> 00:45:41,879
So I invited Kang Soo too.

738
00:45:47,889 --> 00:45:49,919
Come on. Let's all sit down.

739
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:15,149
Goodness.

740
00:46:15,249 --> 00:46:18,389
The chairman was kind enough to send a car.

741
00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:20,549
He didn't have to.

742
00:46:20,649 --> 00:46:22,459
I'm sorry for the trouble.

743
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:25,159
Not at all. The chairman instructed me...

744
00:46:25,229 --> 00:46:26,659
to drive you both safely.

745
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:31,359
You should get used to this.

746
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:35,069
Thank you.

747
00:47:01,529 --> 00:47:03,759
I got the feel from the start.

748
00:47:04,429 --> 00:47:06,769
I noticed something was on,

749
00:47:06,999 --> 00:47:10,139
but when I asked her, she denied it so strongly.

750
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:14,109
Kwang Sook's the cautious type,

751
00:47:14,109 --> 00:47:16,409
and she gave me a hard time.

752
00:47:18,109 --> 00:47:19,949
Stop talking nonsense, Mom.

753
00:47:20,179 --> 00:47:22,019
You stop acting like nothing's going on.

754
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:23,079
Mom.

755
00:47:24,779 --> 00:47:26,689
She acts like she's calm and cool,

756
00:47:26,789 --> 00:47:28,419
but she can be coy.

757
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:29,689
Well...

758
00:47:30,419 --> 00:47:32,489
I can't say she's not like that.

759
00:47:33,029 --> 00:47:34,759
What are you both doing?

760
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:38,799
I couldn't believe...

761
00:47:39,229 --> 00:47:41,629
she got widowed ten days after the wedding.

762
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:43,899
Then she took over the brewery...

763
00:47:43,969 --> 00:47:45,809
and took in her brothers-in-law.

764
00:47:46,409 --> 00:47:48,879
My heart crumbled, you know.

765
00:47:50,479 --> 00:47:53,009
But then she met someone like you.

766
00:47:54,209 --> 00:47:57,049
I still wonder if this is a dream.

767
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:00,919
I'm grateful you think highly of me.

768
00:48:01,389 --> 00:48:04,459
How could I dislike someone like you?

769
00:48:05,189 --> 00:48:08,159
Thank you for raising such a great daughter.

770
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:13,699
I don't want anything.

771
00:48:14,729 --> 00:48:16,799
Just promise me one thing.

772
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:22,239
I can't accept...

773
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:25,679
my daughter becoming a widow twice.

774
00:48:27,849 --> 00:48:29,079
Be sure...

775
00:48:29,779 --> 00:48:32,019
to live one day more than she does, okay?

776
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:36,089
That means...

777
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:40,129
I'd have to be a widower twice.

778
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:42,799
Oh, does it?

779
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:47,869
Stop going overboard, Mom.

780
00:48:47,869 --> 00:48:49,569
You make it sound like...

781
00:48:49,569 --> 00:48:51,499
we're about to get married.

782
00:48:51,939 --> 00:48:53,909
At your age, you marry who you date.

783
00:48:54,509 --> 00:48:57,839
Are you the type to date someone you wouldn't marry in the end?

784
00:48:58,809 --> 00:49:01,009
No, not at all.

785
00:49:01,549 --> 00:49:04,419
I would like to marry Kwang Sook, Mother.

786
00:49:05,219 --> 00:49:06,289
"Mother?"

787
00:49:07,889 --> 00:49:10,019
I haven't heard that in so long.

788
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:12,029
Thank you, Son-in-law.

789
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:15,159
You can't call him that.

790
00:49:15,299 --> 00:49:16,329
Mom.

791
00:49:16,329 --> 00:49:18,969
That's way too far-fetched.

792
00:49:20,569 --> 00:49:24,039
Do you think I shouldn't call you that?

793
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:25,939
Well...

794
00:49:26,909 --> 00:49:29,609
I don't think it's that far-fetched.

795
00:49:30,379 --> 00:49:31,839
See? It's fine.

796
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,339
Actually,

797
00:49:56,269 --> 00:49:58,969
I never imagined you didn't know...

798
00:49:59,209 --> 00:50:00,469
that you were adopted.

799
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:03,139
I'd assumed that by your age,

800
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:05,749
someone in your family...

801
00:50:06,209 --> 00:50:09,479
would've told you the truth.

802
00:50:12,849 --> 00:50:14,589
I was flustered at first,

803
00:50:15,249 --> 00:50:16,319
but I'm okay now.

804
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:19,129
I learned something I should know.

805
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:23,759
Yes. Now that you're old enough to consider marriage,

806
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:26,899
you should know about your roots.

807
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:33,909
I think we're done eating. Shall we go home?

808
00:50:34,109 --> 00:50:36,639
I'm not even halfway done. Why are you so impatient?

809
00:50:38,649 --> 00:50:40,609
Relax and eat all you want.

810
00:50:50,019 --> 00:50:51,019
Have you...

811
00:50:52,429 --> 00:50:54,859
heard anything...

812
00:50:55,659 --> 00:50:57,099
about your birth parents?

813
00:50:57,199 --> 00:50:58,259
Honey.

814
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:01,069
I wasn't talking to you.

815
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:05,169
I'm sure my birth parents are out there somewhere,

816
00:51:06,239 --> 00:51:08,809
but I'm not curious about them, and I don't plan to seek them out.

817
00:51:09,979 --> 00:51:11,879
I've had a good life so far...

818
00:51:11,879 --> 00:51:14,249
with loving parents and caring brothers.

819
00:51:16,879 --> 00:51:19,519
Do you know anything about it?

820
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:24,289
What could I possibly know?

821
00:51:25,589 --> 00:51:28,699
Kang Soo was brought to the brewery...

822
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,629
long before I started working there.

823
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:34,699
Right, of course.

824
00:51:35,869 --> 00:51:37,569
It was so long ago,

825
00:51:37,869 --> 00:51:40,009
and I can hardly remember the details.

826
00:51:43,979 --> 00:51:47,009
If that's all, I'd like to excuse myself.

827
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:49,079
Why? Are you leaving already?

828
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:51,319
Thank you for the meal.

829
00:51:53,149 --> 00:51:54,519
I'll see you around.

830
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:02,729
I'll walk him to the front door.

831
00:52:23,979 --> 00:52:25,379
I bet that was awkward for you.

832
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:28,049
It actually was.

833
00:52:29,389 --> 00:52:32,329
He probably invited you to dinner to apologize,

834
00:52:33,259 --> 00:52:34,789
but he's not easy to be around.

835
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:37,129
Thanks for putting up with it.

836
00:52:38,259 --> 00:52:40,099
I'll get going, then.

837
00:52:41,529 --> 00:52:42,639
Wait.

838
00:52:43,299 --> 00:52:44,499
Could you...

839
00:52:48,979 --> 00:52:50,039
look out for Se Ri...

840
00:52:51,139 --> 00:52:53,349
like a big brother would?

841
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,179
Please.

842
00:52:57,179 --> 00:52:59,289
Sure. I'll do that.

843
00:53:16,439 --> 00:53:17,599
I'm home.

844
00:53:19,669 --> 00:53:21,439
Goodness. Welcome home, Professor Oh.

845
00:53:21,669 --> 00:53:23,639
Join me for some makgeolli.

846
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:24,909
Where is everyone?

847
00:53:25,339 --> 00:53:27,209
Kwang Sook and Ms. Gong...

848
00:53:27,209 --> 00:53:28,679
went to attend a family wedding.

849
00:53:28,849 --> 00:53:30,419
Chun Soo's probably having a drink somewhere...

850
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:32,019
to drown his frustration.

851
00:53:32,789 --> 00:53:34,589
- And Kang Soo... - I'm home.

852
00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:35,659
Hey.

853
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:38,019
- There he is. - You're home.

854
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:39,229
Kang Soo.

855
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:42,229
I hit the jackpot today.

856
00:53:42,529 --> 00:53:43,529
The jackpot?

857
00:53:45,729 --> 00:53:48,999
I managed a large order of 200 sandwiches for LX Hotel.

858
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:51,369
Soon, I might be rolling in money.

859
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,069
LX Hotel?

860
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:55,039
That's right. As snacks for the employees,

861
00:53:55,039 --> 00:53:56,479
I'll be delivering 200 sandwiches...

862
00:53:56,479 --> 00:53:58,439
twice a week.

863
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:00,709
That's great news.

864
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:07,219
I must say that the Oh brothers...

865
00:54:07,219 --> 00:54:09,489
are as clueless as ever.

866
00:54:13,229 --> 00:54:14,259
What the...

867
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,059
What are you doing here?

868
00:54:17,229 --> 00:54:19,199
Didn't Chun Soo get you a motel room?

869
00:54:19,769 --> 00:54:21,699
I forgot something and had to come back for it.

870
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:26,539
Are you making deliveries to that hotel,

871
00:54:26,709 --> 00:54:28,909
knowing why they placed a bulk order?

872
00:54:31,539 --> 00:54:33,109
What are you talking about?

873
00:54:37,919 --> 00:54:39,489
I'll get going, then.

874
00:54:39,689 --> 00:54:40,989
- Please drive home safely. - Sure.

875
00:54:43,019 --> 00:54:45,459
(Eagle Brewery)

876
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:49,559
I still can't tell...

877
00:54:50,059 --> 00:54:52,629
if I'm dreaming or not.

878
00:54:53,029 --> 00:54:55,099
I can't believe you're Chairman Han's girlfriend.

879
00:54:56,699 --> 00:54:57,969
Mom, please!

880
00:54:58,569 --> 00:55:00,139
Of course. I'll zip it.

881
00:55:00,369 --> 00:55:01,909
You promised.

882
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:05,179
Mom, head home first.

883
00:55:05,179 --> 00:55:06,809
I need to stop by the brewery.

884
00:55:06,949 --> 00:55:08,849
I have business there too, so let's go together.

885
00:55:08,849 --> 00:55:09,949
Sure.

886
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:19,259
Come in.

887
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,359
Gosh, Mrs. Gong.

888
00:55:26,269 --> 00:55:28,829
It looks like you didn't go on a date today,

889
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:30,239
seeing as you're eating ramyeon alone.

890
00:55:31,069 --> 00:55:33,439
I only had a small steak,

891
00:55:33,439 --> 00:55:35,039
so I got hungry.

892
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:36,579
That's why I'm eating ramyeon.

893
00:55:36,839 --> 00:55:38,479
You went out with her again?

894
00:55:39,309 --> 00:55:40,749
We're going out tomorrow too.

895
00:55:42,449 --> 00:55:44,619
Hold on. Are you seeing her every day?

896
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:46,219
Not every day.

897
00:55:47,149 --> 00:55:48,349
Just...

898
00:55:51,189 --> 00:55:52,829
three times a week.

899
00:55:53,259 --> 00:55:54,829
Three times?

900
00:55:56,399 --> 00:55:59,229
Are you saying Chairman Han...

901
00:56:01,229 --> 00:56:04,669
placed the bulk order because of Kwang Sook?

902
00:56:05,269 --> 00:56:06,309
Yes.

903
00:56:06,669 --> 00:56:10,639
I'm sure he's being kind because Kwang Sook's a supplier...

904
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:13,909
You really can't take a hint, can you?

905
00:56:16,249 --> 00:56:17,749
Did you have no idea?

906
00:56:18,549 --> 00:56:19,989
They're dating.

907
00:56:21,349 --> 00:56:23,059
I hear they'll soon get married.

908
00:56:23,919 --> 00:56:25,619
- She'll remarry? - Yes.

909
00:56:26,459 --> 00:56:29,159
That's what I gathered from her mother's phone call.

910
00:56:29,399 --> 00:56:31,199
They'll be setting a date soon.

911
00:56:45,409 --> 00:56:46,479
Thank you.

912
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:52,919
Did you drop them off safely at the brewery?

913
00:56:53,489 --> 00:56:54,489
Yes, sir.

918
00:57:17,909 --> 00:57:20,509
Oh, no. How clumsy of her.

Let's stop by Kwang Sook's place.

920
00:57:26,819 --> 00:57:27,889
Yes, sir.

921
00:57:39,569 --> 00:57:42,939
Do you know where your sister-in-law and her mother went?

922
00:57:45,939 --> 00:57:47,009
Where?

00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:52,039
invited Kwang Sook's mother to the hotel to treat her...

925
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:53,579
like a son-in-law would.

926
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:55,049
They went to dinner.

927
00:57:55,379 --> 00:57:57,319
Maybe you're making this all up.

928
00:57:57,819 --> 00:58:00,549
Why would I lie about something that could easily be proven wrong?

929
00:58:00,749 --> 00:58:04,659
I overheard her mother talking on the phone with her friend.

930
00:58:08,429 --> 00:58:09,729
I'm home.

931
00:58:09,729 --> 00:58:10,799
I see you're all here.

932
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,299
Welcome home.

933
00:58:18,669 --> 00:58:21,939
Where are you two coming back from?

934
00:58:22,909 --> 00:58:23,909
What?

935
00:58:25,439 --> 00:58:28,709
Oh, I see. We were at a family wedding.

936
00:58:28,709 --> 00:58:30,049
It wasn't a wedding,

937
00:58:30,149 --> 00:58:32,449
but you had dinner with Chairman Han.

938
00:58:35,819 --> 00:58:36,819
Heung Soo.

939
00:58:37,789 --> 00:58:39,289
Tell me if I'm wrong.

940
00:58:45,499 --> 00:58:47,029
I'm disappointed in you, Kwang Sook.

941
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,599
It hasn't been that long since Jang Soo passed away,

942
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:52,469
yet you're already dating another man.

943
00:58:52,909 --> 00:58:54,669
- Stop it, Heung Soo. - Why should I?

944
00:58:55,209 --> 00:58:56,909
Jang Soo would be turning...

945
00:58:57,539 --> 00:58:59,009
in his grave.

946
00:58:59,009 --> 00:59:00,549
He'd be devastated.

947
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:04,749
What kind of nonsense is this?

948
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:06,049
Are you saying...

949
00:59:06,049 --> 00:59:08,719
she should remain a widow forever, even though she lost her husband...

950
00:59:09,189 --> 00:59:11,419
just ten days after getting married?

951
00:59:11,489 --> 00:59:13,289
No one said that.

952
00:59:13,859 --> 00:59:15,229
Even so,

953
00:59:15,759 --> 00:59:17,629
Jang Soo only died recently.

954
00:59:17,629 --> 00:59:19,469
How can you already be thinking about remarrying?

955
00:59:19,469 --> 00:59:20,829
Shut that mouth!

956
00:59:33,479 --> 00:59:35,279
Kwang Sook did nothing wrong.

957
00:59:35,849 --> 00:59:37,279
You knew about this?

958
00:59:37,279 --> 00:59:38,919
She's done more than enough for us!

959
00:59:39,419 --> 00:59:40,919
Don't talk about things you don't understand.

960
00:59:40,919 --> 00:59:42,759
Stop pretending you understand.

961
00:59:43,789 --> 00:59:45,989
You're just as upset and disappointed as I am.

962
00:59:46,089 --> 00:59:48,459
- That's enough, Heung Soo. - I'm not done!

963
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:52,729
The chairman came to our house and approached us brothers...

964
00:59:52,729 --> 00:59:55,199
just to score points with Kwang Sook!

965
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:58,839
It was nothing like that.

966
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:00,039
As if!

967
01:00:01,109 --> 01:00:02,639
It was all intentional.

968
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:04,479
Shut that mouth, you brat!

969
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,409
- Chun Soo. - Are you going to hit me?

970
01:00:06,449 --> 01:00:08,349
Hit me, then!

971
01:00:09,479 --> 01:00:11,749
Please don't do this.

972
01:00:18,659 --> 01:00:19,659
I...

973
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:27,529
I really thought of you as a big sister.

974
01:00:31,499 --> 01:00:32,669
How could you...

975
01:00:34,439 --> 01:00:36,239
deceive us like this?

976
01:00:49,259 --> 01:00:51,489
I am... I'm sorry.

977
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:22,859
Kwang Sook.

978
01:01:24,019 --> 01:01:25,659
What is it? Is something wrong?

979
01:01:35,699 --> 01:01:37,199
My brothers-in-law.

980
01:01:39,769 --> 01:01:40,809
They all...

981
01:01:42,439 --> 01:01:44,509
found out.

982
01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:55,789
Come here.

983
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:10,899
All Kwang Sook's ever done wrong is marry into this family...

984
01:02:11,739 --> 01:02:14,609
and work herself to the bone making makgeolli.

985
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:17,539
She doesn't deserve this kind of treatment.

986
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:19,609
If you think so,

987
01:02:20,249 --> 01:02:21,949
why did you deceive us?

988
01:02:21,949 --> 01:02:22,979
We deceived you?

989
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:24,749
How dare you say that?

990
01:02:24,749 --> 01:02:26,149
Will you stop it, Heung Soo?

991
01:03:46,629 --> 01:03:49,169
(For Eagle Brothers)

992
01:03:49,439 --> 01:03:51,239
Why ask me for forgiveness?

993
01:03:51,339 --> 01:03:54,709
If you sincerely apologize to Professor Oh and his family...

994
01:03:54,739 --> 01:03:57,509
and bury the hatchet with them, I'll come home then.

995
01:03:57,809 --> 01:04:00,379
Do you broker sales of business properties too?

996
01:04:00,749 --> 01:04:02,449
You know Eagle Brewery, right?

997
01:04:02,749 --> 01:04:04,679
I don't like that Kwang Sook's seeing someone...

998
01:04:04,879 --> 01:04:07,489
when Jang Soo hasn't been gone that long.

999
01:04:07,689 --> 01:04:09,249
And I don't like...

1000
01:04:09,249 --> 01:04:11,889
how you used your wealth to approach us brothers.

1001
01:04:11,959 --> 01:04:14,759
How can you say that after seeing the situation?

1002
01:04:15,029 --> 01:04:16,329
The brewery.

1003
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:18,229
It's time to walk away.
