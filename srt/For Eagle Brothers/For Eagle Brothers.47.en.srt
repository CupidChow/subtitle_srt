00:00:01,516 --> 00:00:02,816
(Episode 47)

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:04,456
Hiding overseas for so long...

3
00:00:06,726 --> 00:00:08,296
must've taken a toll...

4
00:00:08,296 --> 00:00:09,726
on Director Seo Gil Yong's mental state...

5
00:00:10,356 --> 00:00:11,696
because he ended up confessing to everything.

6
00:00:12,696 --> 00:00:14,436
You won't gain anything...

7
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:17,036
by holding out like this.

8
00:00:19,306 --> 00:00:21,876
You're the detectives here,

9
00:00:21,876 --> 00:00:23,376
so I'll leave the case to you.

10
00:00:24,176 --> 00:00:26,376
As for me, I'm not saying a word...

11
00:00:26,376 --> 00:00:28,276
until my lawyer arrives.

12
00:00:35,086 --> 00:00:37,116
We cross-examined the suspect...

13
00:00:37,116 --> 00:00:38,956
who filmed the fabricated video,

14
00:00:39,386 --> 00:00:41,156
and her statement aligns...

15
00:00:43,556 --> 00:00:44,996
with Director Seo's.

16
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:47,326
I'm sure you know what that means.

17
00:00:50,036 --> 00:00:52,206
How would an ordinary citizen like me...

18
00:00:52,206 --> 00:00:53,736
understand what that means?

19
00:00:55,106 --> 00:00:56,276
More importantly,

20
00:00:56,836 --> 00:00:59,146
how was Seo Gil Yong apprehended?

21
00:01:04,246 --> 00:01:06,046
He caused a scene and damaged property...

22
00:01:06,046 --> 00:01:07,646
while completely drunk at a local bar.

23
00:01:07,856 --> 00:01:09,256
He was arrested by local police...

24
00:01:09,256 --> 00:01:11,456
after making threats.

25
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:22,236
What?

26
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,806
When did the detectives burst in?

27
00:01:30,636 --> 00:01:31,806
All right.

28
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:35,446
If you hear anything from the police,

29
00:01:35,976 --> 00:01:37,376
please let me know immediately.

30
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,346
Thank you, Mr. Jung.

31
00:01:45,656 --> 00:01:46,826
Mom, what's wrong?

32
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:48,556
Well...

33
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:51,026
What's going on?

34
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:55,266
Detectives...

35
00:01:56,196 --> 00:01:58,106
escorted your dad out of his office.

36
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,636
What? Why?

37
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:05,276
To look into the fake video made to bring down Eagle Brewery.

38
00:02:13,286 --> 00:02:15,656
I thought Dad didn't order that.

39
00:02:16,056 --> 00:02:17,956
- Some director... - That director...

40
00:02:19,486 --> 00:02:21,456
doesn't have the guts to do such a thing...

41
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:22,756
without your dad's order.

42
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:26,996
You're saying Dad put him up to it?

43
00:02:55,426 --> 00:02:57,026
- Did you have a good time? - Yes.

44
00:02:57,966 --> 00:02:59,026
Hello.

45
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:01,536
Welcome.

46
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:05,066
I came in for a while so I could see you two.

47
00:03:05,236 --> 00:03:06,306
Is that okay?

48
00:03:06,306 --> 00:03:08,036
You bet it is. You're always welcome.

49
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:10,276
I'm happy to see you.

50
00:03:13,576 --> 00:03:15,976
Grandma. I booked you a physical checkup.

51
00:03:15,976 --> 00:03:17,376
I'll take you to the hospital tomorrow.

52
00:03:17,846 --> 00:03:19,016
A physical checkup?

53
00:03:19,546 --> 00:03:21,416
You got one whenever you visited.

54
00:03:21,986 --> 00:03:24,416
Didn't she skip it last year...

55
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:26,226
because she was too busy?

56
00:03:26,256 --> 00:03:28,726
Yes. You skipped it last year,

57
00:03:28,796 --> 00:03:30,296
so you must get checked this year.

58
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:32,626
It's an annual thing,

59
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:35,036
so get your health checked for peace of mind.

60
00:03:35,636 --> 00:03:37,436
Okay, I'll do that.

61
00:03:37,736 --> 00:03:39,206
Thanks for looking out for me.

62
00:03:45,006 --> 00:03:48,316
Can I have a word with you?

63
00:03:49,016 --> 00:03:50,016
Pardon?

64
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:03,526
Is there something you wanted to say?

65
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,166
Here.

66
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:20,076
Was this photo...

67
00:04:20,406 --> 00:04:22,346
taken when you were young?

68
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:24,716
In my last year at university.

69
00:04:25,246 --> 00:04:26,746
I think it was during the summer.

70
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:28,786
You were beautiful.

71
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,786
Who is the man next to you?

72
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:40,126
Find him...

73
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:42,336
for me.

74
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:44,806
What?

75
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:47,536
His name is Park Jong Woo.

76
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:50,876
A law major at Hankuk University. He was admitted in 1970.

77
00:04:52,176 --> 00:04:53,546
If he's still alive,

78
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:57,276
I'd like to meet him just once before my memory fades.

79
00:04:58,546 --> 00:05:01,356
You promised to be a daughter to me.

80
00:05:02,656 --> 00:05:03,716
I did.

81
00:05:04,316 --> 00:05:07,026
I'll do whatever I can to find him.

82
00:05:07,356 --> 00:05:08,556
Leave it to me.

83
00:05:10,626 --> 00:05:11,726
Thank you.

84
00:05:14,426 --> 00:05:17,096
Is this man...

85
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:20,806
your first love?

86
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:27,846
Yes.

87
00:05:29,416 --> 00:05:31,916
Don't tell Dong Seok or his kids.

88
00:05:32,486 --> 00:05:35,656
They might laugh at me and think I'm going senile.

89
00:05:37,486 --> 00:05:38,526
Okay.

90
00:05:39,526 --> 00:05:42,656
I didn't know you had a side like this.

91
00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:45,296
You seem to be strict,

92
00:05:45,526 --> 00:05:47,566
but you're looking for your 1st love from 50 years ago.

93
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,166
What?

94
00:05:49,996 --> 00:05:51,606
It's so romantic.

95
00:05:52,406 --> 00:05:54,106
Don't make a fuss.

96
00:05:54,466 --> 00:05:56,676
Look into it quietly, okay?

97
00:05:57,936 --> 00:05:59,006
Okay.

98
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:01,476
I will...

99
00:06:01,976 --> 00:06:04,016
keep this photo for a while, then.

100
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:06,016
Sure.

101
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:15,996
What did you two talk about?

102
00:06:17,556 --> 00:06:18,566
It's a secret.

103
00:06:18,866 --> 00:06:19,926
- A secret? - A secret?

104
00:06:24,396 --> 00:06:27,136
I promised your grandmother to keep it a secret,

105
00:06:27,336 --> 00:06:28,606
so I can't tell.

106
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:31,806
My lips are triple-sealed.

107
00:06:33,546 --> 00:06:35,216
I don't think...

108
00:06:35,346 --> 00:06:38,086
we should let Grandma return to the US.

109
00:06:38,946 --> 00:06:41,956
She can't manage on her own in that condition.

110
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:45,126
It will be harder on her if she were to think...

111
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:46,386
she were burdening us.

112
00:06:46,826 --> 00:06:47,886
First,

113
00:06:48,526 --> 00:06:50,696
let's see what her physical checkup shows.

114
00:06:50,696 --> 00:06:52,166
Let's talk about it again then.

115
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:56,096
I feel so bad for her.

116
00:07:00,936 --> 00:07:03,606
Your grandmother will be okay.

117
00:07:04,846 --> 00:07:06,106
Don't worry too much.

118
00:07:21,826 --> 00:07:25,266
You really won't tell me anything?

119
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:30,666
Your secret with her.

120
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:33,166
Come on. I'm dead curious.

121
00:07:34,906 --> 00:07:36,276
I told you.

122
00:07:36,476 --> 00:07:38,476
My lips are triple-sealed.

123
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:44,646
There's a season...

124
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:47,546
Ms. Park wants to go back to.

125
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:49,816
That's all I can tell you.

126
00:07:51,956 --> 00:07:53,856
A season she wants to go back to?

127
00:08:03,736 --> 00:08:04,796
Kwang Sook.

128
00:08:06,306 --> 00:08:08,736
Seo Gil Yong who had fled to the Philippines.

129
00:08:09,106 --> 00:08:10,736
He was brought in today.

130
00:08:11,746 --> 00:08:12,876
He was arrested?

131
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:15,516
Yes. The detective called himself.

132
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:16,616
It was on TV too.

133
00:08:18,316 --> 00:08:19,446
And...

134
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,686
Chairman Dokgo Tak.

135
00:08:22,856 --> 00:08:24,316
He'll be investigated again.

136
00:08:25,226 --> 00:08:26,326
He should be.

137
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:29,026
A director wouldn't have done that kind of thing...

138
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:30,726
without the chairman's order.

139
00:08:31,396 --> 00:08:33,226
He won't get away with it this time.

140
00:08:33,396 --> 00:08:34,666
He must pay for what he did.

141
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,306
But...

142
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:42,906
when I think about Beom Soo and Se Ri...

143
00:08:44,276 --> 00:08:45,706
And Kang Soo too.

144
00:08:48,616 --> 00:08:50,276
This is good news,

145
00:08:51,216 --> 00:08:53,686
but I can't just be happy about this.

146
00:08:54,616 --> 00:08:57,386
I feel the same too, but right now,

147
00:08:58,356 --> 00:09:00,886
you must focus on what Dokgo Tak did.

148
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:03,596
You must steel yourself.

149
00:09:03,826 --> 00:09:05,796
He hurt us so much over time.

150
00:09:08,596 --> 00:09:10,636
We must make sure he pays...

151
00:09:10,736 --> 00:09:13,736
and compensates us for all the damage and loss.

152
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:19,946
Director Seo said...

153
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:24,846
he came up with the details of the plan,

154
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:26,886
but that he reported the plan to you.

155
00:09:27,846 --> 00:09:30,416
He said you approved it, and then he put it in motion.

156
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:31,586
That was his statement.

157
00:09:31,956 --> 00:09:34,386
It even includes details of the compensation...

158
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:36,356
offered to the victims.

159
00:09:46,036 --> 00:09:47,306
My client...

160
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:50,176
never gave such instructions.

161
00:09:50,806 --> 00:09:52,076
That's his stance.

162
00:09:56,316 --> 00:09:59,486
If you deny the facts in Director Seo's statement,

163
00:09:59,486 --> 00:10:00,786
we have no choice...

164
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:03,216
but to cross-examine you with each other.

165
00:10:11,896 --> 00:10:12,926
Listen.

166
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:16,436
I have all I want.

167
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:19,706
Why would I take such a big risk to ruin...

168
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:21,436
an insignificant brewery?

169
00:10:23,176 --> 00:10:24,706
I don't have...

170
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:27,046
that much time to kill.

171
00:10:40,256 --> 00:10:42,556
Mom, do you not feel well?

172
00:10:43,396 --> 00:10:45,796
I'm fine. It's just a headache.

173
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,236
What will happen to Dad?

174
00:10:57,076 --> 00:10:59,246
Director Seo isn't the loyal type.

175
00:11:01,046 --> 00:11:02,716
He can't get away with it this time.

176
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:06,646
We must face the past and start over.

177
00:11:07,546 --> 00:11:08,686
If not,

178
00:11:09,616 --> 00:11:11,926
it could hurt the company and the employees.

179
00:11:14,056 --> 00:11:15,126
Then...

180
00:11:16,296 --> 00:11:17,996
will Dad go to prison?

181
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:22,966
We must talk to his lawyer,

182
00:11:24,366 --> 00:11:26,436
but if he admits to what he did,

183
00:11:27,336 --> 00:11:30,376
he might get a lighter sentence.

184
00:11:31,636 --> 00:11:33,406
If he insists he knew nothing,

185
00:11:35,376 --> 00:11:38,116
he could end up with even heavier charges.

186
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:56,736
Hi, Se Ri.

187
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:01,206
You sound upset. Is something wrong?

188
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,836
My dad...

189
00:12:03,776 --> 00:12:06,006
is being questioned at a police station.

190
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:07,546
He's what?

191
00:12:08,346 --> 00:12:11,476
The director who made the fake video about your brewery...

192
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:13,786
had fled overseas,

193
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:15,516
but he just got arrested.

194
00:12:16,216 --> 00:12:18,056
So they are investigating the case again.

195
00:12:20,526 --> 00:12:21,556
I see.

196
00:12:22,726 --> 00:12:23,996
You must be shocked.

197
00:12:26,226 --> 00:12:27,266
Yes.

198
00:12:29,196 --> 00:12:30,936
I know it is right...

199
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:34,236
to uncover the truth and find out who the real culprit is.

200
00:12:36,106 --> 00:12:37,876
But I'm really scared,

201
00:12:38,036 --> 00:12:39,276
worried,

202
00:12:40,946 --> 00:12:42,216
and confused.

203
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:46,016
I understand.

204
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:49,556
Do you want me to come over...

205
00:12:49,556 --> 00:12:50,786
and see you for a moment?

206
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:54,656
No. My mom is having a hard time.

207
00:12:55,556 --> 00:12:57,396
I think I should be with her.

208
00:12:58,766 --> 00:12:59,826
Okay.

209
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:03,396
All right. I'll call you later.

210
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:05,066
Se Ri.

211
00:13:07,066 --> 00:13:08,736
Don't worry too much.

212
00:13:08,736 --> 00:13:10,536
If you need anything, call me right away.

213
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:11,606
Okay?

214
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:14,806
I will.

215
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,916
Come in.

216
00:13:25,756 --> 00:13:27,886
- It's me. - When did you get back?

217
00:13:27,886 --> 00:13:29,126
Yesterday.

218
00:13:30,196 --> 00:13:31,526
I'm so tired.

219
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:35,466
Did the conference go well?

220
00:13:35,466 --> 00:13:36,836
Don't even get me started.

221
00:13:37,496 --> 00:13:38,606
Oh, right.

222
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,706
I forgot to buy a gift for Ha Ni. I'm sorry.

223
00:13:40,906 --> 00:13:43,276
It's no problem. Do you want some tea?

224
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:44,776
No. I just had some.

225
00:13:49,776 --> 00:13:50,776
What is it?

226
00:13:51,616 --> 00:13:52,916
Do you have something to say?

227
00:13:54,286 --> 00:13:55,316
The thing is,

228
00:13:56,056 --> 00:13:58,156
I was in the department store earlier.

229
00:13:58,586 --> 00:13:59,986
And I saw Young Eun there.

230
00:14:01,586 --> 00:14:05,226
She was with a baby.

231
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:06,366
A baby?

232
00:14:06,626 --> 00:14:08,896
I mean, she just got married.

233
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:12,366
Did she already have a baby with Chairman Jang?

234
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,306
Your dad is here. Let's go.

235
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:20,776
All right.

236
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,316
Ha Ni, did you have fun?

237
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:25,816
She ate well and took a good nap.

238
00:14:25,816 --> 00:14:27,216
- She was so gentle. - I see.

239
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:30,286
- Thank you. - My pleasure.

240
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,426
Bye, Ha Ni.

241
00:14:32,426 --> 00:14:35,056
- I'll see you tomorrow. - Bye.

242
00:14:35,226 --> 00:14:38,766
By the way, Ha Ni's clothes have changed.

243
00:14:39,726 --> 00:14:41,726
This isn't what she was wearing this morning.

244
00:14:43,136 --> 00:14:44,936
Oh, right.

245
00:14:45,366 --> 00:14:47,436
While I was trying to give her some juice,

246
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:48,876
I spilled it a little.

247
00:14:48,876 --> 00:14:50,276
I had my granddaughter's clothes at home,

248
00:14:50,276 --> 00:14:52,046
so I put them on her.

249
00:14:52,406 --> 00:14:54,906
I was going to tell you, but I forgot.

250
00:14:58,076 --> 00:15:01,116
Did Ha Ni go out today?

251
00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:05,116
No. She was with me all day.

252
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:07,286
Why?

253
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:11,396
Nothing. Thank you for today.

254
00:15:11,396 --> 00:15:12,466
All right.

255
00:15:39,956 --> 00:15:41,326
I'm home.

256
00:15:43,496 --> 00:15:44,996
- Beom Soo. - Kang Soo.

257
00:15:44,996 --> 00:15:46,096
Did you just get home?

258
00:15:46,526 --> 00:15:47,566
Yes.

259
00:15:48,496 --> 00:15:50,796
Oh, right. Did you hear that?

260
00:15:51,336 --> 00:15:52,366
What?

261
00:15:52,466 --> 00:15:54,836
I got a call from Se Ri earlier.

262
00:15:54,836 --> 00:15:57,436
Chairman Dokgo Tak is now under investigation.

263
00:15:58,746 --> 00:15:59,746
Really?

264
00:15:59,746 --> 00:16:02,416
The employee who instigated the creation of the false video...

265
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,276
of insect-ridden rice and fled overseas...

266
00:16:04,276 --> 00:16:05,516
was caught today.

267
00:16:23,836 --> 00:16:26,136
This is the Department of Law at Hankuk University.

268
00:16:26,806 --> 00:16:28,736
Could you please give me the contact information...

269
00:16:29,176 --> 00:16:31,336
for Mr. Park Jong Woo,

270
00:16:31,836 --> 00:16:34,076
who entered the law school...

271
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,076
in 1970?

272
00:16:36,776 --> 00:16:39,486
I think you should contact the alumni association.

273
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:42,456
The alumni association?

274
00:16:48,856 --> 00:16:52,196
My mother has been diagnosed with dementia,

275
00:16:52,466 --> 00:16:53,926
and she wants to meet...

276
00:16:53,926 --> 00:16:57,296
Mr. Park Jong Woo before her memory fades.

277
00:16:58,296 --> 00:17:00,636
He is Mother's first love.

278
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:03,576
If that's the case,

279
00:17:04,076 --> 00:17:06,676
you can give us your contact information.

280
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:09,716
If we get in touch with Mr. Park,

281
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:11,416
we will give him your message.

282
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,986
Thank you.

283
00:17:13,486 --> 00:17:15,886
We are pressed for time,

284
00:17:15,886 --> 00:17:17,356
so please hurry.

285
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:18,856
I appreciate your help in advance.

286
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:20,556
All right.

287
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:31,266
Why do you think Ri An wants to see you?

288
00:17:32,736 --> 00:17:35,506
I guess she wants me...

289
00:17:35,506 --> 00:17:37,806
to be her backup dancer for her concert.

290
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:41,676
I think I made myself clear last time.

291
00:17:42,376 --> 00:17:44,276
Why wouldn't she listen to the manager?

292
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:46,946
She always gets her own way and has a big mouth.

293
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:49,486
That's why they say half of the rumors...

294
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:50,916
in show business come from her mouth.

295
00:17:52,086 --> 00:17:53,326
Is she that bad?

296
00:17:53,326 --> 00:17:54,326
Yes.

297
00:17:54,486 --> 00:17:56,856
If she finds fault with you and spreads a weird rumor,

298
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:59,296
you'll be kicked out of show business.

299
00:17:59,296 --> 00:18:00,866
Gosh, I hate her.

300
00:18:02,636 --> 00:18:05,936
Anyway, I will turn it down without hurting her feelings.

301
00:18:05,936 --> 00:18:07,506
You should stay quiet.

302
00:18:07,606 --> 00:18:09,336
- Okay. - All right.

303
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:15,146
Heung Soo!

304
00:18:16,946 --> 00:18:19,346
Hey. Have a seat.

305
00:18:20,746 --> 00:18:21,786
What?

306
00:18:22,816 --> 00:18:24,216
I didn't know the manager would be here.

307
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:26,486
Hello.

308
00:18:29,726 --> 00:18:32,166
I thought it would just be the two of us today.

309
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,166
What?

310
00:18:38,936 --> 00:18:40,406
As I told you before,

311
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:43,106
I'm busy with my store,

312
00:18:43,106 --> 00:18:44,876
and I can't afford to do other things.

313
00:18:45,706 --> 00:18:47,946
I don't think I can help you with your concert.

314
00:18:47,946 --> 00:18:48,976
No.

315
00:18:49,616 --> 00:18:51,476
That's not why I wanted to see you.

316
00:18:52,846 --> 00:18:55,246
Isn't this about your concert? What is it, then?

317
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:59,686
You haven't changed at all, Heung Soo.

318
00:19:03,096 --> 00:19:06,126
You know I had a crush on you back in the day, right?

319
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:14,606
I sent you notes and called you many times...

320
00:19:14,606 --> 00:19:15,876
without the managers knowing.

321
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:20,376
You did? I don't remember anything.

322
00:19:20,546 --> 00:19:22,976
You know the CEO of my agency was really strict back then.

323
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:25,146
He didn't want any rumors going around,

324
00:19:25,146 --> 00:19:26,786
so I couldn't even ask you out.

325
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,856
And I met you again after all this time.

326
00:19:30,386 --> 00:19:31,956
Maybe we're meant to be together.

327
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,396
My contract ended a few days ago.

328
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:40,666
I'm free now.

329
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:44,496
I asked you to meet me...

330
00:19:44,496 --> 00:19:47,436
because I wanted to ask you out officially.

331
00:19:56,176 --> 00:19:59,286
As his manager, I want you to make sure...

332
00:19:59,346 --> 00:20:01,686
there will be no other girls who ask him out.

333
00:20:02,356 --> 00:20:03,486
Please.

334
00:20:07,326 --> 00:20:09,726
Actually, I...

335
00:20:11,926 --> 00:20:15,426
Okay. I'll make sure to watch him well.

336
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:17,466
My goodness.

337
00:20:32,046 --> 00:20:35,546
I was going to tell Ri An that we were dating.

338
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:36,756
What was with you?

339
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:41,826
You said you might get kicked out of show business...

340
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:43,856
if she found fault with you...

341
00:20:43,856 --> 00:20:45,666
and spread a weird rumor.

342
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,636
You're just starting to attract public attention.

343
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:54,806
You don't need to do anything to make her hate you.

344
00:20:56,776 --> 00:20:58,676
It's not like I'm an idol.

345
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:01,646
We don't need to keep our relationship a secret.

346
00:21:02,916 --> 00:21:05,446
Still, that's not how a person's feelings work.

347
00:21:08,086 --> 00:21:10,016
I'm fine with this.

348
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:13,726
Let's keep our relationship a secret for the time being.

349
00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:16,756
What's important is your future.

350
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:19,066
My gosh.

351
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:24,636
Are you sure you'll be okay with that?

352
00:21:26,706 --> 00:21:28,066
Of course.

353
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:31,306
I, Ji Ok Bun, am a woman with a broad mind.

354
00:21:37,784 --> 00:21:39,324
- Welcome. - Mi Sun.

355
00:21:39,386 --> 00:21:41,486
Hey, what brings you by?

356
00:21:41,716 --> 00:21:44,286
Se Ri can't make it to work today,

357
00:21:44,286 --> 00:21:45,396
so I came by instead.

358
00:21:46,156 --> 00:21:47,826
Why? Is something wrong?

359
00:21:48,396 --> 00:21:49,396
Well...

360
00:21:50,926 --> 00:21:52,136
Se Ri's father...

361
00:21:52,766 --> 00:21:54,766
is being questioned by the police.

362
00:21:55,736 --> 00:21:57,066
By the police?

363
00:21:59,306 --> 00:22:00,306
Hey.

364
00:22:00,506 --> 00:22:01,606
- Hey. - Hey, Chun Soo.

365
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:04,176
I didn't expect to see you here, Beom Soo.

366
00:22:05,146 --> 00:22:07,176
Se Ri can't make it to work today,

367
00:22:07,816 --> 00:22:10,046
so Beom Soo will cover for her.

368
00:22:10,046 --> 00:22:11,046
I see.

369
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:15,726
Beom Soo.

370
00:22:16,286 --> 00:22:18,056
I've really thought this through.

371
00:22:20,356 --> 00:22:22,966
You and Se Ri may be dating,

372
00:22:23,266 --> 00:22:24,966
but that doesn't excuse what he did,

373
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:28,936
and he should be held accountable for his crimes.

374
00:22:31,566 --> 00:22:32,676
Dokgo Tak...

375
00:22:33,506 --> 00:22:34,776
must pay for what he did.

376
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:37,706
I'm sorry if this is difficult to hear.

377
00:22:38,716 --> 00:22:41,376
Why would I be upset when it should be no other way?

378
00:22:43,046 --> 00:22:44,886
It's tricky for me to say that now,

379
00:22:44,886 --> 00:22:46,356
since you have ties to that family.

380
00:22:46,986 --> 00:22:48,856
I agree with you on this.

381
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,986
My relationship with Se Ri is a separate matter,

382
00:22:51,256 --> 00:22:53,256
and what he did to the brewery is clearly a crime.

383
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:56,626
Good.

384
00:22:57,866 --> 00:22:58,966
Thanks.

385
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:06,936
But...

386
00:23:07,676 --> 00:23:09,676
feelings aren't something...

387
00:23:09,676 --> 00:23:11,506
you can just cut into slices...

388
00:23:11,546 --> 00:23:13,176
- with a knife. - Right.

389
00:23:14,016 --> 00:23:15,416
This whole situation...

390
00:23:15,986 --> 00:23:18,016
must be complicated for Beom Soo.

391
00:23:19,056 --> 00:23:20,386
You're right,

392
00:23:22,156 --> 00:23:24,226
but we still have to figure out where the line is.

393
00:23:24,856 --> 00:23:26,196
That way, we won't cross the line...

394
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:28,356
even if we have a lapse in judgment.

395
00:23:30,026 --> 00:23:31,566
That's true,

396
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:33,866
but you see,

397
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,966
when it comes to feelings,

398
00:23:35,966 --> 00:23:39,076
it's not just black and white.

399
00:23:42,976 --> 00:23:44,046
Unbelievable.

400
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:48,546
I knew I caught the sweet scent of chirping lovebirds.

401
00:23:50,186 --> 00:23:52,616
Newlyweds were walking past the store.

402
00:23:52,686 --> 00:23:53,956
Hello.

403
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:56,356
Why don't you come in for some tea?

404
00:23:57,526 --> 00:23:58,586
Sure.

405
00:23:58,996 --> 00:24:01,256
(3H Acupressure Bed)

406
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:04,666
Gosh, this is nice.

407
00:24:07,766 --> 00:24:09,236
I actually wanted...

408
00:24:09,236 --> 00:24:11,336
to say something to you two privately.

409
00:24:12,036 --> 00:24:13,136
It's a good thing I ran into you.

410
00:24:15,076 --> 00:24:18,146
Now that the second daughter-in-law has moved in,

411
00:24:18,446 --> 00:24:19,676
it's about time...

412
00:24:20,446 --> 00:24:22,586
my Kwang Sook also went her own way.

413
00:24:23,786 --> 00:24:24,816
Yes,

414
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:26,986
of course.

415
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:28,456
It seems like...

416
00:24:28,456 --> 00:24:30,786
Kwang Sook wants to leave only after...

417
00:24:31,586 --> 00:24:33,826
she's sure all the brothers have found peace,

418
00:24:34,856 --> 00:24:37,166
but how is that even possible?

419
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:39,266
Life's a constant battle for everyone.

420
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:40,636
Of course.

421
00:24:40,796 --> 00:24:42,066
That being said,

422
00:24:42,536 --> 00:24:45,266
I'd like you two to support...

423
00:24:46,036 --> 00:24:47,076
her new beginning.

424
00:24:47,436 --> 00:24:49,476
Sure, we understand what you're saying.

425
00:24:49,706 --> 00:24:51,276
I'll try my best...

426
00:24:51,776 --> 00:24:53,246
to get Kwang Sook's wedding moving.

427
00:24:54,246 --> 00:24:55,276
Good.

428
00:24:55,646 --> 00:24:58,516
By the way, Kwang Sook's one thing,

429
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:00,616
but don't you also...

430
00:25:00,816 --> 00:25:02,986
- want a fresh start? - What?

431
00:25:03,226 --> 00:25:05,186
Goodness me.

432
00:25:05,286 --> 00:25:07,396
You're still young and beautiful.

433
00:25:07,496 --> 00:25:09,496
My gosh, at this age?

434
00:25:09,496 --> 00:25:11,266
I'm scared someone might hear you.

435
00:25:15,336 --> 00:25:17,906
You must be exhausted from working at the brewery, so try the bed...

436
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:19,636
while you're here.

437
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:21,076
Mi Sun has it worse,

438
00:25:21,536 --> 00:25:24,076
with the convenience store and household chores.

439
00:25:24,506 --> 00:25:25,676
You should try the massage.

440
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:27,146
I'm fine.

441
00:25:27,176 --> 00:25:29,186
Oh, my. You've got to be kidding me.

442
00:25:29,186 --> 00:25:31,016
You're newlyweds for sure.

443
00:25:32,046 --> 00:25:33,986
Chun Soo, you go first. Come here.

444
00:25:39,756 --> 00:25:41,326
- Is this where I lie down? - Yes.

445
00:25:43,926 --> 00:25:47,796
I'm sure working at the brewery has been wearing you down.

446
00:25:48,396 --> 00:25:50,166
You'll feel relaxed after this.

447
00:25:50,236 --> 00:25:51,606
Right. Thanks.

448
00:25:53,036 --> 00:25:54,036
Hold on.

449
00:25:56,406 --> 00:25:58,206
- This is nice. - Is it?

450
00:25:58,646 --> 00:26:00,276
Goodness, what is this?

451
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,046
Doesn't your body feel lighter?

452
00:26:02,346 --> 00:26:04,046
I bet all the knots are gone now.

453
00:26:04,486 --> 00:26:06,156
I feel so relaxed...

454
00:26:06,786 --> 00:26:08,286
that I might just nod off.

455
00:26:09,926 --> 00:26:10,986
No way.

456
00:26:21,466 --> 00:26:22,506
Dad.

457
00:26:24,836 --> 00:26:27,036
Hey, Se Ri. I bet you were worried.

458
00:26:32,246 --> 00:26:33,576
I know it was a long day.

459
00:26:34,146 --> 00:26:35,516
What did the police say?

460
00:26:35,986 --> 00:26:37,686
They have no evidence...

461
00:26:37,986 --> 00:26:39,716
and have been pressuring me...

462
00:26:39,716 --> 00:26:41,156
solely based on Director Seo's statement.

463
00:26:42,286 --> 00:26:43,426
Are you sure?

464
00:26:44,286 --> 00:26:47,326
Please don't tell me you actually ordered him to make...

465
00:26:48,756 --> 00:26:49,766
that fabricated video.

466
00:26:49,766 --> 00:26:52,126
Absolutely not. I would never have done that.

467
00:26:52,896 --> 00:26:54,696
As if.

468
00:26:54,996 --> 00:26:57,366
That spineless Director Seo doesn't have the guts...

469
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:59,106
to do this behind your back.

470
00:26:59,676 --> 00:27:01,636
Wouldn't holding out like this...

471
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:03,276
get you in more trouble later on?

472
00:27:04,476 --> 00:27:07,376
Is this you showing concern or hoping for the worst?

473
00:27:07,516 --> 00:27:08,646
Honey, please.

474
00:27:08,646 --> 00:27:10,916
When did you even start caring about me?

475
00:27:11,216 --> 00:27:13,356
Worry more about your own future.

476
00:27:13,356 --> 00:27:14,986
I'll take care of mine.

477
00:27:15,186 --> 00:27:16,926
Dad, please.

478
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:21,856
Let me be clear.

479
00:27:22,396 --> 00:27:26,136
I never explicitly ordered him to do this.

480
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:28,066
I'm not responsible.

481
00:27:29,706 --> 00:27:30,906
It'll be all right. Go to your room.

482
00:27:58,896 --> 00:28:00,266
The soup is good.

483
00:28:01,036 --> 00:28:02,136
Grandma.

484
00:28:02,936 --> 00:28:04,006
Yes?

485
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:07,106
Can you live in Korea now?

486
00:28:07,676 --> 00:28:08,976
What do you mean by that?

487
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:12,146
Doesn't it get lonely living all alone...

488
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,746
in the US?

489
00:28:15,216 --> 00:28:18,286
I'll be alone anyway, whether I'm in the US or Korea.

490
00:28:18,546 --> 00:28:21,086
Besides, I'm not particularly lonely.

491
00:28:21,216 --> 00:28:23,186
Grandma, that's not true.

492
00:28:23,456 --> 00:28:26,296
Here, you have Dad, me, and Bom.

493
00:28:26,296 --> 00:28:27,356
Why would you be alone?

494
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:31,026
I don't want to be a burden to anyone.

495
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,196
So don't even bring that up.

496
00:28:33,266 --> 00:28:35,766
Mother, please. Why would you be a burden?

497
00:28:35,806 --> 00:28:38,036
It hurts to hear you talk about yourself like that.

498
00:28:39,076 --> 00:28:41,576
We greet each other warmly once a year...

499
00:28:41,876 --> 00:28:44,546
to enjoy delicious food together and catch up.

500
00:28:45,146 --> 00:28:47,216
That's more than enough.

501
00:28:47,416 --> 00:28:49,086
It's no problem. Okay?

502
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:50,686
Let's eat.

503
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,876
Hey, it's me.

504
00:29:21,146 --> 00:29:22,216
What were you up to?

505
00:29:23,446 --> 00:29:25,346
I just washed up.

506
00:29:27,756 --> 00:29:30,386
What were you up to, sweetie?

507
00:29:31,426 --> 00:29:33,896
I'm having a glass of wine in the study.

508
00:29:34,826 --> 00:29:36,926
Why are you drinking before going to bed?

509
00:29:38,196 --> 00:29:39,766
I figured it'd be a long night.

510
00:29:41,336 --> 00:29:44,366
It must be because you're worried about your mother-in-law.

511
00:29:46,276 --> 00:29:48,136
I'm worried...

512
00:29:49,076 --> 00:29:52,076
that her medical checkup tomorrow will show her condition is worse...

513
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:53,216
than we thought.

514
00:29:54,176 --> 00:29:55,946
There's a lot on my mind.

515
00:29:58,286 --> 00:29:59,756
She'll be all right.

516
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:02,316
Don't worry too much ahead of time.

517
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:04,486
My mother-in-law...

518
00:30:06,126 --> 00:30:07,796
was an impressive woman...

519
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:09,996
in her younger days.

520
00:30:11,196 --> 00:30:13,466
Beautiful, upright,

521
00:30:14,066 --> 00:30:16,066
and resilient.

522
00:30:18,206 --> 00:30:19,836
But she eventually gave in to old age.

523
00:30:24,206 --> 00:30:27,076
As if there's anyone who can escape getting old.

524
00:30:27,876 --> 00:30:28,946
We all...

525
00:30:29,586 --> 00:30:31,986
get a little older every day.

526
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:34,216
That's why...

527
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:38,086
I'm grateful to you.

528
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:42,496
I was close to becoming an old man...

529
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,966
after burying my head in work for so long.

530
00:30:46,736 --> 00:30:48,766
But while I was still relatively young,

531
00:30:49,266 --> 00:30:51,436
I met you and fell in love.

532
00:30:51,936 --> 00:30:54,906
I was also lucky enough to have my love returned.

533
00:30:58,746 --> 00:30:59,816
Likewise.

534
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:03,386
I can call you to ask what you're up to,

535
00:31:04,116 --> 00:31:05,686
if you've eaten,

536
00:31:06,686 --> 00:31:08,216
and when you're going to bed.

537
00:31:10,686 --> 00:31:14,196
Just having someone to check in with like this...

538
00:31:14,926 --> 00:31:17,226
is something to be grateful for.

539
00:31:19,366 --> 00:31:20,736
Recently,

540
00:31:22,396 --> 00:31:25,666
I've been realizing just how precious...

541
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,036
and reassuring it is...

542
00:31:30,446 --> 00:31:31,606
to have someone...

543
00:31:32,406 --> 00:31:33,546
beside me.

544
00:31:34,746 --> 00:31:35,776
Let's...

545
00:31:36,446 --> 00:31:38,146
cherish each other for a long time...

546
00:31:38,946 --> 00:31:40,386
and stay healthy together.

547
00:31:42,826 --> 00:31:43,826
Sure.

548
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:48,556
Too much wine might affect your sleep,

549
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,966
so take it easy.

550
00:31:51,026 --> 00:31:52,096
Got it.

551
00:31:59,006 --> 00:32:00,006
Yes?

552
00:32:03,276 --> 00:32:05,346
Can I come in?

553
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,516
Sure.

554
00:32:12,556 --> 00:32:13,556
Well...

555
00:32:15,456 --> 00:32:18,056
I'm sure you heard...

556
00:32:18,756 --> 00:32:19,926
about Mr. Dokgo Tak.

557
00:32:20,156 --> 00:32:22,796
I did. Beom Soo told me.

558
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:26,336
When I consider Dokgo Tak alone,

559
00:32:26,336 --> 00:32:29,136
I'm glad the police have finally caught him.

560
00:32:31,506 --> 00:32:35,306
But since this involves your birth mother as well,

561
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:40,216
I imagine you're not completely at ease.

562
00:32:41,016 --> 00:32:42,076
That's why I'm here.

563
00:32:44,786 --> 00:32:46,886
It's true that I'm worried about her,

564
00:32:47,986 --> 00:32:51,656
but Dokgo Tak tried to ruin our brewery.

565
00:32:52,826 --> 00:32:54,026
He should be punished.

566
00:32:56,166 --> 00:32:57,496
I fear...

567
00:32:58,166 --> 00:32:59,536
that what's going on...

568
00:33:00,566 --> 00:33:02,436
might cause pain...

569
00:33:03,906 --> 00:33:05,636
to many innocent people.

570
00:33:07,806 --> 00:33:09,176
But Kwang Sook,

571
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,176
those who caused pain shouldn't get a pass...

572
00:33:13,976 --> 00:33:16,846
while those who are hurt have to bear it.

573
00:33:18,386 --> 00:33:19,716
That's wrong.

574
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,466
It's not too late to come forward...

575
00:33:37,906 --> 00:33:40,006
and ask for leniency, honey.

576
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:44,576
Have you lost your mind, woman?

577
00:33:45,246 --> 00:33:48,246
What would I be confessing to when I did nothing wrong?

578
00:33:50,246 --> 00:33:52,086
Do you actually believe that sly Director Seo...

579
00:33:52,086 --> 00:33:53,816
will stay loyal to you?

580
00:33:55,186 --> 00:33:57,556
Lying about your involvement...

581
00:33:57,556 --> 00:34:00,496
might result in a harsher sentence later on.

582
00:34:02,356 --> 00:34:03,896
The police...

583
00:34:04,266 --> 00:34:05,766
are waiting for me to crack...

584
00:34:05,766 --> 00:34:07,696
even though they've got nothing on me.

585
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:11,306
Are you telling me I should just walk into that trap?

586
00:34:11,406 --> 00:34:12,506
Have you lost your mind?

587
00:34:15,306 --> 00:34:17,406
You can't lie your way out of this.

588
00:34:18,846 --> 00:34:21,646
The truth will eventually come out.

589
00:34:21,646 --> 00:34:22,846
Once I go to prison,

590
00:34:22,846 --> 00:34:24,786
you'll have the upper hand in the divorce.

591
00:34:24,786 --> 00:34:27,686
That's what you're happy about, isn't it?

592
00:34:29,726 --> 00:34:31,526
Stop making things up.

593
00:34:36,096 --> 00:34:39,466
Do I seem happy to you?

594
00:34:46,736 --> 00:34:48,876
The only way out of this mess is to confess to your involvement,

595
00:34:49,506 --> 00:34:51,276
apologize to Eagle Brewery,

596
00:34:51,276 --> 00:34:54,046
and collect their signatures on a petition.

597
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:57,886
Let's just say that...

598
00:34:58,616 --> 00:35:00,816
I put my pride aside...

599
00:35:00,816 --> 00:35:03,656
and showed respect to Eagle Brewery.

600
00:35:03,656 --> 00:35:06,496
Do you actually think they'll sign a petition for us?

601
00:35:06,496 --> 00:35:09,156
They might, if we beg on our knees.

602
00:35:09,156 --> 00:35:11,566
Even if we manage to get their signatures,

603
00:35:11,566 --> 00:35:14,666
will the police let me off...

604
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:16,966
just because I went to the trouble?

605
00:35:17,336 --> 00:35:20,436
I'll only be acknowledging my crime.

606
00:35:21,176 --> 00:35:23,006
I talked to a lawyer earlier.

607
00:35:24,076 --> 00:35:26,476
Even one petition could really help...

608
00:35:26,476 --> 00:35:27,976
if this goes to trial.

609
00:35:27,976 --> 00:35:30,586
This doesn't have to go to trial!

610
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,616
Stop being stubborn about this!

611
00:35:34,656 --> 00:35:37,226
If things take a turn for the worse,

612
00:35:37,826 --> 00:35:39,226
you'll end up in prison.

613
00:35:41,526 --> 00:35:43,226
You'll receive an even harsher punishment...

614
00:35:43,226 --> 00:35:44,366
for not confessing sooner.

615
00:35:44,826 --> 00:35:46,026
Cut the nonsense.

616
00:35:46,996 --> 00:35:48,666
There's no way I'm going down.

617
00:35:52,306 --> 00:35:55,576
Keep your mouth shut and stay home.

618
00:35:56,606 --> 00:35:59,306
Taking action right now will only worsen the situation.

619
00:36:32,576 --> 00:36:34,076
(Hope-filled Future With Our Citizens)

620
00:36:36,546 --> 00:36:39,916
I can't share any details about an ongoing investigation.

621
00:36:39,916 --> 00:36:42,116
But like I said over the phone,

622
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,426
we've been questioning...

623
00:36:43,426 --> 00:36:44,786
Director Seo Gil Yong of Silla Brewery...

624
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:47,396
ever since he was transferred to Korea.

625
00:36:47,956 --> 00:36:49,196
Right, I see.

626
00:36:49,926 --> 00:36:52,396
Did he confess to being behind the crime?

627
00:36:52,526 --> 00:36:54,936
He has admitted his involvement,

628
00:36:54,936 --> 00:36:56,266
so the main question...

629
00:36:56,266 --> 00:36:59,306
is whether or not he was the actual mastermind.

630
00:37:00,736 --> 00:37:03,906
At first, he said he took orders from Mr. Dokgo Tak,

631
00:37:03,906 --> 00:37:04,906
but now...

632
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:07,546
he claims he acted on his own.

633
00:37:07,916 --> 00:37:11,086
- What? - Then, how will you proceed?

634
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:13,416
Since he changed his statement,

635
00:37:13,986 --> 00:37:17,686
does that mean Mr. Dokgo Tak will face no charges?

636
00:37:18,456 --> 00:37:20,326
Just because he changed his story,

637
00:37:20,326 --> 00:37:22,426
it doesn't mean his first statement is void.

638
00:37:22,426 --> 00:37:24,726
But other than circumstantial evidence,

639
00:37:24,726 --> 00:37:27,396
we'll need solid proof that the CEO gave the order,

640
00:37:27,396 --> 00:37:29,396
or someone else to back up the claim.

641
00:37:29,836 --> 00:37:32,306
That's the angle we're mainly focused on.

642
00:37:32,536 --> 00:37:34,976
I see. We only ask for your hard work.

643
00:37:34,976 --> 00:37:35,976
Of course.

644
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:43,346
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

645
00:37:43,346 --> 00:37:44,446
Come in.

646
00:37:48,256 --> 00:37:49,256
Sir,

647
00:37:49,256 --> 00:37:50,526
an extraordinary shareholders' meeting...

648
00:37:50,526 --> 00:37:51,826
has been requested.

649
00:37:54,296 --> 00:37:56,266
And so, it finally begins.

650
00:37:58,196 --> 00:37:59,196
Whatever.

651
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:02,396
Let them do as they wish.

652
00:38:03,266 --> 00:38:04,506
Are you sure about this?

653
00:38:05,236 --> 00:38:08,476
They want to go that far just to drag me down.

654
00:38:11,006 --> 00:38:12,576
Bring it on.

655
00:38:13,476 --> 00:38:14,846
We'll see who wins.

656
00:38:24,156 --> 00:38:25,456
Welcome.

657
00:38:25,626 --> 00:38:27,656
Goodness, Se Ri.

658
00:38:32,796 --> 00:38:35,836
Mi Sun, I'm sorry for suddenly bailing on you yesterday.

659
00:38:36,306 --> 00:38:37,836
Don't be ridiculous.

660
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,676
There was chaos at home.

661
00:38:39,676 --> 00:38:41,876
It's no surprise things were hectic for you.

662
00:38:42,976 --> 00:38:44,206
How's your father?

663
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:49,476
He got home after being questioned by the police.

664
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,486
I see.

665
00:38:54,586 --> 00:38:57,656
I know I shouldn't be springing this on you,

666
00:39:00,956 --> 00:39:03,826
but I think I should quit my job here.

667
00:39:05,366 --> 00:39:06,766
My mom's struggling right now,

668
00:39:06,766 --> 00:39:08,796
and I want to be there for her.

669
00:39:10,466 --> 00:39:12,666
- Also, I... - I can always...

670
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:15,136
find someone else to work the shifts.

671
00:39:15,636 --> 00:39:17,976
This is a time to be with your family.

672
00:39:19,716 --> 00:39:20,716
I know it wasn't easy,

673
00:39:21,416 --> 00:39:24,646
especially with the long commute to the convenience store.

674
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:28,486
Oh, dear.

675
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,126
The bad blood between the families...

676
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,956
is causing you and Beom Soo...

677
00:39:33,956 --> 00:39:36,156
a lot of emotional strain.

678
00:39:38,526 --> 00:39:40,566
I feel for you.

679
00:39:51,306 --> 00:39:52,306
Come in.

680
00:39:54,316 --> 00:39:55,416
Professor.

681
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:56,886
Se Ri.

682
00:39:57,916 --> 00:39:59,616
What brings you by unannounced?

683
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:03,386
I came here after talking to Mi Sun.

684
00:40:05,626 --> 00:40:06,726
I'm quitting my job...

685
00:40:07,856 --> 00:40:09,256
at the convenience store.

686
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:13,436
I see.

687
00:40:15,266 --> 00:40:17,236
My mom's having such a hard time,

688
00:40:18,006 --> 00:40:20,036
and I think I should be with her.

689
00:40:21,476 --> 00:40:22,576
Also,

690
00:40:23,806 --> 00:40:26,146
I feel too guilty and ashamed...

691
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,046
to be around your family.

692
00:40:32,986 --> 00:40:35,386
I understand how you feel,

693
00:40:36,056 --> 00:40:37,556
but we agreed to keep our relationship apart...

694
00:40:37,556 --> 00:40:39,226
from the situation with your parents.

695
00:40:39,956 --> 00:40:41,656
I tried,

696
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:45,566
but I haven't been able to.

697
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:50,066
I know I didn't do anything wrong,

698
00:40:50,936 --> 00:40:52,966
but I still feel like I hurt people.

699
00:40:53,836 --> 00:40:54,876
Se Ri.

700
00:40:56,546 --> 00:40:59,376
I told myself to tough it out and get through this.

701
00:41:00,976 --> 00:41:02,676
But I just can't.

702
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:07,516
What my parents did was so inexcusable...

703
00:41:07,516 --> 00:41:08,716
that I...

704
00:41:09,586 --> 00:41:11,456
can't seem to handle the fallout.

705
00:41:19,266 --> 00:41:20,736
No one in my family...

706
00:41:22,136 --> 00:41:25,436
including me expects you to do anything.

707
00:41:26,906 --> 00:41:28,936
I'm not doing this because of what others say.

708
00:41:30,846 --> 00:41:33,006
I find myself tiptoeing around others.

709
00:41:34,616 --> 00:41:36,686
I feel anxious and intimidated.

710
00:41:39,516 --> 00:41:42,116
I can't make sense of the situation at all.

711
00:41:50,396 --> 00:41:52,366
I'm so weighed down by guilt...

712
00:41:54,466 --> 00:41:56,466
that I can't be with you for a while.

713
00:41:58,766 --> 00:41:59,806
What?

714
00:42:01,776 --> 00:42:03,776
Give me a little time, Professor.

715
00:42:09,346 --> 00:42:11,786
We fought so hard to get here.

716
00:42:12,886 --> 00:42:14,156
Do you have to do this?

717
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,386
Yes.

718
00:42:19,626 --> 00:42:20,826
Please.

719
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,166
Okay.

720
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,236
If you need time, I must wait.

721
00:42:32,806 --> 00:42:33,906
Then,

722
00:42:35,006 --> 00:42:36,506
promise me this one thing.

723
00:42:39,406 --> 00:42:41,276
I'll be waiting right here,

724
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:43,416
so don't go too far.

725
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:17,889
Thank you.

726
00:43:20,689 --> 00:43:21,689
Thank you.

727
00:43:22,489 --> 00:43:23,489
You're so cool.

728
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:27,259
What's going on?

729
00:43:27,429 --> 00:43:29,129
A group of my fans visited...

730
00:43:29,129 --> 00:43:30,969
when they heard about my shop.

731
00:43:31,699 --> 00:43:32,939
Order number 108.

732
00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:34,139
Thanks.

733
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,739
Order number 108.

734
00:43:39,139 --> 00:43:41,779
I was here once before. It was so tasty that I came back.

735
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,649
Thank you. Enjoy the food.

736
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:49,019
Can we take a selfie?

737
00:43:49,889 --> 00:43:51,449
You were incredible on TV.

738
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:54,189
Of course, we can take a selfie. Wait right there.

739
00:43:58,759 --> 00:44:01,559
Give me your phone. I'll take the photo for you.

740
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:03,429
- Really? Thank you. - Sure.

741
00:44:04,829 --> 00:44:06,299
- What shall we do? - This.

742
00:44:06,299 --> 00:44:07,599
- This? - Okay.

743
00:44:07,799 --> 00:44:09,539
One, two, three.

744
00:44:09,869 --> 00:44:11,769
- Look at that. - I'm jealous.

745
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:14,709
- Thank you. - Thank you.

746
00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:16,279
The sandwich was so good.

747
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:17,979
- It's the best. - Thank you.

748
00:44:18,949 --> 00:44:21,349
- Can you take one of us? - Yes, of course. Stand over there.

749
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:23,389
- Let's stand in line. - Okay.

750
00:44:23,389 --> 00:44:25,989
- We should ask too. - I loved the sandwich.

751
00:44:26,259 --> 00:44:27,989
It was as sweet as your dance moves.

752
00:44:29,289 --> 00:44:30,789
One, two, three.

753
00:44:31,229 --> 00:44:32,429
Two, three.

754
00:44:33,399 --> 00:44:35,729
- I loved your TV show. - Thank you.

755
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:37,129
Thank you.

756
00:44:39,029 --> 00:44:41,869
Heung Soo. This is unbelievable.

757
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:44,569
It is. I can't believe this is happening.

758
00:44:44,939 --> 00:44:47,009
Our sales will go through the roof.

759
00:44:48,279 --> 00:44:50,749
Oh, if you stand in line over here,

760
00:44:50,879 --> 00:44:53,719
I'll take your photos, and you can get his autograph too.

761
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:54,879
For real?

762
00:44:54,879 --> 00:44:55,879
Thank you.

763
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,719
- Hello. - You're so handsome.

764
00:44:57,719 --> 00:44:58,719
Thank you.

765
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:01,019
One, two, three.

766
00:45:01,959 --> 00:45:03,529
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

767
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:04,589
Come in.

768
00:45:06,429 --> 00:45:09,129
Eagle Brewery's Vice-CEO Oh Chun Soo is here.

769
00:45:09,159 --> 00:45:10,969
Oh, is he? Let him in.

770
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:15,039
Hello, Mr. Han.

771
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:17,509
- Welcome. - Thanks.

772
00:45:18,209 --> 00:45:19,209
Take a seat.

773
00:45:19,909 --> 00:45:22,979
You're busy. I'll get to the point and get out of the way.

774
00:45:24,809 --> 00:45:27,079
What is it? Is something wrong?

775
00:45:27,479 --> 00:45:29,519
Don't you think...

776
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:32,589
it's time to pick a date for the wedding?

777
00:45:32,889 --> 00:45:35,459
I've married and settled down,

778
00:45:35,989 --> 00:45:37,959
and my wife and I...

779
00:45:37,959 --> 00:45:40,129
can take over from Kwang Sook.

780
00:45:41,629 --> 00:45:43,699
That's great to hear.

781
00:45:44,169 --> 00:45:46,839
I'd been thinking it would be nice if we could...

782
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:48,769
get married before fall.

783
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:52,709
I guess you're even more rushed than I am.

784
00:45:52,939 --> 00:45:54,779
Of course, I am.

785
00:45:54,879 --> 00:45:56,879
I was extremely jealous of you.

786
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:02,579
(Hankuk University Hospital)

787
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:04,849
Did they put you through a lot of tests?

788
00:46:05,219 --> 00:46:06,589
They're making me spend the night...

789
00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:08,289
to run every possible test.

790
00:46:08,589 --> 00:46:10,459
They'll look at me inside and out.

791
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:14,759
Why come here when you must be busy?

792
00:46:15,299 --> 00:46:18,299
I may not look it, but I'm a CEO.

793
00:46:18,569 --> 00:46:20,999
I put my employees to work to sneak out.

794
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:22,969
What a show-off.

795
00:46:26,509 --> 00:46:28,839
I went to Hankuk University's...

796
00:46:28,839 --> 00:46:31,149
alumni association office yesterday.

797
00:46:32,249 --> 00:46:33,649
The person there said...

798
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,849
they'd look up Mr. Park's number...

799
00:46:36,019 --> 00:46:37,789
and give him a call.

800
00:46:38,449 --> 00:46:39,919
Let's wait and see.

801
00:46:43,329 --> 00:46:44,759
If he's still alive,

802
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:47,359
we'll hear from him.

803
00:46:47,929 --> 00:46:48,999
Yes.

804
00:46:50,129 --> 00:46:51,169
So...

805
00:46:53,469 --> 00:46:56,809
Why did you and Mr. Park break up?

806
00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:03,209
Seeing that you want to see him again...

807
00:47:04,609 --> 00:47:06,779
makes me think you loved him a lot.

808
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:14,659
You mean you'll give up trying to pass the bar?

809
00:47:17,289 --> 00:47:18,829
I should think of my family.

810
00:47:19,799 --> 00:47:20,929
My younger sisters...

811
00:47:21,459 --> 00:47:22,759
work in a sewing factory...

812
00:47:23,329 --> 00:47:25,769
day and night to support me and my studies.

813
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:28,399
Now, I must earn money and marry them off.

814
00:47:29,139 --> 00:47:30,209
What about me, then?

815
00:47:33,279 --> 00:47:34,609
My parents say...

816
00:47:34,609 --> 00:47:36,809
they won't let me marry you unless you pass the bar.

817
00:47:37,779 --> 00:47:39,409
Giving up the bar...

818
00:47:39,409 --> 00:47:41,179
means giving up on me.

819
00:47:46,089 --> 00:47:47,359
I have...

820
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:50,029
no choice.

821
00:47:52,999 --> 00:47:54,099
What does that mean?

822
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:57,099
You'll leave me?

823
00:48:01,469 --> 00:48:03,809
I'm the first thing you give up when things get bad.

824
00:48:05,739 --> 00:48:06,979
Don't call me again.

825
00:48:07,709 --> 00:48:09,209
You're dead to me.

826
00:48:22,289 --> 00:48:23,959
That was the last time I saw him.

827
00:48:31,029 --> 00:48:33,469
Jong Woo moved to the countryside after that.

828
00:48:34,669 --> 00:48:36,909
Our five-year relationship...

829
00:48:37,569 --> 00:48:38,869
came to an end.

830
00:48:47,079 --> 00:48:49,579
At the time, I cared more...

831
00:48:50,789 --> 00:48:53,089
about my wounded self-esteem than his feelings.

832
00:48:54,259 --> 00:48:56,829
To think I said such cruel things before walking away.

833
00:49:00,759 --> 00:49:01,829
Are you crying?

834
00:49:05,799 --> 00:49:06,999
It's heartbreaking.

835
00:49:08,599 --> 00:49:11,769
Do you cry at the drop of a hat?

836
00:49:12,439 --> 00:49:13,509
Yes.

837
00:49:14,379 --> 00:49:17,209
I cry a lot, and I laugh a lot.

838
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:18,879
I'm easily excited...

839
00:49:19,449 --> 00:49:21,119
and easily angered.

840
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:24,989
I'm generally a bit excessive.

841
00:49:25,449 --> 00:49:26,459
My gosh.

842
00:49:30,659 --> 00:49:31,889
Mr. Park...

843
00:49:32,589 --> 00:49:34,199
will reach out.

844
00:49:35,029 --> 00:49:36,259
Don't worry.

845
00:49:39,129 --> 00:49:41,999
I want to see him one last time to apologize.

846
00:49:45,469 --> 00:49:47,609
After you meet with Mr. Park,

847
00:49:48,879 --> 00:49:51,109
will you return to the US?

848
00:49:52,009 --> 00:49:54,019
Yes. I should.

849
00:49:54,949 --> 00:49:57,789
Wouldn't you feel lonely all on your own?

850
00:49:58,989 --> 00:50:00,689
Loneliness is part of my life now.

851
00:50:01,189 --> 00:50:02,319
No problem.

852
00:50:07,799 --> 00:50:08,799
Excuse me.

853
00:50:10,529 --> 00:50:11,629
It's the chairman.

854
00:50:15,269 --> 00:50:16,339
Hello?

855
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:19,109
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

856
00:50:19,109 --> 00:50:22,009
I had a lot of meetings today, so I had no time to call you.

857
00:50:22,009 --> 00:50:23,039
Where are you?

858
00:50:23,879 --> 00:50:25,179
I'm at the hospital.

859
00:50:26,179 --> 00:50:27,719
Did you go to see my mother-in-law?

860
00:50:28,219 --> 00:50:29,549
I just got here.

861
00:50:29,549 --> 00:50:32,519
I was chatting with Ms. Park.

862
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:36,189
You two have been suspicious since yesterday.

863
00:50:36,289 --> 00:50:38,729
What secret are you two talking about?

864
00:50:40,459 --> 00:50:43,269
If I tell you, it won't be a secret.

865
00:50:45,699 --> 00:50:48,169
Thank you anyway.

866
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:51,269
For taking good care of Mother.

867
00:50:54,909 --> 00:50:57,249
Mr. Chairman. Everything is ready for the management report meeting.

868
00:50:58,249 --> 00:51:00,649
I have another meeting now.

869
00:51:00,649 --> 00:51:03,219
I'll call you later. Bye.

870
00:51:06,389 --> 00:51:07,389
Let's go.

871
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:08,519
Yes, sir.

872
00:51:09,929 --> 00:51:11,459
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

873
00:51:11,459 --> 00:51:13,029
Chairman Jung said...

874
00:51:13,029 --> 00:51:16,059
he'd support me at the shareholders' meeting.

875
00:51:17,169 --> 00:51:19,629
You haven't changed your mind, have you, Chairman Kim?

876
00:51:21,999 --> 00:51:23,439
Of course.

877
00:51:23,439 --> 00:51:24,909
Silla Brewery can't exist...

878
00:51:24,909 --> 00:51:26,779
without Dokgo Tak, you know.

879
00:51:28,939 --> 00:51:32,479
Yes. I'll see you at the meeting then. Bye.

880
00:51:34,279 --> 00:51:35,349
What?

881
00:51:35,749 --> 00:51:37,389
I heard about the shareholders' meeting.

882
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:38,849
I was worried, so I came.

883
00:51:40,919 --> 00:51:43,589
So you're a shareholder? Now that you're getting divorced,

884
00:51:43,589 --> 00:51:45,489
are you suddenly caring about the company?

885
00:51:47,659 --> 00:51:49,059
This is my genuine concern.

886
00:51:49,059 --> 00:51:50,829
Why are you so twisted?

887
00:51:51,999 --> 00:51:53,569
How can I not be twisted?

888
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,069
This is not the time...

889
00:51:56,099 --> 00:51:58,139
for you to be obsessed with the company.

890
00:51:59,269 --> 00:52:01,109
You have to face reality.

891
00:52:01,109 --> 00:52:03,009
What reality?

892
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:05,049
Take this opportunity to step back for a moment.

893
00:52:05,049 --> 00:52:06,549
Why don't you take a breather...

894
00:52:06,549 --> 00:52:08,449
and focus on the investigation?

895
00:52:15,659 --> 00:52:19,629
You probably think I'm some kind of paper tiger.

896
00:52:20,499 --> 00:52:22,659
But you're mistaken.

897
00:52:23,369 --> 00:52:26,799
I'm Dokgo Tak for crying out loud. I won't go down without a fight.

898
00:52:26,799 --> 00:52:27,799
Honey.

899
00:52:27,799 --> 00:52:30,739
Nothing I have will be taken away from me.

900
00:52:31,369 --> 00:52:32,839
I'll protect everything I have.

901
00:52:42,179 --> 00:52:44,549
Yes. All right.

902
00:52:44,549 --> 00:52:46,889
I appreciate your understanding. Yes.

903
00:52:48,859 --> 00:52:52,459
Hello? This is Eagle Brewery with perseverance and loyalty.

904
00:52:53,029 --> 00:52:56,129
Mr. Kim? It's been a long time.

905
00:52:57,069 --> 00:52:58,299
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli?

906
00:52:59,329 --> 00:53:02,199
We are short on stock at the moment.

907
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:05,469
Hang on. Please talk to our vice-CEO.

908
00:53:06,439 --> 00:53:07,639
Oh, dear.

909
00:53:09,309 --> 00:53:12,449
Hello, Mr. Kim. Yes.

910
00:53:13,379 --> 00:53:14,949
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli?

911
00:53:14,949 --> 00:53:17,519
We're going to ramp up production as much as possible,

912
00:53:18,019 --> 00:53:19,849
but I'm afraid it will take some time.

913
00:53:20,889 --> 00:53:22,019
Yes.

914
00:53:22,219 --> 00:53:25,229
I'll call you first as soon as it's ready.

915
00:53:25,589 --> 00:53:26,589
Yes.

916
00:53:26,799 --> 00:53:30,669
Thank you for ordering Jang-Kwang Makgeolli again anyway.

917
00:53:31,429 --> 00:53:33,839
Yes. Bye.

918
00:53:34,799 --> 00:53:36,399
My goodness.

919
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:40,479
I'm back.

920
00:53:41,109 --> 00:53:43,039
We've been getting a lot of calls all day.

921
00:53:43,709 --> 00:53:45,979
- Why? - It's funny how the world works.

922
00:53:45,979 --> 00:53:47,649
They made a fuss, canceled their orders,

923
00:53:47,649 --> 00:53:49,279
and pressed us for the money just a while ago,

924
00:53:49,279 --> 00:53:51,949
but now they're calling us to request faster delivery.

925
00:53:52,649 --> 00:53:53,719
My goodness.

926
00:53:55,089 --> 00:53:58,129
We were also asked to triple the export of Jang-Kwang yakju.

927
00:53:58,589 --> 00:53:59,659
At this rate,

928
00:54:00,429 --> 00:54:02,099
we might become a big conglomerate.

929
00:54:02,299 --> 00:54:05,299
That's no problem. Let's become a big conglomerate.

930
00:54:05,299 --> 00:54:06,969
- High-five! - High-five!

931
00:54:06,969 --> 00:54:08,469
- All right! - High-five!

932
00:54:09,269 --> 00:54:10,809
- Oh, my. - We're going to be rich.

933
00:54:10,809 --> 00:54:12,639
- We'll be rich! - Yes!

934
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:14,009
Oh, my.

935
00:54:14,379 --> 00:54:15,739
I'm home.

936
00:54:16,339 --> 00:54:17,979
Hey. You're home.

937
00:54:18,309 --> 00:54:19,779
Ha Ni.

938
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:24,219
By the way, why do you look so exhausted?

939
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,319
Are you feeling sick?

940
00:54:25,649 --> 00:54:27,159
No.

941
00:54:28,519 --> 00:54:31,889
By the way, I heard Se Ri quit her job.

942
00:54:32,259 --> 00:54:34,529
I hope it won't cause you too much trouble.

943
00:54:34,529 --> 00:54:35,999
Not at all.

944
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:38,029
Fortunately,

945
00:54:38,029 --> 00:54:40,469
one of my friends quit her job a few days ago.

946
00:54:40,469 --> 00:54:42,599
So she will fill in for Se Ri.

947
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:43,609
It's okay.

948
00:54:43,609 --> 00:54:44,739
I'm glad to hear that.

949
00:54:45,969 --> 00:54:48,409
I'm tired. I'll be in my room.

950
00:54:48,409 --> 00:54:49,979
Okay.

951
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:59,689
- Mi Sun. - Yes.

952
00:54:59,689 --> 00:55:01,089
I'll cook dinner tonight.

953
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,889
You should go and get some rest.

954
00:55:03,389 --> 00:55:04,689
Wait, Kwang Sook.

955
00:55:06,829 --> 00:55:10,499
I think something's going on between Beom Soo and Se Ri.

956
00:55:11,369 --> 00:55:12,799
What do you mean?

957
00:55:14,139 --> 00:55:17,239
Se Ri quit her job at the convenience store today.

958
00:55:17,939 --> 00:55:20,039
Something didn't feel right.

959
00:55:30,919 --> 00:55:31,919
Yes.

960
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:33,959
Beom Soo.

961
00:55:35,059 --> 00:55:37,829
Can I talk to you for a moment?

962
00:55:37,989 --> 00:55:39,329
Sure.

963
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,369
I heard Se Ri quit her job at the convenience store.

964
00:55:53,139 --> 00:55:55,379
Yes. It just happened that way.

965
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,409
Mi Sun says it seems like...

966
00:55:57,409 --> 00:55:59,309
something is going on between you two.

967
00:55:59,309 --> 00:56:00,679
She's worried.

968
00:56:01,349 --> 00:56:03,419
Is everything all right?

969
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:09,359
Well, we decided to have some time apart.

970
00:56:10,589 --> 00:56:13,189
What does that mean?

971
00:56:14,059 --> 00:56:16,899
Se Ri is having a hard time because of her parents.

972
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:21,069
So we decided to take some time until she sorts herself out.

973
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:35,349
If you need time, I must wait.

974
00:56:37,049 --> 00:56:38,049
Then,

975
00:56:39,219 --> 00:56:40,759
promise me this one thing.

976
00:56:43,929 --> 00:56:45,659
I'll be waiting right here,

977
00:56:46,259 --> 00:56:47,759
so don't go too far.

978
00:57:21,299 --> 00:57:22,329
Come in.

979
00:57:25,429 --> 00:57:26,469
Hey.

980
00:57:29,369 --> 00:57:31,509
You must've been through a lot today.

981
00:57:32,169 --> 00:57:33,679
It's no problem.

982
00:57:34,379 --> 00:57:36,479
Earlier today, Kwang Sook came to see me,

983
00:57:36,479 --> 00:57:38,849
so I lost track of time while chatting with her.

984
00:57:39,149 --> 00:57:42,579
In the evening, Gyeol and Bom came and spent time with me.

985
00:57:43,079 --> 00:57:44,349
I wasn't bored at all.

986
00:57:45,089 --> 00:57:47,959
I had a lot of meetings today, so I couldn't come early.

987
00:57:48,459 --> 00:57:50,959
It's not like I'm sick in the hospital.

988
00:57:50,959 --> 00:57:53,559
I'm just here for a checkup.

989
00:57:53,559 --> 00:57:54,729
Don't treat me like a patient.

990
00:57:55,159 --> 00:57:57,099
Okay. I won't.

991
00:57:58,399 --> 00:57:59,469
Dong Seok.

992
00:57:59,999 --> 00:58:00,999
Yes.

993
00:58:02,069 --> 00:58:03,669
About Kwang Sook.

994
00:58:06,009 --> 00:58:07,439
She's honest,

995
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:10,309
sweet, and warmhearted.

996
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:12,579
She seems like a nice person.

997
00:58:15,219 --> 00:58:16,279
Of course,

998
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:19,489
she's different from Min Seo in many ways,

999
00:58:20,489 --> 00:58:21,989
but at the same time,

1000
00:58:22,759 --> 00:58:24,589
I think they are similar in many ways.

1001
00:58:25,389 --> 00:58:26,389
Yes.

1002
00:58:26,999 --> 00:58:29,759
I think so too.

1003
00:58:30,869 --> 00:58:34,099
I know I don't have the right,

1004
00:58:35,069 --> 00:58:36,369
but I won't try...

1005
00:58:37,369 --> 00:58:39,209
to stop you from seeing her anymore.

1006
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:42,479
You have my blessing.

1007
00:58:48,979 --> 00:58:50,849
Mother, I'm sorry,

1008
00:58:50,849 --> 00:58:53,119
but I have something urgent to take care of.

1009
00:58:53,689 --> 00:58:55,759
I should get going.

1010
00:58:56,489 --> 00:58:57,489
Well...

1011
00:58:59,629 --> 00:59:00,659
What...

1012
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:10,069
Give me the keys. You may get off work now.

1013
00:59:10,069 --> 00:59:11,939
Aren't you going home?

1014
00:59:12,669 --> 00:59:14,209
I have something important to do.

1015
00:59:14,209 --> 00:59:15,779
- Go home. - Yes, sir.

1016
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:29,259
Hello?

1017
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,929
Where are you?

1018
00:59:32,259 --> 00:59:33,259
I'm home.

1019
00:59:33,729 --> 00:59:36,099
Then I'll see you...

1020
00:59:36,399 --> 00:59:39,529
in exactly 20 minutes at the brewery.

1021
00:59:40,499 --> 00:59:43,139
Why? Is something wrong?

1022
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:48,309
There's something huge.

1023
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:49,979
Look forward to it.

1024
01:00:03,789 --> 01:00:07,129
(Eagle Brewery)

1025
01:00:21,009 --> 01:00:23,309
What's this huge thing you told me about?

1026
01:00:24,479 --> 01:00:25,509
We...

1027
01:00:26,609 --> 01:00:28,319
should now settle on a date.

1028
01:00:30,489 --> 01:00:32,019
A date for what?

1029
01:00:32,189 --> 01:00:33,389
As if you need to ask.

1030
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:35,459
Our wedding date.

1031
01:00:36,689 --> 01:00:37,689
What?

1032
01:00:38,059 --> 01:00:39,559
Why are you so surprised?

1033
01:00:40,059 --> 01:00:41,959
Let's get married before fall.

1034
01:00:43,259 --> 01:00:44,669
That soon?

1035
01:00:45,499 --> 01:00:46,829
Seeing my mother-in-law sick...

1036
01:00:47,369 --> 01:00:48,869
after being healthy...

1037
01:00:48,869 --> 01:00:50,639
just a year ago...

1038
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:53,939
made me realize we might not have...

1039
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,439
as much time as we thought.

1040
01:00:59,479 --> 01:01:00,779
That's why...

1041
01:01:01,579 --> 01:01:04,319
the moments I spend alone have been upsetting to me.

1042
01:01:06,249 --> 01:01:08,089
I don't want to put this off any longer.

1043
01:01:08,759 --> 01:01:12,659
Also, my mother-in-law just gave me her blessing.

1044
01:01:22,169 --> 01:01:23,269
For the time we have left,

1045
01:01:25,669 --> 01:01:28,409
I'll love you with all my heart.

1046
01:01:32,509 --> 01:01:35,079
Will you marry me?

1047
01:02:23,969 --> 01:02:25,069
Hold on.

1048
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:31,639
After...

1049
01:02:33,269 --> 01:02:34,509
we get married,

1050
01:02:39,949 --> 01:02:42,349
let's live with your mother-in-law.

1051
01:02:44,889 --> 01:02:45,949
What?

1052
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:47,659
No matter how I think about it,

1053
01:02:48,519 --> 01:02:50,259
that seems like the best idea.

1054
01:02:52,229 --> 01:02:53,529
Let's live...

1055
01:02:54,359 --> 01:02:56,129
with your mother-in-law.

1056
01:03:47,619 --> 01:03:50,219
(For Eagle Brothers)

1057
01:03:50,279 --> 01:03:53,349
Why you... You offered to live with the ex-mother-in-law?

1058
01:03:53,349 --> 01:03:54,659
Have you lost your mind?

1059
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:56,059
I can't believe you guys.

1060
01:03:56,059 --> 01:03:58,629
How come no one's on my side?

1061
01:03:58,889 --> 01:04:01,629
Wait, you mean you understand her?

1062
01:04:01,859 --> 01:04:03,159
It's me, ma'am.

1063
01:04:03,229 --> 01:04:05,829
My meeting ended early, so I'm getting ready to leave work.

1064
01:04:06,199 --> 01:04:08,539
We still have more than an hour left in the time we agreed on.

1065
01:04:08,539 --> 01:04:10,439
You need to get here as fast as possible.

1066
01:04:10,609 --> 01:04:12,909
This is a project all by itself.

1067
01:04:12,939 --> 01:04:15,839
If this goes well, you'll be famous all because of me.

1068
01:04:16,179 --> 01:04:18,279
After shooting a bunch of ads, you could even afford a house.

1069
01:04:18,309 --> 01:04:19,809
Aren't you here to apologize?

1070
01:04:19,909 --> 01:04:20,979
I'm not.

1071
01:04:21,079 --> 01:04:23,379
I'm not here for you, Mr. Han.
