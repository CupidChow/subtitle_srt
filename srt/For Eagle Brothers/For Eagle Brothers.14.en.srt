(Children and teenagers were filmed
under production guidelines.)

2
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:07,750
The sales must be huge then.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,680
But the debt...

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,920
It's five million dollars.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,090
Five million dollars?

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,450
Yes.

7
00:00:16,490 --> 00:00:17,590
Five million dollars.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,630
I've always wondered
where Prince Charming was...

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,790
and why he didn't show up
to save my life.

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,670
I guess...

11
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,400
I'm finally meeting him today.

12
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,870
I guess
Chairman Dokgo Tak was right.

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,840
Ma Kwang Sook is...

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:45,120
a gold digger full of poison.

15
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,400
Welcome, Chairman Han.

16
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,900
I thought
I'd be the first to arrive,

17
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,270
but you came first.

18
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,640
Of course, I have to come early.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,510
We are having
important guests like you.

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,010
It's been a while since we met
at your inauguration.

21
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,550
I should've arranged
a meeting sooner.

22
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,380
My apologies.

23
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,650
I'm aware that you've been busy.

24
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,290
I'm glad to finally see you here.

25
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,420
- Shall we go in?
- Yes.

26
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,060
- Please.
- All right.

28
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:34,730
Gosh, it's hot.

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,070
I've been talking too much
about myself...

30
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,410
when we just met.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,640
Since you seemed like a nice person,

32
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,580
I guess I felt too comfortable.

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,750
I'm sorry if I was being rude.

34
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,550
From what I've heard,

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,590
it seems like
you've been through a lot.

36
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,020
In life,

37
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,160
you need endurance!

38
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,090
Yes.

39
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,630
I have to hold out...

40
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,960
- as much as I can.
- Sure.

41
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,300
Yes. You need strength in life.

42
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,080
Excuse me.

43
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,350
I'm sorry.
Something bad happened at home.

44
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,480
I'm afraid I have to go first.
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,650
Oh, no.

46
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,750
Are you leaving already?

47
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,990
Gosh, that's disappointing.

48
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,190
I wish you could stay longer.

49
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,760
Well... You take your time.
With endurance.

50
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,000
- Why are you leaving so soon?
- I told you to wait a bit.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,930
- Please stay a little longer.
- Where are you?

52
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,770
I'm so sad.

53
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,510
Okay.

54
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,180
Number one, out!

The Emir of Qatar is visiting Korea?

57
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,060
I should cooperate with the request
of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

58
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,460
Yes.

59
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,330
Okay. I'll call you back
after the ceremony is over.

60
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,930
All right.

61
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,440
Is her name Ma Kwang Sook?

62
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:23,070
Yes. The traffic wasn't
as bad as I thought,

63
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,580
so I arrived a little early.

64
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,250
You sent me her photo the other day,

65
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,980
so I can find her right away.

66
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,450
Okay.

67
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,690
My uncle told me...

68
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,830
that your husband passed away.

69
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,770
Yes.

70
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,400
It happened just ten days...

71
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,740
after we got married.

72
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,210
Oh, no.

73
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,880
You must've been really shocked.

74
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,680
I wonder what sin I committed
in my past life...

75
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,490
to be punished like this.

76
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,260
I had all kinds of thoughts.

77
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,390
I understand.

78
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,100
A new date already?

79
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,140
I'm not usually...

80
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:35,780
into things...

81
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,350
like fortune telling or horoscopes.

82
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,950
But I felt wronged and frustrated,

83
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:44,590
so I went to see
a famous fortune teller.

84
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,490
And?

85
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,100
The fortune teller told me this.

86
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,730
I have such strong energy...

87
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,200
that my chances of having a husband
are very slim.

88
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,570
If I meet a man
with weaker energy than me,

89
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,940
my husband will get sick.

90
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,510
Or he can be intimidated
by my energy,

91
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,820
so he will lose his motivation...

92
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,950
and become unemployed.

93
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,620
If things go wrong,

94
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,390
I can lose my husband again.

95
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,390
Again?

96
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,930
So what do you think?

97
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,070
Do you think...

98
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,900
you have strong energy?

99
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,450
I'm sorry,
but I'd choose a breakup...

100
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,710
over bereavement.

101
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,420

104
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,430
Okay. Please take your time.

110
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,000
She's unbelievable.

111
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,770
My goodness.

112
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,210
My nickname is Macho Man.

And my name is Park Sang Nam.

So I'm Macho Man Park Sang Nam.

Now that you say that,

116
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,490
it's easy to remember.

117
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,560
Actually, when I first met you,

118
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,160
I was really surprised.

119
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,760
- Why?
- You look just like my wife.

120
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,630
For a moment, I doubted my eyes,

121
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,600
wondering if my wife
had come back to life.

122
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,770
Is that so?

123
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,070
I'm serious, Kwang Sook.

124
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,980
My wife had fair skin like you.

125
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,510
She had neat features,

126
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,250
and she was really beautiful.

127
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,320
I just have...

128
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,090
an ordinary face.

129
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,390
And you are so humble.

130
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:35,260
You have such a fatal charm.

131
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:42,400
Actually,

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,070
I thought a lot about
whether I should come here today...

133
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:49,070
or not.

134
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,780
What?

135
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,650
Since our elders arranged this date,
I came anyway.

136
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,120
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,420
What are you talking about?

138
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,190
The thing is,

139
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,160
I have a chronic illness.

140
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,290
I have a serious stomach problem,

141
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,900
so I set a date for surgery.

142
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,930
Oh, no.

143
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,440
Is it serious?

144
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,480
The doctor says that...

145
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,810
even if I have the surgery,
there's a slim chance...

146
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,780
of a full recovery.

147
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,350
If something goes wrong,

148
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,020
I won't be able to make it.

149

That's too bad.

150
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,230
You must be having a hard time.

But my mom doesn't know
about this yet.

153
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,780
That's why I came here today.

154
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,710
Well...

155
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,410
I see.

156
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,520
Number three, out.

157
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,490
I'm done with my homework.

158
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:25,040
Call Gyeol
and ask him what time he's coming.

159
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,740
He will come when he comes.

160
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,040
Why are you being so grumpy?

161
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,750
I'm smelling oil in the morning,
so I feel nauseated.

162
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:36,350
Do you need digestive medicine?

163
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:37,580
It's okay.

164
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,220
It's Seon Mi.

Hello?

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,790
Se Ri,
are you having a good weekend?

167
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,090
Of course. What's the matter?

168
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,400
The accounting documents
for Professor Oh's project...

169
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,600
need to be submitted
on Monday morning.

170
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,470
So I'd like you to organize
the statements of accounts...

171
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,940
and submit them by 9 a.m. on Monday.

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,240
Okay. I will.

173
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,710
Thanks.

174
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,840
Professor Oh came to work today.

175
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,710
He came to work on the weekend?

176
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,550
Yes. He even brought Ha Ni.

177
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,280
He did?

178
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,220
Okay. Have a good weekend.

179
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,790
Mom, I need to go to school.

180
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,260
Why?

181
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,290
The TA asked me
to take care of some documents,

182
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,460
and they're in the office.

183
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,960
Gyeol is coming soon.

184
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,160
There's still a while
before he comes.

185
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,370
I'll be right back.

186
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,040
Make sure to come back
before Gyeol arrives, okay?

187
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,370
All right.

188
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:35,110
Gosh, she's unbelievable.

189
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,110
Darn it.

190
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,380
Come in.

191
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:46,550
Hello, Professor.

192
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,390
Hi. What are you doing here?

193
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,690
I talked to the other TA.

194
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,260
She said Ha Ni was here,
so I came to see her.

195
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:56,160
Ha Ni.

196
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,500
It's been a long time.

197
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,430
Hello.

198
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,100
Can I hold her?

199
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,200
Yes, of course.

200
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,570
Ha Ni.

201
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,540
How are you?

202
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,010
You want to come to me?

203
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,240
Ha Ni.

204
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,510
I missed you so much.

205
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,920
Why are you here on a weekend?

206
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,350
A research center overseas...

207
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,290
urgently asked for a report
on the Korean economy.

208
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,490
It's easier to find material here
than it is at home.

209
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,590
I see.

210
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,700
I'll play with Ha Ni...

211
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,200
while you finish the report.

212
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,330
Can I do that?

213
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,740
I'd appreciate that,
but do you have time?

214
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,600
Of course, I do.

215
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,570
Don't worry about Ha Ni
and focus on the report.

216
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,980
Ha Ni.

217
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,680
Let's go on a date with me.

218
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,180
Okay?

219
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,320
Let's go.

220
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,890
Where's her diaper bag?

221
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,290
Hang on.

222
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,660
Here.

223
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,790
I just fed her,
so she won't be hungry.

224
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,430
Okay.

225
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,100
Ha Ni. Let's go.

226
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Se Ri.

227
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,200
Don't push yourself.

228
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,870
Bring her inside
if it gets too much, okay?

229
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Okay.

230
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,270
"See you later, Dad."

231
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,840
You should wave, Ha Ni.

232
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,880
You should say, "Yes, Se Ri."

233
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,680
I'll see you later.

234
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,550
Ha Ni.

235
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,290
I'll take you to see some flowers.

236
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:35,460
We'll eat something tasty...

237
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,290
and have fun too.

238
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:38,730
Okay?

239
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
Hey.

240
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,570
Hi, Mom.

241
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,110
Where are you?

242
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,240
I just got here.

243
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,880
Get back here right away.

244
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:57,010
Okay.

245
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,320
I'll be home before Gyeol arrives.

246
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,520
Don't worry.

247
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:02,890
Bye.

248
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,530
Let's go.

249
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,210
Isn't it rude to keep coming here...

250
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,970
without an appointment?

251
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,610
I'm here for the last time
to say something.

252
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,560
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

253
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,030
I'll propose
with all the members as witnesses.

254
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,300
Will you be my girlfriend?

255
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:47,060
- Oh, gosh.
- Yes!

256
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
No way.

257
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,870
I have to start teaching soon.

258
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,280
I'd appreciate it
if you'd say your piece and leave.

259
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,110
You win.

260
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,920
What do you mean?

261
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,490
Mr. Oh...

262
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,690
I'll give up on him.

263
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,760
You made up your mind pretty fast.

264
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,600
I thought you'd cling like a leech.

265
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,360
A leech?

266
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,400
I'll say just two things.

267
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,310
One,

268
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,240
I'll extend your lease.

269
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,280
You can stay and run the academy
if you want to.

270
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,720
I can?

271
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,780
Two,

272
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,450
if you make Mr. Oh cry,

273
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,690
I swear I'll kill you myself.

274
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,360
You're such a romantic.

275
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,990
Don't mock me.

276
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,860
I'm on edge right now.

277
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,940
I still think
you're not good enough for him.

278
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,640
But...

279
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,870
he likes you,

280
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,110
so I'll be cool about it.

281
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:09,950
Also,

282
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,080
don't ever take off the mask...

283
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,020
you're wearing.

284
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,090
You're pretending to be kind,
sweet, and demure.

285
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,530
Make Mr. Oh think that forever.

286
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:26,200
He dumped you,

287
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,730
and you're still worried about him.

288
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,440
You must've really liked him.

289
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,370
I did.

290
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,540
I'm not fake like someone else.

291
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,950
Can I really...

292
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,690
keep my business?

293
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,990
I don't go back on what I say.

294
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,900
Promise me one thing.

295
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,630
That you will never break...

296
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:06,140
Mr. Oh's heart.

297
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,570
Mr. Oh is mine now.

298
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,280
Why would you worry about him?

299
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,620
Okay, fine. I promise.

300
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,260
Look who's here.

301
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,490
You're Eun Seo, aren't you?

302
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,460
Ms. Ji the hairdresser.

303
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,830
Why are you here?

304
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,110
Is...

305
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,410
your mom...

306
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,950
Ms. Kim.

307
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,210
Eun Seo has to see the eye doctor...

308
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,120
after her lesson,

309
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,350
so I came with her.

310
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,920
I see. I'm glad you did.

311
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,820
Go to that room...

312
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,020
and practice
what you learned last time.

313
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,830
I'll be with you right away.

314
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,890
Come along, Eun Seo.

315
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,370
Eun Seo...

316
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,110
Do you teach her?

317
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,980
Yes.

318
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,610
Why?

319
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,280
It's nothing.

320
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,760
(Angel Piano)

321
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,560
Did I jump to conclusions?

322
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,510
Don't be like me.

323
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,040
Fight while you can...

324
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,480
and cling while you can.

325
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,350
Don't regret it later on.

326
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,620
Okay?

327
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,630
Why did you want to meet here?

328
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,800
I thought we should talk
somewhere quiet.

329
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,600
I got us a suite.

330
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,340
You can't do this
without asking me first.

331
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,400
I feel uncomfortable
talking in a cafe...

332
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,540
where others can hear us.

333
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,380
Let's have a beer
in peace and quiet...

334
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:27,780
without getting worked up...

335
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,810
and talk things out.

336
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:31,780
For one last time.

337
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:34,490
For one last time?

338
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,850
Yes.

339
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,490
For one last time.

340
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,390
We can't just fight forever.

341
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,660
We must reach a conclusion.

342
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,170
Okay.

343
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,920
We legally waived the right
to any inheritance,

344
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,520
so we have no right to make demands.

345
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,260
If we were to gain anything
from the brewery,

346
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,590
we'd have to rely on
Kwang Sook's goodwill.

347
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:20,330
We can't have you
stirring things up.

348
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,270
You sold the apartment in secret...

349
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,100
then waived the rights
to the brewery in secret.

350
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,740
What does that make me
and Yeoung Ju?

351
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,610
This is why I can't trust you.

352
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,040
I'm still competent.

353
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,610
I can make a comeback
so you don't worry.

354
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,450
I'll do my best to educate Yeoung Ju
in the best environment ever.

355
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,490
So...

356
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,890
let's not do this. Please?

357
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,890
Why are you being so sleazy?

358
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,530
One more time.

359
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,460
Trust me and wait.

360
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,200
You managed this far, didn't you?

361
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,740
What are you doing?

362
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,640
We're married,

363
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,180
but this is still a sex crime
in the US.

364
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,280
What?

365
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,420
To be honest,

366
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,890
I can't stand being
in a closed space with you.

367
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,790
The sound of your breathing.

368
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,600
Your smell.

369
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,660
I don't like it.

370
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,230
Why the sudden change?

371
00:20:32,170 --> 00:20:33,170
Why?

372
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,240
Are you seeing someone?

373
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,480
Why would you suddenly
bring that up?

374
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,380
Then why are you being like this?

375
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,920
Does one need a reason
to dislike someone?

376
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,360
We just don't click, that's all.

377
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,460
The way we view life
and our principles...

378
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:57,230
We're hardly on the same page.

379
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,530
So rather than forcing...

380
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,800
an incompatible relationship
to work,

381
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,140
let's go our separate ways
and live comfortably.

382
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,300
You only care about
what's comfortable for you.

383
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:09,810
Let's say I showed up
out of the blue demanding a divorce.

384
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:12,980
Would you be quick to agree to that?

385
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,680
I'm so sick of this!

386
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,580
How is it...

387
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,420
that our conversation
keeps going in circles?

388
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,430
I'm leaving, so don't follow me out.

389
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,730
Honey.

390
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,040
I doubt you've been able
to shower properly where you live,

391
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,340
so take a bath.

392
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,280
You smell like...

393
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,280
that dingy place you're staying in.

394
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,490
Why waste good money?

395
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:36,790
Finally, I can breathe again.

396
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,400
When did you get here?

397
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,940
What?

398
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,410
Just a second ago.

399
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,780
Why are you back already?

400
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,050
Are you sure you met all three men?

401
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:58,420
Yes. I met all three men,

402
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,520
had tea, and talked to all of them.

403
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,690
I had a good time.

404
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,120
Hold on.

405
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,390
Did you part ways
without having a meal?

406
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,630
No one suggested we eat.

407
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,600
Not even one of them
asked you to eat?

408
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,110
What about the second date?
When will you be seeing them again?

409
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:29,010
Not even one of them asked you on...

410
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,410
a second date?

411
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,620
Hey!

412
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,290
Ma Kwang Sook.

413
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,990
How can you sit there and eat?

414
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,590
You startled me, Mom.

415
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:46,500
You met not 1, not 2, but 3 men.

416
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,270
How come none of them
asked you out again?

417
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,270
How can you not achieve
a batting average of 0.3?

418
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:53,000
A batting average of 0.3 can only be
achieved by a skilled batter.

419
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,340
Realistically speaking,
that's impossible at my age.

420
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,640
You have an answer for everything,
don't you?

421
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:03,050
Stick your nose in the bowl already.

422
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,780
Do it. Now!

423
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,480
Deeper!

424
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,800
A blind date?

425
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,290
How could she meet with three men
at the same exact place?

426
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,730
I guess it's not my concern.

427
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,760
Goodness.

428
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,240
Ha Ni, here you go.

429
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,040
Look at you eat.

430
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,280
Is it delicious?

431
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,550
Does it taste better
when you're eating it with me?

432
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,460
Hey, Mom.

433
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,360
Where else would I be...

434
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,230
but the university?

435
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,570
How can you still be there?

436
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,540
Gyeol will be here any minute.

437
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,740
All right. I'll head out right now.

438
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:39,580
I heard you the first time.

439
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,220
Ha Ni, you'll have to stop snacking
and go to your dad.

440
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,830
Isn't it great
to be on a date with me?

441
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,130
I'd love to enjoy tasty things
with you every day...

442
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,900
and go on walks.

443
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:09,010
That would be amazing.

444
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,580
Oh, dear.

445
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:34,430
Hey. Are you and Ha Ni having fun?

446
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,870
Professor, what do I do?

447
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,640
Why? What is it?

448
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,940
Ha Ni just threw up and is wailing.

449
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,640
She was fine a second ago.

450
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,610
I don't know what's happening.

451
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,820
Where are you right now?
I'll come to you.

452
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,770
- Professor.
- Hey, Ha Ni.

453
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,310
Hey, there. Let's see.

454
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,750
She has a fever.
I should take her to the doctor.

455
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,610
Gosh, Ha Ni. I got you.

456
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,850
I get it. Does it hurt a lot?

457
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,550
I'll rush you to the doctor.

458
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,360
I can go by myself,
so don't worry and head home.

459
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:41,630
How can I go home
when Ha Ni's so sick? I can't.

460
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,230
I found a pediatrician
who's taking patients today.

461
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,500
This is the closest one.

462
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,970
Come on. Step on it.

463
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,110
Hurry.

464
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,780
Ha Ni, hang in there, okay?

465
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,250
Have you been well?

466
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,920
It's been a while.

467
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,290
I'm sorry
I haven't been around often.

468
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,060
When Jinhae's so far away?

469
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,330
We're grateful
you made the time today.

470
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:11,930
Mother, these are for you.

471
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,630
Goodness.

472
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,030
These are calla lilies.

473
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,470
They are my favorite.

474
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,970
- They smell wonderful. Thank you.
- It's okay.

475
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,270
Anyway, where's Se Ri?

476
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,080
She went to her university
for urgent business...

477
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,410
and should be back soon.

478
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,650
I heard she was a TA.

479
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,780
It must keep her busy
on weekends too.

480
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,820
You know how hardworking Se Ri is.

481
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,720
- Well, let's continue this seated.
- Sure.

482
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,860
I'll bring us some tea.

483
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,850
Why isn't she picking up?

484
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:06,620
(Sesim Pediatric Clinic)

485
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,920
You take patients, right?

486
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,350
What's wrong with the baby?

487
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,620
She was fine a minute ago,

488
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,690
but now she has a fever
and is throwing up.

489
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,690
I'll need her name
and date of birth.

490
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,800
Her name is Oh Ha Ni,
and her date of birth is...

491
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,170
What was it again?

492
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,070
It's April 13, 2024.

493
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,670
Let me take her temperature first.

494
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,370
This won't take long.

495
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,180
It's okay.

496
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,450
It's 38.5℃.

497
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,950
Did you say 38.5℃?

498
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,850
Isn't that really high?

499
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,990
Oh, no.

500
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,020
- Please wait over there.
- Okay.

501
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:48,060
Why are you telling us to wait
when she has a bad fever?

502
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,630
This is an emergency.

503
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,960
You need to calm down
Ha Ni's mother first.

504
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Pardon?

505
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,170
She seems more shocked
than Ha Ni is.

506
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,250
Hi.

507
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,350
You're here.

508
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,120
You must be tired
from teaching the kids.

509
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:18,890
This is what I do.

510
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,430
Oh, right. Ms. Ji was here.

511
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,430
What?

512
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,800
That woman is really unbelievable.

513
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,000
Did she make a scene again?

514
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,170
No.

515
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:32,170
She said she'd extend the lease.

516
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,840
- Really?
- Yes.

517
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:36,170
And she said
that she would give up on you.

518
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,540
She also said she would kill me...

519
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,380
if I made you cry.

520
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,750
How nosy.

521
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:44,950
She has nothing to worry about.

522
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,320
Hey.

523
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,590
Stop it.

524
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,470
Hey, are you ill?

525
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,700
Hey.

526
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,970
No, I'm not.

527
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,540
I was tired,
so I was getting some rest.

528
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,550
- Do you want to get your hair done?
- No.

529
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:16,810
You didn't come to the class today.

530
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,980
So I'm stopping by to see
if you're okay.

531
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,890
I'll quit the Zumba class.

532
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,620
Why?

533
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:26,860
It's not fun anymore.

534
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,490
It's somewhat tiresome.

535
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,230
Come on. You made such a fuss
about how fun it was.

536
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,800
And you had a change of heart?

537
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,700
How fickle you are.

538
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:37,870
Are you going somewhere?

539
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:40,900
Yes. I'm on my way to visit Ms. Oh
at the hospital.

540
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,240
Is Ms. Oh sick?

541
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,840
I told you before.

542
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,710
She caught her husband
having an affair...

543
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,320
and passed out after seeing
what she wasn't supposed to see.

544
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,820
She's in the hospital now.

545
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,250
I feel bad for Ms. Oh.

546
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
By the way,

547
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,800
how did she catch her husband
having an affair?

548
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,440
She hired a private detective.

549
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,940
A detective?

(Choi Sherlock Detective Agency)

551
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,310
Excuse me.

00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,010
Are you the detective...

553
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:26,480
who handled the case
of Oh Mi Ja from Smile Jokbal?

554
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,550
Yes, I am.

555
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,020
I took care of the case
in three days...

556
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,390
after Ms. Oh...

557
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,160
hired me.

558
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,060
Were you that fast?

559
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,330
I am a regular member
of the Detective Association...

560
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,800
approved
by the National Police Agency.

561
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,970
I have about 15 years of experience
working in an investigative agency.

562
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,280
I came to the right person!

563
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,150
Please help me, Detective.

564
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,850
Ha Ni, don't be sick.

565
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,160
You have to promise me.

566
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,360
Promise. Okay?

567
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,960
Get in. I'll drive you home.

568
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,730
It's okay. I'll take a taxi.

569
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,230
I'll drop you off on my way.

570
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,540
You should work on your report.

571
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,500
Just go.

572
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:25,310
Thank you for today.

573
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,740
Please get home safely.

574
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,290
Hi, Mom.

575
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,200
Where on earth are you
and what are you doing?

576
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,970
Gyeol has been waiting for you.

577
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,530
I'm on my way home.

578
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:53,700
I'm leaving now.

579
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,610
What took you so long?

580
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,510
I'm sorry. Something came up.

581
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,620
Where's Gyeol?

582
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,950
He's having a meal with your dad.

583
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:07,950
Let's go.

584
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,350
Okay.

585
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,590
I'm home.

586
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,890
What took you so long?

587
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,830
Hi, Gyeol.

588
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,130
I guess you're busy with work.

589
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:20,260
It's the beginning of the semester,
so I have a lot of work to do.

590
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:23,600
What kind of professor
makes you work on weekends?

591
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,840
It's not that the professor
made me work.

592
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,070
I volunteered.

593
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,810
It's good that she does her best
in everything.

594
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,280
Come and have a seat.
You must be hungry.

595
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,280
Okay.

596
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,080
Thanks.

597
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,420
Have you been doing well?

598
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,920
What? I've been pretty fine.

599
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,230
You must be tired
from coming all the way here.

600
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,200
No, I'm not tired at all.

601
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,830
(Eagle Brewery)

602
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,280
Hello? Ma Kwang Sook speaking.

603
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,050
Kwang Sook, it's me.

604
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:16,020
Who is this?

605
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,190
I'm Park Sang Nam.
We met earlier today.

606
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:24,590
Oh, you are the Macho Man,
Park Sang Nam.

607
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:28,560
What are you calling about?

608
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,800
I'm calling you to check
if you got home safely.

609
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,810
Yes. I got home safely.

610
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,980
I was really happy to see you today.

611
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,880
I hope we can continue
our beautiful relationship.

612
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:47,280
As I told you earlier,

613
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,020
I have a major surgery ahead...

614
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,290
I'd like you to share...

615
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,260
your pain with me.

616
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,290
No.

617
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,330
I have no intention
of sharing it at all.

618
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,200
Once you see my sincerity,

619
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,670
you'll want to share it with me.

620
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,600
- Well...
- This is enough for today.

621
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,310
I'll call you again tomorrow.

622
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,610
Have a nice day.

623
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,880
Hello?

624
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,310
Hello...

625
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:18,450
What was that?

626
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,750
I thought I said enough
to make him understand.

627
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,790
"I'd like you to share your pain..."

628
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,060
I'm home.

629
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,830
- You're here.
- It's been a while.

630
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,330
Dad, I'm home.

631
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,570
Hey. Were you at Se Ri's place?

632
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,570
Yes.

633
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,740
I met her parents...

634
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,800
and had a meal with them.

635
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,340
I see.

636
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:47,810
By the way, do you have any problem?

637
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,180
No. Why?

638
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,620
You spent all day in the study
listening to music.

639
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,990
I was just tired,
so I wanted to rest my mind.

640
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,690
Are Se Ri's parents doing well?

641
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,690
Yes.

642
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,060
Her father seems to be busy
with work.

643
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:06,830
He says he's planning to introduce
a premium organic makgeolli.

644
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,070
I heard.

645
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,330
Oh, right.

646
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,840
Bom, do you want
to go on a blind date?

647
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,740
- A blind date?
- Yes.

648
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,410
There's a friend of mine
who's really nice.

649
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:18,870
I think you two will get along well.

650
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,680
No, I'm fine.

651
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,650
What do you mean?

652
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,110
Is there someone you like?

653
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,320
Or is it that you're not interested
in dating?

654
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,920
I'm not interested in a blind date.

655
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:36,160
Well... About a blind date.

656
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:39,900
Is it possible
you go on blind dates...

657
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,030
with 3 different partners
3 times on the same day...

658
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,440
and at the same place?

659
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,370
- Three times?
- Three times?

660
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,640
Three times.

661
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:50,870
Come on.

662
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,310
- That's too much.
- That's too much.

663
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:54,240
Do you also find it too much?

664
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,110
That's not normal, right?

665
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:59,050
So who went on three blind dates?

666
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,850
Is it someone you know?

667
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,080
Yes.

668
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:03,890
What?

669
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,990
No. It's not someone
I know personally.

670
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,290
I just heard it.

671
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,610
Hello?

672
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:25,540
It's me, Professor.

673
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,410
I'm calling
because I'm worried about Ha Ni.

674
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,350
Hang on.

675
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,060
Actually, I was going to call you.

676
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:45,130
She got better
after taking medicine. Don't worry.

677
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:46,500
I'm glad to hear that.

678
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,470
I felt like Ha Ni fell sick
because of me, so I was worried.

679
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,900
It's not your fault.

680
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,340
Why do you keep saying that?

681
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,740
Still, I should've taken better care
of her.

682
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,610
Thanks to you, I was able
to find a clinic that was open...

683
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,140
and work on my report.

684
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:03,880
Thank you for today.

685
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,090
I'm grateful that you say that.

686
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,290
Okay. Bye.

687
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,230
Do you know
how anxious I was earlier?

688
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:24,530
Gyeol already arrived,
but you didn't even take my calls.

689
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,840
Why did you not answer the phone?

690
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,140
I had something to take care of.

691
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,870
What was that?

692
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,370
Something in the department.

693
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,240
Are you the only teaching assistant
in your department?

694
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,850
Why do you take care of everything
all by yourself?

695
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:39,050
Why should I fit my schedule
around Gyeol?

696
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,950
I have a life too.

697
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:41,980
A life?

698
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:44,520
You have a life I don't know about?

699
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,760
It's a figure of speech.

700
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,800
You're acting suspiciously.

701
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,300
What do you mean?

702
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,700
You have lots more secrets.

703
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,770
You're hiding something from me,
aren't you?

704
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,440
I'm not.

705
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,640
I'm going to sleep.
Turn the light off on your way out.

706
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,640
(Chun Soo)

707
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,940
Hello?

708
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,910
Chun Soo. It's me.

709
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,380
I didn't wake you, did I?

710
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,390
No.

711
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:53,090
I called out of concern.

712
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:58,160
Did you talk things out
with your wife?

713
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,130
I don't think it'll work out.

714
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,170
What does that mean?

715
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:12,270
She flew in
determined to end it with me.

716
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:17,110
The sound of my breathing. My smell.

717
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,550
Everything related to me.

718
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,350
She hates it all.

719
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,920
Why on earth...

720
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,960
Why does she feel that way?

721
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,130
Do you need a reason
to dislike someone?

722
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,870
We're just not a good match.

723
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,570
So...

724
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,510
what will you do now?

725
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,510
If that's how she feels,

726
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:54,020
I should give her a divorce.

727
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,090
The thing is,

728
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,930
I don't know...

729
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,430
what to tell Yeoung Ju.

730
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,500
She's still young.

731
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:14,300
Thinking about
how this will hurt her...

732
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,710
breaks my heart.

733
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,350
They say kids break
their parents' hearts as they grow,

734
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:28,220
but no parent
should upset their kid.

735
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,590
Forget about Yeoung Ju for now...

736
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,490
and focus on getting through it.

737
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:42,430
Think only about yourself
for a while, okay?

738
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:45,600
Jang Soo...

739
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,710
I miss him.

740
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,480
On a day like this,

741
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,420
if he were here,

742
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,220
maybe I'd feel a bit better.

743
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,590
I miss...

744
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:17,070
Jang Soo so much.

745
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:25,340
I want to see him so badly.

746
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:32,050
Tell me everything
you'd like to tell him.

747
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,580
Toothless people
chew with their gums.

748
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,420
Your brother's gone,
but you have me instead.

749
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,630
Bottling it up will make you ill.

750
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:49,770
Everything that upset you
and everything you found unfair.

751
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,030
Tell me everything.

752
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,670
I'll listen all night long.

753
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,150
Thank you.

754
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,290
Thank you, Kwang Sook.

755
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,660
Thank you...

756
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,510
Good for you.

757
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,050
Cry as loudly
and as long as you want.

758
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:51,860
If you wail long enough,

759
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,700
your mind will clear,
and you'll feel better.

760
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:41,640
(Eagle Brewery)

761
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:08,270
Mi Sun.

762
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,580
Is...

763
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,480
something wrong?

764
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:22,520
My stepmom favors her kid over me.

765
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,720
She won't even hear what I say.

766
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,220
She told me to just apologize.

767
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,690
You must be so upset.

768
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,170
I want to grow up fast...

769
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:41,270
and live in a world
where she doesn't exist.

770
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,240
Shall I cheer you up?

771
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:06,730
This is dried draff.

772
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:09,030
It's delicious with sugar.

773
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,270
It cheers you up too.

774
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:20,910
It won't make me drunk, will it?

775
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,010
The alcohol evaporated long ago.

776
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:24,510
You needn't worry.

777
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,350
How is it?

778
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:33,820
It's sweet.

779
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,390
I like it.

780
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:38,360
But...

781
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,300
it smells of alcohol
just a little bit.

782
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,300
It's just the smell.
You won't get drunk, so don't worry.

783
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:52,070
But...

784
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,080
I think I feel better already.

785
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:58,610
Right? I told you so.

786
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:26,280
(Eagle Brewery)

787
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:30,980
It's been so long
since we gathered to eat together.

788
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,820
Will you meet Se Ri again today?

789
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,320
No, because she's
coming down with a cold.

790
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:40,620
I thought I'd call Lieutenant Oh
and get together...

791
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,490
before heading back.

792
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:45,090
Why would you meet him in Seoul?

793
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:46,600
He was discharged.

794
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:48,960
Lieutenant Oh was discharged?

795
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:50,670
Why would you tell me that now?

796
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,300
You never asked.

797
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:56,410
Lieutenant Oh?

798
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:00,510
I told you about him the other day.

799
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:02,140
He helped me in Jinhae.

800
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:05,280
Right. The naval officer
I should thank.

801
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:07,520
Have us gather sometime.

802
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:09,020
He kept her out of harm's way,

803
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,490
and I should thank him.

804
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,920
Got it.

805
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:28,970
(Mr. Han)

806
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:35,210
Victory.
Have you been well, Mr. Han?

807
00:49:37,310 --> 00:49:38,310
Today?

808
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:43,320
I'm afraid I have lunch plans
with a teacher of mine.

809
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,190
Right, of course.

810
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,720
Yes, I'm free next Thursday.

811
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,630
Sure.

812
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,190
In this day and age,

813
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:54,530
no one runs a business
only with the money they have.

814
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,700
You take out bank loans...

815
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,330
and borrow from others...

816
00:49:58,330 --> 00:49:59,770
I get that,

817
00:49:59,770 --> 00:50:02,140
but he was alarmed to find out
that she had a debt...

818
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,840
of five million dollars.

819
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,140
Five million dollars?

820
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,150
Yes, Dr. Oh.

821
00:50:10,350 --> 00:50:12,710
Your daughter must be one
with strong energy.

822
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,150
Strong energy?
What do you mean by that?

823
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:26,900
You, Ma Kwang Sook!

824
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,470
What now, Mom?

825
00:50:40,010 --> 00:50:43,150
Are you really
going to play dirty like this?

826
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:45,680
What are you talking about?

827
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:48,750
You told those men that you had
a debt of five million dollars...

828
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:50,390
and that your strong energy...

829
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:52,150
could kill your husband.

830
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,360
You practically threatened them.

831
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,000
I should've known...

832
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,370
when you easily agreed
to the blind date.

833
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:06,840
You put them off...

834
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,070
so that they'd lose interest in you!

835
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:15,010
Ms. Gong, of course.

836
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:18,250
Nothing...

837
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:21,280
gets past you.

838
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,250
You darn brat.

839
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:28,260
I can't believe
I had seaweed soup to recover...

840
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,390
after having you.

841
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:31,460
You deserve a beating.

842
00:51:32,330 --> 00:51:35,400
Why you... Unbelievable.

843
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:36,600
That hurts.

844
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:38,570
Can you actually feel the pain?

845
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:54,750

846
00:51:54,750 --> 00:51:56,080
Greetings, Kwang Sook.

848
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,890
What brings you here?

849
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,430
I was hoping to take you out
on a date.

850
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,500
A date?

851
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:08,630
Yes.

852
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,130
Greetings, Mother.

853
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:14,200
Kwang Sook and I
had a blind date yesterday.

854
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,770
I'm Park Sang Nam.

855
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,610
Which one?

856
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:25,610
Goodness.
It's a pleasure, Number Three...

857
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,380
Wait. I meant, Sang Nam.

858
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:33,190
I was wondering
who Kwang Sook got her beauty from,

859
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:35,490
but she's the spitting image of you.

860
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:39,390
Goodness me. Aren't you a charmer?

861
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,900
Let's not do this out here
and head inside.

862
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,930
We'll talk more over tea.

863
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,170
Can I take a rain check on that?

864
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:49,940
I'll officially greet you
some other time.

865
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,410
Today, I was hoping
to take Kwang Sook out on a date.

866
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,210
Really? Go ahead, then.

867
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,450
Shall we, Kwang Sook?

868
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:01,350
Hold on.
How can you do this to me...

869
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:02,950
without asking me first?

870
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:04,920
I'm busy at the brewery.

871
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:05,920
Also...

872
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,160
Go on this date,

873
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:11,990
or I'll pack up Kang Soo's things
and kick him out.

874
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,000
Must you play dirty?

875
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,830
I won't play dirty anymore
after this,

876
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:18,130
so do this for your mother.

877
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,530
Go on a date with him.

878
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:22,970
Shall we?

879
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,640
Get going.

880
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,550
Watch your step.

881
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,120
All right.

882
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,420
We'll get going, Mother!

883
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,190
Look how friendly he is.

884
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,620
Have a great time.

885
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:43,990
Sure!

886
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:52,530
By the way, where are we going?

887
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:57,010
I wanted to show you who I was...

888
00:53:57,010 --> 00:53:58,840
and what I did.

889
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,110
Would you believe me...

890
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:03,680
if I only told you in words...

891
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,910
what a decent guy I am?

892
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:08,920
You should see who I am
for yourself and decide.

893
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:12,350
I was working...

894
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,660
and don't have a lot of time.

895
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,190
An hour will do.

(LX Fashion, Lessons for the VIP)

897
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:30,710
You're here early, sir.

898
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:32,840
I thought I'd warm up
since I'm here.

899
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,140
It's been a while
since you golfed out on the field.

900
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:36,910
As if I had time to be out
on the grass.

901
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,610
How many VIP guests did we invite?

902
00:54:38,610 --> 00:54:39,910
Around 20, sir.

903
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,820
They requested a small group...

904
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,150
and a one-on-one lesson.

905
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,720
Sure.

906
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,790
I'll take that. Thank you.

907
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:48,790
Sure.

908
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:10,910
Why are we here?

909
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:14,480
I'll be giving a golf lesson...

910
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,280
to the VIP guests today.

911
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:19,120
I wanted you
to see me working hard...

912
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,520
and to teach you
how to play golf as well.

913
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,820
That's why I brought you here.

914
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:26,700
I already told you that...

915
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:27,730
Wait.

916
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:29,660
I understand you have
a serious surgery coming up,

917
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,230
but there won't be
any strenuous activities.

918
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:34,400
Also, these are golf clothes
and shoes for you to wear.

919
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,200
Those are for me?

920
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,910
Yes, I chose
the best-selling items at our store.

921
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:42,910
I have a keen eye for things,

922
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:43,950
so they'll fit you...

923
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:46,150
perfectly.

924
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:49,080
Please take them.

925
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:00,130
Goodness me.

926
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,030
You're using more strength
than usual.

927
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:07,770
I know.

928
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:10,540
It's been so long
that I can't get the hang of it.

929
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:15,310
(Premium driving range)

930
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:17,780
Hello, sir.

931
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:19,710
Goodness, Mr. Park.

932
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,280
Over here.

933
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,760
Sir, this is
pro golfer Park Sang Nam...

934
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,020
who's teaching the VIP guests today.

935
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,520
Is that so? What a pleasure.

936
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,390
It's good to meet you.

937
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:34,300
I'm grateful for this opportunity.

938
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:43,910
She's now with a different guy.

939
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,580
Could you be...

940
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,910
Yes?

941
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:52,680
Gosh, it's nothing.

942
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:56,820
Chairman Han will briefly be
attending the lesson too.

943
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,790
Having you there
might be a bit of a burden,

944
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,590
but I'll do my best.

945
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:04,430
I hope you'll do a good job.

946
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:05,460
Sure.

947
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,930
Sir, can you excuse me?

948
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,670
- I'll see you later.
- Sure.

949
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:12,470
I need to prepare for the class,
so I'll see you later.

950
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,540
Sure.

951
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:21,310
I think it's the guy from yesterday.

952
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,680
Hey.

953
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,680
I'm with Kwang Sook
at the driving range.

954
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:32,750
How could I let a Sunday
go to waste?

955
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,290
Macho Man is my nickname, remember?

956
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:39,430
I should take full advantage
when the opportunity arises.

957
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:43,200
I'll call you back later. Sure.

958
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,200
I was right.

959
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:56,910
My gosh.

960
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:00,450
What did I tell you
about my keen eyes?

961
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:02,080
They suit you well.

962
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:03,550
Look.

963
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,750
To be honest, I don't have
the luxury of playing golf,

964
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,490
nor do I feel like doing so.

965
00:58:10,690 --> 00:58:11,860
What are you doing?

966
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:15,030
Your laces are untied.

967
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,430
It's fine. I'll do it myself.

968
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:20,300
Allow me.

969
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,250
Goodness.

970
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:37,190
Stand with your feet
shoulder-width apart.

971
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:40,220
Keep your spine straight...

972
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,160
and lean slightly forward. Yes.

973
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:46,290
And can you stick your bottom out
a bit more?

974
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:48,300
Yes, that's it. And then...

975
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,430
Leave it. I'll take it from here.

976
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,740
Okay. Have a go.

977
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:12,820
My gosh.

978
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:14,420
What a good shot.

979
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:18,790
Did you play golf regularly?

980
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:20,960
Sometimes, before I was married.

981
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,370
It feels good to whack a ball
after a while.

982
00:59:24,930 --> 00:59:26,300
What is that woman?

983
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:30,540
- Oh, gosh.
- My word!

984
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:32,540
Nice one!

985
00:59:33,510 --> 00:59:34,980
Good shot.

986
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,180
Goodness.

987
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,810
Hello.

988
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:42,850
I'm Park Sang Nam,
the professional golfer...

989
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:44,620
who'll give you some tips today.

990
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:45,690
Nice to meet you.

991
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:52,960
Before we kick off the event,
I'd like to show you...

992
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,430
how I hit the ball.

993
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,770
First, you check the target.

994
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,100
Make sure your club...

995
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:05,140
and shoulders are aligned
with the target.

996
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:06,540
Check your grip...

997
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:09,240
with your feet shoulder-width apart.

998
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:10,810
The takeaway.

999
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,110
Top of the backswing.

1000
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:16,020
- Good shot.
- Well done.

1001
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:17,850
Nicely done.

1002
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:22,290
Can you all go outside...

1003
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:25,490
and get ready
so I can give you personal tips?

1004
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:26,660
Let's go.

1005
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:29,400
Who's next?

1006
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:31,500
Okay.

1007
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,330
Address the ball.

1008
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,400
That's a great grip.

1009
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:36,940
I see your shoulders...

1010
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:39,170
are leaning to the left.

1011
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:42,980
Straighten up so the ball
aligns with your left armpit...

1012
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:45,410
and slowly move into the backswing.

1013
01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:46,410
Okay.

1014
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:49,650
One, two.

1015
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:53,090
What a good shot.

1016
01:00:53,990 --> 01:00:55,090
Give her some applause.

1017
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,630
Take your seat.

1018
01:00:58,590 --> 01:01:01,130
The next person...

1019
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:04,470
Chairman Han. Why don't you come up?

1020
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:06,400
- Yes.
- No.

1021
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:10,270
It would be an honor
if you'd give me the chance...

1022
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,670
to give you some tips.

1023
01:01:11,970 --> 01:01:13,370
Why not give him some applause?

1024
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,420
I think we could learn...

1025
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:23,350
how to use a driver
with Chairman Han.

1026
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:25,790
Here you go.

1027
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:29,190
Address the ball.

1028
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,590
Nice grip.

1029
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:32,590
Yes, relax your shoulders.

1030
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:35,160
You have a great posture. Okay.

1031
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,960
The takeaway.

1032
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,140
One,

1033
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:43,870
two.

1034
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:29,440
(We thank Kim Hyeong Mook...)

1035
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,750
(and Lee Yoon Seok
for their special appearances.)

1036
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:34,120
(For Eagle Brothers)

1037
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,820
It's been three years,
and you're telling me now?

1038
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:38,990
Shouldn't you have told me sooner?

1039
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:41,290
Don't move too fast too soon.

1040
01:03:41,290 --> 01:03:42,820
Take your time, Heung Soo.

1041
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:45,860
Why? Do you not like Seon Ah,
Kwang Sook?

1042
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:48,360
How much younger than me are you
to act like you're so young?

1043
01:03:48,430 --> 01:03:50,030
You call me "Mother" all the time.

1044
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:51,300
Did I give birth to you?

1045
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:53,400
I get that she's a mess,

1046
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:55,770
but how could she do that
with a man...

1047
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:57,070
at a hotel she supplies?

1048
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:58,740
You care about being dignified,

1049
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:00,740
and you're being called
a gold digger?

1050
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:02,010
Did you say a gold digger?

1051
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:03,510
"A gold digger?"
