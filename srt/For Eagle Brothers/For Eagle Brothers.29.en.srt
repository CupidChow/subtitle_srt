00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,810
(Eagle Brewery)

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,110
(Episode 29)

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,780
National stretch, go!

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,050
One, two

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,790
Three, four

6
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:15,190
Five, six

7
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,820
Seven, eight

8
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,190
Isn't this a little outdated?

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,290
There are plenty of new exercises
we can try.

10
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,160
Where's your sense of style?

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,200
We at Eagle Brewery
embrace retro style...

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,000
and honor tradition.

13
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,740
What good would it do
to only follow what's trending?

14
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,610
Heung Soo's right, you know.

15
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,680
This feels right at home.

16
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,550
What do you think, Kwang Sook?

17
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,980
I quite like this as well.

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,750
If you keep complaining,

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,520
I'll make you all do Zumba instead.

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,390
Who does Zumba in the morning?

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,100
That's for the instructor to decide.

22
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:01,770
It sure feels nice...

23
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,040
to be together again...

24
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,740
and kick off the morning
with exercise.

25
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,410
This reminds me of the old days.

26
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,110
We owe it all to Kwang Sook.

27
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,480
Kwang Sook, thank you.

28
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,850
I'm the one who's more grateful.

29
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,090
Thanks to you,
I was able to keep the brewery open.

30
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,330
Stop the chitchat
and concentrate on the workout.

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:32,400
Mic check.

32
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,670
Mrs. Gong says
the soup is getting cold,

33
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,240
so you all need
to hurry back inside.

34
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:38,900
You guys must be hungry,

35
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,110
so head inside
and fill your stomachs.

36
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,840
- Let's go.
- Let's go, guys.

37
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,380
- Kang Soo, help them.
- Sure thing.

38
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,550
I'll take that.

39
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,600
Welcome, Mr. Go.

40
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,970
I didn't prepare a lot,
but join us for breakfast.

41
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,200
Thank you for inviting me
to breakfast, Mrs. Gong.

42
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,040
Hold on.
You should sit here instead.

43
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,950
Sure.

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,120
Why are you all standing there?
Take your seats.

45
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,280
Okay.

46
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:31,490
Can you believe it? It's galbitang.

47
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,120
I only had cereal for breakfast,

48
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,390
but now I'm being treated to luxury,
thanks to you, Ms. Gong.

49
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,530
There was a mix-up with the bowls.

50
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,260
- Sorry?
- Let me see.

51
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,570
- What?
- Take this one.

52
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,300
- Go ahead.
- I see.

53
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,840
But the meat...

54
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,150
Why aren't you digging in?

55
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,320
Right.

56
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
I'll enjoy it.

57
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,490
I'll enjoy it too.

58
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,360
What a rich broth.

59
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,900
The meat is tender too.

60
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,060
I made an entire pot,

61
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,500
so feel free to have more.

62
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:31,720
That reminds me. How's Mi Sun?

63
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,720
She's fully recovered,
so there's no need to worry now.

64
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,020
Did you make your move
without looking back?

65
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,390
I didn't hear you denying it.

66
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,100
Save the comments
and eat your breakfast.

67
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,430
Sure.

68
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,110
You know...

69
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,180
who sent us these short ribs, right?

70
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,710
I'll do the giving,

71
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,880
so you just have to receive.

72
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,990
Call him to let him know
you enjoyed it.

73
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,720
Answer me!

74
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:28,040
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

75
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,310
I'm curious, sir.

76
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,080
Is tomorrow a special day?

77
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,540
What?

78
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,410
The day is marked as D-Day
on your calendar.

79
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:38,850
I've been meaning to ask.

80
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,290
I'll tell you about it
when I get the chance.

81
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,520
Of course, sir.

82
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,360
By the way, about Eagle Brewery...

83
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,460
Yes, sir?

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,230
Now that the misunderstandings
are cleared up,

85
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,030
shouldn't the hotel resume...

86
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:57,600
serving Jang-Kwang Makgeolli?

87
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,010
Given that most of our guests
are foreigners,

88
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,440
they should have fewer reservations
about it.

89
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,710
What do you think?

90
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,710
Of course. I'll contact
Eagle Brewery right away...

91
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,450
and place a delivery order.

92
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,180
By the way,
your schedule for today...

93
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,250
Wait.

94
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,190
If it's not an important event,

95
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,960
let's postpone today's plans.

96
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,590
I see.

97
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,500
Do you have something else
to take care of?

98
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,600
It's a personal matter...

99
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,430
that means a lot to me.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,200
How was it?

101
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,700
Was there any discomfort
or difficulty moving?

102
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,640
Not at all. It fit me like a glove.

103
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,310
I'm glad to hear it was a good fit.

104
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,010
It must've been hard work
meeting the close deadline.

105
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,980
My team had to stay up
for a few nights.

106
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,790
You asked me to fit you
for a new suit in such a short time.

107
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,460
You must have an important event.

108
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,330
It's something special
that means a lot to me.

109
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,870
I wanted to wear a new suit.

110
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,670
I see.

111
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,340
I expect some great news
thanks to your hard work.

112
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,620
It's made
with the best-quality leather...

113
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,550
used by the Italian brand Zantoni
that's soft but durable.

114
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,420
It's brand-new but won't feel new.

115
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,290
That's how comfortable it is.

116
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,000
What do you think? Do you like it?

117
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:10,000
It came out just as I hoped.
I like it.

118
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm pleased to hear that.

119
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,570
You didn't give us
much time this time.

120
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:17,240
Do you have an important meeting?

121
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,650
It's a very important meeting,

122
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,820
and I wanted to wear a pair
I'd never worn before.

123
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,940
Welcome.

124
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,040
My goodness.
You look amazing, Chairman Han.

125
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,350
I should've dressed up too.

126
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,680
I was working.

127
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,490
It happens when you're busy.
Don't mind that.

128
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,290
I look...

129
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:06,090
really shabby compared to you.

130
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,600
Turn the car around.

131
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,710
Pardon?

132
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,410
Yes, sir.

133
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:37,690
I chose a few outfits
based on the details you gave me.

134
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,590
Thank you.

135
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,590
It has been so long
since you came by.

136
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,660
I had no reason to come here
after my wife died.

137
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,330
Bom shops here about twice a year,

138
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:52,640
and she told me about you.

139
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,910
It doesn't look like
you're shopping for her.

140
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,280
I'm shopping for a gift.

141
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,350
I'll take this one.

142
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,480
You chose wisely, sir.

143
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,460
- Chun Soo.
- Kwang Sook.

144
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,670
Hello, Mr. Park. How are you?

145
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,270
I'm doing well.
We haven't talked in a while.

146
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,110
How is business these days?

147
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,280
Customers react swiftly
to bad news...

148
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:38,220
and sluggishly to good news.

149
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,790
It'll take a while
to get back on track.

150
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,090
I have the chairman's order
to receive a shipment...

151
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,820
of Jang-Kwang Makgeolli
and resume sales.

152
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,660
You do?

153
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,160
Okay.

154
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,230
We'll make it with care
and bring it over.

155
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,970
Thank you.

156
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,640
LX Hotel wants a shipment?

157
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,810
Yes. The chairman gave an order.

158
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,110
He found us a route to export...

159
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:08,610
and will sell our makgeolli again.

160
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,320
He cares about us a great deal.

161
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:15,750
He does.

162
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,030
It has been a while
since I smelled cooked rice.

163
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,170
It has. I'd been itching to work.

164
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,510
This feels great.

165
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,040
Mr. Go and Kim stayed loyal...

166
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,410
and guarded our brewery,

167
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,910
and my brothers-in-law
all chipped in,

168
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:42,250
and we repaid the bank.

169
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,880
I think I'm lucky and blessed.

170
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,250
Shouldn't we
throw a party to celebrate?

171
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,920
We'll be too busy
making makgeolli today.

172
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,090
How about tomorrow?

173
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,590
Not tomorrow.

174
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,890
It's D-Day.

175
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,100
- "D-Day?"
- "D-Day?"

176
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,300
Oh, no.

177
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,440
It's nothing.
I was talking to myself.

178
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:12,410
Let's keep working.

179
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,350
Sales dropped by 30 percent?

180
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:25,720
Yes.
People are boycotting us online,

181
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,890
and most media outlets
are criticizing us.

182
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,830
Why won't the PR Team do their job?

183
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,030
Director Seo handled the press,
and since he left...

184
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,930
Don't mention him ever again!

185
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:39,600
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

186
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,940
This is why...

187
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,140
I didn't want to apologize
at a full-blown press conference.

188
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,310
I humiliated myself,

189
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:47,850
and sales still dropped.

190
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,810
What is this?

191
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,320
Darn it.

192
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,750
(Seoul DK Medical,
ENT and Internal Medicine)

193
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,290
You can't give up just like this.

194
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,730
All dating couples
go through a rough patch.

195
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,230
They drift apart then get closer.

196
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,900
That's what makes them stronger.

197
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,540
Se Ri's just immature.

198
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:14,510
Can't you turn a blind eye
and let it go?

199
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:16,940
If Se Ri were being immature,

200
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,340
then I'd try to convince her.

201
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,210
But it's not that.

202
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:25,220
Let's think of the worst case, then.

203
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,820
Wouldn't you mind at all...

204
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,890
if Se Ri were to marry
a single dad...

205
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,260
and raise someone else's child?

206
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,490
It would hurt, but what could I do?

207
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
I must accept it.

208
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,430
No. You shouldn't do that.

209
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,900
Everyone, married or not,
wavers once or twice in life.

210
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,240
That's when they need someone
to keep them on track.

211
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,170
If you give up and let go,

212
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,540
you're allowing someone
to ruin their life.

213
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:56,680
You're the only person
who can help Se Ri.

214
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,290
She regrets everything right now.

215
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:02,590
She's no longer
a teaching assistant.

216
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,320
Did you tell your father?

217
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,660
Not yet.

218
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,160
You haven't told him yet.

219
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,770
Good for you.

220
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,770
Se Ri has almost changed her mind.

221
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,110
You can marry her
in September as planned.

222
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,570
There will be no problem.

223
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,610
Come in.

224
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,320
Your patients are waiting, doctor.

225
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,920
Okay.

226
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,220
I have to see my patients.
I'm sorry, Mother.

227
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,860
Don't apologize.

228
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,190
I'm sorry
for keeping you from your work.

229
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,270
I promised.

230
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,670
I said I'd bring Se Ri back to you.

231
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:58,740
Will you trust me just this once?

232
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,250
Hello?

233
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,560
Where are you?

234
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,390
I'm at school for a lecture.

235
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,330
You don't need to study.
Come right home.

236
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,560
What do you mean?

237
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,000
Do as I say or you'll regret it.

238
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,430
Come home
before I turn really nasty.

239
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,170
I won't.

240
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,330
It's been a while.

241
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,340
I was worried
when you stopped coming to class.

242
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,510
Were you even worried about me?

243
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,420
I took Ha Ni
and moved into the brewery.

244
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,820
She has lots of uncles.

245
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,250
She has an aunt
and a grandma there too.

246
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,390
You don't have to
worry about her now.

247
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,400
Prepare for your wedding at ease.

248
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,340
I don't want to hear
such advice from you.

249
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,420
In this session,

250
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,690
we will analyze
revenue recognition...

251
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:51,990
for Baekje Air's
first-quarter performance...

252
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:54,290
from contract signing
to sales generation...

253
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,790
and cash collection.

254
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,700
We will analyze it, applying
the revenue recognition model...

255
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,340
according to the five stages...

256
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,100
of International Financial
Reporting Standards.

257
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,840
With a mileage program,

258
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,570
between the time
customers make a payment...

259
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,670
and the time
they receive the service,

260
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,540
there is a revenue period...

261
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,110
The mileage program provided...

262
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,680
by the airline company...

263
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,700
Mom.

264
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,640
- Mom?
- Is she her mom?

265
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,240
- What's going on?
- What is she doing here?

266
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,140
What is her mom doing here?

267
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:23,210
- What?
- What is she doing?

268
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,750
- What's going on?
- What?

269
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,090
What are you doing?

270
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,460
Get up this instant.

271
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,430
- Mom.
- Before I make a scene,

272
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,830
just get up!

273
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,500
It's also for the professor's sake.

274
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,450
I'm sorry
for interrupting your class.

275
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,100
Let go of me!

276
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,310
Have you lost your mind?

277
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,340
Yes.

278
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,440
I've lost my mind.
I'm not in my right mind.

279
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,880
When my precious daughter
fell for a divorced man with a kid,

280
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,020
what kind of mother
would be able to stay sane?

281
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,950
Still, you went too far.

282
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,050
How could you barge
into the classroom like that?

283
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,360
What were you going to do?

284
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,760
If you didn't do as I said,

285
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,990
I was going to embarrass him
in front of the students.

286
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
"That fool you call a professor..."

287
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,700
"seduced my daughter
and ruined her life!"

288
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,100
- Mom!
- Do you think I can't do that?

289
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,110
I didn't know
you were this low-class.

290
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,810
- "Low-class?"
- Yes.

291
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,910
I didn't know
you could be so pathetic.

292
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,520
You're the worst.

293
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,320
"Pathetic?"

294
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,290
Yes, you're pathetic.

295
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,490
I suddenly feel so embarrassed
about you.

296
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,230
Watch what you say!

297
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,660
Se Ri.

298
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,730
Dokgo Se Ri!

299
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:31,640
Welcome.

300
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,280
Hello. We're from the head office.

301
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,750
I already got a call
from the head office.

302
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,480
I'm Oh Kang Soo
from the Design Team.

303
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,090
I'm Han Bom. Nice to meet you.

304
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,190
Could you explain each section?

305
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,320
Sure.

306
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,490
This is the section
for women's clothing.

307
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,230
We have basic styling items
such as T-shirts and skirts...

308
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:53,360
in various colors.

309
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,200
How do customers like this product?

310
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,270
It is quite popular,

311
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,970
but this one is
the best-selling product these days.

312
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,340
They say it's neat
and comfortable to wear.

313
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,410
They say it is important...

314
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,680
to come to the store often
and check customer responses.

315
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,550
We should do this together
from time to time.

316
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,290
Okay.

317
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,000
I think it will look good on you.

318
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,640
You think?

319
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,210
What do you think?

320
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,210
You look nice.

321
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,320
I have something to say to you.

322
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:58,430
I didn't mean to hide it from you,

323
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,060
but I was so flustered that
I missed the chance to tell you.

324
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,130
What is it?

325
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,470
The man Se Ri has a crush on.

326
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,210
It's my older brother.

327
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:10,810
What?

328
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,440
He's Se Ri's professor.

329
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,480
When you came to my school,

330
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,080
you said
your brother went there too.

331
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:21,890
So he was a professor,
not a student.

332
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,620
Yes.

333
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,360
What a small world.

334
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,860
I know.

335
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,270
I was surprised when I found out
about it a few days ago.

336
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,440
I was worried
about who Se Ri was attracted to,

337
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,370
which made her act so unreasonably.

338
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,580
So it was your brother.

339
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,280
I feel bad for you and your brother.

340
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,590
It's not something
you should be sorry about.

341
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,260
My brother is almost over it now.

342
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,160
He regrets that he may've taken
marriage too lightly.

343
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,140
Welcome.

344
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,310
You're here.

345
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,540
What?

346
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,780
I told you not to clean.
I said I'd do it.

347
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,850
I already had the stitches
taken out. I'm fine.

348
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,120
You don't have to worry.

349
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,220
Even if you're fine, I'll do it.

350
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:32,160
While working at the brewery,

351
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,760
I'll come by whenever I can,
so don't do the cleaning.

352
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,590
Just do as I say.

353
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,660
Okay.

354
00:22:40,430 --> 00:22:42,370
Do you want some iced coffee?

355
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,530
Weren't you going to give me any?

356
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,610
Welcome.

357
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,010
Hello.

358
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:57,750
You came to the brewery
the other day.

359
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,150
You're from the hair salon, right?

360
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,790
Yes, I am.

361
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,050
You're Heung Soo's brother, right?

362
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,220
Have you been well?

363
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:08,560
Yes, how are you?

364
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,040
So you will invest your money,

365
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:22,610
and Heung Soo will run
the toast store?

366
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,570
Yes.

367
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:28,410
I can't let him stay unemployed
like that.

368
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:32,180
My gosh. You're a capable person.

369
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,550
I know.

370
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,120
What's the use of being capable?

371
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,590
Heung Soo evades giving an answer.

372
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,160
This is so frustrating.

373
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,030
Well...

374
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:51,870
Why? Is he not sure
if he can run a store?

375
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,470
It's not like that.

376
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,810
He doesn't want me to use it
to tie him down.

377
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,450
Heung Soo thinks
you're tying him down?

378
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,480
Yes.

379
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,490
He already thinks
that I'm tying him down...

380
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:11,190
by spending a night together.

381
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,690
If I get him his own store,

382
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,930
he says he will feel like
I'm tying his arms and legs.

383
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,200
- My gosh.
- Oh, dear.

384
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,040
My goodness.

385
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,870
I'm not supposed to bring that up.

386
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,510
Well...

387
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,340
Can you forget I said anything?

388
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,540
Of course.

389
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,880
What am I going to do
with that brat?

390
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,420
Goodness.

391
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,050
- You!
- My gosh.

392
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,120
Why that little...

393
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,360
Heung Soo.

394
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:52,300
Why did you show up unannounced,

395
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,060
telling me to drop everything
just to see you?

396
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,170
Oh Heung Soo, you!

397
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,470
Why you...

398
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,500
What? Why?

399
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,610
Why?

400
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:04,210
A man should take responsibility
for his actions,

401
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,980
not try to avoid it at all costs!

402
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,910
What actions are you talking about?

403
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,520
Ok Bun told us everything.

404
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,380
What did she tell you?

405
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:18,190
While I was chewing you out,

406
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,360
I accidentally told your brother...

407
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,890
and Mi Sun everything.

408
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,530
What do you mean
you told them everything?

409
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,340
Ji Ok Bun,
have you no shame as a woman?

410
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,210
How can you be so ditzy?

411
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,610
My gosh!

412
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:38,810
Heung Soo,
why are you yelling at her?

413
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,440
I can't believe you.

414
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,680
You and I need to talk.

415
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,750
Talk about what?

416
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,750
Follow me out this instant!

417
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,190
Darn it.

418
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,330
Why you...

419
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,430
Heung Soo,
you shouldn't treat Ok Bun this way.

420
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,500
But Mi Sun...

421
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:07,340
- Are you all right?
- Yes. I'm all right, Mi Sun.

422
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:09,840
Get out here!

423
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,580
You've got to be kidding me.

424
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,350
- Get over here.
- But...

425
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,350
- You brat.
- Chun Soo!

426
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,450
- Have a sip.
- Okay.

427
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,520
(3H Acupressure Bed)

428
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,210
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

429
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,350
We often miss what's right
under our noses.

430
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,750
Mr. Go has everything I look for
in a man.

431
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:02,290
If only we had met
when we were a few years younger.

432
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:12,340
Goodness, Dr. Hwang.

433
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:16,440
Everyone at Golden Castle
is still recovering from the shock.

434
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,480
- Sorry?
- You and your boyfriend.

435
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,810
You created quite the stir
at Golden Castle.

436
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,580
For a moment,
you had me guessing what was up.

437
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,560
Dr. Hwang,
let me call you back later.

438
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,290
Welcome.

439
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,560
The employee went to grab lunch.

440
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,770
Please have a seat,
and I'll be right with you.

441
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,000
- Can I get you some coffee?
- Sure.

442
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,470
- Take your time looking around.
- All right.

443
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:52,410
Just a second.

444
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,160
What was that?

445
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,560
I was exercising my legs.

446
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,630
Gosh, my stomach.

447
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,670
Boss, can you stir this for me?

448
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,370
I really need to go.

449
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:24,410
(Eagle Brewery)

450
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,460
How much time do you need?

451
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,030
How long do you want me to wait?

452
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,660
Maybe a month?

453
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,300
Let's cut it in half
and make it ten days.

454
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,210
Tomorrow is already D-Day.

455
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,640
How is it...

456
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,080
that time...

457
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,520
goes by so fast?

458
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,530
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

459
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,290
Sir, can I get you some tea?

460
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:21,260
No, forget the tea.
I'll have some ice water instead.

461
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,700
Yes, sir.

462
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,470
- Ms. Yoon.
- Yes?

463
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,270
Well,

464
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:31,410
when your boyfriend confessed
his feelings for you,

465
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:34,180
did he do anything special?

466
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,850
For me?

467
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,850
He played the piano
and sang for me at a cafe.

468
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,590
He played the piano?

469
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,390
He took classes for a month...

470
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,120
just to play the song for me.

471
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,900
Goodness, how romantic.

472
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:14,120
Who could you possibly be

473
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:21,120
To take over my whole heart
like this?

474
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:27,960
You seem like an angel

475
00:30:28,930 --> 00:30:33,200
From the planet of my dreams

476
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,780
- If my feelings for you
- Do you know how to play the piano?

477
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:43,050
- Only keeps growing
- Chairman Han,

478
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:47,480
- is there anything you can't do?
- What do I do?

479
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:53,760
Without anyone I could ask

480
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,730
I didn't know
you could be this romantic.

481
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:02,130
The night continues to deepen

482
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,370
I'm touched.

483
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,550
That's a bit too much.

484
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,250
Sorry?

485
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:26,320
What? I didn't mean that for you.

486
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,360
- You should get back to work.
- Yes, sir.

487
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,870
Playing the piano...

488
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,070
is a bit too much.

489
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,900
That's just silly.

490
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,340
The phone is turned off.

491
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,410
- Transferring to voicemail.
- Unbelievable.

492
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,550
She even turned off her phone.

493
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:55,790
Where is she, and what is she up to?

494
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,560
Goodness, you're home.

495
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,490
Where's Se Ri?

496
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,930
She went out to meet a friend.

497
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,070
Did you meet with Gyeol?

498
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,230
I went to the clinic
earlier today...

499
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,770
and made sure he understood.

500
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,200
I suggested...

501
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,840
that they still get married
as planned in September.

502
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:18,170
And?

503
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,840
He agreed.

504
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:24,750
What did Chairman Han tell him?

505
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,680
You know how careful Gyeol is.

506
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,820
As if he would've said anything bad
about Se Ri to his father.

507
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:32,090
He didn't say a single word.

508
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,790
If this wedding doesn't go
as planned,

509
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,200
I won't let it slide.

510
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,630
What will you do about it?

511
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,200
You and Se Ri.

512
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,870
Just know that I'll throw you both
out of this house.

513
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,910
As if that scares anyone.

514
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,880
Unbelievable.

515
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,750
Lieutenant Oh!

516
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,860
Bom left earlier,
saying she had plans.

517
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,490
She's not the one I'm here to see.

518
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,930
I'm here to see you, Lieutenant Oh.

519
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,910
Professor Oh was teaching a class...

520
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,310
when my mom opened the door...

521
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:31,580
and charged through it.

522
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,250
Oh, no.

523
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,020
He must've been flustered...

524
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,420
and deeply upset by it.

525
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,560
Why did your mom go
into the lecture hall?

526
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,430
I think she wanted
to scare the professor off.

527
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,770
Even though I keep saying
it's just a crush on my part,

528
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,670
my parents don't believe me.

529
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,380
I've been so worried about him...

530
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,350
that I haven't been able
to focus all day.

531
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,580
He probably won't pick up my calls,

532
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,860
so can you call him...

533
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,560
to check if he's all right?

534
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,360
Well...

535
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,470
Please.

536
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,840
Okay.

537
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,240
Hey, Kang Soo.

538
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,280
Hey. Where are you right now?

539
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,480
I picked up Ha Ni,
and I'm on my way home.

540
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,480
Why?

541
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,190
Nothing's up, right?

542
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,620
Of course, nothing's up.

543
00:34:45,290 --> 00:34:46,290
Why do you ask?

544
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,960
It's good, then.
I'll see you at home.

545
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,130
What did he say?

546
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:57,130
He seems to be fine,
so don't worry too much.

547
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,670
I'm glad.

548
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,640
I felt awful
about what I put him through,

549
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,550
and I was too embarrassed.

550
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:13,520
It's been weighing
on my mind all day.

551
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,360
I'm home.

552
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,370
Beom Soo, you're home.

553
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,900
Goodness.
Ha Ni, did you have a fun day?

554
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:38,070
Hold on. Did you have
a lot of lectures today?

555
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,380
You seem exhausted.

556
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:43,610
Strangely,
I feel a bit drained today.

557
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,310
Let me take Ha Ni.

558
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,650
I'll watch her...

559
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:49,250
while you get some rest
in your room.

560
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,550
Ha Ni, tell your dad
to get some rest.

561
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,860
Thank you, Kwang Sook.

562
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,060
Ha Ni, have fun with your aunt.

563
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,990
I'll play with you
after I get some rest.

564
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,200
"Sure, Dad.
Get some much-needed rest."

565
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,330
Thank you.

566
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,940
- Get some rest, Beom Soo.
- Got it.

567
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,410
Is something up?

568
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,530
I'm sorry
for interrupting your class.

569
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,110
I hope nothing happened.

(TA Dokgo Se Ri)

571
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,090
(Are you all right?)

572
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,470
(Are you all right?)

573
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,550
I say this loud and clear.

574
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,350
You're the investor,
and I'm the store owner.

575
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,360
Let's draw the line clearly
before anything else.

576
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:37,560
If you say it again,
you'll have said it a hundred times.

577
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,460
I won't put up with you...

578
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,460
bossing me around
just because you're the investor.

579
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:45,370
You know,

580
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,200
since I became the president
of your fan club,

581
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,970
I've never tried...

582
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,810
to boss you around
or take advantage of my position.

583
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,650
Also,

584
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,550
if you keep trying to tie me down
because of the night we shared...

585
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,790
I won't dream of it,

586
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:06,360
not even for a second,

587
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,890
so don't you worry.

588
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,890
That's what you say,

589
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,330
but you've been talking about it
to everyone.

590
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:18,230
Why did you tell
my brother and Mi Sun?

591
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,670
That...

592
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,010
I didn't mean to tell them,
but it just came out.

593
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,240
Shouldn't a woman be more cautious?

594
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,210
Watch what you say.

595
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,080
Fine.

596
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,420
Okay.

597
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:37,620
Ok Bun, it's your turn
to list your demands.

598
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,960
Just like when you skipped work
without notice...

599
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,730
after Ms. Kim dumped you,

600
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,630
you can't close the store
because you're having a bad day.

601
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,370
If I ever do that again,

602
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,370
I'll call myself a mutt.

603
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,870
Like how you got together
with Ms. Kim at the dance class,

604
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,710
you can't fall for
or date a customer.

605
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,510
In this desperate situation,

606
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:07,620
where I'm swallowing my pride...

607
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,290
and letting you help me
run the store,

608
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,020
dating is the last thing on my mind.

609
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,660
If that were on my mind,
I'd truly be nothing but a mutt.

610
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,790
All good, then.

611

613
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,840
I'll get going, Heung Soo.

614
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Sure.

615
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,540
Ok Bun.

616
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:39,850
Thank you for putting your trust
in someone like me...

617
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:45,720
and for investing in me.

618
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,940
- You're home.
- You're home.

619
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,140
Did something good happen?

620
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,670
Does it seem that way?

621
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:37,910
Yes.

622
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,740
You'll soon find out,

623
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,840
so be patient.

624
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,950
Did you get a new suit and shoes?

625
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:48,220
Yes, I have
an important meeting tomorrow.

626
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,620
Here. Let me hang that for you.

627
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,660
It's all right. I'll do it myself.

628
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,730
Shouldn't the shoes
go on the shoe rack?

629
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,860
I'm keeping them
right next to my bed.

630
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,730
He seems to be in such a good mood.

631
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,270
I don't think
I should bring up Se Ri today.

632
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,240
That professor Se Ri likes.

633
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:15,040
He's Lieutenant Oh's older brother.

634
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,610
What?

635
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,360
I bet you turned off your phone
on purpose to make me worry.

636
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,560
What have you been doing this late?

637
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:33,300
I asked you a question.
Where have you been until now?

638
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,000
I'm not going to talk to you,
so leave.

639
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,540
What...

640
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,450
If you have any questions for him
or anything you'd like to say,

641
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:00,020
just call me anytime.

642
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,790
I'm happy to help.

643
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:04,490
Thank you so much.

644
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,600
Then,

645
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,270
can I ask for one more favor?

646
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,500
Can you send me photos
of Ha Ni sometimes?

647
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:19,440
I miss her a lot, that's all.

648
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
I will.

649
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,980
If only Professor Oh were as kind...

650
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,350
as Lieutenant Oh.

651
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:39,460
- There you go, Ha Ni.
- Hey, Ha Ni.

652
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,000
She's adorable.

653
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:42,830
- Goodness me.
- I'm home.

654
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:45,130
Kang Soo, you're home
later than usual today.

655
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,240
He's only been working
at this company for a few days,

656
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:50,210
but he might already be seeing
a co-worker.

657
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,570
It's not like that.

658
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,410
As if.

659
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,180
I smell something fishy going on.

660
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,350
Hey, you.

661
00:42:57,850 --> 00:42:59,380
Enough with this nonsense.

662
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,920
Just be good to Ok Bun.

663
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:04,750
Come on, Chun Soo.
Why would you suddenly bring her up?

664
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,520
You won't find someone
quite like her.

665
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:10,490
She saved you from being deceived
by Ms. Kim...

666
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,330
and invested a large sum of money...

667
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,860
so that you could open a store
of your own.

668
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,970
Anyone can tell
that you two are meant to be.

669
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,840
Had I known what was coming,
I would've stayed at the sauna.

670
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,940
Gosh, I'm so stressed.

671
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:27,910
- Unbelievable.
- Ha Ni.

672
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:33,920
Come in.

673
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,190
Hey.

674
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,660
- You just got back?
- Yes.

675
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,600
I just met Se Ri.

676
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,630
She came to my workplace.

677
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,440
She did?

678
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,370
Yes.
She was really worried about you.

679
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:58,010
That's why I called you then.

680
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,910
She said her mother
barged into your lecture hall.

681
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:09,280
She even shed a tear
when she said she felt terrible.

682
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:14,460
She seems to be serious about you.

683
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:18,860
So don't just push her away
and put up a wall.

684
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,700
Stay open-minded about it.

685
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,700
I can't do that.

686
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,430
I'm her professor,
and I'm Ha Ni's dad too.

687
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,370
To be honest,
you don't dislike her, do you?

688
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:33,980
Let's not talk about that.

689
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,880
Don't say it can't happen.
At least think about it.

690
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,220
I think both you
and Se Ri feel the same.

691
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,790
What are you on about?

692
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,390
Stop talking nonsense
and go to your room.

693
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,700
Gosh, I'm tired.

694
00:44:57,770 --> 00:44:58,770
What?

695
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,540
Goodness.
Why aren't you ready for bed?

696
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,640
I came in to thank you.

697
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,240
For what?

698
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,380
Because you were so accepting,

699
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:13,080
my brothers-in-law
could all move in.

700
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,720
Do you like
living with them this much?

701
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:20,060
- Yes.
- You half-wit.

702
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:25,330
Why did you
suddenly change your mind?

703
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:27,600
Well...

704
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:30,330
You wouldn't stop telling me
to sell the brewery.

705
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:31,700
Why did you...

706
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:34,800
suddenly decide
we shouldn't sell it?

707
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,240
That was because...

708
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:39,040
I thought if I just changed my mind,

709
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,040
it would be better for everyone.

710
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,710
My gosh.

711
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:50,190
Thanks, anyway.

712
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:00,900
Oh, my gosh. Jang Soo was so corny.

713
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,600
Read this.

714
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,030
My skin's crawling. It's too much.

715
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,240
He had his charms.

716
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,040
Kwang Sook.

717
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:16,780
What were you doing?

718
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:18,980
We were reading Jang Soo's letter...

719
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,820
we found while unpacking.

720
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,650
A letter from Jang Soo?

721
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:27,690
Yes. He wrote to us every week.

722
00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:29,930
We found a bit about you.

723
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:31,860
Read it, Kang Soo.

724
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:35,900
"Kwang Sook's as pure as water
from the natural spring..."

725
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,470
"in our brewery's backyard."

726
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:40,740
"She's wholesome,
like organic rice."

727
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,070
"She ferments me
and brings out the best in me."

728
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:48,540
I get that makgeolli
was all he knew and cared about,

729
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,750
- but he described her like that?
- Right?

730
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:03,130
What's wrong with you?

731
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,830
Why would you read that
and break her heart?

732
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,300
I'm sorry, Kwang Sook.

733
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,270
We found it funny
and didn't think much of it.

734
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:20,280
Get ready for bed, everyone.

735
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:29,720
Why is she upset?

736
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:31,450
Is something wrong?

737
00:47:32,190 --> 00:47:33,960
He read out a letter.

738
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,790
He took it out.

739
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:37,150
The past 10 days felt like 10 years.

740
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:40,360
This will be my final text.

741
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,460
Like a boy
looking forward to a picnic,

742
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:49,900
for the past few days,

743
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:54,300
I've been preparing every detail
for our meeting tomorrow.

744
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:56,310
There we go.

745
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:57,510
I did my best.

746
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:03,750
Tomorrow,

747
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:07,350
I get to see you at last.

748
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:11,520
I'm so excited I can barely sleep,

749
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:14,660
so I decided to have
a glass of wine before bed.

750
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,740
Goodness.

751
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,080
After just one more night,

752
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:41,680
a new beginning will await us,
won't it?

753
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:45,450
I can't wait for morning to come.

754
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:47,590
Sleep well.

755
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:52,490
I heard from your employees...

756
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:56,260
that you, as the chairman,
recommended Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

757
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:58,600
I'll take them off your hands.

758
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:09,850
Chairman Han. Did you train
in hapkido or taekwondo?

759
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,550
Judo.

760
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:14,120
Do you two know each other?

761
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,220
We're friends.

762
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:19,760
Well... We're sharing comic books.

763
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,090
Doesn't that make us friends?

764
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:28,530
You're awesome, sir!

765
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,000
Why should I have to hide
when I've done nothing...

766
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:35,140
Thank you for today.

767
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:39,640
I have feelings for you.

768
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,880
Why do you like me?

769
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,880
Because you're Ma Kwang Sook.

770
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,650
That's why.

771
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:53,460
(Eagle Brewery)

772
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,410
Kwang Sook.

773
00:51:16,810 --> 00:51:18,350
Wake up.

774
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:20,580
Kwang Sook.

775
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:30,130
Goodness.

776
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:32,660
Why did you sleep out here?
What if you caught a cold?

777
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:37,600
I meant to sit here
to think about something.

778
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,540
I must've fallen asleep.

779
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,210
Are you worried about something?

780
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,650
It's because you fools
read out Jang Soo's letter.

781
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,250
That's what kept her awake.

782
00:51:58,450 --> 00:51:59,490
I'm sorry.

783
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,120
It's not that.

784
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,760
It's time for our morning exercise.
Let's go!

785
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,500
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

786
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:11,930
Come and join us.

787
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,600
- Get changed and come outside.
- Okay.

788
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,440
That fool...

789
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:28,150
The National Warmup. Let's begin.

790
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:31,990
One, two, three, four,

791
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,890
five, six, seven, eight.

792
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:37,660
- Chun Soo.
- What?

793
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,900
Shouldn't we get Mi Sun
to join us for this soon?

794
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:45,430
What are you on about?

795
00:52:45,470 --> 00:52:46,870
Don't pretend.

796
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,810
Almost everyone knows
you're kind of seeing her.

797
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:55,310
Chun Soo. You're dating Mi Sun now?

798
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,910
Congratulations, Chun Soo.

799
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,510
I'm not. Don't be silly.

800
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:05,190
You two had
some serious chemistry yesterday.

801
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,320
Be honest.

802
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:09,620
How far have you gone?

803
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:14,060
What do you mean,
how far have I gone?

804
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:17,100
- Did you hold hands?
- Don't.

805
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:18,570
Don't be gross.

806
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,500
Kwang Sook.
I'm positive they held hands.

807
00:53:23,740 --> 00:53:25,240
I'm sure they did.

808
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:28,340
Why would you join in too?
We didn't.

809
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:29,640
Don't deny it.

810
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,710
Your ears are red.
I'm sure you held hands.

811
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:35,150
And what?
Did you kiss her like this?

812
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,590
- Or like this?
- My gosh.

813
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:39,350
- Like this?
- Go away!

814
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,390
- My goodness.
- Seriously.

815
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:41,790
You did this, right?

816
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,860
I said, go away!

817
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,860
- Hey, catch him!
- Stop it.

818
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,800
- Will you stop that?
- Grab him.

819
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:48,960
- You brat!
- Catch him.

820
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,300
- Stop it.
- Chun Soo.

821
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,800
Please! Don't do this!

822
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,340
- Stop it.
- Hold him.

823
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:00,940
Did you kiss her?

824
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,780
After just one more night,

825
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:08,350
a new beginning will await us,
won't it?

826
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,330
- Hello, sir.
- Hey.

827
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:31,570
You don't seem to be feeling well.

828
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:33,140
Is something wrong?

829
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:36,080
No. I couldn't sleep at all
last night.

830
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,650
My head is in a mess,
like a tangled mess of yarn.

831
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:42,250
I'll get you something
for your headache.

832
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,990
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

833
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:56,770
I look off-color.

834
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,570
I look ten years older today.

835
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:06,740
I've been preparing well as planned,

836
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,680
but why do I have to be
like this today?

837
00:55:21,890 --> 00:55:24,860
(Eagle Brewery)

838
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:32,270
What brings you here, Mr. Kim?

839
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:35,340
Chairman Han asked me
to give this to you.

840
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:42,510
What is this?

841
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,880
I don't know about that.

842
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,010
Today is a special day
for both of us,

843
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:17,050
so I'm sending this to you
to celebrate it.

844
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:20,780
I thought it would look good on you,
so I chose it.

845
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,720
I hope you like it.

846
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:24,750
I'll see you later.

847
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:06,430
There are still 40 minutes left
until the appointed time.

848
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,060
Did I get here too early?

849
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:44,270
(Han Dong Seok)

850
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:31,950
Thank you.

851
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:50,530
I guess you came early.

852
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:54,740
I got here 40 minutes early.

853
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,870
Time went by so slowly...

854
00:58:57,210 --> 00:59:00,070
that 40 minutes felt like 40 years.

855
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,130
Please have a good time.

856
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:33,040
Wine helps you relax a little.

857
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:36,710
Shall we drink it together first?

858
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:38,850
Sure.

859
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:53,800
The wine tastes really good.

860
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,400
I chose it carefully a week ago.

861
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,270
I'm glad you like it.

862
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:12,680
Have you thought about it
over the past ten days?

863
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:19,690
I've been thinking carefully...

864
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:22,860
about my feelings for you.

865
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:28,700
It's time to hear the outcome
of your careful consideration.

866
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,140
Why don't we become...

867
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,770
an official couple?

868
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:46,650
Chairman Han.

869
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:53,620
Chairman Han.

870
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:57,030
You're here.

871
01:00:57,190 --> 01:00:59,590
I had something to think about.

872
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:01,230
Have a seat.

873
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:02,830
Okay.

874
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:20,210
Did you not like the dress...

875
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:21,980
I sent you?

876
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:24,290
It's not that.

877
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:26,490
It was so pretty...

878
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,560
and classy.

879
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:34,730
But it didn't feel like
it was for me,

880
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,330
so I came in my usual outfit.

881
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:45,740
Chairman Han.

882
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:53,610
I've thought about it carefully
for the past ten days.

883
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,960
You are a really nice person.

884
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:04,830
And you've been...

885
01:02:06,430 --> 01:02:09,430
so good to me,
which I don't even deserve.

886
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:14,300
But no matter
how much I think about it,

887
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:19,110
I don't think I can do that.

888
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,080
You don't think you can do that?

889
01:02:30,750 --> 01:02:31,820
I'm sorry.

890
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,490
So are you...

891
01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:41,960
rejecting my offer...

892
01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:45,830
to be my girlfriend?

893
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,080
Yes.

894
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,800
(For Eagle Brothers)

895
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Hold on.

896
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:54,640
Do you have a business card?

897
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,400
I'll try to make up for the time...

898
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,440
I couldn't be there as his mom.

899
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:00,610
I'm on my way back
from meeting Gyeol.

900
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:02,580
Give me the professor's name
and number!

901
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,250
I'll take him down and make sure
he doesn't get back up.

902
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,110
He's someone you also know.

903
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:08,180
Who?

904
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:09,280
It's Beom Soo.

905
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:10,380
From Eagle Brewery?

906
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,720
Hey, Oh Beom Soo!

907
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:15,220
Can't we just be friends?

908
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:18,560
To me, you're already someone
I see romantically,

909
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:20,560
so just being friends
is no longer an option for me.
