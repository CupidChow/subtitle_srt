1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,380
I served in the artillery brigade
in Galmal-eup,

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,910
Cheorwon, Gangwon Province.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,880
It turned out that Chairman Han...

4
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,350
served there before me
as a forward observer.

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,450
Do you remember?

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,690
In mid-winter,

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,260
if you peed during night watch,

8
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,420
your urine froze right away.

9
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,990
That's where he served.

10
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,530
What kind of coincidence is that?

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,630
It's not a coincidence.
It was meant to be.

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,640
- I see why Chun Soo's excited.
- Me too.

13
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,270
That must've been a rough time.

14
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,140
Let me pour you a drink.

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,940
Here you go.

16
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,250
Oh, dear.

17
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,780
- Mr. Han.
- Gosh.

18
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,150
Thank you very much.

19
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,460
Chairman Han must be tired.

20
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,630
Why don't we wrap things up?

21
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,500
I'm not tired at all.

22
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,570
You should go home...

23
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,500
and spend time with your family.

24
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,310
My kids are busy
with their own jobs and lives,

25
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,510
and I have no one at home
waiting to welcome me.

26
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,280
Does that mean you're...

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,080
My wife passed 15 years ago.

28
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,830
I can't believe someone as cool
and perfect as you are single.

29
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,460
You must be so popular.

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,060
Well,

31
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,700
I'm only interested
in the woman I like.

32
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:36,600
I don't care
about anyone else at all.

33
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,570
You must have really high standards.

34
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:42,610
I'd like to know
who you're interested in.

35
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,210
I wouldn't say
my standards are high.

36
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,150
I must say my preference is clear.

37
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,850
What kind of woman do you like?

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,220
Well...

39
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,590
I like someone confident, energetic,

40
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,760
and courageous.

41
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,760
A woman who is honest
and not pretentious.

42
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,930
A broad-minded woman.

43
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,010
Oh, dear.

44
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,080
Spending a great time
with such nice people,

45
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,710
I lost track of time.

46
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,980
I'll stop bothering you
and get going now.

47
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,250
- Okay.
- All right.

48
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,090
I had a wonderful time
thanks to you, Chun Soo.

49
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,390
Thanks to you, I got to reminisce
about the old days...

50
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,530
and laugh a lot.

51
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,700
Since you're Chun Soo's brothers,
you're all like my brothers.

52
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,930
If you have any difficulties
or need some advice,

53
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,370
call me anytime.

54
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,540
Just hearing your words
makes us feel reassured.

55
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,810
I'm not just saying that. I mean it.

56
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,570
Thank you, sir.

57
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:51,980
I'll see you at work.

58
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,280
Good night, sir.

59
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,180
I'll see you again.

60
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,250
Sure. We should meet often.

61
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,520
I'll get going, then.

62
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,590
All right, then.

63
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,270
Let's go in.

64
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,770
- All right.
- Let's go.

65
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,540
Chairman Han is more easygoing
than I thought he'd be.

66
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,780
I know. He seems like a nice man.

67
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,980
We'll clean this up.
You can go in and get some rest.

68
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,290
No, let me help you.

69
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,150
It won't take long. Just go in.

70
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,020
Right. Let your brothers-in-law
take care of it tonight.

71
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,120
Thanks.

72
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,290
Let's go.

73
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,490
You should wash up
and get some rest.

74
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,000
You must be tired
from taking care of Chairman Han.

75
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,700
All right. I'm tired,
so I'll be in my room.

76
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,600
- Okay.
- I'll go and get a tray.

77
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,730
All right.

78
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,580
Why are you looking at me like that?

79
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,550
I'm just proud of you.

80
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
For what?

81
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,790
Chairman Han
must've been so desperate.

82
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,660
That's why he came all the way here.

83
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,090
It's like he walked...

84
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,690
into the enemy camp unarmed.

85
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,760
Stop talking nonsense and go.

86
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,760
I'm tired.

87
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,300
At this rate,

88
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,730
he'll propose to you soon.

89
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,770
I bet...

90
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,640
it'll be two months at most.

91
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,210
Stop being ridiculous
and go get some sleep.

92
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,510
Hey, your problem is that
you're so bad at picking things up.

93
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,080
Will it be a month?

94
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,590
It's an important call.
I have to take it outside.

95
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,160
Of course.

96
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,740
Excuse me.

97
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,670
Where's the restroom?

98
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,170
Go out and turn right.
Then you'll find it.

99
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,510
Okay. Thank you.

100
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,550
I want to be friends with him,

101
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,980
so I asked him
to have a drink with me.

102
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,690
I told you.

103
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,690
You are struggling,
worried, and concerned.

104
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,590
So I'll handle everything.

105
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,930
Half of your worries are
about your brothers-in-law.

106
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,200
In order to take care of the issues,

107
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,770
I need to get to know
your brothers-in-law.

108
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,340
I'm sorry. It was an important call,
so I had to take it.

109
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,170
It's no problem.

110
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,210
Let me pour you a drink.

111
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,110
All right.

112
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,780
Are you asleep?

113
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,850
No. Come on in.

114
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,460
Well...

115
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,530
I have something to say to you.

116
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,900
Okay. Have a seat.

117
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,900
All right.

118
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,140
Now that I'm drunk,

119
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,340
I want to use it as an excuse
to say this.

120
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,350
You should find...

121
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,320
someone nice for you now.

122
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,860
Why are you saying that
all of a sudden?

123
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,330
Since I met Mi Sun again,

124
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,860
I've been really happy lately.

125
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,830
I'm glad to hear that.

126
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,300
When I looked in the mirror before,
my face just looked empty.

127
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,070
Obviously,

128
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:51,940
I had eyes, a nose, and a mouth
on my face,

129
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,650
but I had no expression.

130
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,320
So it just looked empty.

131
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,990
But now,

132
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,760
looking in the mirror
makes me feel good.

133
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,230
And I'm having fun in life.

134
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,200
But at the same time, I feel guilty.

135
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,040
Feel guilty?

136
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,080
You're all alone,

137
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,580
but we're keeping you by our side,

138
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,080
which makes you
sacrifice everything.

139
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,180
"Hey, Oh Chun Soo. Don't you care
about her as long as you're happy?"

140
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,690
This is how I feel.

141
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,690
That's ridiculous.

142
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,560
I'm serious, Kwang Sook.

143
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,130
That's why I'm telling you this.

144
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,270
You should find someone good
for you now.

145
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,230
I mean it.

146
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,870
I've had this thought
for a long time,

147
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,110
and I'm telling you this now
while I'm drunk.

148
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,180
This isn't
the alcohol talking, though.

149
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,980
Please do as I say.

150
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,220
No turning back.

151
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,750
One way.

152
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,990
Okay?

153
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,700
Hello?

154
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,430
I just got home.

155
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,800
I'm calling you
to tell you I got here safely.

156
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:00,400
You must've been surprised today.

157
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,540
I wasn't just surprised.

158
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,410
I thought my heart
was going to pop out of my chest.

159
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,280
How could you even think
about coming to my house...

160
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,450
when I'm living
with my brothers-in-law?

161
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,120
Including Chun Soo,

162
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,560
all your brothers-in-law
seem like nice people.

163
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,560
I'm so glad and relieved.

164
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,690
But Chairman Han,

165
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,560
I haven't agreed to go out...

166
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,300
with you yet.

167
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,970
You can't do things
unilaterally like this.

168
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,840
It puts me in a tough spot.

169
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,070
I knew you wouldn't be happy
about it when I did that.

170
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,810
You can scold me all you want.

171
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,280
What am I...

172
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,120
to scold you?

173
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,280
CEO Ma.

174
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,190
Just stay where you are.

175
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,360
I'll sort things out around you...

176
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,430
and make you choose me.

177
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:08,570
Chairman Han and I...

178
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,940
agreed to call off the wedding.

179
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,080
Since you didn't want
to get married,

180
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:19,180
I decided to give in
with bitter tears of disappointment.

181
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,990
Now it's your turn
to do something in return.

182
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,390
You can't just get your own way
and do everything you want.

183
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,190
He's right.
Now that your dad gave an inch,

184
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,660
you should take one step back
to make things even.

185
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,830
So stop complaining...

186
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,100
and go abroad to study. Okay?

187
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,440
I have no interest in studying.

188
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,680
I only took the MBA course
because you wanted me to.

189
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,210
That's enough.
Just leave in a month...

190
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,980
No, leave in two weeks.

191
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:51,150
Don't be silly.
There's a lot to prepare.

192
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,880
She can't leave that soon.

193
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,220
That's nonsense.

194
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,860
I heard you and Dad...

195
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,690
used to work at Eagle Brewery.

196
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,330
Who told you that?

197
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,530
Is it not true?

198
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,440
You're right.

199
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,210
It's true.

200
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,250
We worked there when we were young.

201
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,720
Why do you dislike
Professor Oh so much, then?

202
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,690
They put him on a pedestal
because he was smart,

203
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,190
and he turned out
to be a rotten jerk.

204
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:33,360
He didn't care for his elders.
I could tell all along.

205
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,130
Your mom and I
worked our fingers to the bone,

206
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,070
but we were never acknowledged
or properly paid.

207
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,770
They exploited us.

208
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,440
Eagle Brewery is an evil company!

209
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,110
Don't go too far.

210
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,450
If you were in my position,

211
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,920
would you want that professor
to marry your daughter?

212
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,050
A divorced single dad?

213
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,550
Forget about the past.

214
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,390
You've been through a lot, Se Ri.

215
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:09,430
Go abroad for some fresh air
and change of scenery.

216
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:11,500
Wouldn't it be nice
to cheer yourself up?

217
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,730
If you really don't want
to get a degree,

218
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,970
learn a new language
for a couple of years. Right?

219
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
That's right.

220
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,940
Don't try to keep it
from me like that.

221
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,340
What is it that I don't know?

222
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,840
There's more to the story.

223
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,920
Come on. Take her...

224
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,690
- to her room.
- I was just about to.

225
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,820
Get up. You're coming with me.

226
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,860
Let go.

227
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,170
Send her away quickly.

228
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,520
Why did he send us such a letter
knowing it could damage...

229
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,290
his daughter's reputation?

230
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,330
Her parents had arranged
for her to marry someone.

231
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,230
But when she refused to marry him,

232
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,900
her parents decided to blame me.

233
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:25,770
Are you saying her father's claim...

234
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,410
is completely unfounded?

235
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,210
I did not approach her...

236
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,940
with a motive
or sabotage her engagement...

237
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,480
as the letter suggests.

238
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,250
You're awake, Ha Ni?

239
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,690
When did you wake up?

240
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,520
It's okay. Don't cry.

241
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,460
It's okay.

242
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,330
I know.

243
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,830
You're grumpy
because you just woke up.

244
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,770
It's okay.

245
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,550
What's this?

246
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,690
Whose is this?

247
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,560
It's Se Ri's mother's.

248
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,520
Why do you have it?

249
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,760
She followed her husband here
when he caused a scene.

250
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,300
I found it in the garden
after they left.

251
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,530
I see.

252
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,070
It must be nice...

253
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,300
to be rich.

254
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,940
Ms. Jang...

255
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,180
had the aura of a rich madam.

256
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,580
Do you remember Se Ri's mother?

257
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,310
Of course, I do.

258
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,120
You don't?

259
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,820
Ms. Jang used to carry you around,
get you dressed, and put you to bed.

260
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,160
She adored you a lot.

261
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,960
- Did she?
- Yes.

262
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,330
She wasn't just
an employee of the brewery.

263
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,900
She was like your nanny.

264
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,640
But then she colluded with...

265
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,570
the brewery manager
at the time and embezzled from us.

266
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,670
It was a massive shock to everyone.

267
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,310
Gosh.

268
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,690
What?

269
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,960
Goodness.

270
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,730
Where did I lose the other one?

271
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,250
Right now,

272
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,220
what does the brewery need
most urgently?

273
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,460
It's funding, of course.

274
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,620
Because of the fake video,

275
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,330
our bank refused to extend our loan.

276
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,900
My brothers moved in with us
and put together their deposits...

277
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,900
to pay off the bank loan.

278
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,100
Right now,

279
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,640
in order to produce the yakju
we agreed to export,

280
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,810
we need extra equipment...

281
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,710
and more rice.

282
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:23,550
We still owe the rice farmers
for what they supplied us.

283
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,150
You mean you need operational funds.

284
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:28,990
Yes, that's right.

285
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,490
What bank do you do business with?

286
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,690
Yuil Bank.

287
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,070
Take me to Yuil Bank's main branch.

288
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,100
Yes, sir.

289
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,820
Is the rice looking good?

290
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,320
You bet. It's cooked to perfection.

291
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,490
We should be working...

292
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,790
day and night
to meet the export deadline.

293
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,960
We're almost out of rice.

294
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,290
LX Hotel paid for
the last delivery of makgeolli,

295
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,400
but we had to pay them back
for paying off our wholesalers,

296
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,800
so we have almost nothing left.

297
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:23,970
Hello?

298
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,580
Hello, Ms. Ma.

299
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,880
I'm Yuil Bank
Branch Manager Park Sung Il.

300
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,350
A Yuil Bank branch manager?

301
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,090
We were approved for a new loan?

302
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,060
- The prime rate?
- The prime rate?

303
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,200
When I asked about it last time,
you turned me down coldly.

304
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,640
The refusal
to extend your previous loan...

305
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,240
and the approval for a new one...

306
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,310
were both instructions
we received from the main branch.

307
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,440
We're pleased
with the turn of events,

308
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,840
but why do you think
the main branch changed their mind?

309
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,350
I heard that LX Hotel stood in
as a guarantor...

310
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,480
based on your business agreement.

311
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,350
LX Hotel?

312
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,690
Yes, so the main branch
gave us special instructions.

313
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,360
You can borrow up to twice
the amount you've repaid.

314
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:16,690
Twice the amount?

315
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,370
It looks like...

316
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,610
Chairman Han helped us out.

317
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,210
When we had drinks yesterday,

318
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:34,580
he asked
what our biggest difficulty was.

319
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,510
I said we needed operational funds.

320
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,620
I'm pretty sure
he contacted the main branch.

321
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,220
He helps us out at every turn.

322
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,530
It's Yeoung Ju.

323
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,160
You can take it.

324
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,430
Hi, Yeoung Ju.

325
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,400
You sound upset.

326
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,300
Is something wrong?

327
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,740
Mom didn't come home
again last night.

328
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:03,840
What?

329
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,810
She didn't come home
and didn't call either?

330
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:12,620
Okay. I'll talk to her.

331
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,250
Bye.

332
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,420
What is it? Is something wrong?

333
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,230
So Yeon stayed out last night
without calling home.

334
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,560
She slept elsewhere?

335
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,000
The person you are calling...

336
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,870
cannot come to the phone
at the moment.

337
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,610
She won't pick up.
I don't know what she's thinking.

338
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,320
(Convenience Store Special Offers)

339
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:57,060
I'll take my share and go.

340
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,630
Yeoung Ju's dad?
He's no help at all.

341
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,760
He's too soft.

342
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,910
Should I return this to Chun Soo?

343
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,580
I can't throw it away.

344
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,720
(3H Acupressure Bed)

345
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,460
She has the calm, Asian look,

346
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,530
and she seems like
she'd make a good wife and mom.

347
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,670
To be honest, my type...

348
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,240
You nailed it.

349
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,740
Looks like
I've got some competition now.

350
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,340
Welcome.

351
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,580
- Hello.
- Hello.

352
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:52,450
My back has been sore,
so I stopped by to try the bed.

353
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,050
Gosh, you came to the right place.

354
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,290
Please try this one over here.

355
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,420
- This way.
- Please lie down.

356
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,020
Take off your shoes...

357
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,190
- and lie down comfortably.
- Sure.

358
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,570
Can you feel it?

359
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,730
Goodness, yes.

360
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,000
Gosh, that feels good.

361
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,210
You'll feel much lighter
after this massage.

362
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,310
It's already doing wonders.

363
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,180
- Relax and enjoy the massage, then.
- Right.

364
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,550
- Get her whatever she needs.
- Sure.

365
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,160
I need to stop this
before it gets out of hand.

366
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,430
Goodness. Who may you be?

367
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,610
My gosh.

368
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,410
You sweet little thing.

369
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,010
Where did you come from?

370
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,820
Where's your mom?

371
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,590
Where's your mom?

372
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,330
I don't see your mom.

373
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,770
Where do you live?

374
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,970
I'll take you home.

375
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,010
(Vet)

376
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:59,140
Hello.

377
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:03,550
Doctor, can you find his mom?

378
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,820
You see, he walked
into my salon a minute ago.

379
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,220
Right. Just a second.

380
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,920
- Here.
- Let me see you.

381
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:15,130
All right.

382
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:22,170
This little puppy
doesn't have a microchip.

383
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,900
It looks like it has been homeless
for a while.

384
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,940
I can also see
that it's malnourished.

385
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,610
You poor thing.

386
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,610
Well...

387
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,650
Then, I'll cover all the costs.

388
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,580
Could you do a full checkup...

389
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,890
and give it whatever treatment
it needs?

390
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,860
Can I have your number?

391
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:48,360
Why do you want my number?

392
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:53,360
I should be able to call you
once the checkup is done.

393
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,030
Of course.

394
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,800
Here.

395
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,810
I see.
You're the owner of the salon.

396
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,680
That's right.

397
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,620
And the name...

398
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,350
It's Ji Ok Bun.

399
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,990
Not you, Ms. Ji. I meant the dog.

400
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,930
Do you have one in mind?

401
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,400
I see.

402
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,800
Well...

403
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,400
How about Gureum?

404
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,740
With its soft, white fur,
it looks like a fluffy cloud.

405
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,440
Gureum.

406
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,080
That's a good one.

407
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,120
(Be back soon)

408
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,600
Hey.

409
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,330
Where did you go
after closing the shop?

410
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,930
The vet.

411
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,400
Why did you go to the vet?

412
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,970
An abandoned dog
walked into the salon,

413
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,870
so I went there to locate its owner.

414
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,380
But why are you here
and not at your store?

415
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,420
I've been working nonstop,

416
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,850
and I just got a chance
to get some fresh air.

417
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,920
Would you like a cup of coffee?

418
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:24,850
Sounds good.

419
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,730
- Here you go.
- Right.

420
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,900
I've been working
in the kitchen all day,

421
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,600
and now I'm aching everywhere.

422
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,000
Stop grumbling like a kid,
Heung Soo.

423
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,170
Everyone works that hard
just to make a living.

424
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:46,040
I work hard all day too,

425
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,180
cutting hair...

426
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,110
and breathing in toxic perm fumes.

427
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,080
I wasn't complaining.

428
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,150
I just wanted some words
of comfort from you.

429
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,090
You didn't have to call me out
like that.

430
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,490
That wasn't it.

431
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,560
Whatever. I'll get going.

432
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,760
Once I'm done
with the perm client I've booked,

433
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,230
I'll swing by your store.

434
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,230
Keep working hard until then.
Got it?

435
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,050
Why is he like a kid
I can't take my eyes off?

436
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,680
I'm constantly on edge.

437
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:36,030
(Dean of Academic Affairs)

438
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,770
I'll be asking a few questions.

439
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,270
Professor Oh Beom Soo
is your thesis advisor.

440
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,870
Yes.

441
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,770
Has your professor said
anything inappropriate...

442
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,310
or made you feel pressured
in any way?

443
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,380
Not at all.

444
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,110
Professor Oh has a young child.

445
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,780
Have you babysat for him?

446
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,390
I babysat Ha Ni...

447
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,220
only because I volunteered.

448
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,960
From what I've heard,

449
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,190
Professor Oh ruined your engagement.

450
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:13,530
There was a man
my parents had hoped I'd marry...

451
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,030
for a long time.

452
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,300
When I refused to marry him,

453
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,500
they blamed Professor Oh.

454
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,770
This is between my parents and me.

455
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,380
It has nothing to do
with Professor Oh.

456
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,580
Then why did your father...

457
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,710
send this letter to the school
if that's not what happened?

458
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,380
I came to a decision...

459
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,520
that went against
my parents' wishes.

460
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,620
They couldn't accept it,

461
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,490
so now they're blaming Professor Oh.

462
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,930
That's why...

463
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,300
I just feel really sorry
toward Professor Oh.

464
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,000
Come in.

465
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,880
Do you have a class today?

466
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,520
No, I just met with
the Dean of Academic Affairs.

467
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,280
I see.

468
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,160
It must've surprised you.
Are you okay?

469
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,130
Yes, I'm good.

470
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,960
I never expected my dad
to send a letter to the university.

471
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:26,200
My dad is capable of much more
than I realized.

472
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,140
I spoke to the dean
and explained things...

473
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,140
in a way that wouldn't hurt you.

474
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,050
Also,

475
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,780
my wedding has been called off.

476
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,820
I hope...

477
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:49,030
the wedding being off
is good news to you.

478
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,800
But that's probably
wishful thinking.

479
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,600
I'll get going, then.

480
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,040
Se Ri.

481
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,850
What worries me most...

482
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,980
is that you'll end up
getting hurt...

483
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,120
and suffer because of it.

484
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:16,750
That's all I worry about.

485
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,320
Thank you, Professor.

486
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,800
But you don't have
to worry about me anymore.

487
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,600
From now on, I'm going to be brave.

488
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,680
What do you think you're doing?

489
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,050
Dad wrote a letter to my university.

490
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,580
What?

491
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:51,290
I didn't know you and Dad
could be so cruel.

492
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,160
I'm really disappointed.

493
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,160
So you'll just pack your stuff
and run away from home?

494
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,900
There's nothing I can do
in this house.

495
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,860
Se Ri.

496
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,870
I want to escape from the shadow
of you and Dad now.

497
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,140
I'll do what I want to do...

498
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:10,210
and meet whom I want to meet.
That's how I want to live my life.

499
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,010
Wait. Don't get so worked up.

500
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,280
Let's sit down
and calmly have a talk.

501
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,050
I have nothing to say to you.

502
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,150
I'm so sick of everything.

503
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,490
- What?
- You and Dad...

504
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,760
always get your own way
and act stubborn.

505
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,590
I can't take it anymore.

506
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,830
It's just terrible.

507
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,930
Do you think I'm terrible?

508
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:38,370
Yes. You're really terrible.

509
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,700
How could you do this to me?

510
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,040
You know what I've been through
to raise you!

511
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:48,650
You raised me to marry me off
to the son of LX Hotel.

512
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,650
- What?
- As if failing to marry Gyeol...

513
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,450
was the end of the world.

514
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,920
You acted
as if my life would be ruined.

515
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,490
Fine. Do as you please.

516
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,790
If you want to run away from home,
go ahead and leave now.

517
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,460
If you think you can be happy...

518
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,560
on your own
after abandoning your mom and dad,

519
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,270
go ahead and have it your way!

520
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:40,100
Without a car and money,

521
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,200
let's see how long you can hold out.

522
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,940
I'm leaving now.

523
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Come in.

524
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,200
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

525
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,570
We met yesterday,

526
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,000
but you missed me already?
Is that why you're here?

527
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,800
My goodness.

528
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:56,510
Why do you keep making
such cheesy jokes?

529
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,540
It was supposed to be sweet,
but was it cheesy?

530
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,080
Have a seat.

531
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:12,160
Before delivering the makgeolli,

532
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,090
I wanted to see you and thank you.

533
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:19,900
I finally got to take out a loan
from the bank.

534
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,430
And it's twice as much as last time.

535
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,300
I'm glad to hear that.

536
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,910
It was you who talked
to the headquarters, right?

537
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,280
That was the easiest one
of all the things I could do,

538
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,610
and I'm good at those things.

539
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:38,850
It's nothing difficult.

540
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:45,520
I feel like
I'm such a selfish person,

541
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,560
which is upsetting.

542
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,330
While getting help from you,

543
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,370
I can't give you what you want.

544
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,600
I feel bad.

545
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,240
I have mixed feelings about it.

546
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,440
I told you before.

547
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,810
I'll do the giving.
You just need to receive.

548
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,380
I'm just doing this
because I want to.

549
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,750
You don't have to worry about it.

550
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,220
CEO Ma.

551
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,790
Just get a load off your mind...

552
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:26,060
and focus on taking care
of the brewery.

553
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,300
When everything is settled
and you're ready,

554
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,230
you can come to me then.

555
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,370
I won't rush things
like I did before.

556
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,710
Come in.

557
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,850
Dr. Park Hyeong Jun is here.

558
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,320
- Let him in.
- Yes, sir.

559
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,960
He's a close friend of mine.

560
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,690
He said he'd stop by...

561
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:59,200
to have some tea with me
after the seminar at the hotel.

562
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,600
Okay.

563
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,800
Come on in.

564
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:10,370
This is my oldest friend,

565
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,910
Dr. Park Hyeong Jun.

566
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,080
And this is CEO Ma Kwang Sook...

567
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,710
of Eagle Brewery.

568
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,950
Hello. Nice to meet you.

569
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,290
Nice to meet you.

570
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:25,420
I'll leave you two alone now.

571
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,890
I'll get going.

572
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:38,500
So is she the one
with the fateful spark?

573
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:40,000
What?

574
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,310
Well, Yes.

575
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:45,540
I can tell it right away.

576
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,410
I can feel her tremendous energy.

577
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:52,080
Right. She's incredibly energetic.

578
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:55,820
She's brave, honest, and cheerful.

579
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:59,660
So have you made a lot of progress?

580
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,690
Not at all.

581
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,960
Why not? Is there a problem?

582
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:10,870
I guess
she's still not so sure about me.

583
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,340
I need to try harder.

584
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:31,950
All right.

585
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,290
(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

586
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:36,130
Although it isn't as much
as before the incident,

587
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,760
we're getting more orders...

588
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,360
for Jang-Kwang Makgeolli
from customers.

589
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,360
It's not just Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

590
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,000
I think Jang-Kwang Yakju is...

591
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,300
really popular among foreigners.

592
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,300
After we start exporting
our products to the US,

593
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,770
we expect to see an increase
in demand for Jang-Kwang Yakju,

594
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,770
so we're planning to increase...

595
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,980
the production of Jang-Kwang Yakju.

596
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,780
- My goodness.
- That's great.

597
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,120
My gosh.

598
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,950
We meet again.

599
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,860
Oh, hello.

600
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,290
Excuse me. If you're not busy,

601
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,530
would you like
to have some tea with me?

602
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,410
Dong Seok and I...

603
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,810
went to the same school
from elementary school to college.

604
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,950
And we've been close friends
ever since.

605
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,320
I see.

606
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,650
I'm pretty sure that I know him
better than anyone else.

607
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,120
But these days,
he seems quite unfamiliar to me.

608
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,930
He looks like a teenage boy in love.

609
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,030
He's not like the friend
whom I've known.

610
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,840
A few days ago,

611
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,640
he called me
after having a few drinks.

612
00:38:58,110 --> 00:38:59,680
And he complained about something.

613
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,750
He may seem like
he has everything in the world,

614
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,980
but he says
he doesn't have anything.

615
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,090
He failed to win the heart
of the woman he loved,

616
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:16,490
which is the only thing he wanted,

617
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,290
so he feels like...

618
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:21,800
he doesn't have anything with him.
That's what he said.

619
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:30,510
So please take good care
of my friend.

620
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:35,110
After his wife died,
he shut the doors of his heart.

621
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:38,110
He has lived a dull life
for 15 years.

622
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,450
And now, thanks to you,

623
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:44,220
he has finally opened his heart.

624
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,500
Do I seem...

625
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,870
like I have everything
the world can offer?

626
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:03,510
Yes. You have it all.

627
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:05,740
I guess you can say
I have almost everything.

628
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,280
But there's one thing I don't have.

629
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:11,650
What's that?

630
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,050
Maybe later.

631
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,790
I'll tell you
when it feels like the right time.

632
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:33,200
(Eagle Brewery)

633
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,220
Jang Soo.

634
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,990
What should I do?

635
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:05,670
I feel like I'm betraying you.

636
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:10,170
I try to be tough...

637
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,980
and tell myself I shouldn't do this.

638
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,450
But I keep falling for...

639
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,750
Chairman Han.

640
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:29,530
I know I shouldn't hurt you,
Jang Soo.

641
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,200
What should I do?

642
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:48,810
(Eagle Brewery)

643
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,800
I noticed it was missing...

644
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,430
and wondered where I'd dropped it.

645
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,000
It was in your garden.

646
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,640
I was...

647
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,580
going to call you too.

648
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,350
I'm sorry about that day.

649
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,080
My husband has
such high hopes for Se Ri.

650
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:31,720
He feels completely betrayed.

651
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,990
I was quite startled.

652
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:38,860
But my brother...

653
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,700
isn't the type
who would ever seduce a student...

654
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,830
like your husband suggested.

655
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:46,270
I know very well...

656
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,600
that Beom Soo isn't like that.

657
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,310
I apologize once again.

658
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,250
Were you crying?

659
00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:05,590
What?

660
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:07,660
Your eyes are puffy.

661
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,230
Oh, that?

662
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:12,860
The truth is,

663
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,070
Se Ri left home.

664
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:17,970
What?

665
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,970
She left her card and car key...

666
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,370
and left with nothing.

667
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:24,340
Hey.

668
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,510
If you get in touch with her,
could you give me a call?

669
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,850
Yes, I'll do that.

670
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,550
I'm not sure...

671
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:37,850
how this will come across,

672
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,260
but Beom Soo is a really great guy.

673
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,330
We were extra close
because he was the fourth,

674
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,430
and I considered him my role model.

675
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,740
The way he studied,
spoke, and carried himself...

676
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,270
I copied him,

677
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:59,040
and that's how
I managed to stay on track.

678
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:03,450
Beom Soo is my older brother,
but to me,

679
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,980
he's more like a tutor.

680
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,580
I see.

681
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:13,020
Professor Oh is the reason...

682
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:19,600
you grew up into a nice young man.

683
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,670
Heung Soo told me that...

684
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,700
when I was a baby,

685
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,340
you carried me, dressed me,
and put me to bed.

686
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,940
You adored me
like you were my nanny.

687
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:49,020
Are you all right?

688
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,720
I'm sorry.

689
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,850
Hearing that brought back memories.

690
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:33,070
Thank you.

691
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:40,680
For growing up so well.

692
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,270
Hey, Kang Soo.

693
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,240
Se Ri left home?

694
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:18,680
She didn't say anything
when we met earlier today.

695
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:22,650
Okay. I'll give her a call. Bye.

696
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:46,380
(Professor Oh Beom Soo)

697
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,430
She won't take my call either.

698
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,500
Where do you think she went?

699
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,430
I don't know.

700
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,370
She gets scared easily,

701
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:14,100
and she doesn't enjoy
hanging out with friends.

702
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:16,370
I can't say.

703
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:21,180
Her mother cried a lot
out of concern.

704
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:23,910
It weighs on me.

705
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:28,150
She has never disobeyed her mother.

706
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:29,950
What do you think...

707
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:32,850
made her so brave?

708
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,160
Oh, gosh.

709
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,340
That's heavy. Let's do it together.

710
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,500
This is nothing to me.

711
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,610
It might be nothing,
but let's share the load anyway.

712
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:13,430
- Excuse me for a bit.
- Okay.

713
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,070
Where are you?

714
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,240
What do you think? I'm at home.

715
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,410
Yeoung Ju called this morning.

716
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,780
You didn't come home last night
or call her.

717
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,510
We're divorced.

718
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,710
Whether I come home or not...

719
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,620
is up to me, so don't butt in.

720
00:48:34,820 --> 00:48:36,250
You promised...

721
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:37,990
to look after Yeoung Ju.

722
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,720
How can you leave her alone at home?

723
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:44,460
Yeoung Ju's grown up.
She's not a kid anymore.

724
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:47,930
I know you're crazy about men,

725
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,830
but look after your kid too.

726
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,200
What?

727
00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:53,540
I'm crazy about men?

728
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:55,340
How dare you say that?

729
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,640
Do you think I stay out at night
to be with a man?

730
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:02,580
I have stuff I can't share too.

731
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,550
What stuff is that?

732
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,550
Why should I tell you about it?

733
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:11,250
Don't mind me.

734
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,100
What's wrong with her?

735
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,670
What is it? Is something wrong?

736
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,770
It's nothing serious.

737
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,740
Hey!

738
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:38,380
What a lovely scene.

739
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,450
When do I get to attend the wedding?

740
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:45,420
What about you, Heung Soo?

741
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,790
If you keep playing hard to get,

742
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:48,690
someone else is going
to snatch up Ok Bun.

743
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,160
Goodness. Come on, Mi Sun.

744
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,760
You're being ridiculous.

745
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,900
How is that ridiculous?

746
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,870
She has a great personality,
she's independent,

747
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:58,870
and she's pretty.

748
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:01,100
Men would line up to date her.

749
00:50:01,270 --> 00:50:03,870
Chun Soo, even if men lined up
from Seoul to Busan,

750
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:05,610
Ok Bun would still only have eyes
for me.

751
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:07,440
I'm her whole world.

752
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,210
Don't you think
you're being a little overconfident?

753
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,980
What if a great guy...

754
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,620
suddenly shows up in her life?

755
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:17,620
She's right. Don't be too smug.

756
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,550
You never know
what'll happen in life.

757
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:22,260
Guys, save it.

758
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,990
Don't worry about me.

759
00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:26,330
Just hurry up
and set a date for your wedding.

760
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:29,600
Unbelievable.

761
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,120
Hello, Doctor.

762
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:52,790
The checkup showed...

763
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:55,420
a slight decline
in stomach and intestinal function.

764
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:59,160
I advise an IV drip
along with additional treatments.

765
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:02,130
I thought it'd be best
to keep Gureum here...

766
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:04,170
and provide treatment
for the next 2 to 3 days.

767
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,570
However, it doesn't have an owner.

768
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,970
I'll be the owner.

769
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:13,780
So don't worry about the cost.

770
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:16,550
Just take good care of Gureum...

771
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:18,510
until it gets better.

772
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,020
What an angel you are.

773
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:27,590
Gureum sure is a lucky one.

774
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,560
Did you just call me an angel?

775
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,240
Why are you sulking in bed again?

776
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,210
Did you and Se Ri argue?

777
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:51,210
Se Ri isn't home.

778
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:53,450
Where did she go?

779
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:55,750
She ran away from home.

780
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,720
What? She did what?

781
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,120
She ran away from home.

782
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,120
When?

783
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,730
Earlier in the day.

784
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,390
She left her credit cards
and car key behind.

785
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:10,070
She packed some of her clothes
and left.

786
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,200
What?

787
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:14,270
How could you let her run away?

788
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:15,440
You should've stopped her!

789
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,910
This is all your fault!

790
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:19,010
What did I do?

791
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,610
You wrote a letter
to her university.

792
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:25,710
She was so angry about it
that she ran away from home!

793
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:29,220
My one and only daughter
lost her chance to get married.

794
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,990
I had every right to do that
as her father.

795
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:32,890
What's the big deal
about that letter?

796
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:35,290
Don't ask me.

797
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:38,960
Call the police or whatever.
Do what you want!

798
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:44,070
Both my daughter and my husband
only do as they please.

799
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,600
Darn it!

800
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:00,780
What now?

801
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,390
Why are you back here?

802
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:06,020
Where's Oh Beom Soo?

803
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:08,020
Why are you looking for Beom Soo?

804
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:10,890
My daughter ran away from home.

805
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:12,590
She ran away from home!

806
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,000
So what if she ran away?

807
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,300
That doesn't explain
why you're here.

808
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,730
Look at that attitude.

809
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:20,540
Beom Soo seduced my daughter,
and now she has run away!

810
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,240
Now you've gone too far.

811
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,440
Stay out of it!

812
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:26,340
- What...
- Hey!

813
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:27,710
Why you...

814
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,110
- Darn.
- Hey!

815
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,880
Hey. Hold on!

816
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:32,710
Oh Beom Soo, get out here!

817
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,050
- What's that?
- Get out here, you jerk!

818
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:37,990
Oh Beom Soo!

819
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:39,190
- Wait.
- My goodness.

820
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:40,490
- This is...
- Goodness me.

821
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:41,860
Where's Oh Beom Soo?

822
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:42,860
Get out here!

823
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:45,590
How dare you barge in here
like this?

824
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:47,200
Why are you yelling in our home?

825
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,600
He isn't here now.

826
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,170
As if.

827
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:53,200
Where did he hide my Se Ri?

828
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:55,070
We know nothing about this.

829
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:56,100
Leave this instant.

830
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,310
And who may you be?

831
00:53:57,310 --> 00:53:59,110
Don't make another scene
and please leave.

832
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,740
Are you the youngest?

833
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,950
You're not an Oh,
so this doesn't concern you.

834
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:12,550
What...

835
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,960
Don't just stand there.
Drag him out of here!

836
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,160
- Get him out of here!
- Leave.

837
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:20,160
- Let go.
- Leave!

838
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,430
Let go of me!

839
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,000
Darn.

840
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,170
I won't move an inch...

841
00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:27,170
until you bring me my daughter.

842
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:29,940
I never thought
anyone could be this rude!

843
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:31,870
I thought I heard a dog barking.

844
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:32,970
It was this mutt all along.

845
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,680
Words won't get through to him.

846
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:38,210
Guys, each of you grab a limb.

847
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:39,210
Sure.

848
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:41,380
- We'll lift on three.
- Got it.

849
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,420
One, two, three.

850
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:47,120
Let go. Put me down.
What do you think you're doing?

851
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:49,590
Let go of me, you punks.

852
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:52,060
- Bring me my daughter!
- How can this family...

853
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:55,260
never have a day of peace and quiet?

854
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,030
To get away from this madness,

855
00:54:58,370 --> 00:54:59,370
I need...

856
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:02,140
to go back...

857
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:05,340
to Golden Castle!

858
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,110
You punks.
I'll call the cops on all of you...

859
00:55:10,110 --> 00:55:11,410
and have you put behind bars.

860
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:13,750
This is assault!

861
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:16,380
Says the one
who should be put behind bars!

862
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,320
You made a fake video...

863
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:20,090
to sabotage our brewery!

864
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:22,160
Why are you bringing that up
right now?

865
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,530
Get Beom Soo out here!

866
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:27,960
Where did you hide my daughter?

867
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,960
- Darn.
- That hurts.

868
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:35,270
- Get lost!
- My daughter.

869
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,170
Where's my daughter?

870
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,140
Get going this instant!

871
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:40,740
Yes, of course.

872
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,080
Let me out.

873
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:44,810
Where did you hide my daughter?

874
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:46,010
My daughter!

875
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,320
Get going already.

876
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,460
Tell Beom Soo!

877
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:59,830
He'd better bring my daughter home!

878
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,260
Why aren't the garbage men...

879
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:03,870
collecting that piece of trash?

880
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:05,270
Try to calm down, Kwang Sook.

881
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:06,530
Darn it.

882
00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:12,440
At first, I wasn't deeply affected,

883
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,840
but now that some time has passed,

884
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:18,350
I feel a void
in the corner of my heart.

885
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,420
But I don't resent Se Ri at all.

886
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,420
In a way,

887
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,520
I respect how she went after...

888
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,790
what she wanted.

889
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:33,700
It's a relief to be able...

890
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:36,630
to move on
to the next chapter of your life...

891
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:37,830
without hating someone.

892
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,870
You're doing great.

893
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,370
Right, Dad?

894
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,640
Of course.

895
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:46,440
These are difficult times
for both of us,

896
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,010
but let's do our best
to power through.

897
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:52,210
How so?
Is something going on with you?

898
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,190
That's a story for another time.

899
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,710
He may seem like
he has everything in the world,

900
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:24,880
but he says
he doesn't have anything.

901
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,220
He failed to win the heart
of the woman he loved,

902
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,620
which is the only thing he wanted,

903
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:32,250
so he feels like...

904
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:35,460
he doesn't have anything with him.
That's what he said.

905

(Eagle Brewery)

906
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:50,940
Cancel the 3 p.m. meeting...

907
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,070
and tell them we'll reschedule
at a later time.

908
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,440
(Eagle Brewery)

909
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,150
Is something up?

910
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:16,200
How did it happen?

911
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:18,030
I have no idea.

912
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,340
Oh, dear. That's terrible.

913
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,440
Hello.

914
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,940
Hello, you're here.

915
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,610
What's got you talking so seriously?

916
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:29,640
Did something happen?

917
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:33,350
Chairman Han got in a car accident.

918
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,250
A car accident?

919
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:38,920
Is it serious?

920
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,420
I'm afraid I don't have the details.

921
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:43,360
I was in a meeting with Mr. Park...

922
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:45,860
when he suddenly left
after receiving a call.

923
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,030
Do you know which hospital
he was taken to?

924
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,940
Did you hear about it?

925
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,410
Hear about what?

926
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:59,940
Chairman Han
has got in a car accident.

927
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:01,540
I think the injuries are serious.

928
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:02,910
What? Oh, no.

929
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,050
Could they be life-threatening?

930
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:06,180
I don't know.

931
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,350
I really hope it's nothing serious.

932
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:09,620
Tell me about it.

933
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:35,240
It'll be okay.

934
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:37,910
He'll be fine.

(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

937
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:08,940
What problem?

938
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:11,610
The dress was damaged?

939
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,650
That's right. It's him.

940
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:20,020
- Are you okay?
- Are you making a move on me?

941
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:23,120
Mr. Han Dong Seok.

942
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:28,130
To be honest,
you left a bad first impression.

943
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,200
But I see you in a new light now.

944
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:34,740
I think you're nicer than you look.

945
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,210
I know you don't know me
very well yet,

946
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,210
but I'm the sweetest person...

947
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,880
when it comes to
the people I care about.

948
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:50,590
When everything is settled
and you're ready,

949
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:52,550
you can come to me then.

950
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,660
I won't rush things
like I did before.

954
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:33,560
Excuse me.

955
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,800
Where's Han Dong Seok
who came in after a car accident?

956
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,430
Don't you see I'm with a patient?

957
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,600
Sorry.

958
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:01,320
Let's dress the wound.

959
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,010
Chairman Han.

960
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,480
What are you doing here, CEO Ma?

(For Eagle Brothers)

962
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,000
Please don't do anything.

963
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,870
Don't cause a fuss
and make things worse.

964
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:54,140
"Cause a fuss?"

965
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,700
You can't say that to your husband.

966
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,240
How can you be so cold?

967
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:00,610
He's so selfish and self-centered.

968
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:04,050
I can't help
but compare him to the vet.

969
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:07,010
As you must know,

970
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:08,850
I have a trauma.

971
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,350
I won't die.

972
01:04:11,390 --> 01:04:14,790
I still have a mission left,
and that is to make you happy.

973
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:16,860
Until I've completed that,

974
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,060
I won't die.
