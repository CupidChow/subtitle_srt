00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,180
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,080
This feels wrong
no matter how I think about it.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,750
We already settled this,
so what now?

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:13,990
It'd be a nuisance...

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:16,990
for me to stay at the brewery
when Jang Soo's not around.

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,890
How many times must I tell you
that you're not putting anyone out?

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,530
I'm scared to live in
that big house...

8
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,000
with just my mom.

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,430
A few days ago,

10
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,370
a stray cat jumped into the yard
in the middle of the night.

11
00:00:28,370 --> 00:00:31,440
My mom and I got hysterical
thinking it was a burglar.

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:39,910
It's too scary for two women
to live alone,

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:41,650
so I'm asking you to keep us safe.

14
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:43,620
Are you going to turn
your back on us?

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,950
Is that the right attitude
for a defender of our nation?

16
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,190
- That's not what I meant.
- If not,

17
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,420
then just do
as your sister-in-law says.

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,430
Got it?

19
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,430
Saying it's scary is just an excuse.

20
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,000
She wants to stay close to him
to look after him.

21
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,940
Chun Soo, do something.

22
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,970
She's so stubborn about it
that I can't get a word in.

23
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:11,140
He could just stay with me.

24
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:16,250
Did her mother agree to this?

25
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,450
Kwang Sook said
she got her approval.

26
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,050
There's no way she'd agree to it.

27
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,850
I bet Kwang Sook
made this decision alone.

28
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,820
Does this mean our baby brother...

29
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,260
around Ms. Gong?

30
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,040
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

31
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,700
This must be the makgeolli
from the news.

32
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,210
That's right.

33
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,840
It's Jang-Kwang Makgeolli
that's the talk of the town.

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,740
- Dr. Lee, allow me.
- Sure.

35
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,880
From what I saw on the news,

36
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,380
your daughter seems to have
a knack for business.

37
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,620
I don't want to sound like
I'm bragging about my daughter,

38
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,790
but CEO Ma is a supertaster.

39
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,230
- A supertaster?
- A supertaster?

40
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,360
That's right.

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,100
With just one sip
of any alcoholic beverage,

42
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,270
she can identify...

43
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,670
the ingredients
and the ratio of them.

44
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,670
Goodness.
She's a supertaster for sure.

45
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,570
It's an impressive feat...

46
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,910
to have makgeolli sold at LX Hotel.

47
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,080
Your daughter is truly remarkable.

48
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,380
Dr. Hwang, your high praise...

49
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,650
makes me a proud mother.

50
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,650
Now, everyone.
Let's all raise our glasses.

51
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:28,950
Here.

52
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,990
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

53
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,360
You're here, Professor.

54
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,730
Goodness, Chairman Han.
It's been a while.

55
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,000
He was a student of mine.

56
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,440
Is that so?

57
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,170
Well, I'm CEO Ma's mother.

58
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,210
We met at the brewery
a few days ago.

59
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,710
Oh, right.

60
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,010
What a small world this is.

61
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,210
I had no idea you were one
of Dr. Hwang's students.

62
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,350
He's actually one of my favorites.

63
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,820
Goodness me. I see.

64
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,020
Anyway, Ms. Gong...

65
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,590
is like family and a close friend,

66
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,230
so do right by Eagle Brewery,
Chairman Han.

67
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,260
Right.

68
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,600
Does the food suit your palate?

69
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,240
The food is always exceptional,

70
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,310
but it tastes even better today
thanks to Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

71
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,680
I'll make sure
you're served well tonight.

72
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,610
Enjoy your evening, then.

73
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,420
Goodness, what a small world.

74
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:40,330
I had no idea
Chairman Han of LX Hotel...

75
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,930
was one of your favorite students.

76
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:45,100
He'll do right by the brewery
since I put in a good word.

77
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,970
I appreciate everything.

78
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,370
My one and only daughter...

79
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,370
became a widow
ten days into her marriage,

80
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,310
and I was worried
she might lose her mind.

81
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,510
It's a good thing she was able
to pull herself together...

82
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,950
and focus on the business.

83
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:05,080
Don't you want her to remarry
given how young she still is?

84
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,820
Of course, I want that.

85
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,050
She should start fresh
with someone decent.

86
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:12,020
Then why don't I set up
a blind date for her?

87
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,490
My nephew is divorced,

88
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,430
and is doing well at Hanse Group.

89
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,660
Yes! A million times, yes!

90
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,400
My youngest brother-in-law
lost his wife three years ago,

91
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,770
and they didn't have any children.

92
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,410
Goodness me.

93
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,270
He used to be a pro golfer.

94
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,210
These days, he teaches clients...

95
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,740
and runs a golf business,

96
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,950
which is quite successful.

97
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,150
Your brother-in-law, Dr. Lee?

98
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,250
I would say yes
without even blinking!

99
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,430
A lot of my students
are now living alone.

100
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,600
Bingo.

101
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:53,030
Anyone you recommend...

102
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:55,300
would instantly have
the nation's stamp of approval.

103
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,870
Please settle on a date
as soon as you can.

104
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:01,010
If all goes well,

105
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,880
I'll return the favor
with a stylish suit.

106
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,840
- Let's raise our glasses.
- Sure.

107
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,450
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

108
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,990
A premium strategy that emphasizes
craftsmanship has proven successful.

109
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,560
We do not compromise and stick to
the traditional way of brewing.

110
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,430
Makgeolli is an honest liquor.

111
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,660
Rice harvested from healthy land,

112
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:26,160
clear water, and our special nuruk.

113
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,470
We bring out the best flavors
with those three ingredients.

114
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,240
- Have you seen this?
- That's what defines our makgeolli.

115
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
- Sorry?
- Finding a new way...

116
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,710
- to bring back...
- Did you watch...

117
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,910
the TV interview
with Eagle Brewery's CEO?

118
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,110
Yes, I watched it.

119
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,110
What's your take on it?

120
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,450
I must say she had a way with words.

121
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,250
Why you... You punk!

122
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,590
I didn't ask for a review!

123
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,890
Even that tiny brewery
made the news,

124
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:56,130
so why aren't we doing any better?

125
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,360
Well...

126
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,000
I followed up on your order...

127
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,400
and suggested tweaking...

128
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,640
some of our existing recipes.

129
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,710
But?

130
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,040
None of them met the standards
we expected.

131
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,650
Unless we implement
a premium production line...

132
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,520
Premium or whatnot!
We must do what is needed.

133
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,150
How can Silla be seen
as a second-rate brewery?

134
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:25,090
Have the head of sales
and the technical director...

135
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:26,890
come up with a plan
to implement a premium line.

136
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,430
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

137
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,130
The money we set aside
to buy Eagle Brewery...

138
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,800
will all be poured into that.

139
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Shoot.

140
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,030
Darn it!

141
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,780
He said I could bring Ha Ni.

142
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,510
His children are grown...

143
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,010
Don't be ridiculous!

144
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,080
Professor Oh is a single dad?

145
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,750
That never crossed my mind.

146
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,930
Why have you been staying
in your room all day?

147
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,960
Are you not feeling well?

148
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,640
Gosh, no.
I had something to think about.

149
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,240
Is something troubling you?

150
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,340
Mom.

151
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,080
What could make a woman walk out...

152
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,080
on her newborn baby?

153
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,580
What?

154
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,320
I've been trying to understand,
but I'm still at a loss.

155
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,920
Even if she didn't love
her husband anymore,

156
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,130
it still wouldn't be right to leave
her newborn baby.

157
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,000
And then, after all this time,
she wants her child back?

158
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,530
How shameless is that?

159
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,040
Be clearer with your words.
Who are you talking about?

160
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,100
What?

161
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,840
It's just someone I know.

162
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,780
Right.

163
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,810
I'm sure that woman
had her own reasons.

164
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,150
The mother wouldn't have left...

165
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,390
her newborn baby without a reason.

166
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,690
What?

167
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,220
What reason?

168
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,120
One can never be forgiven...

169
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,590
for abandoning their child.

170
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,260
No way.

171
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,500
(Eagle Brewery)

172
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,540
Kwang Sook.

173
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:25,610
I urge you to rethink this.

174
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,910
You haven't been around in a while,
so stay for dinner.

175
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,150
Kwang Sook, please.

176
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,420
I promised your big brother.

177
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,720
That I'd do for you all...

178
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,820
what your late mother would've done.

179
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,830
It's not just because
of that promise.

180
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,870
My mom and I live alone
in this huge house,

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,440
and it can get scary and daunting.

182
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:57,910
We're in desperate need
of Kang Soo's help.

183
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,050
Did you really talk this through
with your mother?

184
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,080
Yes.

185
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,350
My mom was much more pleased
about it than me.

186
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,720
Isn't this house too big
for just the two of us?

187
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,920
Don't you think it'd be nice...

188
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,230
to have a handsome and sweet son?

189
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,800
A son-in-law is the same as a son.

190
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,370
Okay, then.

191
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,640
Kwang Sook insists.

192
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,210
Stay here for a while,

193
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,940
fix up the house and brewery,

194
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,340
and sort out their complaints.

195
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,720
Okay. I'll do that.

196
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,820
Let's all go inside.

197
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,620
How about budae jjigae for dinner?

198
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,190
Budae jjigae is my specialty.

199
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,430
Let's get inside.

200
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:53,160
Come along.

201
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,270
Let's go.

202
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,670
He'll need to find...

203
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,010
a place of his own
when he finds work.

204
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,240
Let him stay here until then.

205
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:06,010
That will put Kwang Sook at ease.

206
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,680
Let's do that, then.

207
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,960
I'll drop by the brewery for a bit.

208
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,760
- Okay.
- I won't be long.

209
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,770
Hello?

210
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,470
Mom. Where are you?

211
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,170
I'm almost home.

212
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,610
Already?

213
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,250
What's the busy CEO doing out here
welcoming me home?

214
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,520
Did you have a good time
with your Golden Castle friends?

215
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,390
Yes. We had an elegant lunch
at LX Hotel...

216
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,190
and watched a movie too.

217
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,960
I was the center of attention today,
and I owe that to you.

218
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,870
Everyone praised you
and said they were impressed.

219
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,040
I owe a lot to you.

220
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,910
Thank you, Mom.

221
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,810
A daughter shouldn't have to thank
her mom.

222
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,090
- Mom.
- Kwang Sook.

223
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,560
You go first.

224
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,060
No. You go first.

225
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,560
No. You go first, Mom.

226
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,430
Do you want to tell me something?

227
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:34,630
I'll tell you after I hear you out.

228
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,670
Okay. Then I'll go first.

229
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,440
My brother-in-law Kang Soo.

230
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,810
He left the navy today.

231
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,550
And he'll live with us for a while.

232
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,520
So what if he left the navy?
Why would he live with us?

233
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,420
I want him to stay with us
for a while...

234
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,420
so I can plump him up...

235
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,790
- and look after him...
- You crazy thing.

236
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,160
Why would you do something
like that?

237
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,160
I can't believe you took over
your dead husband's brewery.

238
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,030
You'll take in a brother-in-law too?

239
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,300
Don't you have a spine?

240
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,670
Are you out of your mind?

241
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,310
That really hurt.

242
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,650
I'm warning you.
I won't accept that.

243
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,450
I won't allow it.

244
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,980
He's here already.

245
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,490
I lied and said
you'd given permission.

246
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,760
What? Are you a total nutcase?

247
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,630
Let it go for my sake. Please, Mom.

248
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,830
He's the youngest brother
that Jang Soo raised like a son.

249
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,530
I want to look after him
until he recovers his health...

250
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,270
and finds a job.

251
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,170
How did I give birth to a halfwit
like you?

252
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:54,850
Oh, my darling husband.

253
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,480
Take me with you.

254
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,150
I want to go to wherever you are...

255
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,390
Mom.

256
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,030
Let it go just this once.

257
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,430
Just this one time.

258
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,000
I promise to do
as you say from now on.

259
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,340
Will you really do as I say?

260
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,240
Then go on a blind date.

261
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,140
A blind date?

262
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,950
My Golden Castle friends...

263
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,050
will set you up
with people they know.

264
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,650
Go on the dates and don't complain.

265
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,250
Are you crazy? That's ridiculous.

266
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Then I have no choice
but to kick out your brother-in-law.

267
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,420
No.

268
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,960
This isn't fair.

269
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,860
Kang Soo's inside, right?

270
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,630
Okay, fine. I'll do it.

271
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,230
I'll do it.

272
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,480
I'll go on the blind date.

273
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,490
Here you go.

274
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,530
Hello.

275
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,500
Welcome, Kang Soo.

276
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,000
Make yourself at home, okay?

277
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,840
Thank you, Ms. Gong.

278
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,940
You wanted a son your whole life.

279
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,910
Now you have one.

280
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,720
Yes.

281
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,420
I'm so blessed in my old age.

282
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,190
I'm grateful...

283
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,360
that you think so.

284
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,730
He'll stay only until he gets well
and finds a job.

285
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,900
Let's catch up...

286
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,470
over our dinner feast.

287
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,340
This looks amazing.

288
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,910
I'll serve Ms. Gong first.

289
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,080
Excuse me.

290
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,720
- I'll serve.
- At this crucial moment...

291
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,950
(Ms. Ji)

292
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,590
(Angel Piano)

293
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,090
(Ms. Ji)

294
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,360
- I'll serve the others.
- This is for you, Kwang Sook.

295
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,060
Transferring to voicemail...

296
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,770
He won't take my calls now?

297
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,910
One day,

298
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,580
you'll bow to me with gratitude.

299
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,510
(Angel Piano)

300
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
Shoot.

301
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,420
You...

302
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,730
I got you today.

303
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,430
Taxi!

304
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,170
That car, sir.

305
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,470
Follow that car.

306
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,270
Don't lose it.

307
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,490
Think again.

308
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,500
Catching them at it
won't do you any good.

309
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,030
What?

310
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,370
Aren't you after
your cheating husband?

311
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,840
My cheating what?

312
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,070
I'm about to catch
a fraud red-handed.

313
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,240
What?

314
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,440
Hey.

315
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,780
Turn right.

316
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,180
Don't lose track of that car.

317
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,850
Okay. I won't.

318
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,290
She said she lived in Gangnam.

319
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,590
Why is she heading up so high?

320
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,420
Hello?

321
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,490
You closed already?

322
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,600
I came to get a trim.

323
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,060
Come early tomorrow morning.

324
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:16,400
What's up?
Why did you close this early?

325
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,500
Are you unwell?

326
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:20,470
No. Something important came up.

327
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,510
Okay. See you tomorrow.

328
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,490
What? Where did she go?

329
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,580
It's really strange.

330
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,280
She was here
just a little while ago.

331
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,550
Where on earth did she go?

332
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,300
No one's home?

333
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,270
Dad.

334
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,010
Where are you?

335
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,850
I have some work left to do,
so I'm still at school.

336
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,580
Where's the domestic helper?

337
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,150
She told us this morning
that she'd go to her hometown...

338
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,780
for her younger sibling's
60th birthday.

339
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,520
Oh, right.

340
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,660
It's dangerous at night,
so don't come home too late.

341
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:51,030
All right. Okay. Bye.

342
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,270
What is this smell?

343
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,500
They say ox knee soup...

344
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,810
is good for broken bones.

345
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,110
You're way too naive
and kindhearted.

346
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,850
Don't make Kang Soo uncomfortable.

347
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,250
Just make sure to keep your promise.

348
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,220
- What promise?
- The blind date.

349
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,650
Okay. I will.

350
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,520
Oh, right.

351
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,430
I went to the hotel earlier today...

352
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,790
and ran into Chairman Han.

353
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,160
What a small world.

354
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,200
Chairman Han
used to be Dr. Hwang's student.

355
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,870
I see.

356
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,870
Dr. Hwang asked Chairman Han...

357
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,970
to take good care of you.

358
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,010
Why would he do that?

359
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,480
Chairman Han is obsessed
with integrity.

360
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,240
He hates it when he's asked
for a special favor.

361
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,750
Obsessed with integrity?

362
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,650
When I gave him
some makgeolli as a gift,

363
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,550
he almost called off
the supply contract.

364
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:33,020
He must've been annoyed
because he wasn't satisfied...

365
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,560
with the lame gift.

366
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,130
Seriously,
he's so particular and picky.

367
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:38,300
- What?
- What a jerk.

368
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,060
Gosh, it's hot. Darn it!

369
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:43,830
Hey.

370
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,370
When I gave him
some makgeolli as a gift,

371
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,440
he almost called off
the supply contract.

372
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,580
He must've been annoyed
because he wasn't satisfied...

373
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,100
Honey, why is there still no news?

374
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,340
About what?

375
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,840
About the makgeolli
that you brought as a sample.

376
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,810
Why is there no news
of it being released?

377
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,520
It's the best makgeolli
you've ever made.

378
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,620
Is there any problem?

379
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,750
- Come on!
- My goodness.

380
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,820
I told you
not to meddle in my business.

381
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,960
You startled me.

382
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,800
I'm not meddling.

383
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,660
I'm just asking because I'm curious.

384
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,470
It'll be released when it's time.

385
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,500
Can't you just wait patiently?

386
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,470
What's wrong
that's making you feel so down?

387
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,310
Se Ri, where are you going?

388
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,810
I'm going to school.

389
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,150
You have no class today.

390
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:07,080
I'm working as Professor Oh's TA
starting today.

391
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,220
"TA?"

392
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,920
She means a teaching assistant.

393
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,160
I'm running late, so I'll go first.

394
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,520
I'll see you later.

395
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:19,030
She should just learn
to be a good wife...

396
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,730
until Gyeol finishes
his military service.

397
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,430
Why would she work
as a teaching assistant?

398
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,870
Our Se Ri...

399
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,570
will be taking over LX Hotel.

400
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,870
For Se Ri,
learning to be a good wife...

401
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,980
means studying something useful
for hotel management.

402
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,650
Apparently,

403
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,650
he's a very promising professor...

404
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,480
who studied in the US.

405
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,120
If she works as his assistant,

406
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,660
it will be helpful...

407
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,560
when she takes over the hotel.

408
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,960
So, you don't have to worry
about Se Ri.

409
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,260
You should just focus on your work.

410
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,270
Okay?

411
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,470
Come on!

412
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,740
Why are you nagging me so much
when I have to go to work?

413
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,670
Wait. I'm coming with you.

414
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:21,630
Okay.

415
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:54,720
It's nice.

416
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,530
Hello, Professor Oh.

417
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,530
Hey.

418
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,970
It's my first day,
so I took extra care of things.

419
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,200
I see.

420
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,640
This is made with my favorite beans.

421
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,880
I hope you will like it.

422
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:20,720
I can make my own coffee,
so you don't have to do this.

423
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,450
Okay.

424
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,120
It does smell good.

425
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,590
By the way,

426
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,730
this doesn't feel like my office.

427
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,900
Why not? Do you not like it?

428
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,730
I appreciate the gesture,

429
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,500
but I don't want you
to do this again.

430
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,270
This is a professor's office...

431
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:43,770
where graduate students read books
and study together.

432
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,780
I don't think
we'd need flowers here.

433
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,450
You bought them for me anyway,

434
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,280
so I'll gratefully accept them
this time.

435
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,410
But don't do that again.

436
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,050
Okay.

437
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,830
This is for the flowers and coffee.

438
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,000
Please don't do this.

439
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,130
I didn't spend much on this.

440
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,470
Still, I can't let a student
spend her own money.

441
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,740
Just take it.

442
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,740
Your office is also my workplace.

443
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,480
I just wanted to work
in a comfortable and nice place.

444
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,980
I can't take your money.

445
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,190
I will stop buying flowers.

446
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,920
If you still feel indebted,
please buy me a meal.

447
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,360
At the school cafeteria.

448
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,560
Sure.

449
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:41,930
Hold on.

450
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,740
Hello?

451
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,270
It's me, Beom Soo.

452
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,810
What now?

453
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,750
Professor, I'm heading
to the department office.

454
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,290
I believe we were done talking.

455
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,190
Ha Ni...

456
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,590
Let me see her just once.

457
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:12,730
Please.

458
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,500
Enough with this nonsense.

459
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,840
That must be Ha Ni's mom.

460
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,110
What if this upsets
Professor Oh again?

461
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:28,040
(Professor's Office, Oh Beom Soo)

462
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,900
What's the occasion?

463
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:51,500
It's not like you to call first.

464
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,940
- I'm at the airport.
- The airport?

465
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,570
Are you going somewhere?

466
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:57,110
I mean I'm
at Incheon International Airport.

467
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,010
What?

468
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,940
Incheon International Airport?

469
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,030
- Honey.
- Hey.

470
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,640
I was going to fly out there
in two days.

471
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,910
I figured it'd be better for me
to make the trip.

472
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,110
There are things to sort out anyway.

473
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,180
Let's order first.

474
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,020
What do you mean?

475
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,460
Are you saying you're out of a job?

476
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,600
In a nutshell, yes.

477
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:57,700
You've got to be kidding me.

478
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:03,110
How could you keep
something this huge from me?

479
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:04,570
I wasn't keeping it from you.

480
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,110
It never seemed like the right time.

481
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,280
I was going to tell you
when I got to the US.

482
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,480
How have you been paying
for our living expenses...

483
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,850
and Yeong Ju's tuition?

484
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,250
Was it from your severance pay?

485
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,250
I sold the apartment.

486
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,390
What?

487
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,730
I don't care if it was in your name.

488
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,860
How could you sell it
without telling me?

489
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,930
Calm down and lower your voice.

490
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,600
How can I calm down?

491
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,600
I'm sorry
I didn't discuss it with you,

492
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,970
but I didn't tell you
because I didn't want...

493
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,940
to worry you or Yeoung Ju.

494
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,780
I didn't sell the apartment
to make my own life better.

495
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,540
What can we do
now that we're in this situation?

496
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,080
This is worse than pathetic.
It's appalling.

497
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,380
Do you have to talk that way?

498
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,520
What else?

499
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,390
Should I applaud you instead?

500
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:53,920
Darn.

501
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,200
What about
your brother's inheritance?

502
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,400
- What do you mean?
- Didn't the brothers...

503
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,940
sell the brewery
and split the money?

504
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,340
We didn't split anything.

505
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,210
Our sister-in-law is running it.

506
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,650
Why is that woman
taking over the brewery?

507
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:17,810
That woman? Watch your words.

508
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:21,380
You gave the brewery to a woman
he was married to for just ten days?

509
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,690
All the brothers agreed to it.

510
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:23,890
Well, I didn't.

511
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,120
Heung Soo, Beom Soo, Kang Soo,
and I made the decision.

512
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,230
How did you reach that conclusion
when I never agreed to it?

513
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,560
Aren't I a member of this family?

514
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,160
If that's how you felt,

515
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,530
you should've come to the funeral
when we were sorting things out.

516
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,670
What good could come out
of bringing that up now?

517
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:39,000
Being the pushover you are...

518
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,600
is why you're always duped.

519
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,410
What?

520
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:47,080
I'll be staying at Seok Jin's.

521
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,850
At your brother's?

522
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,510
If I stay with you,

523
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,450
all we'll do is argue.

524
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,670
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

525
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,440
Come in.

526
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,280
Someone is here to see you, sir.

527
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,580
Someone? Who?

528
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:30,290
She's the mother of CEO Ma
at Eagle Brewery.

529
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:35,330
Why is CEO Ma's mother
here to see you?

530
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,160
Beats me.

531
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,830
There's no reason for me to see her.

532
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,870
Should I talk to her instead?

533
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,740
Ms. Gong...

534
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,400
is like family and a close friend,

535
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,370
so do right by Eagle Brewery,
Chairman Han.

536
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:56,880
Have her come in.

537
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,950
Go ahead.

538
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,490
Thank you.

539
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,820
I greeted you...

540
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,060
with Dr. Hwang
at the restaurant the other day.

541
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,690
I'm CEO Ma's mother.

542
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,060
Right. I remember.

543
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,600
I apologize for taking up your time
when you're busy.

544
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,530
I'll give you what I came here for
and be on my way.

545
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,280
I heard from my daughter...

546
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,190
that you helped her immensely...

547
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,960
in getting her makgeolli
supplied to this hotel.

548
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:44,030
Gosh, no. The decision was made...

549
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:47,500
after a blind test was conducted
by the employees.

550
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,570
My daughter and I...

551
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:53,270
see you as our lifelong savior.

552
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:58,540
A lifelong savior? That's absurd.

553
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,910
My goodness.

554
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,750
You're also quite humble.

555
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,550
CEO Ma may be on the older side,

556
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,690
but she has no grasp
on the real world.

557
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:14,120
Even I'm frustrated
by my own daughter at times.

558
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,200
Many of our guests have been
ordering Jang-Kwang Makgeolli...

559
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,930
ever since your interview aired.

560
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,000
Those who tasted it
at the restaurant...

561
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,140
come by to purchase it too.

562
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:32,280
I had no idea our makgeolli...

563
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,780
would be served at a hotel.

564
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,210
I'm overwhelmed.

565
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:39,120
Anyway,

566
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:42,190
I hope we get along.

567
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,890
I should be saying that to you.

568
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,890
Hello, Mr. Park.

569
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,390
Hello.

570
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,930
You must be here with your mother.

571
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,030
- Sorry?
- Your mother is...

572
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,500
in the chairman's office.

573
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,730
Mother...

574
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,670
as in my mom?

575
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:04,510
Yes. She came by just now
to meet with the chairman.

576
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,410
Why would my mom be here?

577
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,310
Are you kidding me?

578
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,380
Excuse me. Sorry about this.

579
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,620
Darn it!

580
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,600
What's this?

581
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,640
It's a black and white porcelain jar
from the Joseon Dynasty.

582
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:43,380
Back when my husband was alive,

583
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,080
he cherished it dearly...

584
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,580
as if it would fly away
if blown on...

585
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,350
or shatter if touched.

586
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,490
But why did you...

587
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,190
It's for you, Chairman Han.

588
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,560
For me?

589
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:07,040
(Eagle Brewery)

590
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,040
Seriously.

591
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,410
The call cannot be connected.

592
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,180
- Transferring to voicemail.
- You're killing me, Mom.

593
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:17,880
Why isn't she picking up?

594
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,490
(Eagle Brewery)

595
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,660
Shoot!

596
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,500
Darn.

597
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,000
Darn it.

598
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,600
You're going out of your way
to help my daughter.

599
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,010
Honestly, I could offer you
not just this...

600
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,370
but also Joseon white porcelain
or Goryeo celadon.

601
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,140
Please accept this
as a token of my appreciation.

602
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,350
Goodness.

603
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,280
You can't do this.

604
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,090
I can't accept this.

605
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,950
I'm coming to you
as someone's mother.

606
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,520
I mean nothing else.

607
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,290
- Here.
- But...

608
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,890
Let me say this again.

609
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:05,190
There's no reason for me
to accept this.

610
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,160
Of course, there's a reason.

611
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,030
Ever since the news coverage,
orders have been piling in,

612
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:12,700
and our online business
has taken off.

613
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,300
I owe it all to you, Chairman Han.

614
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,640
I had nothing to do with it.

615
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,280
It's because...

616
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,550
your daughter's makgeolli
is of high quality.

617
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,750
You're being too modest.

618
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,790
The brewery was close
to shutting its doors for good,

619
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:34,020
but you breathed life back into it.

620
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,730
You changed CEO Ma's life.

621
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:41,200
You have every right to accept this.

622
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:59,580
I understand your intention.

623
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:03,150
However, accepting personal gifts
from a partner or supplier...

624
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,790
goes against my business principles.

625
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,420
My conscience won't allow it either.

626
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,060
You're only embarrassing me
by saying that.

627
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:16,270
I was wondering
how to express my gratitude...

628
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,570
and wanted...

629
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:21,000
to give you something
that means the most to me.

630
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,340
I guess a porcelain jar like this...

631
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,940
must seem like nothing
to someone as wealthy as you.

632
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,920
Gosh, no. That's not what I meant.

633
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,420
But it's the most valuable thing
I own,

634
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,890
so please accept it.

635
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,960
I come to you as someone's mother.

636
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,630
Come in.

637
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,230
Goodness.

638
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,300
Mom, what are you doing here?

639
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,200
I had something to give
to Chairman Han.

640
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,110
What could you possibly give him?

641
00:38:58,370 --> 00:38:59,380
What...

642
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,340
What is this doing here?

643
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:04,080
Thanks to Chairman Han,
the brewery is doing well,

644
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,880
and my daughter was on the news.

645
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,950
I wanted to express my gratitude.

646
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,650
You're killing me.

647
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,290
I'm sorry, sir.

648
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,330
Well, there's no need to apologize.

649
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,460
- Get up.
- What? Why?

650
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,700
Goodness.

651
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,910
Oh, no. Why would you take that?

652
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,610
It's for the chairman.

653
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,610
Stop it, will you?

654
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,750
My gosh.

655
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,420
Oh, no!

656
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,160
- My gosh!
- Goodness.

657
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,730
What now?

658
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,870
But this jar means everything to me.

659
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:00,270
It's a black and white porcelain jar
from the Joseon Dynasty!

660
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:04,810
Oh, no. I can't believe I lost this.

661
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,980
No, leave that there.

662
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,250
I'll have my secretary
clean the floor.

663
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,180
I apologize for the commotion, sir.

664
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,920
Please leave with your mother.

665
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,960
What?

666
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,830
Oh, right. Of course.

667
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,100
Mom, let's go.

668
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,130
Anyway,

669
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,200
my apologies, Chairman Han.

670
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:32,570
Right.

671
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,870
I'm sorry you lost
something precious to you.

672
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,710
I know.

673
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:39,640
The jar may have shattered,

674
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,910
but please know how grateful I am.

675
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,050
Sure thing.

676
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,920
Forgive us for the intrusion.

677
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,890
I'll see you again
if the situation allows it.

678
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,390
Sure.

679
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,030
Let go.

680
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:11,840
Just a second.

681
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,160
"Made in China?"

682
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:32,660
- Made in China?
- Made in China?

683
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,500
What...

684
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:47,680
You said it was
from the Joseon Dynasty.

685
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,980
What? Well...

686
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,820
That's what your father said.

687
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:55,450
Could it have been brought
to Joseon...

688
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,950
from China by boat?

689
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,980
You're killing me, Mom.

690
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,450
How can I look at him
now that you've humiliated me?

691
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,480
Your father said...

692
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,620
it was from the Joseon Dynasty.

693
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,620
Mom!

694
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,690
Goodness me. My heart.

695
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,490
What would he think of me now?

696
00:42:37,490 --> 00:42:39,260
I already got on his bad side...

697
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,200
for putting makgeolli in his trunk.

698
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,770
That's why I came by.
To help you get...

699
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,270
on his good side.

700
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,840
My gosh.

701
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,840
You're impossible, Mom.

702
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,950
- Wait for me.
- Take the bus!

703
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:57,850
Wait for me.

704
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,020
Hold on.

705
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,060
She disappeared
around here somewhere.

706
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,440
Did your mom
allow you to get a perm?

707
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:21,900
Yes.

708
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,740
That's great. Congratulations.

709
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,410
Hey, kid.

710
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:38,290
Gosh, I'm sorry.

711
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:40,790
I thought you were someone I know.

712
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:41,960
Sorry about that.

713
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:42,960
It's fine.

714
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,490
Wait.

715
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:48,000
Do you perhaps know
a girl named Eun Seo?

716
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,430
She seems to live around here.

717
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:51,270
I don't.

718
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:53,900
Is that so?

719
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,010
Got it. Thanks anyway.

720
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,780
Is this not the right neighborhood?

721
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,120
It's currently a yoga studio,

722
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,690
but it's big enough
to fit four pianos.

723
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,690
A bus stop is right outside it,

724
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,030
which makes it
incredibly accessible.

725
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,200
The location seems better
compared to your current academy.

726
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,600
Sure. It seems that way.

727
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:26,240
It's nice to see a married couple
speaking to each other with respect.

728
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,070
You're like a pair of lovebirds.

729
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,680
We're not married, ma'am.

730
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,080
You're not?

731
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,180
I thought that was the case
because you two look good together.

732
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:43,650
Who knows if that will be the case?

733
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:03,740
What on earth?
Why are they together again?

734
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,340
Did I offend you earlier?

735
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,880
With that remark about us
possibly getting married someday.

736
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:18,220
Why would I be offended...

737
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,390
when it was only a joke?

738
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,260
I wasn't joking.

739
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:26,160
It wasn't a joke.

740
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:29,870
I...

741
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,200
I'd like us to formally date,
Ms. Kim.

742
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:38,640
You feel the same way about me,
don't you?

743
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,050
Thank you.

744
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:01,630
My gosh!

745
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:02,830
What is it?

746
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,500
Over there.

747
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,840
Goodness!

748
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,270
What...

749
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:24,720
What were you doing out here?

750
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:27,620
I believe I pleaded with you.

751
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,660
Why won't you take me seriously?

752
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:34,360
Ms. Kim's not the person
you think she is.

753
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:37,100
She's hiding a massive secret.

754
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:38,370
What secret?

755
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:40,640
Well...

756
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,710
I'm not ready to tell you yet.

757
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,340
If you give me a little time,

758
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,110
I'll reveal whatever the secret is.

759
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:49,180
My gosh.

760
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,680
It looks like you watched
too many K-dramas.

761
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,280
What?

762
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,450
Stay out of my business...

763
00:46:57,450 --> 00:46:59,450
and focus on your salon business.

764
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:02,990
Hey.

765
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:08,330
If you two want to talk a bit more,

766
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:09,570
shall I leave?

767
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,500
No. We're done.

768
00:47:11,570 --> 00:47:12,600
Let's go.

769
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:18,640
But...

770
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,920
Why that sly little...

771
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,120
Darn her.

772
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,460
Hey. What are you doing out here?

773
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,730
I was cleaning the floor.

774
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,900
Your arm's not healed yet.

775
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,240
Don't waste your energy.

776
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,870
I can do it in no time.

777
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,750
Thank you, Mr. Go.

778
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,820
For staying with my sister-in-law.

779
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:08,360
Jang Soo will thank you
from where he is too.

780
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,790
I thought you were childish
and naive,

781
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,530
but you're pretty thoughtful.

782
00:48:15,430 --> 00:48:17,330
And you're a hard worker too.

783
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,600
I like you even more.

784
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,110
Treat your sister-in-law well.

785
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,280
I will.

786
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,080
I should.

787
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,220
The CEO and her mother
got into another huge fight.

788
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:43,430
There's never a quiet day.

789
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:51,500
Why did you go to the chairman
without talking to me first?

790
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:53,840
How am I to face him now?

791
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:55,840
I didn't know this would happen!

792
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,040
You're in the wrong!
Don't yell at me!

793
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:00,410
I apologized to you
all the way back.

794
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:02,010
What more do you want?

795
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,310
Should I go on my knees?

796
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:04,980
What's the matter?

797
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:06,320
Is something wrong, Kwang Sook?

798
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,220
Kids do nothing for you
once they're grown up.

799
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:11,120
I didn't do it on purpose.

800
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,690
I meant well, and I messed up.

801
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:13,990
I can't stand it anymore.

802
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,490
Let's see how you manage without me.

803
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,790
Darn it.

804
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:19,560
Did something bad happen?

805
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,900
My mom did something terrible.

806
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,930
Something terrible?

807
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:39,450
Hang on.

808
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:42,020
If they didn't break it by mistake,

809
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,850
I'd have believed it were
a Joseon white porcelain jar.

810
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:47,420
My gosh...

811
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,560
They're really something.

812
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:04,570
Se Ri.

813
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,770
Hi.

814
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:07,210
What are you thinking about?

815
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:12,580
What you see
isn't always what you get.

816
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,820
What do you mean?

817
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:18,190
They look perfect on the outside...

818
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:20,090
as if they lack nothing at all,

819
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,690
but if you look inside,

820
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:24,490
they're full of hurt.

821
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,830
There's an insane story
they can't tell anyone.

822
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:32,600
- Who do you mean?
- What?

823
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,440
Sorry.

824
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,410
It's just someone I know.

825
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:42,040
I got a breakfast set. Let's eat.

826
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:44,550
Thank you.

827
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:51,020
(Egg Toast)

828
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:56,160
It's nice and sweet.

829
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,360
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

830
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,960
Is your TA job doable?

831
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:05,370
So-so, I guess?

832
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:07,040
Is the professor nice to you?

833
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:10,510
He doesn't say much,
and he's a bit on the cold side.

834
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,210
But I understand why.

835
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:20,480
I think I'd be the same
if I were him.

836
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:26,350
Does he have
some special circumstances?

837
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,760
What?

838
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:30,390
No.

839
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:33,900
I just have a feeling he does.

840
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,430
I see.

841
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,180
I gave birth to Ha Ni.

842
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,520
I have a right to see her
when I want to.

843
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:00,020
Isn't it too cruel
to keep her from me?

844
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:13,970
The call cannot be connected.
Transferring to...

845
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:17,210
Where on earth is she
that she won't pick up?

846
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,620
Welcome.

847
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,690
I went to a few realtors.

848
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,090
The brewery's the only thing
that hasn't changed around here.

849
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:38,860
There's a low-rise complex,

850
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,060
and a high-end townhouse
might be built.

851
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:42,600
The price of land soared.

852
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:52,710
- How much?
- Two dollars.

853
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:55,110
Thanks.

854
00:52:57,150 --> 00:52:58,780
It'll keep going up.

855
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:01,520
How could he lose it all
to his sister-in-law?

856
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,620
Here's your card.

857
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,920
Exactly.

858
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,270
I'll take my share and go.

859
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:19,970
Yeoung Ju's dad?

860
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,510
He's no help at all. He's too soft.

861
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,910
The woman was married
for just ten days,

862
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,580
and she took over the brewery...

863
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,110
that had been in his family
for generations.

864
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:32,980
Does that make any sense?

865
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,400
"I'm so very sorry..."

866
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:54,340
"for what..."

867
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,840
"happened today,"

868
00:53:58,270 --> 00:53:59,440

(Pot Number 3)

871
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:47,260
My mother went to see you
with the simple intention...

872
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,390
of showing her gratitude.

(Eagle Brewery)

874
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,830
My father got the jar
from an acquaintance...

875
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,700
who owed him money
instead of a payment.

876
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,640
The person who gave him the jar...

877
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,970
said it was from the Joseon era,

878
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:06,540
and that it was an antique
with great monetary value.

879
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:08,910
My family...

880
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,850
cherished it
as if it were a treasure.

881
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:16,820
So please,
do not have any misgivings.

882
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:19,990
I'm sorry
someone as upright as you...

883
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,060
had to witness such a disaster.

884
00:55:22,990 --> 00:55:24,030
In the future,

885
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:27,000
nothing like this will happen again.

Okay.

(Okay.)

896
00:56:58,850 --> 00:56:59,890
"Okay?"

897
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:01,290
What?

898
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:04,890
It took me hours
to write the message,

899
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,800
but he just said,

900
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,060
"Okay?"

901
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:11,500
Is that it?

902
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:24,780
She could've just said sorry.

903
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:27,350
Why did she have to say
so many things?

904
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,990
There is no one I can trust.

905
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,420
This is really baffling.

906
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:43,830
And what's wrong with this wine?

907
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,390
What are you doing here?

908
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:13,230
About Ms. Gong.
She didn't even have dinner.

909
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:15,200
She's been stuck
in her room all day.

910
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:19,230
She will be fine tomorrow morning,

911
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:20,400
so you don't have to worry.

912
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:22,640
From what I heard,

913
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,670
she just tried to help you
with your business.

914
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,780
Please don't be upset.

915
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,550
You're worried about my mom?

916
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:34,950
You're so sweet, Kang Soo.

917
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:39,320
Okay.

918
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:41,160
Now that you say that,

919
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,460
I'll be cool
and make up with my mom.

920
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:44,960
Happy now?

921
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,860
Thank you, Kwang Sook.

922
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,670
I should thank you.

923
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:54,070
I feel so reassured and happy
because I have you.

924
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:05,980
(Dancing Prince)

925
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,550
We're not married, ma'am.

926
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:14,460
You're not?

927
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:18,060
I thought that was the case
because you two look good together.

928
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:19,530
Who knows if that will be the case?

929
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:32,370
Hello?

930
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:36,840
I'm calling you as I was wondering
if you got off work yet.

931
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:40,480
Yes. I just parked
in front of my house.

932
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:42,380
Are you coming
to the class tomorrow?

933
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:45,650
Of course. Why do you ask?

934
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,590
Nothing. I'll see you tomorrow.

935
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,760
Okay. Bye.

936
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:19,590
What is going on?

937
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,170
Isn't this the neighborhood
she lives in?

938
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,770
I'm sure she has something to do
with the kid and the old lady.

939
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,110
Did you drink?

940
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:46,810
A little.

941
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:48,980
What's the matter?

942
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:52,010
Pack your stuff and come back.

943
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:55,050
I told you. I like it here.

944
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:56,180
We're married.

945
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,920
Why should we live apart?

946
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:02,290
Come back with your stuff right now.

947
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:05,630
Are you saying I should live in
that tiny room with you?

948
01:02:06,790 --> 01:02:09,260
There won't be any space left
with my suitcase open.

949
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:10,570
I'll get you a hotel room.

950
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:13,000
We can stay there, right?

951
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,140
Let's go.

952
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,870
Hotel room, my foot.

953
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:20,270
I like it here.

954
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:21,910
So don't worry about me.

955
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:22,910
Honey.

956
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:24,880
Don't call me like that.

957
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:27,750
I want to stop being your wife.

958
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:30,490
What?

959
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:37,330
I came back to end things with you.

960
01:02:39,190 --> 01:02:40,360
End things?

961
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,560
What does that mean?

962
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:47,070
I want a divorce.

963
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:54,010
Let's get divorced.

964
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:56,910
We should.

965
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:48,660
(For Eagle Brothers)

966
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:50,600
I gritted my teeth
through the hard times,

967
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,130
thinking of you and Yeoung Ju.

968
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:54,000
But all I get in return
is a divorce?

969
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,370
Kwang Sook, you might get
a new sister-in-law soon.

970
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:59,410
I'm planning to propose tomorrow.

971
01:03:59,410 --> 01:04:02,810
Am I finally getting
a younger sister-in-law?

972
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:04,580
Where is the woman?

973
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:06,780
Are you talking about Kwang Sook?

974
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:08,580
You want a piece of me?

975
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:10,180
I do want a piece of you!

976
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,650
The brewery is mine!

977
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:14,660
I will never let you
take it away from me!
