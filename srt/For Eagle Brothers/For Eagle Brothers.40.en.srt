1
00:00:30,852 --> 00:00:32,082
I won't give you...

2
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:35,092
a perfect score so easily.

3
00:00:37,762 --> 00:00:39,832
If you finish your last drink in one go,

4
00:00:41,132 --> 00:00:42,632
I'll give you a perfect score.

5
00:00:45,502 --> 00:00:46,672
All right.

6
00:01:05,552 --> 00:01:06,692
Oh, my!

7
00:01:13,232 --> 00:01:14,292
Okay?

8
00:01:15,162 --> 00:01:16,262
Okay!

9
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:20,872
Mr. Han, you win!

10
00:01:21,102 --> 00:01:22,342
I give you a perfect score too!

11
00:01:23,072 --> 00:01:24,872
Mission accomplished!

12
00:01:36,522 --> 00:01:37,552
Oh, dear.

13
00:01:39,322 --> 00:01:41,092
My goodness.

14
00:01:41,092 --> 00:01:42,792
Mr. Han...

15
00:01:45,062 --> 00:01:46,692
Well done, Mr. Han.

16
00:01:52,032 --> 00:01:53,132
Kwang Sook.

17
00:01:56,072 --> 00:01:57,342
Kwang Sook?

18
00:02:02,312 --> 00:02:03,482
Kwang Sook.

19
00:02:05,782 --> 00:02:06,912
Kwang Sook.

20
00:02:10,152 --> 00:02:12,392
My goodness. Yes?

21
00:02:17,192 --> 00:02:18,522
How did it go?

22
00:02:18,522 --> 00:02:19,662
Kwang Sook.

23
00:02:20,462 --> 00:02:21,492
I...

24
00:02:22,232 --> 00:02:23,802
passed the test!

25
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:33,172
I passed!

26
00:02:34,672 --> 00:02:36,942
Oh, dear.

(Episode 40)

28
00:03:08,872 --> 00:03:10,012
Kwang Sook?

29
00:03:11,812 --> 00:03:12,912
Are you up?

30
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:16,952
Come and have breakfast.

31
00:03:27,492 --> 00:03:28,932
Is Dong Seok up?

32
00:03:29,732 --> 00:03:30,832
"Dong Seok?"

33
00:03:31,162 --> 00:03:32,232
Chairman Han.

34
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:35,372
Why are you looking for him in my room?

35
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:39,042
He didn't sleep here last night?

36
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:42,982
Are you insane? Why would he sleep here?

37
00:03:42,982 --> 00:03:44,212
Where did he sleep, then?

38
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:01,492
Did you sleep well, sir?

39
00:04:01,732 --> 00:04:02,732
What?

40
00:04:03,232 --> 00:04:04,332
Yes.

41
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,772
Gosh, where am I?

42
00:04:12,072 --> 00:04:13,172
We will now...

43
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:16,912
begin Chairman Han's fitness test.

44
00:04:18,012 --> 00:04:20,652
This is the last test. It's the drinking test.

45
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:22,952
- I'll give you 5 out of 5. - I give him a perfect score.

46
00:04:23,152 --> 00:04:24,152
I agree with them.

47
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:25,792
Mission accomplished!

48
00:04:27,592 --> 00:04:28,622
Oh, dear.

49
00:04:29,092 --> 00:04:30,592
I passed the test!

50
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:32,932
I passed!

51
00:04:32,932 --> 00:04:34,462
Oh, dear.

52
00:04:34,462 --> 00:04:36,332
- You can sleep in my room. - Hold him.

53
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:38,562
- Come on. It's too late. - No, I can't sleep here.

54
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:40,402
- Take off his jacket. - Gosh, no.

55
00:04:40,402 --> 00:04:42,702
- Come on. - I can't sleep here. What is this?

56
00:04:42,702 --> 00:04:44,242
- No, let me... - This way.

57
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,372
- Come with me. - No, I should go home.

58
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,712
How is your stomach?

59
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:56,582
Well... I'm fine.

60
00:04:57,382 --> 00:04:59,352
Gosh, I drank too much last night,

61
00:04:59,352 --> 00:05:00,922
so I passed out.

62
00:05:01,222 --> 00:05:02,822
Did I make any mistake?

63
00:05:04,092 --> 00:05:06,432
I watched you with my eyes wide open.

64
00:05:07,062 --> 00:05:08,562
And you didn't make any mistakes.

65
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:12,262
I didn't expect you to pass with a perfect score.

66
00:05:12,262 --> 00:05:13,372
You're amazing.

67
00:05:14,902 --> 00:05:17,642
I guess you guys were being too generous.

68
00:05:18,302 --> 00:05:20,072
We aren't that easy to deal with.

69
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:23,342
We examined you thoroughly with an eagle eye.

70
00:05:24,082 --> 00:05:25,712
That's true.

71
00:05:29,482 --> 00:05:30,752
Let's have breakfast.

72
00:05:36,262 --> 00:05:37,362
Come on out.

73
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:42,232
- Let's go. - Okay.

74
00:05:42,702 --> 00:05:43,762
- Please come on out. - My gosh.

75
00:05:44,332 --> 00:05:45,332
Oh, dear.

76
00:05:48,572 --> 00:05:51,602
You passed that difficult test with a perfect score.

77
00:05:51,872 --> 00:05:54,972
You're a capable man.

78
00:05:55,212 --> 00:05:56,442
You're the best.

79
00:05:57,082 --> 00:05:58,182
I'm flattered.

80
00:05:58,282 --> 00:06:00,152
I'm not flattering you.

81
00:06:00,412 --> 00:06:02,312
You are like Lee Mong Ryong who came back from Hanyang...

82
00:06:02,312 --> 00:06:04,822
after winning first place in the state examination, right?

83
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,622
Sure thing, Ms. Gong. That's an appropriate analogy.

84
00:06:08,122 --> 00:06:10,222
Though he's a little older than Lee Mong Ryong,

85
00:06:10,222 --> 00:06:13,792
his fighting spirit was just as impressive.

86
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:17,762
I'm feeling a bit dizzy from all the praise.

87
00:06:19,472 --> 00:06:21,702
The soup is getting cold. Let's eat.

88
00:06:21,732 --> 00:06:23,342
- Okay. - All right.

89
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:39,852
Stop staring at him.

90
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:42,562
He's too uncomfortable to eat.

91
00:06:45,262 --> 00:06:46,262
Oh, right.

92
00:06:46,332 --> 00:06:48,332
Now that you've passed the test,

93
00:06:48,792 --> 00:06:50,862
you should hurry and set a date.

94
00:06:55,372 --> 00:06:57,102
Are you all right? Here.

95
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:02,012
It's a shame that you two met after you grew old.

96
00:07:02,042 --> 00:07:04,342
Why would you stall and waste more time?

97
00:07:04,682 --> 00:07:06,552
Let's just make it quick. Okay?

98
00:07:08,952 --> 00:07:10,322
Will you stop that?

(Eagle Brewery)

100
00:07:40,112 --> 00:07:42,482
Don't blame your mother.

101
00:07:42,822 --> 00:07:44,352
She's just honest and straightforward,

102
00:07:44,582 --> 00:07:47,022
so she can't hide her feelings.

103
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:51,792
I feel bad for my brothers-in-law.

104
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:56,502
I'll make sure to handle things well in the middle...

105
00:07:57,162 --> 00:07:59,472
so they don't feel too upset.

106
00:07:59,602 --> 00:08:00,932
Don't worry.

107
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,602
Thank you.

108
00:08:06,812 --> 00:08:08,512
But to be honest with you,

109
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:13,712
I feel the same way your mother does.

110
00:08:14,912 --> 00:08:16,322
Since we are old enough,

111
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:18,582
I want us to get married quickly.

112
00:08:19,252 --> 00:08:21,152
I don't want to waste more time.

113
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:30,662
I'll make sure things work out well...

114
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:34,202
without anyone getting hurt.

115
00:08:34,202 --> 00:08:35,372
Just trust me.

116
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,172
I will.

117
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:42,072
I'll get going, then.

We did the right thing, didn't we?

121
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:05,232
Tell us that we did.

122
00:09:08,302 --> 00:09:12,672
I believe Jang Soo will be happy about what we did.

123
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:17,012
Yes, we did the right thing.

124
00:09:22,952 --> 00:09:24,652
You know, humans can be so fickle.

125
00:09:26,152 --> 00:09:27,722
I do want...

126
00:09:29,122 --> 00:09:31,322
to sincerely congratulate Mr. Han and Kwang Sook,

127
00:09:33,132 --> 00:09:36,232
but I feel upset from time to time.

128
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:41,272
When Ms. Gong told them earlier to hurry and set a date,

129
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,402
I felt like crying.

130
00:09:46,872 --> 00:09:49,312
I was also choked up for a moment.

131
00:09:54,612 --> 00:09:57,782
Guys, make sure not to show that in front of Kwang Sook.

132
00:09:58,452 --> 00:09:59,922
It's just between us.

133
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:02,722
Sure. I know that.

134
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:21,342
They're not even married yet. Don't you think it's wrong...

135
00:10:21,842 --> 00:10:25,112
that he stayed out overnight like this without calling us?

136
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:29,382
Why do you sound so old-fashioned when you're young?

137
00:10:30,652 --> 00:10:34,022
Honestly, I didn't like her from the beginning.

138
00:10:34,752 --> 00:10:36,122
Did you meet Dad's girlfriend?

139
00:10:36,392 --> 00:10:39,362
Yes. I met her at the VIP golf outing...

140
00:10:39,962 --> 00:10:41,532
the other day.

141
00:10:42,132 --> 00:10:44,732
She was nothing like the image I had in mind at all.

142
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:48,772
I thought she would be...

143
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:51,142
someone graceful and quiet like Professor Kim Ja Young.

144
00:10:52,202 --> 00:10:54,042
- You're home, Dad. - You're home.

145
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:59,982
I drank with Kwang Sook's brothers-in-law last night,

146
00:10:59,982 --> 00:11:01,852
and I ended up falling asleep there.

147
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:03,852
It can happen.

148
00:11:03,982 --> 00:11:07,192
So when are you going to introduce her to us?

149
00:11:08,092 --> 00:11:11,392
Speaking of which, how about tonight?

150
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:13,462
Tonight?

151
00:11:13,762 --> 00:11:15,032
I'm available.

152
00:11:17,562 --> 00:11:18,562
What about you?

153
00:11:19,772 --> 00:11:21,272
I'm available too.

154
00:11:32,182 --> 00:11:33,552
All right.

155
00:11:38,852 --> 00:11:41,422
It's me. I just got home.

156
00:11:43,722 --> 00:11:44,892
You went through a lot.

157
00:11:45,562 --> 00:11:47,792
You must be tired. Get some rest.

158
00:11:48,732 --> 00:11:50,662
Do you have time tonight?

159
00:11:52,132 --> 00:11:53,632
Tonight?

160
00:11:53,702 --> 00:11:54,832
My children...

161
00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:58,042
are asking to meet you officially.

162
00:11:58,942 --> 00:12:01,412
Can you have dinner with us tonight?

163
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:04,042
So,

164
00:12:05,012 --> 00:12:08,612
is it my turn to be tested today?

165
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:11,952
My children are really sweet and gentle.

166

What are you doing?

169
00:12:34,842 --> 00:12:36,882
- I want a divorce. - What?

170
00:12:37,542 --> 00:12:40,212
You and I can't return to the way things were between us.

171
00:12:42,452 --> 00:12:43,852
Let's part ways here.

172
00:12:45,922 --> 00:12:47,522
You're angry at me for your own mistakes?

173
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:50,462
You should be begging desperately for my forgiveness, if anything.

174
00:12:50,462 --> 00:12:52,962
How dare you ask me for a divorce?

175
00:12:53,092 --> 00:12:56,432
Even if I beg you desperately, you will never forgive me.

176
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:59,302
- What? - Let's split up here.

177
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:00,772
Stop being ridiculous!

178
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:02,532
Why is it ridiculous?

179
00:13:04,102 --> 00:13:06,512
Why would I get a divorce for your sake?

180
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:09,682
Once we split up,

181
00:13:09,682 --> 00:13:12,112
will you call Kang Soo over and live with him?

182
00:13:12,482 --> 00:13:14,752
He's doing well with his brothers, so why would I do that?

183
00:13:16,322 --> 00:13:19,322
What right do I have to show myself before him after all these years?

184
00:13:20,922 --> 00:13:22,352
Let me tell you this one thing.

185
00:13:24,422 --> 00:13:25,992
You'd better not mess with Kang Soo.

186
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:28,692
If you call him out...

187
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:30,932
and say something funny to him like you did last time,

188
00:13:30,932 --> 00:13:32,032
I swear...

189
00:13:33,032 --> 00:13:35,202
I will kill you and myself.

190
00:13:41,712 --> 00:13:44,182
What's gotten into her head?

191
00:13:45,182 --> 00:13:46,682
How dare you threaten me?

192
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:12,502
What important thing do you have to say?

193
00:14:12,502 --> 00:14:14,272
Keep it short. I'm expecting a visitor.

194
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,512
I have a question.

195
00:14:18,582 --> 00:14:19,712
Are you actually...

196
00:14:20,212 --> 00:14:22,552
considering marrying your student?

197
00:14:26,522 --> 00:14:29,392
You won't answer. I guess you are thinking about it.

198
00:14:29,822 --> 00:14:31,422
Why do you want to know?

199
00:14:31,762 --> 00:14:34,162
I should know, as Ha Ni's mom.

200
00:14:37,432 --> 00:14:39,102
Let me make this very clear.

201
00:14:39,532 --> 00:14:43,002
I can't leave my daughter to some child like her.

202
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,642
It might be a slight exaggeration, but I can't leave my Ha Ni...

203
00:14:48,742 --> 00:14:50,482
to someone who could be her sister.

204
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:52,642
You cared that much about Ha Ni,

205
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,012
and you still abandoned her?

206
00:14:54,912 --> 00:14:56,252
I didn't abandon her.

207
00:14:57,382 --> 00:14:58,522
I left her with you...

208
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,022
for a while because I was in a bind.

209
00:15:04,292 --> 00:15:07,062
I absolutely can't leave my child in the hands of that young girl.

210
00:15:07,392 --> 00:15:09,902
She's a hundred times better than the mom who left.

211
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:12,232
Seriously, why are you being like this?

212
00:15:12,762 --> 00:15:14,872
I'm Ha Ni's birth mom.

213
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:17,742
You left Ha Ni to go after what you couldn't give up on,

214
00:15:18,242 --> 00:15:20,742
whereas Se Ri gave up everything she could enjoy.

215
00:15:22,042 --> 00:15:23,482
That's the difference between you two.

216
00:15:26,112 --> 00:15:27,812
I'm about to see a lawyer.

217
00:15:28,482 --> 00:15:30,182
To get custody of Ha Ni.

218
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:33,222
Come at me all you want.

219
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:36,052
I talked to a lawyer already.

220
00:15:37,592 --> 00:15:40,332
The mom who left the newborn now wants to regain custody?

221
00:15:42,062 --> 00:15:44,032
There's almost zero possibility that you'll win.

222
00:15:46,672 --> 00:15:48,202
Are you that confident?

223
00:15:49,802 --> 00:15:50,842
Yes.

224
00:15:51,502 --> 00:15:52,742
You bet I am.

225
00:15:54,572 --> 00:15:57,242
Let's see who wins.

226
00:16:10,422 --> 00:16:12,122
I got here a bit early.

227
00:16:12,692 --> 00:16:14,062
You're with a guest.

228
00:16:15,662 --> 00:16:17,702
No. She was on her way out.

229
00:16:29,312 --> 00:16:30,382
Take a seat.

230
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:31,782
Thanks.

231
00:16:32,982 --> 00:16:34,812
Sorry for bothering you on your day off.

232
00:16:35,382 --> 00:16:38,052
It's fine. I had to prepare for my lecture anyway.

233
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,192
The lady who just left.

234
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:50,602
Was that Ha Ni's mom?

235
00:16:51,832 --> 00:16:54,032
The new wife of Daeheung Group's chairman.

236
00:16:54,832 --> 00:16:55,832
Right?

237
00:16:56,602 --> 00:16:58,172
Yes. That's her.

238
00:17:02,772 --> 00:17:05,582
Why did you do such a thing?

239
00:17:06,782 --> 00:17:09,152
She cares too much about money.

240
00:17:09,252 --> 00:17:10,882
I couldn't stand it.

241
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,792
There was a reason my Se Ri couldn't stand her.

242
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,492
Pardon?

243
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:18,522
Never mind.

244
00:17:22,592 --> 00:17:24,032
I asked to see you today...

245
00:17:25,932 --> 00:17:27,672
because we need to prepare ourselves.

246
00:17:28,902 --> 00:17:29,942
In what way?

247
00:17:32,642 --> 00:17:34,242
Se Ri's dad found out...

248
00:17:35,712 --> 00:17:37,482
that I'm Kang Soo's birth mother.

249
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:40,582
How did that happen?

250
00:17:43,622 --> 00:17:45,622
He'd compared our DNA in secret.

251
00:17:50,492 --> 00:17:52,162
Now that he knows,

252
00:17:52,722 --> 00:17:54,362
Kang Soo will find out soon too.

253
00:17:56,232 --> 00:17:58,332
Yes, I guess so.

254
00:18:01,972 --> 00:18:03,342
What should we do?

255
00:18:04,672 --> 00:18:07,872
We should figure out how to minimize the emotional toll on Kang Soo.

256
00:18:08,612 --> 00:18:09,672
And then...

257
00:18:11,282 --> 00:18:13,482
Se Ri will find out as well.

258
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:24,292
The shock will hit her hard.

259
00:18:27,092 --> 00:18:29,032
We must protect them as best as we can.

260
00:18:30,162 --> 00:18:32,362
I'll talk to her about it.

261
00:18:36,072 --> 00:18:38,002
I'm grateful she has you.

262
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:40,412
I'm relieved.

263
00:18:41,972 --> 00:18:42,972
Thank you.

264
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:25,582
Hi, Dad.

265
00:19:28,552 --> 00:19:29,722
Do you...

266
00:19:30,522 --> 00:19:33,362
hate your dad that much?

267
00:19:34,092 --> 00:19:36,092
Am I that disappointing?

268
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:39,932
You left home so long ago,

269
00:19:39,932 --> 00:19:42,472
and you haven't called me once.

270
00:19:43,672 --> 00:19:46,712
What did I do to you that was so wrong?

271
00:19:47,942 --> 00:19:49,642
Are you drunk?

272
00:19:50,282 --> 00:19:51,582
Yes, I am.

273
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:54,282
My only daughter...

274
00:19:54,282 --> 00:19:56,582
left home and never called me once.

275
00:19:57,022 --> 00:19:58,882
And my wife...

276
00:19:58,882 --> 00:20:00,892
left a piece of paper asking for a divorce.

277
00:20:01,452 --> 00:20:03,992
How am I to stay sober with all that happening?

278
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:07,992
What do you mean Mom wants a divorce?

279
00:20:09,962 --> 00:20:11,832
That's what she wants.

280
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,532
What? Why?

281
00:20:15,472 --> 00:20:18,742
Ask her yourself if you want to know!

282
00:20:20,772 --> 00:20:24,712
I worked hard my whole life to support you two.

283
00:20:24,742 --> 00:20:26,642
And in my old age,

284
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:30,322
my wife and daughter left me.

285
00:20:31,282 --> 00:20:33,022
My life was in vain.

286
00:20:44,132 --> 00:20:46,302
Dad. Hello?

287
00:20:51,602 --> 00:20:53,512
What's going on?

288
00:20:57,712 --> 00:20:58,712
Hey.

289
00:21:00,812 --> 00:21:02,582
Hi, Ha Ni.

290
00:21:11,192 --> 00:21:13,022
Where's Professor Oh?

291
00:21:13,462 --> 00:21:15,632
He left a short while ago for an appointment.

292
00:21:21,202 --> 00:21:22,402
Is something wrong?

293
00:21:24,572 --> 00:21:26,402
My parents might get divorced.

294
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:28,572
What?

295
00:21:28,672 --> 00:21:31,282
I think I caused a rift between them,

296
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:33,182
and I feel bad.

297
00:21:37,482 --> 00:21:39,152
I'm sure it wasn't because of you.

298
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:42,592
What?

299
00:21:43,392 --> 00:21:46,222
No. It's nothing at all.

300
00:21:49,462 --> 00:21:51,402
Did Ha Ni have something to eat?

301
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,132
Yes.

302
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:56,202
Beom Soo fed her before he went out.

303
00:21:58,102 --> 00:21:59,472
- Ha Ni. - Yes.

304
00:21:59,472 --> 00:22:02,372
Shall we go and see when your dad will be back?

305
00:22:02,672 --> 00:22:04,042
- Yes. - Yes.

306
00:22:04,242 --> 00:22:05,742
- Let's go. - Yes.

307
00:22:07,082 --> 00:22:08,852
- Let's go. - Yes.

308
00:22:27,075 --> 00:22:31,245
(Professor Kim Ja Young)

309
00:22:32,364 --> 00:22:33,434
Hello?

310
00:22:34,734 --> 00:22:36,004
Hello, Chairman.

311
00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:38,874
Hello, Professor. It has been a while.

312
00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:41,704
I'm at the hotel to return...

313
00:22:41,704 --> 00:22:43,504
the artwork we exhibited.

314
00:22:44,104 --> 00:22:45,744
Oh, are you?

315
00:22:46,314 --> 00:22:49,214
I called to see if you were in your office.

316
00:22:49,944 --> 00:22:51,814
I'm not. I rest at home on weekends...

317
00:22:51,814 --> 00:22:53,214
unless something pressing comes up.

318
00:22:54,214 --> 00:22:55,884
I chose the wrong day to visit.

319
00:22:56,324 --> 00:22:58,024
I was busy with the exhibition...

320
00:22:58,024 --> 00:22:59,924
and forgot it was the weekend.

321
00:23:01,754 --> 00:23:03,664
I'm sure we can meet another time.

322
00:23:04,324 --> 00:23:05,364
The exhibition went well,

323
00:23:05,364 --> 00:23:06,964
thanks to the piece you let us display.

324
00:23:07,164 --> 00:23:10,364
I'll treat you to a delicious meal as a token of my appreciation.

325
00:23:12,634 --> 00:23:14,474
Sure. Have a good day.

326
00:23:20,944 --> 00:23:23,284
(Eagle Brewery)

327
00:23:23,914 --> 00:23:25,284
My gosh!

328
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:31,554
Are you all right? Oh, no.

329
00:23:31,554 --> 00:23:33,254
What do you think you're doing?

330
00:23:33,294 --> 00:23:34,524
- Well... - Unbelievable.

331
00:23:34,994 --> 00:23:37,424
I should clean up the coffee you spilled.

332
00:23:37,524 --> 00:23:39,664
Forget it. Not with that dirty rag.

333
00:23:40,034 --> 00:23:42,164
Unbelievable. Are you kidding me?

334
00:23:42,834 --> 00:23:44,464
Watch where you're going, will you?

335
00:23:45,474 --> 00:23:46,704
But you also...

336
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,474
Either way, I'm sorry.

337
00:23:54,314 --> 00:23:56,414
Seriously. Forget it!

338
00:23:57,944 --> 00:23:58,954
Shoot.

339
00:24:10,964 --> 00:24:13,494
Why does she look familiar?

340
00:24:26,574 --> 00:24:27,674
Hello?

341
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:29,614
Where are you?

342
00:24:30,114 --> 00:24:31,144
At the hotel.

343
00:24:31,384 --> 00:24:32,384
Already?

344
00:24:32,784 --> 00:24:34,754
But we won't be meeting until much later.

345
00:24:36,554 --> 00:24:38,894
After delivering makgeolli to the restaurant,

346
00:24:39,094 --> 00:24:41,524
I'm going to have coffee with the ladies.

347
00:24:43,394 --> 00:24:46,964
How is it that you're closer to my employees than I am?

348
00:24:48,094 --> 00:24:49,234
I'll see you later.

349
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,404
Actually,

350
00:24:51,604 --> 00:24:52,634
I'm...

351
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:55,034
super nervous.

352
00:24:55,904 --> 00:24:56,974
About what?

353
00:24:57,474 --> 00:24:59,244
What if...

354
00:25:00,344 --> 00:25:03,114
your daughter and son don't like me?

355
00:25:04,644 --> 00:25:07,014
I'll disown them both.

356
00:25:07,854 --> 00:25:08,884
What?

357
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:10,754
Just kidding.

358
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:15,024
That won't happen, so don't be nervous. Got it?

359
00:25:18,564 --> 00:25:20,694
Sure. I got it.

360
00:25:22,464 --> 00:25:23,564
I'll see you later, then.

361
00:25:44,724 --> 00:25:45,894
Hey, Jin Young.

362
00:25:48,724 --> 00:25:51,394
KBC asked...

363
00:25:51,524 --> 00:25:54,764
that I perform to celebrate my 35th anniversary next month.

364
00:25:55,394 --> 00:25:58,304
Could the team get back together?

365
00:26:01,034 --> 00:26:02,844
I'm totally up for it.

366
00:26:03,874 --> 00:26:06,174
Oh Heung Soo still has it, you know.

367
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,244
Got it. I'll head to the studio right away.

368
00:26:09,514 --> 00:26:10,514
Sure.

369
00:26:16,984 --> 00:26:18,024
Ok Bun.

370
00:26:18,584 --> 00:26:19,854
Ok Bun? Hey.

371
00:26:21,194 --> 00:26:22,224
Hey, Heung Soo.

372
00:26:24,064 --> 00:26:25,364
Is something up?

373
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:26,964
I have amazing news.

374
00:26:27,194 --> 00:26:29,234
Jin Young called a second ago.

375
00:26:30,634 --> 00:26:32,104
Jin Young?

376
00:26:33,574 --> 00:26:35,534
As in Park Jin Young?

377
00:26:36,204 --> 00:26:37,974
No, Hyun Jin Young.

378
00:26:38,674 --> 00:26:42,014
I see. Right, Hyun Jin Young.

379
00:26:42,544 --> 00:26:43,884
What did he want?

380
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:46,914
He'll be performing to celebrate his 35th anniversary,

381
00:26:47,714 --> 00:26:49,824
and he asked me to take the stage too.

382
00:26:50,824 --> 00:26:52,824
You know I was one of his backup dancers.

383
00:26:53,554 --> 00:26:55,354
Of course, I remember that.

384
00:26:55,454 --> 00:26:59,564
You tore up the stage back then!

385
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:02,734
So, sit tight.

386
00:27:03,234 --> 00:27:06,104
This time, I'll show you that I'm worth something too.

387
00:27:07,204 --> 00:27:08,334
Then, after that,

388
00:27:08,334 --> 00:27:11,074
I'll confidently ask you to go out with me.

389
00:27:12,774 --> 00:27:13,814
You know what I mean, right?

390
00:27:26,454 --> 00:27:27,824
She kept raising her voice...

391
00:27:27,824 --> 00:27:29,724
even though there was another customer,

392
00:27:30,664 --> 00:27:31,924
so I ended up losing my temper.

393
00:27:34,064 --> 00:27:35,934
I should've held back.

394
00:27:36,034 --> 00:27:37,064
It's okay.

395
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,634
I know how she is. I can tell you had no choice.

396
00:27:42,234 --> 00:27:45,144
I'm worried I made her even angrier.

397
00:27:47,344 --> 00:27:50,084
She's been going around saying she won't show up at court.

398
00:27:50,644 --> 00:27:52,414
That makes me think she's going to do something awful.

399
00:27:53,114 --> 00:27:54,584
I need to quickly settle this.

400
00:27:56,324 --> 00:27:57,624
But Chun Soo,

401
00:27:58,624 --> 00:28:00,824
don't corner her too harshly.

402
00:28:00,994 --> 00:28:03,164
Try to reason with her calmly.

403
00:28:05,064 --> 00:28:07,664
The mistake she made was so terrible...

404
00:28:08,164 --> 00:28:10,164
that she's flustered and out of options.

405
00:28:10,464 --> 00:28:12,434
It could make her act on impulse.

406
00:28:13,134 --> 00:28:15,404
So don't get worked up.

407
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:17,774
Just talk this out.

408
00:28:19,874 --> 00:28:22,244
If I had enough money to give her,

409
00:28:22,884 --> 00:28:24,144
this could all be resolved easily.

410
00:28:28,754 --> 00:28:30,724
That's what you did last time.

411
00:28:31,354 --> 00:28:34,254
You've already done enough, so don't blame yourself.

412
00:28:36,894 --> 00:28:37,894
I'm sorry.

413
00:28:46,204 --> 00:28:47,574
Everything you do will be caught...

414
00:28:47,574 --> 00:28:49,304
on the security camera at the convenience store.

415
00:28:50,544 --> 00:28:52,474
So why did you even go there?

416
00:28:52,914 --> 00:28:54,874
Did that woman tell you to patronize me?

417
00:28:55,114 --> 00:28:56,544
Just as crimes committed in convenience stores...

418
00:28:56,544 --> 00:28:57,884
aren't taken lightly in the US,

419
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,514
the same is true in Korea.

420
00:29:00,414 --> 00:29:03,054
You might end up being taken away from Yeoung Ju.

421
00:29:04,684 --> 00:29:05,954
Don't try to scare me.

422
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,034
Let me ask you one thing.

423
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:17,834
During our marriage,

424
00:29:19,204 --> 00:29:20,434
were you ever happy?

425
00:29:24,004 --> 00:29:26,044
Why are you bringing up the past?

426
00:29:26,674 --> 00:29:29,344
We didn't marry because we were madly in love.

427
00:29:30,414 --> 00:29:31,514
Whatever.

428
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:35,014
I'm too busy putting food on the table to dwell on the past.

429
00:29:39,854 --> 00:29:42,154
Either way, we've drifted too far apart now.

430
00:29:43,964 --> 00:29:46,534
Before, I believed you were the only one to blame.

431
00:29:47,594 --> 00:29:48,764
But now, I see...

432
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:52,474
that I just focused on earning money for the family...

433
00:29:53,534 --> 00:29:55,904
and never understood how lonely you were,

434
00:29:57,004 --> 00:29:58,144
and I feel bad about that.

435
00:30:01,944 --> 00:30:04,614
Why are you saying that? What's the catch?

436
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:06,514
That's just...

437
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,814
how I feel.

438
00:30:14,294 --> 00:30:16,624
I know you're in a rough spot after being scammed,

439
00:30:16,624 --> 00:30:18,194
and I'd like to help you,

440
00:30:18,864 --> 00:30:20,964
but I have nothing more to give you.

441
00:30:22,234 --> 00:30:23,604
Of course, you have something to give.

442
00:30:24,134 --> 00:30:25,934
- You can sell the brewery... - How many times do I have to say...

443
00:30:25,934 --> 00:30:27,404
- that it's Kwang Sook's? - Come on!

444
00:30:28,934 --> 00:30:30,774
Wanting that money won't change anything.

445
00:30:33,544 --> 00:30:34,914
Did you call me out here...

446
00:30:34,914 --> 00:30:36,844
and waste my time just to say you're broke?

447
00:30:45,584 --> 00:30:46,894
I know you're feeling hopeless...

448
00:30:47,454 --> 00:30:49,364
after losing all your money,

449
00:30:50,524 --> 00:30:52,164
but don't be like this. Just go back to the US.

450
00:30:53,494 --> 00:30:54,864
I consulted a lawyer.

451
00:30:56,404 --> 00:30:58,334
My case is 100 percent winnable.

452
00:30:58,834 --> 00:30:59,934
Chun Soo!

453
00:30:59,934 --> 00:31:02,334
Let's not waste good money on lawyers.

454
00:31:03,574 --> 00:31:04,874
Let's end it right here.

455
00:31:05,804 --> 00:31:08,074
I'll do whatever it takes to cover Yeoung Ju's tuition...

456
00:31:08,244 --> 00:31:09,884
and ease your burden.

457
00:31:13,414 --> 00:31:15,784
As if I'd fall for those sugar-coated words.

458
00:31:18,284 --> 00:31:20,424
I wouldn't have bothered coming here...

459
00:31:20,724 --> 00:31:22,624
just to back out this easily.

460
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,794
Think about what will benefit you...

461
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,634
the most.

462
00:31:57,694 --> 00:31:58,864
Hey, Yeoung Ju.

463
00:31:58,994 --> 00:32:00,934
Mom, when will you be back?

464
00:32:01,594 --> 00:32:04,134
I told you before that your dad was having an affair.

465
00:32:04,334 --> 00:32:06,434
How can you call that an affair?

466
00:32:06,704 --> 00:32:08,704
You guys already agreed to get divorced.

467
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:11,004
We'll still married under the eyes of the law.

468
00:32:11,904 --> 00:32:13,314
You're being unreasonable.

469
00:32:13,444 --> 00:32:14,974
How am I being unreasonable?

470
00:32:15,244 --> 00:32:16,284
Technically,

471
00:32:16,484 --> 00:32:18,514
you're the one who dated another guy...

472
00:32:18,514 --> 00:32:19,784
before agreeing to the divorce.

473
00:32:20,384 --> 00:32:21,984
Will you stop it with that nonsense?

474
00:32:22,214 --> 00:32:24,884
Word had already been spreading among the Korean community.

475
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:26,854
Shut it. I'm hanging up.

476
00:32:39,034 --> 00:32:41,004
(3H Acupressure Bed)

477
00:32:41,004 --> 00:32:43,304
- Enjoy your massage, - Thank you.

478
00:32:43,304 --> 00:32:45,904
and please call for an employee if you have any questions.

479
00:32:45,904 --> 00:32:46,944
Sure.

480
00:32:51,484 --> 00:32:52,544
Who am I seeing?

481
00:33:06,264 --> 00:33:07,334
Mr. Go.

482
00:33:08,094 --> 00:33:09,164
You startled me.

483
00:33:14,204 --> 00:33:15,634
Where are you going all dressed up?

484
00:33:16,144 --> 00:33:17,844
I have plans for dinner.

485
00:33:20,314 --> 00:33:21,374
Come on in.

486
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,784
(3H Acupressure Bed)

487
00:33:36,624 --> 00:33:39,094
Plans for dinner? With who?

488
00:33:39,634 --> 00:33:41,064
Who do you think?

489
00:33:41,464 --> 00:33:43,404
The woman I met on the blind date...

490
00:33:43,404 --> 00:33:45,864
I've had a lot on my mind because of Kwang Sook,

491
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:49,444
and I didn't want to look like I was meddling in your business.

492
00:33:50,244 --> 00:33:52,604
But have you been seeing her this whole time?

493
00:33:52,604 --> 00:33:53,614
Yes.

494
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:56,044
I know it's too soon,

495
00:33:57,984 --> 00:33:59,954
but I'm going to propose to her tonight.

496
00:34:01,314 --> 00:34:02,454
Propose?

497
00:34:02,854 --> 00:34:05,084
You're already proposing when you just met her?

498
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:07,194
Are you out of your mind?

499
00:34:07,194 --> 00:34:09,324
I understand your concern,

500
00:34:10,094 --> 00:34:11,564
but I'm running late.

501
00:34:12,524 --> 00:34:13,664
Mr. Go!

502
00:34:15,064 --> 00:34:16,804
Wait. Mr. Go!

503
00:34:17,104 --> 00:34:18,104
Hey!

504
00:34:25,444 --> 00:34:26,914
This is driving me crazy.

505
00:34:49,434 --> 00:34:50,704
I'm Ma Kwang Sook.

506
00:34:52,204 --> 00:34:53,374
I'm Ma Kwang Sook.

507
00:35:00,574 --> 00:35:02,014
I'm glad that the results turned out well.

508
00:35:02,614 --> 00:35:03,644
I'm relieved.

509
00:35:06,884 --> 00:35:07,914
Dad.

510
00:35:08,454 --> 00:35:09,484
Hey.

511
00:35:12,624 --> 00:35:13,624
Hi.

512
00:35:16,764 --> 00:35:18,694
Let me introduce them to you.

513
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:21,094
This is my son.

514
00:35:21,094 --> 00:35:22,294
It was so sudden the other day,

515
00:35:22,294 --> 00:35:23,564
so I couldn't introduce myself properly.

516
00:35:24,064 --> 00:35:25,104
I'm Han Gyeol.

517
00:35:25,534 --> 00:35:26,674
Same here.

518
00:35:27,134 --> 00:35:28,404
I'm Ma Kwang Sook.

519
00:35:31,244 --> 00:35:32,504
And this is my daughter.

520
00:35:33,014 --> 00:35:34,844
Hello. I'm Han Bom.

521
00:35:35,314 --> 00:35:37,484
We met at the golf course...

522
00:35:37,484 --> 00:35:39,484
the other day, right?

523
00:35:39,914 --> 00:35:41,084
Nice to meet you.

524
00:35:41,584 --> 00:35:42,614
Yes.

525
00:35:44,484 --> 00:35:46,424
Let's have a seat, then.

526
00:35:46,424 --> 00:35:47,494
Sit.

527
00:35:48,154 --> 00:35:49,154
Okay.

528
00:36:00,674 --> 00:36:04,004
I'd like to thank you first.

529
00:36:06,814 --> 00:36:09,074
Dad's face has brightened a lot,

530
00:36:09,074 --> 00:36:10,814
and he seems quite relaxed now.

531
00:36:10,814 --> 00:36:12,584
I don't know how to thank you enough.

532
00:36:14,514 --> 00:36:15,514
I see.

533
00:36:15,754 --> 00:36:18,554
Please take good care of Dad.

534
00:36:19,994 --> 00:36:22,724
I'm the one who should be saying that.

535
00:36:23,894 --> 00:36:26,024
Oh, right. Please feel free to speak casually with us.

536
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,064
Maybe later.

537
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:35,434
Bom.

538
00:36:35,974 --> 00:36:37,074
Do you not have anything to say?

539
00:36:40,674 --> 00:36:43,084
Well, I've heard a lot of good things...

540
00:36:43,084 --> 00:36:45,014
about you from Kang Soo.

541
00:36:45,014 --> 00:36:46,584
So, I feel like I already know you pretty well.

542
00:36:48,084 --> 00:36:49,854
I've also heard...

543
00:36:49,854 --> 00:36:51,924
a lot of good things about you from Kang Soo.

544
00:36:52,554 --> 00:36:53,554
I see.

545
00:36:56,194 --> 00:37:00,094
We're just here to have dinner together today.

546
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,964
Let's just eat at ease.

547
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:04,834
Okay.

548
00:37:05,504 --> 00:37:06,504
All right.

549
00:37:08,234 --> 00:37:09,774
Hey, Bom.

550
00:37:09,804 --> 00:37:10,804
My gosh.

551
00:37:11,004 --> 00:37:12,374
Hello, Professor Kim.

552
00:37:15,814 --> 00:37:17,714
I thought I'd be going back after hanging up the paintings,

553
00:37:17,984 --> 00:37:19,584
but I get to see you here.

554
00:37:20,354 --> 00:37:21,454
It's been a while.

555
00:37:25,484 --> 00:37:26,554
Who is she?

556
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:28,624
Professor Kim Ja Young.

557
00:37:29,154 --> 00:37:30,194
I see.

558
00:37:30,324 --> 00:37:32,764
Hello. I'm Bom's brother. My name is Han Gyeol.

559
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:34,434
Nice to meet you.

560
00:37:35,364 --> 00:37:37,264
I guess you are having a family gathering.

561
00:37:48,114 --> 00:37:50,314
This is my girlfriend.

562
00:37:51,684 --> 00:37:52,684
Pardon?

563
00:37:55,254 --> 00:37:58,754
I'm introducing her to my children today.

564
00:38:00,294 --> 00:38:01,294
My gosh.

565
00:38:04,764 --> 00:38:06,394
You're the one...

566
00:38:07,464 --> 00:38:08,694
who delivered makgeolli, right?

567
00:38:09,194 --> 00:38:10,204
Pardon?

568
00:38:12,704 --> 00:38:13,734
Yes.

569
00:38:19,304 --> 00:38:21,414
It's not like she just delivers makgeolli.

570
00:38:21,974 --> 00:38:24,384
She's the CEO of Eagle Brewery.

571
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,554
I must say, you have unique taste...

572
00:38:32,554 --> 00:38:34,524
in women.

573
00:38:44,134 --> 00:38:47,074
We are having a family gathering here.

574
00:38:47,374 --> 00:38:48,534
I'll see you later.

575
00:38:50,474 --> 00:38:51,474
Well...

576
00:38:52,244 --> 00:38:54,244
Okay. All right, then.

577
00:39:06,624 --> 00:39:07,694
Sit.

578
00:39:29,344 --> 00:39:30,884
Let's eat.

579
00:39:31,144 --> 00:39:32,144
Okay.

580
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:34,554
Enjoy your food.

581
00:39:34,554 --> 00:39:36,214
Okay. Thank you.

582
00:39:36,354 --> 00:39:37,484
Thank you.

583
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:39,854
Here.

584
00:39:40,694 --> 00:39:41,754
All right.

585
00:39:43,324 --> 00:39:44,324
My gosh.

586
00:39:45,994 --> 00:39:46,994
Oh, no.

587
00:39:47,464 --> 00:39:48,734
Are you all right?

588
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:49,734
Yes.

589
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:54,034
Excuse me. I need to use the restroom.

590
00:40:05,684 --> 00:40:07,884
Do you know who I just ran into at the hotel?

591
00:40:08,984 --> 00:40:10,454
I met Han Dong Seok.

592
00:40:13,554 --> 00:40:15,354
Apparently, he has a girlfriend.

593
00:40:17,764 --> 00:40:20,164
He wants to marry a woman who delivers makgeolli.

594
00:40:21,194 --> 00:40:23,134
She's definitely not on his level, don't you think?

595
00:40:25,764 --> 00:40:27,504
And Bom is quite reckless.

596
00:40:28,004 --> 00:40:30,004
When she knew her dad was seeing someone,

597
00:40:30,504 --> 00:40:32,274
why on earth did she set me up with him?

598
00:40:34,044 --> 00:40:36,314
Han Dong Seok was acting so high and mighty in front of me.

599
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:38,684
I think he's out of his mind.

600
00:40:50,394 --> 00:40:51,864
Just pretend that you didn't hear it.

601
00:40:52,124 --> 00:40:54,734
How could I, when I already heard everything?

602
00:41:01,134 --> 00:41:04,644
Backbite others after you're done relieving yourself.

603
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,544
Why don't you wait in the stall for a moment?

604
00:41:09,544 --> 00:41:10,644
- Go. - But...

605
00:41:17,784 --> 00:41:18,954
What are you doing here?

606
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:20,754
What do you think?

607
00:41:21,254 --> 00:41:23,264
I was listening to you gossiping about us.

608
00:41:27,664 --> 00:41:28,664
You know what?

609
00:41:29,394 --> 00:41:31,534
I'm not a woman who delivers makgeolli.

610
00:41:32,264 --> 00:41:33,934
I make makgeolli.

611
00:41:34,734 --> 00:41:37,174
And Chairman Han Dong Seok is not out of his mind.

612
00:41:37,404 --> 00:41:39,914
He's sane and sober.

613
00:41:41,714 --> 00:41:44,584
And Bom wouldn't set you up...

614
00:41:44,584 --> 00:41:48,314
with her dad for no good reason.

615
00:41:49,284 --> 00:41:52,424
You can't question her kindness like that.

616
00:41:53,224 --> 00:41:56,094
I mean, you are a professor who is very well-educated.

617
00:42:00,534 --> 00:42:01,834
Unbelievable.

618
00:42:02,164 --> 00:42:03,204
My gosh.

619
00:42:06,934 --> 00:42:10,104
Why don't you stop talking behind someone's back...

620
00:42:10,704 --> 00:42:12,074
and lead a good...

621
00:42:12,844 --> 00:42:14,114
and honest life?

622
00:42:16,714 --> 00:42:17,714
Okay?

623
00:42:20,954 --> 00:42:22,014
I can't believe this.

624
00:42:30,824 --> 00:42:33,834
How was it? Did it make you feel better?

625
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:34,834
Yes.

626
00:42:35,134 --> 00:42:38,304
You said everything I wanted to say.

627
00:42:40,804 --> 00:42:41,904
Then...

628
00:42:42,734 --> 00:42:45,544
did I pass the test...

629
00:42:46,404 --> 00:42:47,674
to be your dad's girlfriend?

630
00:42:48,814 --> 00:42:49,984
Totally.

631
00:43:01,454 --> 00:43:03,624
They said they'd go to the restroom. What's keeping them?

632
00:43:04,024 --> 00:43:06,594
I don't know. Is something wrong?

633
00:43:16,174 --> 00:43:18,104
Things were a bit awkward just a while ago.

634
00:43:18,444 --> 00:43:19,974
Now, they're walking arm-in-arm. What happened?

635
00:43:20,844 --> 00:43:21,914
I don't get it either.

636
00:43:23,414 --> 00:43:24,484
Let's sit down.

637
00:43:44,532 --> 00:43:45,802
Hi, Se Ri.

638
00:43:46,342 --> 00:43:47,942
Where are you, Mom?

639
00:43:48,242 --> 00:43:50,172
I'm at home, of course.

640
00:43:53,182 --> 00:43:55,082
Dad called me earlier today.

641
00:43:55,752 --> 00:43:58,552
Is it true you're getting divorced?

642
00:44:00,222 --> 00:44:01,252
Yes.

643
00:44:01,922 --> 00:44:03,852
I gave him the papers.

644
00:44:04,822 --> 00:44:05,992
Why, all of a sudden?

645
00:44:08,292 --> 00:44:10,492
I can't do this anymore.

646
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,262
Is it because of me?

647
00:44:14,762 --> 00:44:16,132
It's not.

648
00:44:18,642 --> 00:44:20,772
Going our separate ways...

649
00:44:22,112 --> 00:44:24,372
is the best for me and your dad.

650
00:44:26,712 --> 00:44:28,442
I'm a bit tired.

651
00:44:29,312 --> 00:44:30,882
Let's talk some other time.

652
00:44:34,352 --> 00:44:36,222
Mom. Hello?

653
00:44:42,792 --> 00:44:44,462
What's going on?

654
00:44:54,072 --> 00:44:55,842
Let me make this very clear.

655
00:44:56,212 --> 00:44:59,712
I can't leave my daughter to some child like her.

656
00:45:00,382 --> 00:45:04,012
It might be a slight exaggeration, but I can't leave my Ha Ni...

657
00:45:04,482 --> 00:45:06,182
to someone who could be her sister.

658
00:45:09,152 --> 00:45:10,152
Yes?

659
00:45:11,552 --> 00:45:12,562
Kang Soo.

660
00:45:14,062 --> 00:45:15,092
Is Ha Ni asleep?

661
00:45:15,092 --> 00:45:16,862
Yes. She just fell asleep.

662
00:45:18,232 --> 00:45:20,632
What's up? Do you want to talk to me?

663
00:45:25,102 --> 00:45:26,302
I want to know something.

664
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:28,712
What is it?

665
00:45:30,842 --> 00:45:31,982
Do you know...

666
00:45:32,482 --> 00:45:35,012
who my birth mother is?

667
00:45:38,822 --> 00:45:41,322
Why? Do you want to know who it is?

668
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:45,052
I don't know.

669
00:45:46,062 --> 00:45:47,462
I want to know,

670
00:45:47,692 --> 00:45:49,992
but then I don't see what difference it will make.

671
00:45:52,932 --> 00:45:55,772
A few days ago, Chairman Dokgo Tak said...

672
00:45:55,772 --> 00:45:57,272
he'd tell me about my mom.

673
00:45:58,272 --> 00:45:59,472
I refused at first,

674
00:46:00,642 --> 00:46:02,872
then I changed my mind and went to see him.

675
00:46:04,012 --> 00:46:05,042
And?

676
00:46:05,782 --> 00:46:08,652
I met Se Ri's mother right outside Silla Brewery.

677
00:46:09,882 --> 00:46:12,522
She pleaded with me to turn away, so I did.

678
00:46:19,322 --> 00:46:21,022
Make up your mind first.

679
00:46:22,092 --> 00:46:23,932
Once you know what you want for sure,

680
00:46:24,692 --> 00:46:25,962
I'll tell you then.

681
00:46:29,232 --> 00:46:30,272
Then...

682
00:46:31,032 --> 00:46:32,972
you know who my mother is?

683
00:46:37,572 --> 00:46:38,572
Excuse me.

684
00:46:42,252 --> 00:46:43,282
Hi, Se Ri.

685
00:46:45,652 --> 00:46:46,722
Right now?

686
00:46:51,822 --> 00:46:54,962
I think things are pretty serious between my parents.

687
00:46:56,562 --> 00:46:59,862
I never heard them even talk about divorce.

688
00:47:03,972 --> 00:47:06,542
I think they drifted apart because of me,

689
00:47:07,002 --> 00:47:08,342
and it hurts.

690
00:47:08,442 --> 00:47:10,072
I'm sure it's not just about you.

691
00:47:10,872 --> 00:47:12,282
Go home,

692
00:47:12,882 --> 00:47:15,852
apologize for leaving, and try to appease them.

693
00:47:17,852 --> 00:47:18,852
Okay.

694
00:47:20,322 --> 00:47:22,392
Even if I move back home,

695
00:47:23,022 --> 00:47:25,562
I'll keep my job at the convenience store for now.

696
00:47:27,062 --> 00:47:30,332
You'll commute from your home to the store?

697
00:47:32,132 --> 00:47:33,202
Yes.

698
00:47:34,102 --> 00:47:36,832
Since I took on the job, I want to see it through responsibly.

699
00:47:37,572 --> 00:47:39,402
It's a great excuse...

700
00:47:39,672 --> 00:47:41,102
to keep seeing you and Ha Ni.

701
00:47:42,642 --> 00:47:44,542
It would be best for many reasons.

702
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,842
You're so stubborn.

703
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:52,552
Okay, then.

704
00:48:01,222 --> 00:48:02,332
Mom.

705
00:48:04,592 --> 00:48:05,762
Dad.

706
00:48:07,632 --> 00:48:09,902
Mom. I'm home.

707
00:48:13,342 --> 00:48:14,502
Who's that?

708
00:48:15,202 --> 00:48:16,212
My gosh.

709
00:48:19,612 --> 00:48:20,612
Se Ri.

710
00:48:25,552 --> 00:48:26,652
Se Ri.

711
00:48:28,682 --> 00:48:30,752
- Mom. - Se Ri.

712
00:48:33,322 --> 00:48:34,322
Se Ri.

713
00:48:35,932 --> 00:48:37,892
You didn't say you'd come home.

714
00:48:39,202 --> 00:48:40,532
Are you back for good?

715
00:48:41,762 --> 00:48:44,202
I got worried after our last call.

716
00:48:45,032 --> 00:48:48,042
My darling puppy, you came home because you were worried about me?

717
00:48:51,772 --> 00:48:53,282
I'm sorry.

718
00:48:54,212 --> 00:48:57,882
I apologize for everything. Forgive me.

719
00:48:59,122 --> 00:49:00,852
I'm sorry too, Mom.

720
00:49:13,032 --> 00:49:14,062
Dad.

721
00:49:15,432 --> 00:49:18,332
Why the huge fuss as if you did something great?

722
00:49:22,002 --> 00:49:24,042
I'm hungry. Set the table.

723
00:49:26,742 --> 00:49:28,412
You and your darn food.

724
00:49:30,782 --> 00:49:31,812
What?

725
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,722
What got into that woman?

726
00:49:35,692 --> 00:49:36,722
My gosh.

727
00:49:42,592 --> 00:49:43,662
Darn it.

728
00:50:46,762 --> 00:50:48,022
Come and have dinner, Mom.

729
00:50:50,662 --> 00:50:52,532
I'm not hungry.

730
00:50:53,162 --> 00:50:54,202
Come on.

731
00:50:54,932 --> 00:50:57,872
Get up and eat just a little.

732
00:50:58,002 --> 00:50:59,972
Like I said, I'm not hungry.

733
00:51:00,272 --> 00:51:02,542
Oh, my goodness.

734
00:51:04,012 --> 00:51:05,242
Oh, well.

735
00:51:07,782 --> 00:51:08,782
My gosh.

736
00:51:08,842 --> 00:51:09,882
Sit down.

737
00:51:11,012 --> 00:51:13,482
I'm not hungry.

738
00:51:13,852 --> 00:51:16,692
Eat just a little for your daughter's sake.

739
00:51:17,822 --> 00:51:19,992
- Come on. - Goodness.

740
00:51:25,562 --> 00:51:27,932
Did you really cook all this?

741
00:51:28,132 --> 00:51:30,702
Yes. I found some bean sprouts in the fridge,

742
00:51:30,702 --> 00:51:32,872
so I made this soup and steamed a few eggs too.

743
00:51:33,102 --> 00:51:36,612
All you ever knew how to do was pour boiling water into cup noodles.

744
00:51:37,342 --> 00:51:38,412
What happened?

745
00:51:39,642 --> 00:51:41,012
It might taste horrible.

746
00:51:46,682 --> 00:51:49,852
I don't know what made you decide to come home,

747
00:51:50,122 --> 00:51:52,622
but you cannot marry Beom Soo.

748
00:51:52,822 --> 00:51:54,692
For as long as I live,

749
00:51:54,692 --> 00:51:57,432
I won't ever give my blessing. Okay?

750
00:51:57,432 --> 00:52:00,532
Let's make that very clear. You got that?

751
00:52:01,932 --> 00:52:04,202
Don't put pressure on the girl who just cooked for us.

752
00:52:04,202 --> 00:52:05,802
Let's eat for now.

753
00:52:13,012 --> 00:52:14,412
Goodness.

754
00:52:14,412 --> 00:52:15,642
Oh, my.

755
00:52:16,452 --> 00:52:17,582
I'm impressed.

756
00:52:21,252 --> 00:52:22,252
It's good.

757
00:52:29,292 --> 00:52:32,432
By the way, why did you suddenly bring up a divorce?

758
00:52:35,062 --> 00:52:36,802
Ask your mother...

759
00:52:36,832 --> 00:52:39,372
about the heartbreaking story she has to tell.

760
00:53:07,202 --> 00:53:08,262
Doctor Baek.

761
00:53:11,572 --> 00:53:12,772
Are you heading home?

762
00:53:13,842 --> 00:53:14,842
Yes.

763
00:53:18,242 --> 00:53:19,242
Here.

764
00:53:20,442 --> 00:53:22,812
Wait. What's this?

765
00:53:24,052 --> 00:53:27,052
I came by to thank you.

766
00:53:29,952 --> 00:53:31,752
Did you two make up?

767
00:53:33,622 --> 00:53:34,662
Yes.

768
00:53:35,622 --> 00:53:37,362
And I owe it all to you.

769
00:53:37,992 --> 00:53:38,992
Thanks.

770
00:53:39,562 --> 00:53:42,432
If he ever gets on your nerves after you get married,

771
00:53:42,432 --> 00:53:43,602
give me a call.

772
00:53:44,202 --> 00:53:47,402
I'd gladly role-play to teach him a lesson.

773
00:53:49,672 --> 00:53:51,112
I'd appreciate that.

774
00:53:53,542 --> 00:53:54,712
Ms. Ji.

775
00:53:55,582 --> 00:53:58,382
You're a kind and amazing person.

776
00:54:00,722 --> 00:54:02,322
I'm only telling you this now,

777
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:05,552
but if the sandwich shop guy had continued to ignore you,

778
00:54:05,862 --> 00:54:08,492
I would've asked you out myself.

779
00:54:09,332 --> 00:54:10,432
Really?

780
00:54:12,532 --> 00:54:15,102
No way. I could've hit the jackpot!

781
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:23,642
Be happy.

782
00:54:25,442 --> 00:54:26,442
Please.

783
00:54:28,582 --> 00:54:29,582
Sure.

784
00:55:55,862 --> 00:55:58,632
Guys, looking good!

785
00:55:58,632 --> 00:55:59,742
You're here.

786
00:56:00,602 --> 00:56:01,602
Didn't I look incredible?

787
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:03,942
Gosh, Heung Soo.

788
00:56:04,172 --> 00:56:05,342
You still have it.

789
00:56:05,572 --> 00:56:09,212
Hey. Dancer Oh Heung Soo has always had it.

790
00:56:09,552 --> 00:56:10,752
Just put me on stage,

791
00:56:10,752 --> 00:56:13,322
and I'll perform like I did in my prime.

792
00:56:13,752 --> 00:56:15,322
Don't tease me like that.

793
00:56:15,522 --> 00:56:17,322
You're always teasing me.

794
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:21,362
The phone is turned off. Transferring to voicemail.

795
00:56:21,362 --> 00:56:23,462
You will be charged after the beep.

796
00:56:24,832 --> 00:56:28,062
What's he up to that he had to turn off his phone?

797
00:56:29,132 --> 00:56:30,372
I didn't peg him for that type,

798
00:56:30,932 --> 00:56:32,742
but could Mr. Go be a player?

799
00:56:36,012 --> 00:56:37,372
I'm home.

800
00:56:37,372 --> 00:56:40,442
Hey. Did it go well with the chairman's children?

801
00:56:40,682 --> 00:56:41,682
Yes.

802
00:56:41,682 --> 00:56:42,882
How are they?

803
00:56:43,212 --> 00:56:44,252
What do you mean?

804
00:56:44,382 --> 00:56:45,952
Are they polite?

805
00:56:46,052 --> 00:56:48,882
Are they the type to give their stepmother a hard time?

806
00:56:49,592 --> 00:56:50,592
No.

807
00:56:50,752 --> 00:56:53,222
They're such sweet, good kids.

808
00:56:53,422 --> 00:56:56,392
Chairman Han did a great job raising his kids.

809
00:56:56,562 --> 00:56:57,832
What a relief.

810
00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:00,302
Are they fond of you?

811
00:57:01,902 --> 00:57:02,972
I'm not sure.

812
00:57:04,232 --> 00:57:06,202
They didn't seem to dislike me.

813
00:57:15,012 --> 00:57:16,352
What happened to you today?

814
00:57:16,612 --> 00:57:17,612
What do you mean?

815
00:57:17,752 --> 00:57:20,652
You were quiet at first and sulking a little.

816
00:57:20,652 --> 00:57:21,852
Then, you showed up arm-in-arm with her.

817
00:57:23,092 --> 00:57:24,552
What happened to you two?

818
00:57:26,762 --> 00:57:27,822
It's a secret.

819
00:57:49,082 --> 00:57:50,482
Hello?

820
00:57:51,352 --> 00:57:52,952
Did you get home?

821
00:57:53,722 --> 00:57:56,122
Yes, I arrived a few minutes ago.

822
00:57:57,292 --> 00:57:58,622
You seemed...

823
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:02,422
to have left a good impression on my kids.

824
00:58:03,092 --> 00:58:04,092
Really?

825
00:58:04,332 --> 00:58:06,162
My daughter was gushing...

826
00:58:06,962 --> 00:58:09,832
about the girl crush she developed for you.

827
00:58:11,902 --> 00:58:14,472
Does that mean I got their stamp of approval?

828
00:58:14,702 --> 00:58:16,372
Of course, you did.

829
00:58:18,242 --> 00:58:19,242
What a relief.

830
00:58:20,212 --> 00:58:22,912
I was really nervous at dinner today.

831
00:58:24,352 --> 00:58:26,682
I know it was stressful today.

832
00:58:26,682 --> 00:58:27,752
Get a good night's sleep.

833
00:58:28,882 --> 00:58:29,952
Sure.

834
00:58:30,392 --> 00:58:32,892
Sleep well too, Chairman Han.

835
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,792
Unbelievable.

836
00:58:35,622 --> 00:58:38,462
Why are you still calling me Chairman Han?

837
00:58:38,792 --> 00:58:41,432
Are you an employee at my hotel?

838
00:58:43,372 --> 00:58:47,042
I'm too embarrassed to call you by your name.

839
00:58:49,042 --> 00:58:50,072
Then,

840
00:58:51,812 --> 00:58:53,982
let's agree to "sweetie."

841
00:58:56,252 --> 00:58:58,612
Gosh, that gave me goosebumps!

842
00:58:59,212 --> 00:59:01,052
I can't call you that.

843
00:59:01,182 --> 00:59:04,152
Just close your eyes and give it a shot.

844
00:59:15,032 --> 00:59:16,032
Sweet...

845
00:59:19,402 --> 00:59:21,302
Maybe next time.

846
00:59:22,602 --> 00:59:23,772
Next time, when?

847
00:59:24,472 --> 00:59:26,072
I'll practice tonight...

848
00:59:26,412 --> 00:59:28,942
and call you that the next time we meet.

849
00:59:29,852 --> 00:59:31,252
You promised.

850
00:59:32,552 --> 00:59:33,622
Sure.

851
00:59:34,352 --> 00:59:35,382
I promise.

852
01:00:13,492 --> 01:00:14,562
Welcome.

853
01:00:14,562 --> 01:00:16,532
I hope the long flight wasn't too exhausting.

854
01:00:16,692 --> 01:00:18,192
It's been a while, Dong Seok.

855
01:00:18,792 --> 01:00:20,062
Have you been well?

856
01:00:20,432 --> 01:00:22,562
Of course. I'm pretty much the same.

857
01:00:23,032 --> 01:00:24,202
I see some wrinkles now.

858
01:00:24,702 --> 01:00:27,502
You're finally growing old too.

859
01:00:28,472 --> 01:00:30,372
You're still a gentleman, though.

860
01:00:30,972 --> 01:00:32,442
- It's good to see you. - Right.

861
01:00:34,242 --> 01:00:35,242
Let me.

862
01:00:36,412 --> 01:00:37,852
No problem.

863
01:00:38,082 --> 01:00:40,382
I'm still able to drag my own suitcase.

864
01:00:51,492 --> 01:00:54,232
I booked you the room you always stay in.

865
01:00:54,932 --> 01:00:57,472
After I spend the day resting alone...

866
01:00:57,502 --> 01:00:58,872
and adjusting to the time difference,

867
01:00:59,332 --> 01:01:01,442
I'll head home feeling my best.

868
01:01:02,302 --> 01:01:03,942
Please let me know...

869
01:01:03,942 --> 01:01:05,272
if there's anything I can do for you.

870
01:01:05,842 --> 01:01:06,842
Thank you.

871
01:01:07,312 --> 01:01:08,312
This way.

872
01:01:24,462 --> 01:01:25,492
Mr. Chairman...

873
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:29,902
Sweetie.

874
01:01:30,832 --> 01:01:32,172
Please don't.

875
01:01:46,682 --> 01:01:47,822
No...

876
01:01:53,522 --> 01:01:55,522
Aren't you getting in, sweetie?

877
01:02:01,402 --> 01:02:03,432
You're not getting in, Dong Seok?

878
01:02:06,972 --> 01:02:08,302
I am.

879
01:03:09,462 --> 01:03:11,972
(For Eagle Brothers)

880
01:03:12,302 --> 01:03:13,602
I sometimes wonder...

881
01:03:13,772 --> 01:03:15,342
if I'm allowed to do this.

882
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,972
Is he gutsy or shameless?

883
01:03:18,112 --> 01:03:19,242
What are you doing here?

884
01:03:19,342 --> 01:03:20,982
I came to ask for a favor.

885
01:03:21,242 --> 01:03:23,282
Because you went and did something stupid,

886
01:03:23,282 --> 01:03:26,012
my family might end up getting torn apart.

887
01:03:26,212 --> 01:03:28,022
Who was that lady?

888
01:03:28,182 --> 01:03:29,352
My mother-in-law.

889
01:03:29,482 --> 01:03:31,352
I'm sorry I ran my mouth.

890
01:03:31,422 --> 01:03:32,692
Dong Seok.

891
01:03:32,922 --> 01:03:35,492
You're more naive than I thought.

892
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:39,062
You're not considering marriage, are you?

893
01:03:39,262 --> 01:03:40,502
I'm Yeoung Ju's dad.

894
01:03:40,502 --> 01:03:42,232
I'll be there for my daughter.

895
01:03:42,362 --> 01:03:44,132
- Can I trust you on that? - Trust me.

896
01:03:44,132 --> 01:03:46,272
Would I say what I don't mean when my child's future's at stake?
