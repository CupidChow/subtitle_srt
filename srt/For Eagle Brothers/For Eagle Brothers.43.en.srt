1
00:00:01,398 --> 00:00:02,868
I'm not going to object...

2
00:00:02,868 --> 00:00:04,338
(Episode 43)

3
00:00:04,598 --> 00:00:06,138
to you two dating.

4
00:00:08,778 --> 00:00:09,978
Thank you.

5
00:00:10,738 --> 00:00:11,778
However,

6
00:00:14,248 --> 00:00:15,748
I'm against the two of you marrying.

7
00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:18,788
Sorry?

8
00:00:19,318 --> 00:00:20,348
You see,

9
00:00:21,318 --> 00:00:24,918
I don't see you as someone who can replace my daughter.

10
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:29,198
While her position has much to offer,

11
00:00:29,758 --> 00:00:31,868
it also demands responsibilities of equal weight.

12
00:00:32,398 --> 00:00:34,868
It does not suit you at all.

13
00:00:38,468 --> 00:00:39,868
Right, we'll do that. Sure.

14
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,038
What I said...

15
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:46,178
will be kept between us for now.

16
00:00:47,478 --> 00:00:48,948
Anyway, since we're here,

17
00:00:49,318 --> 00:00:52,188
we might as well share a meal before we part ways.

18
00:00:56,788 --> 00:00:59,058
That was an important call. Sorry about that.

19
00:01:01,488 --> 00:01:02,498
Go ahead.

20
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:20,548
Would you like some Jang-Kwang Makgeolli...

21
00:01:20,548 --> 00:01:22,418
- that you couldn't try? - No, it's all right.

22
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:24,218
I don't like makgeolli.

23
00:01:26,848 --> 00:01:28,888
Kwang Sook's makgeolli is...

24
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:30,488
more like medicine than liquor.

25
00:01:30,988 --> 00:01:32,658
It is made with natural bedrock water,

26
00:01:32,658 --> 00:01:34,858
homemade traditional nuruk, and the best-quality rice...

27
00:01:34,858 --> 00:01:36,658
with no additives.

28
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:39,828
It leaves a clear and refreshing aftertaste.

29
00:01:39,928 --> 00:01:42,238
Are you a salesperson from the brewery?

30
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:50,678
All right. Let's stop talking and just eat.

31
00:01:51,178 --> 00:01:52,178
Okay.

32
00:02:06,758 --> 00:02:08,158
Are you sure you don't need to see a doctor?

33
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:11,928
I just took some digestive medicine, so I'll be okay.

34
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:16,438
You've got to be kidding me.

35
00:02:16,798 --> 00:02:18,408
An ex-mother-in-law...

36
00:02:18,408 --> 00:02:21,338
has no business getting involved in her son-in-law's marriage.

37
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,438
She's his children's grandmother.

38
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:25,578
She must be concerned.

39
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:28,848
Without her daughter, her son-in-law is a stranger to her.

40
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:30,078
They have no connection.

41
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:35,888
Mr. Han's mother-in-law means a lot to him.

42
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:39,628
So what on earth is she like?

43
00:02:39,858 --> 00:02:41,058
Do you want me to meet her?

44
00:02:41,358 --> 00:02:44,228
You should just stay quiet and pretend not to know anything.

45
00:02:46,328 --> 00:02:49,238
Don't say anything silly to Mr. Han.

46
00:02:49,798 --> 00:02:51,738
It's just one thing after another.

47
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:54,868
Your brothers-in-law have finally backed down,

48
00:02:54,868 --> 00:02:56,678
but his mother-in-law is standing in your way now.

49
00:02:57,278 --> 00:03:00,208
Nothing is going your way.

50
00:03:01,408 --> 00:03:03,678
My goodness. I'm so upset.

51
00:03:07,248 --> 00:03:08,248
My gosh.

52
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,098
Do you not like Kwang Sook?

53
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:21,668
To be honest with you, I'm not completely satisfied.

54
00:03:23,268 --> 00:03:24,938
You will see it soon enough,

55
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:27,468
but there are a lot of good things about her.

56
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:30,238
I had some plans of my own,

57
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:33,178
so I'm disappointed that she doesn't fit in with them.

58
00:03:34,678 --> 00:03:38,618
You know, I can be very particular.

59
00:03:39,818 --> 00:03:42,058
But she is up to my standards.

60
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,258
Please watch her more with patience.

61
00:03:44,988 --> 00:03:46,328
What are your standards?

62
00:03:49,798 --> 00:03:51,058
She has a warm heart...

63
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:54,398
that can embrace not only her family,

64
00:03:54,398 --> 00:03:55,938
but also the people around her.

65
00:03:56,338 --> 00:03:57,438
What makes you think so?

66
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:02,878
She lost her husband in an accident only ten days after her wedding.

67
00:04:03,278 --> 00:04:04,808
In such a difficult situation,

68
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:08,278
she took over the brewery in accordance with his will.

69
00:04:08,918 --> 00:04:12,318
She also took in her four brothers-in-law...

70
00:04:12,848 --> 00:04:16,158
and embraced all of them as family, which I found impressive.

71
00:04:16,618 --> 00:04:17,618
And?

72
00:04:19,288 --> 00:04:21,328
She has her firm principles for making liquor,

73
00:04:21,558 --> 00:04:24,228
and she never lies or sugarcoats things...

74
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:27,068
even in situations that could be disadvantageous to her.

75
00:04:29,898 --> 00:04:30,998
I'll keep that in mind.

76
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:34,168
You must be tired. Get some good sleep.

77
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:35,608
I'll be in my room.

78
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:38,308
Good night.

79
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:53,928
He is such a poor judge of character. Oh, dear.

80
00:04:56,798 --> 00:04:58,458
- You're home, Grandma. - Hello.

81
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,598
Hey. Hi, guys.

82
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,598
Did you meet the CEO of the brewery?

83
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:05,938
Do you like her?

84
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:09,138
I didn't know your dad was such a poor judge of character.

85
00:05:09,308 --> 00:05:12,108
I wonder how he married your mom with such an eye.

86
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:13,848
Oh, dear.

87
00:05:20,188 --> 00:05:22,258
You must have been hurt.

88
00:05:23,258 --> 00:05:26,958
Did you get an upset stomach or something after dinner?

89
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,828
No.

90
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:32,568
Actually, I'm good at taking blows,

91
00:05:32,698 --> 00:05:35,568
so I don't get hurt easily.

92
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,738
I guess Mother was a little upset,

93
00:05:40,138 --> 00:05:43,138
thinking of my children's mom.

94
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:46,878
But she will soon regain her composure.

95
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,078
She is actually a rational and reasonable person.

96
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:55,458
My qualifications and background...

97
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:59,158
are not enough compared to her daughter's,

98
00:05:59,828 --> 00:06:01,458
so I understand...

99
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:05,498
that she may be disappointed.

100
00:06:07,428 --> 00:06:09,598
It's not like she's hiring an employee.

101
00:06:09,998 --> 00:06:13,038
Why would we need good qualifications and background?

102
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:16,778
What's important is...

103
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,708
that my mother-in-law's opinion...

104
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,678
can never be an obstacle between us.

105
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,318
It won't sway me.

106
00:06:29,258 --> 00:06:30,388
I knew it.

107
00:06:31,818 --> 00:06:35,958
I knew my boyfriend was a man with a strong mind.

108
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:39,398
I know I can count on you.

109
00:06:40,368 --> 00:06:41,398
So...

110
00:06:42,338 --> 00:06:44,768
don't be upset. Okay?

111
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:49,078
I get it. You don't have to worry.

112
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:51,538
Good night.

113
00:07:07,058 --> 00:07:08,088
You see,

114
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:12,598
I don't see you as someone who can replace my daughter.

115
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:16,338
It does not suit you at all.

116
00:07:30,448 --> 00:07:31,448
My goodness.

117
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:35,088
This woman... I can't believe this.

118
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:39,228
What do you think you're doing?

119
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:45,898
It'd be weird to share the bed in a situation like this.

120
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:47,898
What?

121
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:51,198
It would be better to sleep separately,

122
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,568
without bothering each other in the same bed.

123
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,578
You're the one who caused the problem.

124
00:07:56,878 --> 00:07:59,548
People might think I was the one who had an illegitimate child.

125
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,148
I'm telling you.

126
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:03,448
It happened before I met you.

127
00:08:04,278 --> 00:08:06,988
You deceived me for 30 years.

128
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:11,088
Then you have never deceived me?

129
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:13,428
What?

130
00:08:13,528 --> 00:08:15,798
Have you never lied to me since we got married?

131
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:17,958
Can you put your hand on your heart and say that you didn't?

132
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:21,198
What nonsense are you talking about?

133
00:08:21,198 --> 00:08:23,468
So stop making it look like I'm the only bad one here.

134
00:08:23,468 --> 00:08:24,938
Are you saying what you did was right?

135
00:08:26,168 --> 00:08:29,078
You won't divorce me or forgive me.

136
00:08:29,508 --> 00:08:31,138
What do you want me to do?

137
00:08:32,508 --> 00:08:34,178
You are angry at me for what you did?

138
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:37,448
Until I say that I will forgive you,

139
00:08:37,848 --> 00:08:39,448
just keep your mouth shut.

140
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:41,548
Okay?

141
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:54,728
I'm home.

142
00:08:56,238 --> 00:08:57,898
You're home, darling puppy.

143
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:00,168
Did you have a long day?

144
00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:03,678
Professor Oh drove me home.

145
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:04,908
Oh, dear.

146
00:09:05,578 --> 00:09:08,108
He must be tired. You should drive to work.

147
00:09:08,878 --> 00:09:11,518
He is busy giving lectures and taking care of his child.

148
00:09:15,618 --> 00:09:16,958
Thank you, Mom.

149
00:09:19,928 --> 00:09:23,058
I told him you gave us your blessing.

150
00:09:23,658 --> 00:09:26,068
He didn't say much, but he seemed elated.

151
00:09:29,098 --> 00:09:31,368
I've let go of all my greed now.

152
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:33,868
As long as you are happy, Se Ri,

153
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:38,008
I'm ready to accept anything.

154
00:09:39,608 --> 00:09:41,708
I'm sorry for having been so mean to you, Mom.

155
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:46,118
I'll be a better daughter.

156
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:47,318
All right.

157
00:09:50,618 --> 00:09:54,058
How did a mother like me get a daughter like you?

158
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,258
Why would you say that?

159
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:01,228
I'm shameful and lacking in many ways as a mom.

160
00:10:02,798 --> 00:10:04,238
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,538
Why would you say that?

162
00:10:08,268 --> 00:10:10,238
You've been saying strange things since yesterday.

163
00:10:11,238 --> 00:10:12,448
Is something wrong?

164
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:18,078
You must be tired. Wash up and go to bed, then.

165
00:10:27,858 --> 00:10:29,598
Were you never going to tell me?

166
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:35,838
I believed that not telling you was for your own good.

167
00:10:36,698 --> 00:10:38,798
You were only looking out for yourself and your family.

168
00:10:39,868 --> 00:10:41,138
Kang Soo.

169
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:52,618
Come in.

170
00:10:54,948 --> 00:10:56,058
Hey, Kang Soo.

171
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,358
Am I interrupting you?

172
00:10:58,818 --> 00:11:01,028
No. I just had something to think about.

173
00:11:01,188 --> 00:11:02,228
What is it?

174
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,058
Are you worried about something?

175
00:11:06,728 --> 00:11:08,098
I shouldn't have said such a thing.

176
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,868
The more I think about it, the more it bothers me.

177
00:11:13,338 --> 00:11:14,408
What did you say?

178
00:11:16,138 --> 00:11:19,248
I said she kept my existence a secret...

179
00:11:19,778 --> 00:11:20,978
not to protect me,

180
00:11:20,978 --> 00:11:23,478
but to protect herself and her family.

181
00:11:26,048 --> 00:11:27,488
I shouldn't have said that.

182
00:11:29,118 --> 00:11:31,158
It is something you can say in your situation.

183
00:11:31,888 --> 00:11:33,058
Don't beat yourself up.

184
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:35,188
Still, I should've held it back.

185
00:11:36,258 --> 00:11:37,858
I said something that could break her heart.

186
00:11:43,068 --> 00:11:44,738
Do you not resent her at all?

187
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:52,008
You know I grew up receiving a lot of love from my parents...

188
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:54,048
and brothers.

189
00:12:05,618 --> 00:12:07,158
Oh, right. Well...

190
00:12:07,988 --> 00:12:10,228
Did Yeoung Ju's mom arrive safely?

191
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,158
Yes.

192
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,468
She made Yeoung Ju call me.

193
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,108
You must've been through a lot.

194
00:12:21,568 --> 00:12:24,008
I had to go through all that anyway.

195
00:12:26,348 --> 00:12:28,408
I just felt bad for you.

196
00:12:28,978 --> 00:12:30,848
That's life, isn't it?

197
00:12:31,648 --> 00:12:35,588
There are always unexpected surprises.

198
00:12:36,518 --> 00:12:37,788
You must've been...

199
00:12:38,888 --> 00:12:40,358
angry and upset.

200
00:12:42,288 --> 00:12:44,098
Thank you for believing in me until everything was over.

201
00:12:47,168 --> 00:12:49,038
I'm so grateful. I will make sure...

202
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,898
to make up for it for the rest of my life.

203
00:12:52,768 --> 00:12:54,008
I'll see if you keep your promise.

204
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,408
Okay.

205
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:20,828
Are you done eating?

206
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:24,038
Yes. I enjoyed the food a lot, thanks to you.

207
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,438
Let's have dessert, then.

208
00:13:26,968 --> 00:13:30,208
No. The food was so good that I ate too much.

209
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,038
I'm too full to eat dessert.

210
00:13:32,038 --> 00:13:35,348
No, come on. You always have room for dessert.

211
00:13:37,178 --> 00:13:38,178
Excuse me.

212
00:13:39,048 --> 00:13:40,218
We'd like some dessert.

213
00:13:42,918 --> 00:13:44,318
I'm really okay.

214
00:13:44,458 --> 00:13:47,388
No. We have to have dessert. It's a must.

215
00:13:47,788 --> 00:13:49,228
Eat just a little.

216
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,838
- All right. - Thank you.

217
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:01,838
Thank you.

218
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:05,208
How are we going to eat all this?

219
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:07,648
You should at least taste it.

220
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:10,148
What?

221
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:13,018
Go ahead...

222
00:14:13,788 --> 00:14:14,818
and cut the cake.

223
00:14:18,588 --> 00:14:19,658
Now.

224
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,638
I'm too full to eat the cake.

225
00:14:31,638 --> 00:14:32,708
Instead...

226
00:14:44,878 --> 00:14:45,888
What?

227
00:14:46,688 --> 00:14:47,688
What's that?

228
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,258
I'll take this.

229
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:57,428
How did you know?

230
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:58,428
My gosh.

231
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:00,568
This feels outdated,

232
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:02,838
but this is so typical of you.

233
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:05,908
My gosh.

234
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:08,568
Here. Put it on my finger.

235
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:10,778
Hang on.

236
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:15,578
Oh, dear.

237
00:15:45,948 --> 00:15:47,248
I'm sorry...

238
00:15:48,978 --> 00:15:50,118
for taking too long.

239
00:15:52,248 --> 00:15:53,418
Thank you.

240
00:15:54,948 --> 00:15:56,318
Let's start over.

241
00:16:07,568 --> 00:16:10,098
(Hyun Jin Young, go! Heung Soo, go! Reunited after years, but why?)

242
00:16:18,008 --> 00:16:20,148
After you streamed drunk because of Ms. Kim,

243
00:16:20,978 --> 00:16:22,848
you lost half of your subscribers.

244
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,518
(Dancing Prince)

245
00:16:24,878 --> 00:16:27,348
I guess I wasn't in my right mind back then.

246
00:16:28,818 --> 00:16:29,988
What were you thinking?

247
00:16:32,588 --> 00:16:34,128
I have no excuse for that.

248
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:39,728
Don't worry.

249
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:42,968
I will double your subscribers...

250
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:46,008
and bring back all the fans who have left you.

251
00:16:46,838 --> 00:16:48,038
Just trust me.

252
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:52,778
Forget it.

253
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:56,878
After Jin Young's upcoming concert,

254
00:16:57,448 --> 00:16:59,518
I will end my career in the show business.

255
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:03,418
What are you talking about?

256
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,958
Now, I will go back to being an ordinary person...

257
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:08,858
and live a normal life.

258
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:12,698
Then you won't have to endure all that distress again.

259
00:17:14,728 --> 00:17:15,798
Heung Soo.

260
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:20,538
I've lived my life doing what I wanted to do.

261
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:23,638
So, I've decided to adjust it to suit you...

262
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:24,978
from now on.

263
00:17:28,678 --> 00:17:29,878
Do you really mean that?

264
00:17:31,178 --> 00:17:32,478
Of course, I do.

265
00:17:46,568 --> 00:17:48,168
- Hello? - Hello.

266
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:50,598
This is Nam Gi Ppeum, the KBC documentary director.

267
00:17:50,598 --> 00:17:51,938
We met the other day.

268
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:54,068
Hello, Director Nam.

269
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:55,808
What's the matter?

270
00:17:57,608 --> 00:18:00,648
You want to film me?

271
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:04,248
Does he want to film you?

272
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:06,518
Yes.

273
00:18:07,888 --> 00:18:09,048
Of course.

274
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:12,618
We will register our marriage and start living together.

275
00:18:13,888 --> 00:18:16,028
Is Mi Sun okay with that?

276
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:17,498
Yes.

277
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:19,428
This isn't our first marriage.

278
00:18:19,828 --> 00:18:21,598
And she's not the type to care about empty formalities.

279
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:25,038
We will just go on a two-day trip after the marriage registration.

280
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:28,408
That sounds like a good idea.

281
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,408
By the way, Kwang Sook,

282
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,118
Mi Sun has lived a lonely life,

283
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:40,848
so she wants to live with a big family.

284
00:18:40,848 --> 00:18:42,788
She says she wants to move in here with me,

285
00:18:43,888 --> 00:18:45,118
but I'm worried...

286
00:18:45,118 --> 00:18:48,028
you and Ms. Gong would be uncomfortable.

287
00:18:48,588 --> 00:18:51,628
So I'm thinking about moving into Mi Sun's place.

288
00:18:51,628 --> 00:18:52,998
What do you think?

289
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:57,698
If Mi Sun wants to move in with us,

290
00:18:58,298 --> 00:19:00,208
I'm all for it.

291
00:19:00,938 --> 00:19:02,978
Aren't you going to feel uncomfortable?

292
00:19:03,178 --> 00:19:05,538
That's the fun of living with a big family.

293
00:19:05,538 --> 00:19:06,848
Why would I be uncomfortable?

294
00:19:07,408 --> 00:19:09,478
I have no problem with that.

295
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:12,848
Are you sure you'll be all right?

296
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:15,248
Of course.

297
00:19:15,248 --> 00:19:17,688
I mean, I'll finally have someone underneath me.

298
00:19:20,758 --> 00:19:21,758
Thank you.

299
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:24,928
I hope she won't cause any trouble underneath you.

300
00:19:26,428 --> 00:19:29,568
Mi Sun isn't someone who causes trouble.

301
00:19:29,798 --> 00:19:30,998
I'm so happy for you.

302
00:19:32,668 --> 00:19:33,708
Thank you.

303
00:19:38,108 --> 00:19:39,708
Chun Soo told me about it.

304
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:43,118
You said I could move in with you.

305
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:47,818
It's not really my decision to make. I'm just grateful.

306
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:51,958
You'd probably want to start your married life alone.

307
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:54,658
I'm thankful that you want to live...

308
00:19:54,658 --> 00:19:55,858
with our family.

309
00:19:58,758 --> 00:20:02,728
I've known Heung Soo, Beom Soo, and Kang Soo since they were little.

310
00:20:03,298 --> 00:20:05,468
They're all like my little brothers.

311
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:09,068
And you tried your best so things could work out...

312
00:20:09,268 --> 00:20:10,838
for Chun Soo and me.

313
00:20:12,738 --> 00:20:14,448
I'm thankful to all of you,

314
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,148
so I want us to rely on each other as we live together.

315
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:19,488
I've been all alone,

316
00:20:20,588 --> 00:20:22,088
which made me really lonely.

317
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:25,118
All right.

318
00:20:25,118 --> 00:20:28,688
Let's have a lot of fun, living together.

319
00:20:30,228 --> 00:20:31,458
Thank you.

320
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:38,368
Mom, are you sleeping...

321
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:44,208
Where did she go?

322
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:53,118
Hello?

323
00:20:53,188 --> 00:20:55,388
Mom, where are you?

324
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:58,688
I'm out for a walk.

325
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:02,958
Why would you go for a walk this late at night?

326
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:04,458
Well...

327
00:21:05,298 --> 00:21:08,398
I was going to sleep, but it was kind of hot,

328
00:21:08,398 --> 00:21:10,438
and I couldn't fall asleep, so I came out for a while.

329
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:13,338
Anyway, why were you looking for me at this hour?

330
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,338
Mom.

331
00:21:15,668 --> 00:21:17,538
It's Chun Soo.

332
00:21:17,978 --> 00:21:19,038
He's...

333
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:21,578
marrying Mi Sun.

334
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:24,048
I saw that coming.

335
00:21:25,648 --> 00:21:28,488
But Mi Sun...

336
00:21:28,748 --> 00:21:31,258
wants to live with the family,

337
00:21:32,058 --> 00:21:33,528
so I told her she could move in.

338
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:36,058
You don't mind, do you?

339
00:21:36,188 --> 00:21:37,628
I can't believe you.

340
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:42,868
The two of us are likely to move out soon, but...

341
00:21:44,168 --> 00:21:47,308
Fine, whatever. Just hang up already. I'm busy.

342
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:51,778
Was that the boss?

343
00:21:52,338 --> 00:21:55,778
Yes. Chun Soo and the convenience store owner...

344
00:21:56,278 --> 00:21:57,448
are tying the knot.

345
00:21:57,518 --> 00:21:59,448
That's great news.

346
00:22:01,348 --> 00:22:02,448
By the way,

347
00:22:03,258 --> 00:22:05,588
when the boss finds out...

348
00:22:05,918 --> 00:22:07,588
that we're dating,

349
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:10,128
she's going to be shocked. So, what do we do?

350
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:11,928
Why worry?

351
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:15,128
We're not doing anything wrong. Don't let her scare you.

352
00:22:15,368 --> 00:22:19,498
Still, how about we keep this under wraps for now?

353
00:22:19,768 --> 00:22:21,038
You're such a scaredy-cat.

354
00:22:22,238 --> 00:22:23,278
Fine.

355
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:27,908
It's over with the woman from your blind date, right?

356
00:22:27,908 --> 00:22:29,448
Of course.

357
00:22:31,178 --> 00:22:33,448
If I catch you two-timing me, I will...

358
00:22:35,788 --> 00:22:36,858
You're toast.

359
00:22:36,918 --> 00:22:38,288
That will never happen.

360
00:22:40,928 --> 00:22:43,028
Say, "Ah."

361
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:44,228
"Ah."

362
00:22:51,715 --> 00:22:53,075
You shouldn't resent me.

363
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:56,215
You broke your word...

364
00:22:56,715 --> 00:22:59,055
the very next day after promising you'd never see Kang Soo again.

365
00:23:00,155 --> 00:23:03,785
No matter what you say, I can't trust you now.

366
00:23:06,225 --> 00:23:07,825
You lied...

367
00:23:07,825 --> 00:23:10,065
about going on a business trip just to test me.

368
00:23:10,495 --> 00:23:11,935
You're hardly more trustworthy.

369
00:23:17,435 --> 00:23:19,405
If you had kept your word,

370
00:23:19,635 --> 00:23:21,305
I would have kept the truth buried.

371
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,005
You're the one who ruined everything.

372
00:23:27,915 --> 00:23:29,385
That's why we should split.

373
00:23:29,385 --> 00:23:31,485
Why stay married if all we'll do is argue?

374
00:23:31,755 --> 00:23:33,555
I've made it clear...

375
00:23:34,415 --> 00:23:37,555
that only I can suggest a divorce.

376
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:39,895
What?

377
00:23:40,825 --> 00:23:43,625
You'll be by my side forever,

378
00:23:43,895 --> 00:23:45,165
paying for what you did.

379
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:47,295
I won't let you go free.

380
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:48,735
Honey, please.

381
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:53,235
I'm going to sleep now. Don't disturb me.

382
00:24:40,255 --> 00:24:41,315
What are you doing?

383
00:24:41,415 --> 00:24:43,085
Don't lay a hand on my mother.

384
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,025
Today is your birthday.

385
00:24:48,995 --> 00:24:50,325
I wanted to...

386
00:24:51,495 --> 00:24:54,465
make you seaweed soup on your birthday for once.

387
00:24:54,465 --> 00:24:56,035
That's why I invited you.

388
00:24:59,005 --> 00:25:00,605
My poor baby.

389
00:25:23,365 --> 00:25:26,195
(June 19)

390
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:34,875
(My birthday, Save)

391
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:38,075
(June 19: My birthday)

392
00:25:44,885 --> 00:25:45,985
Listen up.

393
00:25:46,985 --> 00:25:49,025
To wish Chun Soo a great new beginning,

394
00:25:49,025 --> 00:25:50,585
how about we give him a round of applause...

395
00:25:50,585 --> 00:25:52,355
before breakfast, Ms. Gong?

396
00:25:52,595 --> 00:25:54,995
Okay. Sounds good to me.

397
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,765
Everyone, applaud!

398
00:25:59,695 --> 00:26:00,735
- Good for you. - It's great.

399
00:26:02,165 --> 00:26:03,265
It's a bit embarrassing.

400
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:05,475
- Congratulations, Chun Soo. - Thanks.

401
00:26:05,835 --> 00:26:07,375
Have you picked a date for the wedding?

402
00:26:07,505 --> 00:26:09,005
We'll skip the ceremony...

403
00:26:09,245 --> 00:26:11,475
and go on our honeymoon after registering our marriage.

404
00:26:11,915 --> 00:26:13,575
Won't Mi Sun be upset about that?

405
00:26:14,145 --> 00:26:16,085
She's the one who suggested it.

406
00:26:17,385 --> 00:26:20,515
Still, you should redo the walls and floor in your room.

407
00:26:20,655 --> 00:26:22,655
Hey, Beom Soo, Kang Soo. Clear some time...

408
00:26:22,655 --> 00:26:23,725
in your schedules this week.

409
00:26:24,255 --> 00:26:26,455
We should redecorate the room for the newlyweds ourselves.

410
00:26:27,695 --> 00:26:28,765
Sure thing.

411
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:31,595
Anyone who needs to move in should do it quickly,

412
00:26:31,595 --> 00:26:33,835
and those who are leaving should get going.

413
00:26:38,705 --> 00:26:42,075
Your sister-in-law deserves a new beginning as well.

414
00:26:42,075 --> 00:26:44,445
- Mom! - It's not like I'm wrong.

415
00:26:44,775 --> 00:26:45,845
Chairman Han...

416
00:26:45,945 --> 00:26:48,815
passed the brothers' test with all his might ages ago,

417
00:26:49,345 --> 00:26:51,085
yet he still hasn't said a word.

418
00:26:52,515 --> 00:26:55,525
Anyway, now that Chun Soo has set things in motion,

419
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:58,655
let's all get on with our lives. Got it?

420
00:26:58,955 --> 00:27:00,725
Yes, absolutely.

421
00:27:01,725 --> 00:27:04,595
We're ready for what's to come, Kwang Sook.

422
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:09,835
He's not just saying that. We all mean it.

423
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:17,775
We should hurry up with breakfast and get ready for work.

424
00:27:17,975 --> 00:27:19,275
- Dig in. - Sure.

425
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:21,575
- Enjoy your breakfast. - Enjoy.

426
00:27:23,245 --> 00:27:25,355
(Economy Day)

427
00:27:26,515 --> 00:27:27,755
Hey, good morning.

428
00:27:28,885 --> 00:27:30,025
Did you sleep well?

429
00:27:30,825 --> 00:27:33,095
I'm still a bit jet-lagged,

430
00:27:33,095 --> 00:27:34,455
so not really.

431
00:27:35,095 --> 00:27:37,165
I also had an unsettling dream.

432
00:27:38,635 --> 00:27:40,495
- Have a seat. - Sure.

433
00:27:46,235 --> 00:27:48,445
I know this isn't anything original,

434
00:27:49,175 --> 00:27:52,915
but you've always been more than just a son-in-law to me.

435
00:27:54,145 --> 00:27:57,445
I wouldn't go so far as to say you're like a son,

436
00:27:58,515 --> 00:28:00,115
but I've thought of you...

437
00:28:00,215 --> 00:28:02,485
as something between a son and a son-in-law.

438
00:28:03,385 --> 00:28:07,355
That's why I genuinely want you to be happy.

439
00:28:08,695 --> 00:28:10,165
I don't view your remarriage...

440
00:28:10,165 --> 00:28:12,595
as a betrayal to my daughter in any way.

441
00:28:14,095 --> 00:28:15,265
I'm aware.

442
00:28:15,805 --> 00:28:17,165
You have many years to live,

443
00:28:18,035 --> 00:28:20,605
and you deserve to marry someone new.

444
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:23,475
However,

445
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:26,545
I do hope you'll make your decision more carefully.

446
00:28:27,845 --> 00:28:30,885
Being a good person alone is too vague a reason.

447
00:28:31,955 --> 00:28:33,455
The person who marries you...

448
00:28:34,015 --> 00:28:35,225
should be able to handle...

449
00:28:35,225 --> 00:28:37,285
all the responsibilities that come with the position.

450
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:42,425
Ms. Ma...

451
00:28:43,525 --> 00:28:45,365
is more than capable...

452
00:28:45,365 --> 00:28:46,895
of handling the pressure and then some.

453
00:28:47,635 --> 00:28:48,635
Is that so?

454
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:51,365
But I saw someone lacking the seriousness needed...

455
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,775
to handle the responsibilities.

456
00:28:55,205 --> 00:28:58,245
Maybe if you look at her without prejudice,

457
00:28:58,845 --> 00:29:01,575
you'll see her differently.

458
00:29:03,485 --> 00:29:04,585
Maybe.

459
00:29:05,715 --> 00:29:07,915
I want nothing more than to be wrong.

460
00:29:19,735 --> 00:29:21,795
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

461
00:29:22,035 --> 00:29:23,205
I hope you haven't forgotten...

462
00:29:23,205 --> 00:29:25,035
about the VIP fashion show event this afternoon.

463
00:29:26,575 --> 00:29:28,105
- Is that today? - Yes.

464
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:29,845
Bom will host the event,

465
00:29:29,845 --> 00:29:32,345
and Oh Kang Soo will walk the runway.

466
00:29:33,215 --> 00:29:34,645
He'll walk the runway himself?

467
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:38,245
That's right. His photos for the lookbook...

468
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:39,685
were well-received,

469
00:29:39,885 --> 00:29:41,855
so they're having him walk the runway as well.

470
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:44,625
He looks like a model, doesn't he?

471
00:29:45,695 --> 00:29:47,255
According to the design team,

472
00:29:47,255 --> 00:29:49,565
Mr. Oh has great character...

473
00:29:49,895 --> 00:29:51,795
and handles his work efficiently.

474
00:29:51,995 --> 00:29:53,665
They've been singing his praises.

475
00:29:53,965 --> 00:29:54,965
Really?

476
00:29:55,365 --> 00:29:57,665
I guess I'm a good judge of character.

477
00:30:02,475 --> 00:30:04,175
I'll watch Ha Ni today.

478
00:30:04,705 --> 00:30:06,815
I can drop her off with the sitter on my way to campus.

479
00:30:07,715 --> 00:30:09,315
I'm working the night shift today,

480
00:30:09,485 --> 00:30:11,885
so I can watch Ha Ni until you get off work.

481
00:30:12,555 --> 00:30:14,555
Thanks for this. I'll try to hurry back...

482
00:30:14,555 --> 00:30:15,625
after my classes.

483
00:30:15,625 --> 00:30:17,085
Don't worry about us and head out.

484
00:30:31,905 --> 00:30:33,035
Ha Ni.

485
00:30:33,435 --> 00:30:35,975
After your nap, we'll go have some fun.

486
00:30:49,385 --> 00:30:50,625
Hey, Professor Oh.

487
00:30:51,325 --> 00:30:53,025
Is this a good time to talk?

488
00:30:53,355 --> 00:30:54,395
Of course.

489
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:55,925
I hope everything's okay.

490
00:30:56,095 --> 00:30:58,835
Kang Soo's been worried sick, so I called.

491
00:31:01,635 --> 00:31:03,535
Kang Soo's worried about me?

492
00:31:04,465 --> 00:31:06,235
Yes, quite a bit.

493
00:31:08,875 --> 00:31:11,175
I'm fine, so there's no need to worry.

494
00:31:12,415 --> 00:31:14,245
I hope Kang Soo is okay.

495
00:31:14,675 --> 00:31:15,745
He is.

496
00:31:16,145 --> 00:31:19,785
The company he works for is hosting a fashion show today,

497
00:31:19,785 --> 00:31:22,225
and he'll be modeling the clothes on stage.

498
00:31:23,225 --> 00:31:24,225
Really?

499
00:31:24,355 --> 00:31:26,425
He was chosen to represent the employees.

500
00:31:29,725 --> 00:31:31,065
I see.

501
00:31:39,835 --> 00:31:40,905
Ha Ni.

502
00:31:41,135 --> 00:31:44,405
We'll go for a walk, take photos,

503
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:47,945
and eat lots of tasty buns. Sound good?

504
00:32:08,595 --> 00:32:11,735
Goodness me. What a sweet baby.

505
00:32:12,005 --> 00:32:14,505
Hi, what's your name?

506
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,475
My gosh.

507
00:32:17,345 --> 00:32:18,645
She's Oh Ha Ni.

508
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:19,915
So you're Ha Ni.

509
00:32:20,015 --> 00:32:22,645
Ha Ni, how many months old are you?

510
00:32:23,315 --> 00:32:25,755
"My 1st birthday was 2 months ago."

511
00:32:26,055 --> 00:32:27,415
Is that so?

512
00:32:27,515 --> 00:32:29,155
She looks just like her mom,

513
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,725
especially with her strong facial features.

514
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:32,755
How can she be this pretty?

515
00:32:33,525 --> 00:32:35,825
- Do we really look alike? - Yes.

516
00:32:35,825 --> 00:32:38,025
My gosh. You're like two peas in a pod.

517
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:42,235
You'll grow into a beautiful lady, just like your mom.

518
00:32:42,805 --> 00:32:44,735
Men will line up for her attention.

519
00:32:46,505 --> 00:32:47,975
- There you go. - What a sweetheart.

520
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:50,245
- She's so pretty. - Goodness.

521
00:32:53,175 --> 00:32:54,415
How dare she play house,

522
00:32:55,215 --> 00:32:56,915
pretending to be my baby's mom?

523
00:32:57,115 --> 00:32:58,445
Do you live around here?

524
00:32:58,445 --> 00:32:59,485
Yes.

525
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:22,005
Some ladies in the neighborhood said Ha Ni looked just like me.

526
00:33:22,545 --> 00:33:24,005
We really do look alike, don't we?

527
00:33:33,885 --> 00:33:37,325
(Peach Jam Toast)

528
00:33:40,195 --> 00:33:41,295
Please enjoy.

529
00:33:41,455 --> 00:33:42,465
- Right. - Sure.

530
00:33:42,465 --> 00:33:43,925
- We'll enjoy. - Thank you.

531
00:33:44,595 --> 00:33:46,465
- It's delicious. - Thank you.

532
00:33:47,135 --> 00:33:48,495
- Try the potato bites. - These?

533
00:33:48,495 --> 00:33:49,565
Yes, they're tasty.

534
00:33:49,565 --> 00:33:51,405
- I love the potatoes. - Standard is my favorite.

535
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:53,135
Have a sip of cola as well.

536
00:34:00,145 --> 00:34:01,975
Ok Bun, I'm a nervous wreck.

537
00:34:02,645 --> 00:34:03,715
Don't be intimidated.

538
00:34:04,185 --> 00:34:06,615
Just do exactly what we practiced earlier. Got it?

539
00:34:06,615 --> 00:34:07,615
Sure.

540
00:34:10,185 --> 00:34:12,455
Heung Soo, you can head to the kitchen now.

541
00:34:12,555 --> 00:34:13,555
Sure.

542
00:34:21,235 --> 00:34:23,805
Heung Soo, you've got this!

543
00:34:23,805 --> 00:34:25,005
Good luck to me.

544
00:34:26,505 --> 00:34:27,505
Sorry.

545
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:30,645
Just act as you normally would.

546
00:34:31,105 --> 00:34:32,745
Try not to be too conscious of the camera.

547
00:34:33,515 --> 00:34:34,675
Sure. Got it.

548
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:36,315
Right.

549
00:34:37,085 --> 00:34:39,055
All right. Ready,

550
00:34:39,685 --> 00:34:40,685
action.

551
00:34:40,885 --> 00:34:43,125
Mr. Oh, you said you were a dancer.

552
00:34:43,785 --> 00:34:46,055
Sorry? Oh, right.

553
00:34:47,525 --> 00:34:49,625
In the evenings,

554
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:51,695
I've been rehearsing...

555
00:34:51,695 --> 00:34:53,865
for Hyun Jin Young's 35th-anniversary show.

556
00:34:54,035 --> 00:34:57,365
During the day, I make sandwiches.

557
00:34:59,405 --> 00:35:00,405
Right, cut.

558
00:35:02,705 --> 00:35:05,875
Try not to be so stiff with your answers.

559
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:08,145
Maybe you could be a bit more relaxed.

560
00:35:08,145 --> 00:35:09,315
Sorry about that.

561
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,215
I'm just nervous, being in front of the camera.

562
00:35:11,415 --> 00:35:13,285
- Heung Soo. - Yes?

563
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:16,755
Don't look at the camera. Say it to me instead.

564
00:35:16,755 --> 00:35:17,785
Got it?

565
00:35:18,585 --> 00:35:20,525
All right. We'll take it from the top.

566
00:35:20,525 --> 00:35:21,595
Sure.

567
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,995
Wait, hold on.

568
00:35:23,995 --> 00:35:26,795
Look at me over here.

569
00:35:26,935 --> 00:35:28,095
Relax.

570
00:35:28,395 --> 00:35:29,805
Got it, Ok Bun.

571
00:35:30,535 --> 00:35:31,565
All right.

572
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,105
Ready, action.

573
00:35:34,935 --> 00:35:37,275
Mr. Oh, you said you were a dancer.

574
00:35:37,305 --> 00:35:38,915
Look at me.

575
00:35:39,675 --> 00:35:40,675
That's right.

576
00:35:41,215 --> 00:35:43,315
In the evenings, I'm at the dance studio practicing,

577
00:35:43,915 --> 00:35:46,255
and during the day, I make sandwiches.

578
00:35:47,955 --> 00:35:49,955
Both are a part of my life.

579
00:35:51,455 --> 00:35:55,155
Wait. Hold on. Just a second.

580
00:35:55,865 --> 00:35:57,765
His hair's sticking out in the back.

581
00:35:57,765 --> 00:35:59,495
Let me fix it for him.

582
00:35:59,495 --> 00:36:00,595
Sorry about that.

583
00:36:02,135 --> 00:36:03,665
Who is that woman?

584
00:36:04,405 --> 00:36:06,405
She's Mr. Oh's manager.

585
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:07,435
His manager?

586
00:36:11,375 --> 00:36:12,975
- Yes. - Yes.

587
00:36:12,975 --> 00:36:14,175
You've got this.

588
00:36:14,175 --> 00:36:15,545
- I can do it. - Yes.

589
00:36:15,545 --> 00:36:16,585
Eyes on me.

590
00:36:17,985 --> 00:36:20,515
Got it. I can do this.

591
00:36:21,515 --> 00:36:23,285
What? Oh, sure.

592
00:36:26,455 --> 00:36:28,595
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

593
00:36:28,595 --> 00:36:29,595
Come in.

594
00:36:31,665 --> 00:36:34,495
Vice-CEO Oh Chun Soo of Eagle Brewery is here.

595
00:36:34,565 --> 00:36:35,965
Sure. Please escort him in.

596
00:36:37,305 --> 00:36:38,305
Hello, Chairman Han.

597
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:41,005
- Come on in, Chun Soo. - Right.

598
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:42,875
Have a seat.

599
00:36:49,445 --> 00:36:51,585
Well, Chairman Han, I'm...

600
00:36:53,115 --> 00:36:54,315
getting married.

601
00:36:55,455 --> 00:36:57,555
I thought I should tell you in person,

602
00:36:57,725 --> 00:36:59,225
so I came up after delivering the makgeolli.

603
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:01,995
Kwang Sook already told me.

604
00:37:01,995 --> 00:37:02,995
Congratulations.

605
00:37:02,995 --> 00:37:04,025
Thank you.

606
00:37:04,465 --> 00:37:06,035
There won't be a wedding,

607
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:07,865
but instead, we'll be having...

608
00:37:07,865 --> 00:37:09,405
a family dinner next weekend.

609
00:37:09,765 --> 00:37:12,065
Does that mean I'm also invited?

610
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:15,035
I'd be honored to have you there.

611
00:37:17,175 --> 00:37:20,445
My gosh. How does it feel to be a newlywed again?

612
00:37:22,845 --> 00:37:26,315
I feel a little embarrassed tying the knot before you.

613
00:37:27,585 --> 00:37:29,825
Tell me about it. I'm jealous.

614
00:37:31,855 --> 00:37:34,625
Kwang Sook's mother must be feeling a bit anxious.

615
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,795
Even this morning, she mentioned how she wanted Kwang Sook...

616
00:37:37,795 --> 00:37:39,695
to start her new life soon.

617
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:42,635
I see.

618
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:46,405
My brothers and I have no issues...

619
00:37:47,335 --> 00:37:48,535
with what she said.

620
00:37:48,535 --> 00:37:49,575
So,

621
00:37:50,745 --> 00:37:52,575
please feel free to proceed.

622
00:37:57,715 --> 00:37:58,815
That I should.

623
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:01,185
I'll be following your lead shortly.

624
00:38:01,715 --> 00:38:02,725
Sure.

625
00:38:11,895 --> 00:38:14,365
Hey, I'm telling the truth.

626
00:38:14,365 --> 00:38:17,105
That woman's mother acted as if she'd marry her daughter...

627
00:38:17,105 --> 00:38:18,405
off to me right away.

628
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:20,305
So I even bought her a designer bag.

629
00:38:20,305 --> 00:38:22,335
I barely got my money back.

630
00:38:22,905 --> 00:38:25,105
The mother and daughter are a pair of gold diggers.

631
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:28,075
He wants to marry my daughter so much...

632
00:38:28,445 --> 00:38:31,215
that he practically took all four...

633
00:38:31,215 --> 00:38:33,585
of her brothers-in-law under his wing.

634
00:38:34,055 --> 00:38:35,255
Her brothers-in-law?

635
00:38:35,615 --> 00:38:36,625
Yes.

636
00:38:39,595 --> 00:38:41,655
I can't just sit idly by and watch things burn.

637
00:38:42,965 --> 00:38:45,965
I need to take action for the sake of the kids.

638
00:38:49,335 --> 00:38:52,165
(Eagle Brewery)

639
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:06,285
Judging by how proud she was of her products,

640
00:39:06,285 --> 00:39:08,055
I thought the brewery would be bigger in size.

641
00:39:09,425 --> 00:39:10,855
Instead, it's just a corner shop.

642
00:39:25,935 --> 00:39:27,005
Boss.

643
00:39:28,175 --> 00:39:29,405
You have a visitor.

644
00:39:30,105 --> 00:39:31,105
A visitor?

645
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:35,915
Goodness.

646
00:39:38,885 --> 00:39:40,115
Hello.

647
00:39:41,985 --> 00:39:43,885
Could I get a cup of tea?

648
00:39:54,224 --> 00:39:55,994
I'm sorry we only have instant coffee.

649
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:05,704
I came by to ask a few questions.

650
00:40:07,734 --> 00:40:09,174
Chairman Han...

651
00:40:10,004 --> 00:40:12,744
lived alone for 15 years, unable to move on from my daughter.

652
00:40:13,374 --> 00:40:15,874
There must not have been much love between you and your late husband,

653
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:18,384
considering you're already thinking about remarrying.

654
00:40:21,384 --> 00:40:25,084
I lost my husband just ten days after marrying him,

655
00:40:27,754 --> 00:40:29,154
but I loved...

656
00:40:29,754 --> 00:40:32,164
my late husband dearly.

657
00:40:34,564 --> 00:40:36,894
I've been grateful for our moments together,

658
00:40:37,904 --> 00:40:39,204
and even after the dust settled,

659
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:44,134
I did my best to make our memories meaningful.

660
00:40:45,604 --> 00:40:46,674
And now,

661
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:52,514
I love Chairman Han in a way that's different,

662
00:40:53,114 --> 00:40:56,114
with new emotions, unlike the love I had...

663
00:40:57,654 --> 00:40:59,784
for my late husband.

664
00:41:02,524 --> 00:41:05,124
I carry the love for two men in my heart now,

665
00:41:05,894 --> 00:41:07,394
and I don't consider loving Chairman Han...

666
00:41:08,764 --> 00:41:12,434
a betrayal of my late husband.

667
00:41:15,704 --> 00:41:17,634
I see you have a way with words.

668
00:41:19,474 --> 00:41:20,504
Sorry?

669
00:41:21,074 --> 00:41:22,114
So,

670
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,644
if you were to remarry,

671
00:41:25,914 --> 00:41:28,084
what would happen to the brewery?

672
00:41:30,284 --> 00:41:31,484
As of now,

673
00:41:32,224 --> 00:41:34,354
I want to continue running it.

674
00:41:35,054 --> 00:41:37,294
Don't you think you're being selfish?

675
00:41:38,324 --> 00:41:39,764
When you remarry,

676
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:42,394
this brewery will belong to your former husband's family,

677
00:41:43,164 --> 00:41:45,564
and you can no longer say it's yours.

678
00:41:49,434 --> 00:41:50,904
After my husband passed,

679
00:41:51,804 --> 00:41:53,904
the brewery almost fell apart.

680
00:41:54,104 --> 00:41:55,544
I stepped in with my own funds,

681
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,544
and as we run it together, I've grown closer...

682
00:41:59,084 --> 00:42:01,414
to my brothers-in-law, feeling like we're siblings.

683
00:42:03,014 --> 00:42:04,284
I consider the brewery...

684
00:42:04,784 --> 00:42:07,124
to be mine too, and a vital part of my life.

685
00:42:07,954 --> 00:42:09,754
Doesn't remarrying imply...

686
00:42:10,794 --> 00:42:13,264
letting go of your life...

687
00:42:14,364 --> 00:42:17,134
with your former husband and starting fresh?

688
00:42:17,834 --> 00:42:19,434
On top of that, Chairman Han...

689
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:22,574
has a career that demands support from all angles.

690
00:42:24,804 --> 00:42:25,874
I'm sorry,

691
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:28,474
but I don't see it that way.

692
00:42:30,144 --> 00:42:32,244
For starters,

693
00:42:32,914 --> 00:42:36,054
Chairman Han has successfully run his business...

694
00:42:36,054 --> 00:42:38,424
on his own for the past 15 years.

695
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:40,454
I doubt he needs help from me,

696
00:42:40,454 --> 00:42:42,924
especially since I know nothing about the hotel industry.

697
00:42:44,054 --> 00:42:45,594
I also don't believe...

698
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:47,964
that remarrying means both people must erase the life they had...

699
00:42:48,334 --> 00:42:50,334
with their former spouses.

700
00:42:51,804 --> 00:42:52,864
In my case,

701
00:42:53,634 --> 00:42:55,774
I will show respect...

702
00:42:56,234 --> 00:42:59,474
to Chairman Han's late wife as the mother of his children.

703
00:43:00,174 --> 00:43:03,474
In that same sense, I believe Chairman Han...

704
00:43:03,644 --> 00:43:07,244
will show me the same respect.

705
00:43:11,054 --> 00:43:12,584
I appreciate the lecture.

706
00:43:13,454 --> 00:43:14,584
I wasn't trying to lecture anyone.

707
00:43:14,794 --> 00:43:17,454
I was simply sharing my thoughts with you.

708
00:43:18,494 --> 00:43:20,164
I apologize if I offended you.

709
00:43:21,434 --> 00:43:23,464
Please don't. Either way,

710
00:43:24,064 --> 00:43:25,504
I've learned a lot today.

711
00:43:32,504 --> 00:43:34,374
(Eagle Brewery)

712
00:43:39,714 --> 00:43:40,884
Allow me.

713
00:43:43,884 --> 00:43:45,354
Take care, ma'am.

714
00:43:51,564 --> 00:43:53,764
(Eagle Brewery)

715
00:43:56,664 --> 00:43:58,434
That felt like a job interview.

716
00:44:02,274 --> 00:44:03,974
And something tells me I didn't pass.

717
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:08,014
(Eagle Brewery)

718
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,884
Where are you headed, Mr. Go?

719
00:44:13,244 --> 00:44:14,314
Oh, right.

720
00:44:14,714 --> 00:44:17,814
I'm meeting a friend for lunch.

721
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:21,224
Enjoy your lunch, then.

722
00:44:21,224 --> 00:44:22,224
Sure.

723
00:44:30,864 --> 00:44:32,404
How far out are you, Mr. Go?

724
00:44:32,504 --> 00:44:33,804
I'm almost there.

725
00:44:33,834 --> 00:44:36,674
Okay, good. I'll order for us both.

726
00:44:37,804 --> 00:44:41,244
Excuse me. I'd like to order two rolls of gimbap and pork cutlet.

727
00:44:41,514 --> 00:44:43,614
You can place your order at the self-service kiosk.

728
00:44:44,814 --> 00:44:46,014
The kiosk?

729
00:44:46,214 --> 00:44:47,214
It's over there.

730
00:44:51,784 --> 00:44:53,424
But I haven't tried this before.

731
00:44:58,124 --> 00:45:00,224
I already pressed pork cutlet, so why does it keep popping up?

732
00:45:01,294 --> 00:45:04,094
Where did the gimbap options go?

733
00:45:05,734 --> 00:45:06,904
This is so annoying.

734
00:45:07,364 --> 00:45:08,834
I'm starving.

735
00:45:09,074 --> 00:45:10,434
Sorry about that.

736
00:45:11,134 --> 00:45:13,004
I won't be long. You must be hungry.

737
00:45:15,774 --> 00:45:17,514
Yes, here they are!

738
00:45:18,244 --> 00:45:19,814
I got it.

739
00:45:19,814 --> 00:45:21,554
(Card payment)

740
00:45:21,614 --> 00:45:23,214
Please insert your credit card...

741
00:45:23,214 --> 00:45:25,454
and wait for confirmation.

742
00:45:25,454 --> 00:45:27,054
Yes! I got it.

743
00:45:27,684 --> 00:45:28,694
Credit card?

744
00:45:32,394 --> 00:45:34,194
Is she for real?

745
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:35,934
Gosh, where is it? I'm so sorry.

746
00:45:36,764 --> 00:45:37,964
Here it is.

747
00:45:39,534 --> 00:45:41,134
Do I insert it here?

748
00:45:41,604 --> 00:45:43,474
Or here? Is it here?

749
00:45:43,674 --> 00:45:44,734
Here.

750
00:45:46,974 --> 00:45:48,444
Why won't it take my card?

751
00:45:55,484 --> 00:45:56,484
Come on.

752
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:58,754
Mrs. Gong.

753
00:46:00,584 --> 00:46:02,024
Allow me.

754
00:46:03,024 --> 00:46:04,194
Mr. Go!

755
00:46:04,354 --> 00:46:06,424
Just wait in your seat.

756
00:46:06,424 --> 00:46:08,334
I'll handle it all.

757
00:46:13,134 --> 00:46:15,574
Excuse me, young ladies.

758
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:27,184
Take your seat.

759
00:46:33,054 --> 00:46:36,524
I didn't expect to feel a generation gap with you,

760
00:46:37,424 --> 00:46:39,224
but I couldn't even order at the kiosk.

761
00:46:40,494 --> 00:46:42,934
I bet I came off as a total grandma just now.

762
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:44,194
Oh, please.

763
00:46:44,364 --> 00:46:46,734
I only knew what to do...

764
00:46:46,734 --> 00:46:47,964
because I eat out a lot.

765
00:46:48,204 --> 00:46:49,974
You shouldn't let that bother you.

766
00:46:55,444 --> 00:46:56,974
Say, "Ah."

767
00:46:57,944 --> 00:46:59,314
"Ah."

768
00:47:00,314 --> 00:47:01,414
"Ah."

769
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,824
Make sure to chew.

770
00:47:08,294 --> 00:47:11,394
How do you manage to look so cute even while eating?

771
00:47:11,924 --> 00:47:13,564
- What? - You're like a baby bird...

772
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,164
being fed by its mother.

773
00:47:15,894 --> 00:47:17,394
Not the mother bird?

774
00:47:17,394 --> 00:47:18,504
Gosh, no.

775
00:47:19,404 --> 00:47:21,064
You'll always be...

776
00:47:22,034 --> 00:47:23,604
my baby bird.

777
00:47:25,004 --> 00:47:26,074
Now, "Ah."

778
00:47:27,204 --> 00:47:29,974
Say, "Ah."

779
00:47:30,374 --> 00:47:31,474
"Ah."

780
00:47:38,454 --> 00:47:39,684
- Here? - Yes.

781
00:47:41,954 --> 00:47:42,954
Hey.

782
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:45,594
- What is it? - Look over there.

783
00:47:45,664 --> 00:47:46,894
Say, "Ah."

784
00:47:46,894 --> 00:47:48,164
- "Ah." - "Ah."

785
00:47:48,194 --> 00:47:50,334
That's Ms. Gong and Mr. Go.

786
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:51,764
- No way. - Oh, my.

787
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:54,104
- What? - Let's walk away quietly.

788
00:47:54,864 --> 00:47:55,874
Hurry.

789
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:08,314
Bom.

790
00:48:10,984 --> 00:48:12,084
Aren't you nervous?

791
00:48:12,754 --> 00:48:14,954
You're probably more nervous than I am.

792
00:48:16,224 --> 00:48:17,724
I have to admit, I'm pretty nervous.

793
00:48:18,124 --> 00:48:19,394
I'm not sure if I'll do a good job.

794
00:48:20,024 --> 00:48:21,164
Please stand by.

795
00:48:21,734 --> 00:48:22,764
Sure.

796
00:48:24,894 --> 00:48:25,904
Let's do this!

797
00:48:43,114 --> 00:48:44,154
Please sit.

798
00:49:15,784 --> 00:49:18,624
The theme of the 2025 LX Fashion SS collection...

799
00:49:18,624 --> 00:49:20,654
is golf and vacation.

800
00:49:21,624 --> 00:49:24,754
Please let me introduce the collection,

801
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,924
combining comfortable, stylish looks...

802
00:49:26,924 --> 00:49:29,494
with the functionality of golf wear.

803
00:49:38,774 --> 00:49:41,474
It is a line featuring graphics that evoke the seasons...

804
00:49:41,474 --> 00:49:43,914
and capture the mood of a vacation getaway.

805
00:49:51,184 --> 00:49:54,184
With cool colors and neat styling,

806
00:49:54,184 --> 00:49:55,554
it adds a touch of flair to your look,

807
00:49:55,554 --> 00:49:57,794
both in everyday life and on the golf course.

808
00:50:23,914 --> 00:50:25,654
You can't leave out golf.

809
00:50:26,284 --> 00:50:27,884
It offers both the functionality...

810
00:50:27,884 --> 00:50:30,454
and design of sportswear.

811
00:50:59,924 --> 00:51:00,954
Wait.

812
00:51:07,524 --> 00:51:10,994
Professor Oh told me you'd be on the fashion show,

813
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:13,404
so I was going to watch it and leave quietly.

814
00:51:13,964 --> 00:51:15,204
But I ended up bothering you.

815
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:18,304
I'm sorry.

816
00:51:19,374 --> 00:51:20,374
Please don't be.

817
00:51:22,374 --> 00:51:23,514
You looked cool.

818
00:51:24,814 --> 00:51:25,914
I enjoyed the show.

819
00:51:29,754 --> 00:51:31,154
I'm sorry about the other day.

820
00:51:34,484 --> 00:51:36,194
I'm sorry that I broke your heart.

821
00:51:37,024 --> 00:51:38,594
Please forget what I said.

822
00:51:41,934 --> 00:51:43,734
You don't need to apologize.

823
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,234
Do you not resent me at all?

824
00:51:50,704 --> 00:51:51,844
I don't resent you.

825
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:57,774
I grew up with my loving parents and brothers who cared for me,

826
00:51:58,584 --> 00:52:00,014
so I couldn't ask for more.

827
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:02,354
I don't resent it at all.

828
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:08,384
Thank you for saying that.

829
00:52:08,824 --> 00:52:09,924
So,

830
00:52:10,424 --> 00:52:13,794
don't feel sorry or pitiful toward me.

831
00:52:15,894 --> 00:52:19,164
I'll live happily the way I have lived so far.

832
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:22,104
So don't worry about me.

833
00:52:25,904 --> 00:52:26,904
Kang Soo.

834
00:52:28,204 --> 00:52:29,314
Goodbye.

835
00:52:49,264 --> 00:52:50,664
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

836
00:52:51,564 --> 00:52:53,204
(Goguryeo Property)

837
00:52:53,204 --> 00:52:54,764
It's been a while, Ms. Jang.

838
00:52:54,764 --> 00:52:57,574
It's been almost two years since we last met, right?

839
00:52:57,574 --> 00:53:00,204
Yes. I guess it's been about two years.

840
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:01,474
All right.

841
00:53:04,914 --> 00:53:08,514
As a major shareholder, I couldn't just sit back and watch,

842
00:53:08,754 --> 00:53:10,484
so I asked to see you.

843
00:53:12,424 --> 00:53:14,384
Is there a problem with the company?

844
00:53:15,224 --> 00:53:17,494
Mr. Dokgo stepped up...

845
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:19,424
and apologized publicly...

846
00:53:20,124 --> 00:53:22,494
for the fake video last time,

847
00:53:23,494 --> 00:53:26,404
but public opinion has not changed yet.

848
00:53:27,034 --> 00:53:28,734
Due to the tarnished reputation of the company,

849
00:53:29,004 --> 00:53:31,704
the sales have fallen by more than 30 percent,

850
00:53:31,704 --> 00:53:35,174
and the stock price has dropped even further.

851
00:53:35,544 --> 00:53:38,714
I see. I'm well aware of that.

852
00:53:38,714 --> 00:53:41,514
In this situation, Mr. Dokgo is pushing ahead...

853
00:53:41,514 --> 00:53:44,854
with the construction of a new factory and a subsidiary,

854
00:53:45,754 --> 00:53:48,754
practically pouring...

855
00:53:48,754 --> 00:53:50,854
all the company's funds into it.

856
00:53:53,124 --> 00:53:55,194
This is my first time hearing about this.

857
00:53:55,334 --> 00:53:57,934
He is pushing ahead with the construction...

858
00:53:57,934 --> 00:54:01,604
of a new premium-line factory, saying he'd beat Eagle Brewery.

859
00:54:02,574 --> 00:54:06,304
The company's financial manager was very concerned,

860
00:54:06,304 --> 00:54:08,144
so he told me about it.

861
00:54:08,344 --> 00:54:09,614
Eagle Brewery?

862
00:54:10,074 --> 00:54:11,944
The financial situation is already bad enough...

863
00:54:11,944 --> 00:54:13,644
due to the declining sales.

864
00:54:14,014 --> 00:54:16,284
But this is a project that requires...

865
00:54:16,284 --> 00:54:18,854
all the spare funds the company has.

866
00:54:19,824 --> 00:54:21,754
If this becomes official,

867
00:54:21,754 --> 00:54:23,724
the stock price will fall even further.

868
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:45,414
Hello, Mother.

869
00:54:46,114 --> 00:54:48,314
If you don't have any other plans, come home early today.

870
00:54:49,384 --> 00:54:51,584
I have something to say to you and the children.

871
00:54:52,324 --> 00:54:55,024
Is there something special going on?

872
00:54:55,594 --> 00:54:57,694
You will find out once you come home and listen.

873
00:54:58,454 --> 00:55:00,094
Okay. I will.

874
00:55:00,094 --> 00:55:02,734
I'll leave now, then.

875
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:07,104
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

876
00:55:17,214 --> 00:55:18,944
Hello, sweetie.

877
00:55:19,784 --> 00:55:20,884
Are you working?

878
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:22,714
I'm cooking rice now.

879
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:25,954
Chun Soo went out to deliver makgeolli,

880
00:55:25,954 --> 00:55:28,924
and Mr. Go and Kim went to the farm.

881
00:55:30,194 --> 00:55:32,824
I'm getting off work early today.

882
00:55:33,524 --> 00:55:35,094
Why? Is something wrong?

883
00:55:35,434 --> 00:55:38,134
I guess Mother has something to say...

884
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:40,564
to me and my children.

885
00:55:42,574 --> 00:55:43,634
I see.

886
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:55,684
What's wrong, Kwang Sook?

887
00:55:57,214 --> 00:55:58,214
Hello?

888
00:56:02,194 --> 00:56:03,294
What happened?

889
00:56:13,134 --> 00:56:15,774
I guess Dad is busy with work.

890
00:56:17,334 --> 00:56:18,704
I'll try calling him again.

891
00:56:24,514 --> 00:56:27,314
The call cannot be connected and will be transferred to voicemail.

892
00:56:29,014 --> 00:56:30,254
He's not answering.

893
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:41,024
(Eagle Brewery)

894
00:56:59,444 --> 00:57:01,084
I'm glad it isn't so serious.

895
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,984
It could've been really dangerous.

896
00:57:04,214 --> 00:57:06,324
I'm sorry for worrying you.

897
00:57:06,524 --> 00:57:08,424
Apologizing to me isn't important.

898
00:57:08,424 --> 00:57:10,594
It could've been really serious.

899
00:57:12,364 --> 00:57:14,624
The steam pipe was quite old,

900
00:57:14,624 --> 00:57:17,364
so I thought I'd have it repaired sometime.

901
00:57:18,234 --> 00:57:20,804
I didn't know it'd burst so suddenly like this.

902
00:57:23,274 --> 00:57:24,334
It must hurt a lot.

903
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:27,744
It's bearable.

904
00:57:28,074 --> 00:57:29,814
I don't believe you.

905
00:57:29,914 --> 00:57:33,444
I saw you had blisters all over.

906
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,654
I can't put up with this anymore. I feel so bad for you.

907
00:57:43,654 --> 00:57:46,124
Why don't you come to me now?

908
00:57:49,594 --> 00:57:50,964
You can work at the brewery,

909
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:52,764
but do it when I'm there for you.

910
00:57:53,404 --> 00:57:54,864
Only then will I be at ease.

911
00:58:27,304 --> 00:58:29,534
Does your promise to me not matter to you at all?

912
00:58:30,804 --> 00:58:32,674
No, it's not like that.

913
00:58:33,004 --> 00:58:35,044
CEO Ma Kwang Sook got scalded...

914
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:37,544
while working at the brewery,

915
00:58:37,544 --> 00:58:38,944
so I had to take her to the hospital...

916
00:58:38,944 --> 00:58:41,414
Then you should've called me.

917
00:58:42,084 --> 00:58:43,154
I'm sorry.

918
00:58:43,154 --> 00:58:46,884
I had no time to mind other things, so I forgot to give you a call.

919
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:51,224
So what is it that you want to say to me?

920
00:58:51,954 --> 00:58:53,364
I don't feel like talking now.

921
00:58:54,124 --> 00:58:55,194
Maybe next time.

922
00:59:10,744 --> 00:59:12,214
Welcome.

923
00:59:12,484 --> 00:59:14,944
Hey. It's been a while.

924
00:59:15,684 --> 00:59:16,814
Have you been well?

925
00:59:17,714 --> 00:59:19,024
You must've been busy.

926
00:59:20,184 --> 00:59:22,624
Life has been hectic with so many things going on.

927
00:59:23,194 --> 00:59:24,194
I see.

928
00:59:25,764 --> 00:59:27,424
Anyway, I have good news to share.

929
00:59:28,824 --> 00:59:29,894
My mom...

930
00:59:30,464 --> 00:59:32,934
approved of Professor Oh and me dating.

931
00:59:34,334 --> 00:59:35,334
Really?

932
00:59:37,234 --> 00:59:39,574
My dad's still being stubborn,

933
00:59:39,644 --> 00:59:41,144
but now that my mom has approved,

934
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:42,944
we're halfway there.

935
00:59:44,214 --> 00:59:46,444
He always ends up doing what my mom says.

936
00:59:47,744 --> 00:59:48,744
That's great.

937
00:59:49,954 --> 00:59:53,224
If Beom Soo ever gives you a hard time, come to me.

938
00:59:54,024 --> 00:59:55,384
I'll set him straight.

939
00:59:56,194 --> 00:59:59,024
Nice, that makes me feel reassured.

940
01:00:09,904 --> 01:00:11,074
What's so funny?

941
01:00:12,504 --> 01:00:13,644
It's a secret.

942
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,654
Lieutenant Oh told me to come to him if you ever give me a hard time.

943
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:29,054
He'll straighten you out.

944
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:31,854
Did he actually say that?

945
01:00:32,424 --> 01:00:33,424
Yes.

946
01:00:33,994 --> 01:00:36,094
He seemed to mean it in a protective way.

947
01:00:36,094 --> 01:00:37,794
It felt like having an older brother looking out for me.

948
01:00:56,484 --> 01:00:58,514
Aren't you even going to greet your husband...

949
01:00:58,514 --> 01:01:00,284
who just came home from work?

950
01:01:01,454 --> 01:01:02,894
I hear you're setting up a subsidiary...

951
01:01:02,894 --> 01:01:04,224
to take down Eagle Brewery.

952
01:01:05,694 --> 01:01:08,494
You've been pushing this project despite everyone's objections.

953
01:01:09,194 --> 01:01:10,764
How did you find out about that?

954
01:01:10,994 --> 01:01:12,194
How else?

955
01:01:12,604 --> 01:01:13,934
Rumor has already spread.

956
01:01:14,064 --> 01:01:15,264
Unbelievable.

957
01:01:15,704 --> 01:01:18,534
Which jerk went to you to tattle on me?

958
01:01:21,674 --> 01:01:24,244
I told you not to mess with Eagle Brewery.

959
01:01:25,814 --> 01:01:28,284
Is this your way of paying back the family...

960
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:29,354
who raised your son?

961
01:01:29,514 --> 01:01:32,254
Apart from my ties to Kang Soo, it's only right to leave them be.

962
01:01:32,654 --> 01:01:34,924
The family had every chance to put us behind bars,

963
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:36,154
yet they didn't.

964
01:01:36,524 --> 01:01:37,754
And yet, here you are,

965
01:01:37,924 --> 01:01:40,494
ungratefully crossing the line.

966
01:01:41,724 --> 01:01:43,064
- I'm home. - "Ungrateful..."

967
01:01:43,064 --> 01:01:44,934
isn't the word I should be called.

968
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:46,604
That label should be for you,

969
01:01:46,604 --> 01:01:48,034
since you gave birth to a son 30 years ago...

970
01:01:48,034 --> 01:01:49,634
and lied about it.

971
01:01:52,674 --> 01:01:55,004
I owe Eagle Brewery nothing.

972
01:01:55,274 --> 01:01:56,614
The money I took?

973
01:01:56,614 --> 01:01:58,444
I deserved every penny for the work I put in...

974
01:01:58,444 --> 01:01:59,514
when I was young.

975
01:01:59,544 --> 01:02:01,014
But that's all in the past.

976
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:05,054
Why are you so determined to ruin Eagle Brewery now?

977
01:02:05,954 --> 01:02:07,454
Is it because of my son, Kang Soo?

978
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,494
Or is it to get back at Beom Soo for winning Se Ri's heart?

979
01:02:10,594 --> 01:02:11,694
Both.

980
01:02:12,124 --> 01:02:14,024
I hate everyone in that family.

981
01:02:14,324 --> 01:02:15,624
They get on my nerves.

982
01:02:19,064 --> 01:02:20,364
What did I just hear?

983
01:02:29,004 --> 01:02:30,174
Se Ri...

984
01:02:30,174 --> 01:02:31,744
Who's your son?

985
01:02:33,984 --> 01:02:35,014
Se Ri...

986
01:02:35,744 --> 01:02:37,554
Did I hear that correctly?

987
01:02:38,484 --> 01:02:41,084
You just said Lieutenant Oh was your son.

988
01:02:41,354 --> 01:02:42,354
Didn't you?

989
01:03:38,874 --> 01:03:41,414
(For Eagle Brothers)

990
01:03:41,444 --> 01:03:42,784
How could you?

991
01:03:42,784 --> 01:03:44,854
If my mom had done such a terrible thing,

992
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:46,324
I deserve to know.

993
01:03:46,384 --> 01:03:49,054
Who knew Jin Young's 35th-anniversary show...

994
01:03:49,124 --> 01:03:50,694
would be my retirement soiree?

995
01:03:50,724 --> 01:03:52,124
As I said before,

996
01:03:52,224 --> 01:03:54,894
you'll always be a superstar to me.

997
01:03:55,264 --> 01:03:58,064
Someone dropped this on the couch.

998
01:03:58,064 --> 01:03:59,334
Who was it?

999
01:03:59,334 --> 01:04:01,834
Alzheimer's? You mean, dementia?

1000
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:02,904
I'm well aware.

1001
01:04:02,904 --> 01:04:05,374
My life is slowly being wiped away,

1002
01:04:05,634 --> 01:04:07,444
one particle at a time.

1003
01:04:07,774 --> 01:04:09,914
You feel bad for my mother-in-law?

1004
01:04:10,544 --> 01:04:11,574
Why?
