1
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:07,510
Excuse me.

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,720
Where's Han Dong Seok
who came in after a car accident?

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,180
Don't you see I'm with a patient?

4
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,620
Sorry.

5
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,420
Chairman Han.

6
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,430
What are you doing here, CEO Ma?

7
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,770
Do you have any idea
how alarmed I was?

8
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,580
I felt like...

9
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,350
my heart had shriveled.

10
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,960
I'm all right. I wasn't injured.

11
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,890
(Episode 33)

12
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,360
The hotel employees said...

13
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,260
you'd been in a bad car accident.

14
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,100
I dropped everything
during my delivery run...

15
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,230
and rushed over.

16
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,870
It was just a fender bender.

17
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,170
Nothing serious.

18
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,340
I'll know for sure
once my MRI results are out,

19
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,540
but I'm okay.

20
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,710
And here I thought...

21
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,150
You have no idea how alarmed I was.

22
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,350
I didn't expect you
to be this worried about me.

23
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,120
I'm touched.

24
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:33,660
There's no need to be touched.

25
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:35,660
Of course, there is.

26
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,660
You cried your eyes out
and even hugged me in public.

27
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,370
I did what?

28
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,000
When?

29
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,170
The security cameras
caught everything,

30
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:49,910
so don't play dumb.

31
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,980
I thought you were dying,
but then you showed up unscathed.

32
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,280
I was just relieved.

33
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,650
CEO Ma, you just revealed
your true feelings.

34
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,490
So don't be coy,
and don't play dumb with me.

35
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,590
Me, being coy?
I don't even know how to do that.

36
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,330
Why do you keep saying that...

37
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,600
when you clearly know how it's done?

38
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,400
Again, you're so coy.

39
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,170
Anyway, I'm grateful.

40
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:23,780
I was feeling down
after the accident,

41
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,080
but you really cheered me up.

42
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,520
As you must know,

43
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,090
I lost my husband...

44
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,720
in a car accident.

45
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,990
I have a trauma.

46
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,800
If something that terrible
happens again...

47
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
Don't worry.

48
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,600
I...

49
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,540
won't die.

50
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:56,740
I still...

51
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,080
have a mission left,
and that is to make you happy.

52
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,350
Until I've completed that,
I won't die.

53
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,050
I mean it.

54
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,030
That being said,

55
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,790
this is day one for us as a couple.

56
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,260
Day one?

57
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,770
You pulled me into your arms...

58
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,100
and cried your eyes out in public.

59
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,340
Doesn't that make us a couple?

60
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,010
You can't leave.
Not until you give me an answer.

61
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,150
Fine.

62
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,050
You gave me your answer.

63
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,860
There's no going back on it later.

64
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,060
I was in the middle
of my delivery run,

65
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,600
so I should get going.

66
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,310
What now?

67
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,120
Am I even allowed to do this?

68
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,760
Hey, Chun Soo.

69
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,670
Kwang Sook, did you hear?

70
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,330
Chairman Han was in a car accident.

71
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,640
It wasn't serious, fortunately.

72
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,010
You knew already?

73
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,570
What?

74
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,180
Well, yes.

75
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,080
I'm so glad
it wasn't a bad accident.

76
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,250
I was so startled
when I heard the news...

77
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,950
that I went to the hospital.

78
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,390
The chairman was admitted?

79
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,690
No. He's in the ER right now,

80
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,360
but he'll go home
after seeing the MRI results.

81
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,430
Oh, okay.

82
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,830
You met the chairman already.

83
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,770
What?

84
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,970
Yes.

85
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,640
Good for you.
He's our most important customer.

86
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,740
You should be attentive.

87
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,540
I called to ask...

88
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,340
if I should check on him,
in case you hadn't already.

89
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,310
Okay, then. Drive back safely.

90
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
Bye.

91
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,040
Jang Soo.

92
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,750
You feel the same as me, don't you?

93
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,320
You want her to struggle less,

94
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,490
not grow old and lonely,

95
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,890
and be happy.

96
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,160
That's what you want too.

97
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,860
Right?

98
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,110
(Office)

99
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,750
(Medi-in Hospital)

100
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,450
You're fine too, right?

101
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,880
Yes, I'm fine.

102
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,120
We sent your car to the garage...

103
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,990
and called a hotel car over.

104
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,320
Good.

105
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,290
I'll get the car.

106
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,270
Were you startled by what you saw?

107
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,070
Not a great deal, sir.

108
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,370
I had...

109
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,910
caught on.

110
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,740
Had you?

111
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,340
I've worked for you for years.

112
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,450
Pretend nothing's going on for now.

113
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,150
Of course. Until you decide
to reveal it yourself,

114
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,590
I'll turn a blind eye.

115
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,090
But...

116
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,830
I must say this,
even though it's not my place.

117
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,030
You two look great together.

118
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,340
I hope it works out.

119
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,440
Let's get going.

120
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,610
I felt like...

121
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,280
my heart had shriveled.

122
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,670
Come in.

123
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,180
I'm sorry.

124
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,610
I know you don't want to see me,

125
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,550
but I feel so frustrated and stuck.

126
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:08,720
Take a seat.

127
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,360
Thank you.

128
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,140
Se Ri has been gone for a week.

129
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,810
I can't eat or sleep
because I'm worried...

130
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:30,840
she might do something drastic.

131
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,550
You know
she's not that irresponsible.

132
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,180
Don't worry about that.

133
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,150
Have you...

134
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,090
heard about or from her?

135
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,160
No, I haven't.

136
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,100
It's all on me.

137
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,540
I'm paying for...

138
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,510
what I did all those years ago.

139
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,050
Out of guilt and shame
of what I did to Kang Soo,

140
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,880
I made it my life's purpose...

141
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,690
to raise Se Ri as best I could.

142
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,160
Thankfully, she never once went
against what I said,

143
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,990
and she grew up well.

144
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,700
I was grateful she was my daughter.

145
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,870
How did it all end up like this?

146
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,440
I'm sorry for bothering you.

147
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,140
Now I see...

148
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,750
I won't be able to change her mind.

149
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,150
I must ask for a favor.

150
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,990
I know I don't deserve to ask,

151
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,760
but you're the only one I can trust.

152
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,400
If Se Ri ever calls you,

153
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:38,700
can you talk to her
so she can come home?

154
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,810
I can't go on living...

155
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:44,340
if something were to happen
to Se Ri.

156
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,950
Okay. I'll do that.

157
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,650
I'll call
as soon as I hear from her.

158
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,860
And also...

159
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,530
I heard you're in trouble because...

160
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,360
my husband wrote to the university.

161
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,200
I apologize for that.

162
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,470
Forget about that.

163
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,070
He came to our place again
afterward.

164
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,150
My husband
went to your brewery again?

165
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,350
He never told me that.

166
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,780
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

167
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,290
He said something he shouldn't have.

168
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,290
What did he say?

169
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,120
He told Kang Soo...

170
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,260
it didn't concern him
because he wasn't an Oh.

171
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,430
What?

172
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,470
We were all too flustered
to take anything he said seriously,

173
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,070
but caution him just in case.

174
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,640
I will.

175
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,480
That Kang Soo is your son.

176
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,850
He doesn't know, does he?

177
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:56,980
He doesn't.

178
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,520
My husband only knows
that Kang Soo was a foundling.

179
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,520
Anyway, caution him...

180
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,660
so he doesn't say that again.

181
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,690
I don't want Kang Soo to get hurt.

182
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,460
Okay.

183
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,830
Don't worry.

184
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,710
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

185
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,850
Goodness.

186
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,820
Hello?

187
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,030
It's me, sir.

188
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
Director Seo?

189
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,700
You can't call me like this.

190
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,870
I called
because I was worried about you.

191
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,910
I told you to just relax over there
and not worry,

192
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,180
and that it would die down in time.

193
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,510
It's so hot here,
and I don't like the food.

194
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,850
And I have no friends.

195
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,550
I'm dying of boredom
and frustration.

196
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,220
I know the sacrifice you're making.

197
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,960
Keep quiet
and don't get into trouble.

198
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,160
I'll make it up to you later.

199
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,630
Hang in there, okay?

200
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:17,630
Okay.

201
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:21,100
I trust you'll keep your word
and hang on a bit longer.

202
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,130
Yes, do that.

203
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,000
Let's talk again. Bye.

204
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,110
He's a criminal on the run,

205
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:31,740
and he acts like he's a martyr.

206
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,610
I should've fired him long ago.

207
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,380
You startled me.

208
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,450
What are you doing here?

209
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,490
Did you go to Eagle Brewery
without telling me?

210
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,890
I went over in a fury...

211
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,660
the day Se Ri left home.

212
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,060
Why? Did the Beom Soo fool complain?

213
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,400
Please don't do anything.

214
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,240
Don't cause a fuss
and make things worse.

215
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,510
"Cause a fuss?"

216
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:03,740
You can't say that to your husband.

217
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,710
Se Ri wouldn't have left home...

218
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,380
if you hadn't written
to her university.

219
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,320
He said
he didn't know where she was,

220
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,250
but I'm pretty sure Beom Soo...

221
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,550
hid Se Ri somewhere.

222
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,150
Beom Soo's not like that.

223
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,960
Don't you know he had
high moral standards even as a kid?

224
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,960
What are you on about?

225
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,560
Do you want our daughter to marry...

226
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,800
a single dad?

227
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,000
That's not what I'm saying.

228
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,070
If you keep visiting that family
and irritating them,

229
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,700
it won't do us any good.

230
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,840
I'm the one who was humiliated
by those people.

231
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,110
That punk Ja Dong,
Chun Soo, and Heung Soo.

232
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,840
And what was the name
of the youngest one?

233
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,150
Oh, right. Kang Soo.

234
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:44,480
Those brats picked me up,

235
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,980
dragged me out of their house,

236
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,720
and threw me into the car.

237
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,620
So stop doing things
that will only humiliate you,

238
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,160
and please stay still.

239
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,070
We know nothing about this.

240
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,240
Leave this instant.

241
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,770
Are you the youngest?

242
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,280
You're not an Oh,
so this doesn't concern you.

243
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,280
I'm not an Oh?

244
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,020
- You're here.
- Were you here alone?

245
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,890
The team leader is
at the executive meeting,

246
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,560
and the assistant managers are
at the studio for a catalog shoot.

247
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,900
Did you submit
your graduation project?

248
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,570
Yes. I stayed up all night...

249
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,070
for several days to finish it.

250
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,770
I just submitted it
to the professor.

251
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,410
By the way,
did you hear from Se Ri yet?

252
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,640
No. I texted her several times,

253
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,180
but she didn't check them.

254
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,550
Didn't your brother hear from her?

255
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:52,450
No.

256
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:00,090
Your call may be charged
after the tone.

257
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,330
Your mom just stopped by my office.

258
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,600
Her face looked a lot worse
than it did a few days ago.

259
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,500
You shouldn't be doing this
to your mom.

260
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,400
Call me
as soon as you get this message.

261
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,510
I'll be waiting.

262
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,950
She's out?

263
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:31,120
Where did she go
after closing the shop at this hour?

264
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Yes, Heung Soo.

265
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,100
Hey. Where are you?

266
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,140
I'm on my way to meet Gureum.

267
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,670
Gureum?

268
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,680
I told you before.

269
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,310
An abandoned dog came into my salon
the other day,

270
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,810
so I sent it to a vet.

271
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,950
I see. The stray dog.

272
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,780
It will stay with the vet...

273
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,320
for the time being
until we find its owner.

274
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,860
It won't take long.

275
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,520
I'll just see Gureum briefly
and be right there.

276
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,160
I'm here to see Gureum.

277
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,830
Gureum.

278
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,830
Here.

279
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:21,410
Gureum. Have you been doing well?

280
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,510
Gureum, did you not miss me?

281
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:29,480
I missed you so much.

282
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:34,550
People would think
you were the owner of Gureum.

283
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:40,560
Wasn't there anyone
looking for Gureum?

284
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,530
I wrote about it
on the local community website,

285
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,160
but the owner hasn't shown up yet.

286
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,500
Then what will happen to Gureum?

287
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,670
It would be best to find the owner,

288
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,140
but if not,

289
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,080
we would need to find a good owner.

290
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,750
What if someone strange...

291
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,080
takes Gureum?

292
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,290
Some dog owners
who often come to my clinic...

293
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,320
are interested in Gureum.

294
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:14,290
I'll make sure to find
a good family for Gureum.

295
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,330
Are you sure?

296
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:24,270
I'd really appreciate it
if you could do that.

297
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,940
Please take good care of Gureum.

298
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:33,480
(Bbongjjak)

299
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,150
You said you'd be back soon.
What took you so long?

300
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,490
The freezies are all melty.

301
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,660
Look. They're half melted.

302
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,960
You eat it.

303
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,660
What?

304
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,270
What's wrong with her?

305
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,140
This one is still fine.

306
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,670
Try it. It's cool.

307
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,410
I'm not in the mood for freezies.

308
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,650
Why not? Did something happen?

309
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,050
I might have to send...

310
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,450
Gureum to a stranger.

311
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:17,920
It really breaks my heart.

312
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,830
It's been only a few days.

313
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,260
Why would you care so much
about some dog?

314
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,400
You're overreacting.

315
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,970
I didn't know
you were so coldhearted.

316
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,240
What?

317
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,170
The vet at the clinic says...

318
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,540
he'll make sure
to find a good family...

319
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,210
for Gureum.

320
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,480
But how can you be so cold?

321
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,180
The vet is saying that
because of his job,

322
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,950
- but I...
- Forget it.

323
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,360
You're so selfish and self-centered.

324
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,960
Hey! How could you say such a thing?

325
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,900
Is it okay to be away
from your store for so long?

326
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:04,000
Fine! I'm leaving now.

327
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,600
Eat it.

328
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,010
He's so selfish.

329
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:19,250
I can't help
but compare him to the vet.

330
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,850
(Eagle Brewery)

331
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,970
It's Chairman Han.

332
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,600
Hello, Mr. Han.
I was going to give you a call.

333
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,740
I heard you got into a car accident.

334
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,140
How are you feeling?

335
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,710
It was just a little bump. I'm fine.

336
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,210
What a relief.

337
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,880
By the way, I'd like to meet with
Professor Oh Beom Soo.

338
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,790
Can you give me his phone number?

339
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,220
You want to meet Beom Soo?

340
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:00,560
Yes. I need some advice from him
on something about my hotel.

341
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,390
I see. I'll text you
his number right away.

342
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,100
Okay.

343
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,780
It's me.

344
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,340
Why?

345
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,010
We met a little while ago,

346
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:24,150
and you already want
to hear my voice?

347
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,150
It's not that.

348
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,950
Why did you ask
for Beom Soo's number?

349
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,350
What are you doing?

350
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,520
Were you eavesdropping?

351
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,130
I didn't eavesdrop.

352
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,730
I was with Chun Soo.

353
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,160
What are you up to?

354
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,600
I told you.

355
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:42,530
I said I'd be like a big brother...

356
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,940
to your brothers-in-law.

357
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:49,710
Being a big brother isn't
as easy as it sounds.

358
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,640
If you did anything rash,

359
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,010
- it might backfire...
- Don't you think...

360
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:56,180
you're underestimating me?

361
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,950
I'm not underestimating you.

362
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,080
Don't worry about it...

363
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,490
and put yourself at ease.

364
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,320
I'll take care of it.

365
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,420
I'm busy, so I should get going.

366
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,630
Chairman Han...

367
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,520
An outside director?

368
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,320
But I don't have any experience.

369
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,020
We meet up about once a month...

370
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,190
to talk about
global economic trends...

371
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:42,130
and the domestic economy
over some tea.

372
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,490
As far as I know, you are...

373
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:47,160
a prominent expert in the field.

374
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,730
I'm flattered,

375
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,040
but I've just started my career
as a scholar.

376
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,870
You studied at Stanford, right?

377
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,940
Yes.

378
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,310
I took the MBA course at Duke...

379
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,540
and studied at Cornell.

380
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,410
I see.

381
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,420
I wanted to study more,

382
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,720
but my father suddenly passed away.

383
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,790
So I had to take over the hotel.

384
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,090
That's why I'm still interested
in learning.

385
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,030
Since you're young,

386
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,160
I'm hoping you can teach me...

387
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,860
about the latest trends
and how young people think.

388
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,070
It would be a great help
for me to run the company.

389
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,270
You'll be paid the same
as other outside directors.

390
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,570
I don't have experience,

391
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,540
but I'll do my best
if you give me a chance.

392
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,980
Thank you for accepting my offer.

393
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,310
Since you're
Chun Soo's younger brother,

394
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:38,220
I'll think of you
as a brother as well.

395
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,680
Is that all right?

396
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,890
Call me whatever feels natural,
Chairman Han.

397
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,060
Hey, Chun Soo.

398
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,730
I just finished my meeting
with Chairman Han.

399
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,330
I was wondering
how the meeting went.

400
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,100
What did he want to see you about?

401
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,300
There's an open spot
for an outside director,

402
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,630
and he offered me the position.

403
00:24:58,370 --> 00:24:59,570
An outside director?

404
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:00,870
Yes.

405
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,370
That's great news.

406
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,940
Congratulations.

407
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,310
I owe it all to you and Kwang Sook.

408
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:09,710
If it weren't for the two of you,
he wouldn't have even heard of me.

409
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:12,480
An organization like LX Hotel
is always under public scrutiny,

410
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,550
so they can't appoint
unqualified outside directors.

411
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:17,150
You were offered the position
because you deserve it.

412
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,090
Sure. All right.

413
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,820
We'll talk about the rest at home.

414
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,590
Sure.

415
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,930
Chairman Han offered Beom Soo...

416
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,530
an outside director position
at LX Hotel.

417
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,570
An outside director?

418
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,800
We owe it all to you.

419
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:37,610
Thanks to the good impression
you made on him,

420
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,880
he's been treating
both Beom Soo and me really well.

421
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,960
It's me.

422
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,960
Don't you think
you're calling too often?

423
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,760
You're keeping me from doing my job.

424
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,930
Don't you think
you're making it too obvious?

425
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,730
What do you mean?

426
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,400
Chun Soo...

427
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:09,070
seems to be under the impression
that you and I are close.

428
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,040
Offering Beom Soo
an outside director position...

429
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,110
makes it even more obvious.

430
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,280
Since Chun Soo used to work
in finance,

431
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,750
he wouldn't see it that way.

432
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,220
Outside directors at LX Hotel
face close scrutiny...

433
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,890
from the financial district.

434
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,090
We can't give the position
to just anyone.

435
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,830
I guess, but...

436
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,600
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

437
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,870
I'll make sure there aren't
any mix-ups or misunderstandings.

438
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,170
All you have to do
is watch calmly from afar.

439
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:41,810
I get what you mean,

440
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:46,710
but I'd appreciate it
if you didn't rush things.

441
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,550
(Eagle Brewery)

442
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,420
Look here, Mr. Go.

443
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,020
Yes?

444
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,520
(Eagle Brewery)

445
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,990
What did you decide
about the blind date?

446
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,630
The blind date?

447
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,860
I'm seeing her tomorrow evening.

448
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,230
Even after I told you
that your blind date...

449
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,940
looked like trouble?

450
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,470
You'll still go through with it?

451
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,710
My little sister
won't stop calling me,

452
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,510
pushing me to go on this blind date.

453
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,980
I have no other choice.

454
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,880
Aren't you old enough
to say no to your little sister?

455
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,950
You've met her yourself.

456
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,780
My little sister...

457
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,650
terrifies me.

458
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,690
Goodness.

459
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,570
(3H Acupressure Bed)

460
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,100
- You're here, boss.
- Hey.

461
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,710
I see we have a lot of customers.

462
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,070
Yes, we have quite a few.

463
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,780
But they'll soon be done
with their massages.

464
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,780
I see.

465
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,710
- Enjoy your massage.
- Right.

466
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:58,850
Excuse me.

467
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,050
- Can you help me with this?
- Sure.

468
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,420
You should call it a day.
I'll close up instead.

469
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,520
Right. I'll get going, then.

470
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,560
Bye.

471
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,070
Ma'am, can you help me with mine?

472
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,100
Of course.

473
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,640
How's that? Do you feel it working?

474
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,840
Sure.

475
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,770
Goodness.

476
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,420
How can a guy his age let
his little sister boss him around?

477
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,790
What a waste of muscles.

478
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Unbelievable.

479
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,160
Your husband just got home
from work,

480
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,800
but you didn't even greet him...

481
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,340
or take his clothes.

482
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,240
What am I, a widower?

483
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,470
I don't have the energy.

484
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,080
We'll pretend
that we never had a daughter.

485
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,480
Pretend that we never
had a daughter?

486
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,720
Can you do that?

487
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,290
I'll die without Se Ri.

488
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,620
While I've been working my butt off
at the office,

489
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,260
my wife and daughter
have been living in luxury,

490
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,030
and now they're throwing tantrums.

491
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,160
I'm hungry, so set the table!

492
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,100
Skipping a meal won't kill you.

493
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,730
Once she's hungry and broke,

494
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,240
she'll crawl back home.

495
00:29:28,610 --> 00:29:31,340
She's an innocent flower
who has been sheltered all her life.

496
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,410
Who knows what kind of harm
she might face out there all alone?

497
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,150
I blame Eagle Brewery
for everything.

498
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,450
How is it that family's fault?

499
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,890
This is karma!

500
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,990
Karma, my foot.

501
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,590
I didn't do anything wrong.

502
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:51,530
I worked hard at the brewery
despite being scolded.

503
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:54,400
When I left,
I took what I had contributed.

504
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,630
How is it...

505
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,600
that you always spin the yarn
your way?

506
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,770
If you have the energy to talk back,
you can make me dinner.

507
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,250
All he ever cares about
is his meals and money.

508
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,850
What did I even see in him...

509
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,620
that made me leave Kang Soo...

510
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,030
and run off after stealing
from the brewery?

511
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,670
How crazy was I?

512
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,980
There's something
that's been bothering me.

513
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,750
When Chairman Dokgo Tak was
at our house,

514
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,590
he told me...

515
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,590
this didn't concern anyone
who wasn't an Oh.

516
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:55,790
What did he mean by that?

517
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:01,360
Drink this.

518
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,710
Well...

519
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,740
What do you mean?

520
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,310
Chairman Dokgo said that
to me directly.

521
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,210
I'm not an Oh,
so this doesn't concern me.

522
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,750
Did he say that?

523
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,590
Did he? I didn't catch that either.

524
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:30,360
That jerk was out of his mind
that night...

525
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,730
and probably just talked nonsense.

526
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,900
When he was here
to try and buy our brewery,

527
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,530
he also said things
that didn't make any sense.

528
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,100
That he did.

529
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,970
Someone who isn't an Oh?

530
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,670
Does he think
you're not one of us or something?

531
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,680
Hey. Why are you bothered
by the words of a man...

532
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,980
who was clearly having a meltdown?

533
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,480
Ignore him and eat up.

534
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:53,220
He's right. Ignore him.
Don't even be bothered.

535
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,590
I can't believe that lunatic.

536
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,630
I have to do the dishes. What is it?

537
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:13,370
Is there a secret...

538
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,570
behind the youngest's birth?

539
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,340
My goodness.

540
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,140
Don't even mention that nonsense.

541
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,640
As if you can fool me.

542
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,980
I can read the room
like no one else.

543
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:27,350
If you won't tell me,
I'll ask the brothers.

544
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,050
Mom!

545
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,360
Just tell me the truth.

546
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,590
I'll zip my mouth shut...

547
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,360
with three layers of zippers.

548
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,470
I first heard...

549
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:51,910
about it...

550
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,480
from Jang Soo during our honeymoon.

551
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,050
When Kang Soo was just a baby,

552
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,420
he was left outside the brewery.

553
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,320
By whom?

554
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,760
No one knows.

555
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,060
Goodness me.

556
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,460
I had no idea
Kang Soo had such a story.

557
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,600
Don't act like you know anything.

558
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,900
You have to keep this secret.

559
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:22,040
My gosh, of course.

560
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,250
Goodness, did you bump your head?

561
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,580
It's all right.

562
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,520
There. You're okay.

563
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,720
You're good.

564
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:37,820
Come in.

565
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,960
Hey.

566
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:43,930
Hey, Ha Ni.

567
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,930
What is it?
Do you have something to say?

568
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,140
Has Se Ri reached out to you?

569
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,910
Oh, that.

570
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,510
I left her a voice message,

571
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,740
but she hasn't called back.

572
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:05,850
Why are you so worried about her?

573
00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,350
Because I know her feelings for you
are genuine.

574
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,420
Also,

575
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,490
I feel bad for her mother.

576
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,900
I still hate her for what she did...

577
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,170
to our late father,

578
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,100
but she says she truly regrets it.

579
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,840
And...

580
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,240
I don't know why,
but I keep feeling sorry for her.

581
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,220
Can I come in?

582
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,920
Sure. Come in.

583
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,060
Can't you give Se Ri a call?

584
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,530
She's ignoring everyone's calls,

585
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,800
so why would she answer mine?

586
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,800
I guess.

587
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,470
Where is she, and how is she doing?

588
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:03,540
Has she not even called
Lieutenant Oh's brother?

589
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,580
No, she hasn't.

590
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:11,510
She probably needs some time
to clear her head.

591
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,820
I'm sure she'll be fine.

592
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,190
And Dad?

593
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,390
He's not home yet.

594
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,720
He's been coming home
later than usual lately.

595
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,340
What is it?
Why are you looking around?

596
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,540
I'm worried my family will see us.

597
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,670
Who cares? It's not like
we're doing anything wrong.

598
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,580
If they find out we're dating,

599
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,610
my family will be shocked.

600
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,950
Come on.

601
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:47,450
Don't you think you're overreacting?

602
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,220
Let's talk somewhere else
before anyone sees us.

603
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,390
Hurry.

604
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,820
Come on.

605
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,990
Go on. Get in already.

606
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,510
By the way,

607
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:16,150
what brought you by unannounced?

608
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,550
It occurred to me...

609
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,150
that we didn't do anything...

610
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,490
to celebrate our first day
as a couple.

611
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,450
So I dropped by on my way home.

612
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,060
Here.

613
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,830
Ta-da.

614
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,700
Goodness.

615
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,440
You didn't have to do this.

616
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,410
Tomorrow, I'll get you two roses...

617
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,910
and three the day after.

618
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,850
What? Hold on. Are you saying...

619
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,950
you'll get me roses every day?

620
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,260
Just kidding.

621
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,360
That really isn't necessary.

622
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,300
Celebrating small anniversaries
and throwing events like kids.

623
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,340
You don't have to do any of that.

624
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,710
Don't you know
that age is just a number?

625
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,710
I'm planning to do everything...

626
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,080
young couples do these days.

627
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,780
Please don't.

628
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,310
I'd rather...

629
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,820
keep things relaxed between us.

630
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,090
Anyway, to celebrate our first day
as a couple,

631
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,560
let's decide
how we'll address each other.

632
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,860
- Sorry?
- Instead of Chairman Han,

633
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,830
you can just call me Dong Seok.

634
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,070
But...

635
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,980
I've been calling you Chairman Han
all this time.

636
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,780
How am I supposed
to just switch to your name?

637
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
That'd be awkward.

638
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,850
I don't find it awkward at all,

639
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,350
Kwang Sook.

640
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,390
What?

641
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,630
"Dong Seok."
Go ahead and call me that.

642
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,160
Forget it.

643
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,170
Maybe some other day.
When I'm more mentally prepared,

644
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,300
I'll call you that.

645
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,640
Why do you need
to be mentally prepared...

646
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,000
to call me by my name?

647
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,670
Just go ahead.

648
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,380
Forget it. I can't.

649
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,750
Would you rather
call me "sweetie" instead?

650
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:35,620
What?

651
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:42,560
Then, I'll just call you
by your name.

652
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,010
Dong Seok.

653
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,050
Good job, Kwang Sook.

654
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,530
Well, I'll head home, then.

655
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,900
Let me take you home, Kwang Sook.

656
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,570
Gosh, no. That's fine.

657
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,030
I live right around the corner.

658
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:25,300
Get home safely, then.

659
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,740
But...

660
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:51,130
Tomorrow, to celebrate
our second day as a couple,

661
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,390
we'll have dinner together.

662
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,530
Why do you keep wanting
to celebrate everything?

663
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:56,530
Forget it.

664
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:59,500
How can a woman be so unromantic?

665
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,770
All right, fine. We'll have dinner.

666
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,010
Sleep tight, Kwang Sook.

667
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,390
Dream about Dong Seok tonight!

668
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,090
Please stop it!

669
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,880
That was so corny.

670
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,610
"Dream about Dong Seok tonight?"

671
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,780
So corny.

672
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,330
The rose smells nice.

673
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,910
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

674
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:32,260
(Investigation Report)

675
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,870
"In accordance with regulations,
the university..."

676
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,670
"investigated the allegations stated
in the letter."

677
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,240
Her parents had arranged
for her to marry someone.

678
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,940
When I refused to marry him,

679
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,240
they blamed Professor Oh.

680
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,050
I did not approach her...

681
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,920
with a motive
or sabotage her engagement...

682
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,350
as the letter suggests.

683
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,190
I just feel really sorry
toward Professor Oh.

684
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:01,220
"We once again inform you..."

685
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,390
"that the university..."

686
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:04,730
"will not question
the allegations made."

687
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,460
Darn it.

688
00:42:16,810 --> 00:42:18,170
Oh Beom Soo!

689
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,980
What is this?

690
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,880
Did you think
I'd just take it like last time?

691
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,320
I'm afraid I have no intention
of doing so.

692
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,120
What do you think you're doing?

693
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,720
Let go of me.

694
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,090
I will, if you agree to talk
instead of causing a commotion.

695
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:38,560
All right, fine.
I won't get physical.

696
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,000
Let go of me. Let go.

697
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,630
What do you want this time?

698
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,740
Unbelievable.

699
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,500
Hey.

700
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,870
My daughter
could be anywhere right now,

701
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:54,340
and here you are,
just casually teaching...

702
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:56,080
like some kind of classy professor.

703
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,410
I'm far from at ease
with all of this,

704
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,780
but I'm teaching
because it's my job.

705
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,120
You and your fancy education.

706
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,750
You're always so slick
with your words.

707
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,460
I'd appreciate some respect.

708
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,520
You got lucky.

709
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,030
I don't know how you got your bosses
on your side,

710
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,730
but they refused
to take my letter seriously.

711
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,430
Give it to me straight.

712
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:19,970
I bet you approached Se Ri
knowing she was my daughter.

713
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,440
I still feel nauseated
at the sight of you.

714
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,070
If I had known Se Ri
was your daughter,

715
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,780
would I have really taken her in
as a TA?

716
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,350
Whatever you say,
I blame you for the way...

717
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,350
Se Ri's acting out.

718
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:36,890
It's all your fault.

719
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,190
She left home because of you,

720
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:41,120
so go out there and find her.

721
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:42,860
Or I won't stop with a letter.

722
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,990
I'll see to it that you...

723
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:48,430
and your daughter
have to leave the country.

724
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,540
Don't you dare mention my daughter.

725
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,670
I treasure my daughter...

726
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,180
as much as you treasure yours.

727
00:44:06,050 --> 00:44:08,050
How dare a divorced single dad...

728
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,350
want to date my daughter?

729
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:13,720
Someone like you
shouldn't be teaching anyone.

730
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:15,090
Get out this instant.

731
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,890
Find Se Ri and bring her to me...

732
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:19,460
before the week is out.

733
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,160
I can't say what I'll do
if you don't.

734
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,810
What do you want?

735
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,410
Are you seeing someone?

736
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,810
Get out.

737
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,950
I overheard the last part.

738
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,080
Did you...

739
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,990
date one of your students?

740
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,790
The daughter of the man
who just left?

741
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,590
You said we'd never meet again.

742
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,690
Why are you being clingy?

743
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,360
I'm not being clingy.

744
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:55,860
I bought Ha Ni some clothes...

745
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:57,930
while I was on a trip and came to...

746
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:00,340
I can afford Ha Ni's clothes.

747
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,170
Don't make up reasons to come here.

748
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,610
This is my office,
not our private space.

749
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,050
I won't criticize you
for your choice of girlfriend,

750
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,080
but doesn't this change things?

751
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,050
- What do you mean?
- Ha Ni.

752
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,190
I'll raise her.

753
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,620
You'll do what?

754
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,230
I let you keep Ha Ni...

755
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,890
under the condition
that you focus on her.

756
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,600
I have no reason to let you keep her
now that I know...

757
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,570
you're dating a student.

758
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,830
Shut your mouth.

759
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,400
Get out of my office.

760
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,740
I was too naive.

761
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,610
Why did I never consider the fact...

762
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,180
that you could date someone?

763
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,180
Get out!

764
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:44,050
We're in the same situation now.

765
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:47,920
I don't have to give up Ha Ni.

766
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,590
I'll see you again soon.

767
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,610
Welcome.

768
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,450
- Hi.
- Heung Soo.

769
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,220
Two signature toasts to go, please.

770
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:25,620
- To go?
- Yes.

771
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:29,090
I'm going to eat with the vet.

772
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:32,330
Why would you eat...

773
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,630
with the vet?

774
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,770
He's looking after Gureum.

775
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:40,100
I'm grateful, that's all.

776
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,240
Why are you so grateful...

777
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:47,110
when you're paying for everything
and nothing's for free?

778
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,810
Is that all you can say?

779
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,620
What more should I say?

780
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,850
Forget it, then.

781
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,450
Can you take my order?

782
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:01,160
Two signature toasts to go, please.

783
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:06,460
Thanks.

784
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:10,030
Gosh.

785
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:17,340
What?

786
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,280
- Isn't it good?
- It's really tasty.

787
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,380
I'll get you another one next time.

788
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:26,680
Thank you.

789
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:32,320
Gureum's doing so much better.

790
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,320
Yes. Gureum eats so much now.

791
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,660
What the...

792
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:39,360
What is she smiling so widely about?

793
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,160
She can't smile like that
for other men.

794
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:03,790
She rejected my call?

795
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:05,950
What is she up to?

796
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:10,230
What's with that guy
who looks like some pretty boy?

797
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:12,790
I don't believe this.

798
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:23,270
Hello.

799
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,140
Hey, Mi Sun.

800
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:29,910
Welcome.

801
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:33,420
Am I disturbing you
when you're busy with work?

802
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,220
I'm not busy at all.

803
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,320
Let's sit down.

804
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,830
A friend from Wando Island
sent some abalone.

805
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:47,730
There was too much,
so I brought some for you.

806
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:48,860
My goodness.

807
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,800
Abalone is so expensive.

808
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,340
Thank you.

809
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,170
I'm glad you like it.

810
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:57,340
Some people can't stand seafood.

811
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,340
We always wish
there was more to go around.

812
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:03,280
You can stay for dinner
if you're free.

813
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:04,650
Shall I?

814
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,150
Where is Chun Soo?

815
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,620
He'll be back from the bank soon.

816
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:12,090
I see.

817
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:18,160
Are you making progress with him?

818
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,060
Yes.

819
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,630
We decided to start over together...

820
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:28,740
once the legal issues
are taken care of.

821
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,640
Goodness. That's great to hear.

822
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:37,480
Chun Soo...

823
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:40,280
said something to me a few days ago.

824
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:43,850
When he looked in the mirror before,

825
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,490
his face looked expressionless
and empty.

826
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,090
But now looking in the mirror
makes him feel good.

827
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:53,100
And he's having fun in life.

828
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:57,170
He's happy...

829
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,570
because of you.

830
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,840
Did he really say that?

831
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:04,970
Yes.

832
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:08,980
So don't hesitate
and go full steam ahead...

833
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,750
with your plans.

834
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,080
No turning back. One way.

835
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,650
"No turning back, one way?"

836
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:23,890
The guts will explode...

837
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:26,030
if you poke them in the wrong spot.

838
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:29,600
If you look carefully,
you can find a pointed spot.

839
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,970
You slide the spoon in underneath...

840
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:34,570
and don't harm the guts.

841
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:37,040
- There.
- I see.

842
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:41,380
There's nothing you can't do.

843
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:43,810
You can clean abalone too.

844
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:46,250
Anyone can do this.

845
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,050
(Yeoung Ju's mom)

846
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,190
I'll take this call outside.

847
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:57,490
Okay.

848
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:20,380
What's going on?

849
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,490
I called to ask for a favor.

850
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,020
A favor?

851
00:51:27,290 --> 00:51:29,490
Yes. Do you have...

852
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,830
any money you could lend me?

853
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,760
I'll repay you when I'm there.

854
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:36,400
What are you saying?

855
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:38,670
You took my savings as alimony.

856
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,540
I invested all that,

857
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,140
and my account's empty.

858
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:46,680
Did you lose your mind?

859
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,610
How dare you invest that money?

860
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,580
It's alimony, so it's my money.

861
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,950
Why do you care what I do with it?

862
00:51:55,950 --> 00:51:57,220
How is it your money?

863
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,790
I gave you the money to clothe,
feed, and educate Yeoung Ju.

864
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:07,730
So can you lend me any money or not?

865
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,400
I'm penniless.

866
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:15,070
Why shout at me
when you won't lend me anything?

867
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:18,970
I'm trying to increase that money
to give Yeoung Ju a better life.

868
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:20,340
Don't yell.

869
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:24,880
Hello?

870
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,680
Hello? So Yeon.

871
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:37,690
Darn it.

872
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:47,770
(LX Hotel Chairman Han Dong Seok)

873
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:50,440
You haven't forgotten
today's dinner, have you?

874
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,370
I'll see you later. From Dong Seok.

875
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:30,780
Have a seat.

876
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:41,920
I can pull up the chair and sit.

877
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,530
Go ahead.

878
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,480
I knew I got the right one.

879
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,450
I mean, the dress.

880
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:13,090
I thought it'd look great on you,
Kwang Sook.

881
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,690
Please stop flattering me.

882
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:19,890
It's a bit much for me.

883
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:22,960
And...

884
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,230
can you please call me...

885
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,670
CEO Ma
instead of using my first name?

886
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,010
Why can't I call you by your name
when you have one?

887
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,410
I didn't know that
hearing you say my name...

888
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:40,380
could feel so tender...

889
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,320
and make me feel tingly like this.

890
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,830
Things will get better over time,

891
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,190
Kwang Sook.

892
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,980
When we first met in the elevator,

893
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:18,550
who would've thought
that this moment would come?

894
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:26,960
A bride who was eating gimbap
in her sneakers.

895
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,530
I thought you were eccentric.

896
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:32,500
How could I have ever dreamed...

897
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,540
that she'd become my girlfriend?

898
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,010
I never imagined the grumpy guy...

899
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:42,610
who hated the smell of gimbap
in the elevator...

900
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:46,280
would end up being my boyfriend.

901
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:51,620
Time...

902
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:55,460
really changes a lot of things.

903
00:55:58,930 --> 00:55:59,990
I guess you're right.

904
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,000
So...

905
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:05,130
let's not worry about the future...

906
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,400
and let time take care of it.

907
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:16,010
In the meantime, I became friends
with Vice-CEO Oh Chun Soo...

908
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,780
thanks to the time we served
in the same military unit.

909
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:20,320
And I became acquainted
with Professor Oh Beom Soo...

910
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:23,120
as an outside director at my hotel.

911
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:26,390
Now it's time for me
to get to know the third brother.

912
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:30,490
Heung Soo is like a loose cannon.

913
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,160
He's totally different
from the other two.

914
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,170
He's the one...

915
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:39,570
who cried and said he got dumped...

916
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,300
the other day, right?

917
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,240
Yes.

918
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,980
No matter how much I think about it,

919
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:54,320
the third one and I don't have
anything in common.

920
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,890
It's quite difficult.

921
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,190
I think I need to do some research.

922
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:08,930
Why are you smiling?

923
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,470
I'm grateful that you're trying
to be friends...

924
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,840
with my brothers-in-law,

925
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,510
and I feel bad at the same time.

926
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:23,850
On the other hand,

927
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:28,250
I wonder if I'm worth all of this.

928
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,990
This is the least I can do...

929
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:32,690
to have you.

930
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:34,020
You're worth it.

931
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:41,730
(Eagle Brewery)

932
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,470
I had a lot of fun today.

933
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:54,340
You must be tired.
Go in and get a good sleep,

934
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,680
Kwang Sook.

935
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:02,020
Okay. Drive home safely.

936
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:09,920
Dong Seok.

937
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,160
If you keep calling my name,

938
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,060
you'll get used to it.

939
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,130
Okay.

940
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:21,840
See you.

941
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:29,810
It's Heung Soo.

942
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:36,250
We have to hide.

943
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,490
What?

944
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:38,550
Hurry.

945
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,060
Well...

946
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:53,530
Is someone here?

947
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,140
My goodness.

948
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,410
I've been working all day,

949
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,240
and now I have dark circles
under my eyes.

950
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:41,320
I should use a face mask before bed.

951
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,540
Gosh, I was scared to death.

952
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
My goodness.

953
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:04,410
I told you.

954
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:07,280
We should be careful
in front of my house.

955
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:20,090
Bye.

956
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:22,460
Drive home safely.

957
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:24,190
Good night.

958
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,590
And...

959
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:27,360
dream about Dong Seok...

960
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,260
Stop it. Okay.

961
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,870
I'll have a dream about you. Bye.

962
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:25,050
Kwang Sook.

963
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:28,490
Beom Soo.

964
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,990
You're still up.

965
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:35,330
Well... I have
some materials to go over.

966
01:01:35,530 --> 01:01:36,530
I see.

967
01:01:37,370 --> 01:01:38,800
Oh, right.

968
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:42,000
Have you not heard from Se Ri yet?

969
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:44,970
Not yet.

970
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,310
I'm worried.

971
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,650
I wonder where she is
and what she's doing.

972
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:48,130
(For Eagle Brothers)

973
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,570
I must say, our paths crossed
in the most mysterious way.

974
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,170
Now that I think about it,

975
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:54,570
our fates...

976
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:57,870
must've been connected
from the beginning.

977
01:03:58,170 --> 01:03:59,410
- Her first birthday party?
- Her first birthday party?

978
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:01,510
Her whole family is here for her,

979
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:03,980
so it makes no sense
that she can't even have...

980
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:05,150
her first birthday party.

981
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:08,250
I realized I wasn't living my life
for myself.

982
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:11,350
I had been living it for my mom.

983
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,290
What I really want in life...

984
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:16,620
and who I really love.

985
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:19,530
I desperately needed
to figure that out.
