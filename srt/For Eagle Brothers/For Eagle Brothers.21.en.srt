00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,070
(Episode 21)

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,850
I came from my delivery run...

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:13,450
only because
you had something urgent to say,

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,120
so cut to the chase.

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,160
I brought myself
to the police station.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,000
But I suppressed my anger
and called you instead.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,970
Why were you at the police station?

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:28,770
Why else? I...

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,970
I couldn't let it slide
how you and Chairman Han...

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,640
humiliated me...

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,440
and seriously considered
pressing charges.

12
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,980
Go ahead if that's what you want.

13
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:43,450
You were the first
to address the chairman...

14
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,720
with violence and crude words,

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,990
and I'm a witness to that.

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,390
What are you to each other?

17
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,260
What do you mean?

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,230
You and Chairman Han.
You're dating, aren't you?

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What?

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,970
Only that explains...

21
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,030
how the arrogant
and haughty Chairman Han...

22
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:06,070
drove to Sokcho
just to come to your aid.

23
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,710
- Have you lost it?
- What?

24
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,880
One would have to be insane
to say something that preposterous!

25
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:15,950
Even if it's by chance,

26
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,620
I truly hope
we never cross paths again.

27
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,190
The chairman and I are dating?
What nonsense is that?

28
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,230
He's lost it for sure.

29
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,730
That nutjob.

30
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,670
Unbelievable.

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,780
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

32
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,830
I starved myself
all day yesterday...

33
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,300
worrying the dress wouldn't fit,

34
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,730
and now I'm seeing stars
because of it.

35
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:09,200
I couldn't miss
my walk down the aisle,

36
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,470
so I'm replenishing my energy now.

37
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,910
What...

38
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,450
Are you all right?

39
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:23,210
As if that'd be enough
to get me drunk.

40
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,680
Do you know what kind
of horrible nightmare I had?

41
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:29,120
In this nightmare,

42
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,990
you died in a car accident.

43
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,060
Hey, look here.

44
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,960
You have the wrong person.

45
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,100
Do you have any idea how sad I was?

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,670
It was as if my heart
was melting away.

47
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,850
I'm certain...

48
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,710
that what I'm feeling is abnormal.

49
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,020
I...

50
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,290
But I would never.

51
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,320
There has to be an error.

52
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,400
I must find a solution
to this problem.

53
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,410
Hey!

54
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,140
Kwang Sook.

55
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,040
What is this I'm hearing?

56
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,010
About what?

57
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,010
Are you...

58
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,910
dating Chairman Han?

59
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,650
Someone might hear you.

60
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,290
Is it true?

61
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,460
Would it be?

62
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,590
It's not?

63
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,030
If you were him,

64
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,630
a chairman who had everything
he could want in life,

65
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,200
would you fall for me...

66
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,570
instead of all those
other women out there...

67
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:50,230
who are young, pretty,
smart, competent,

68
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,200
and wealthy?

69
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,740
Well, that's...

70
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,540
Even you couldn't argue with that.

71
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,510
Why did Park Sang Nam
tell me otherwise, then?

72
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,980
Don't mind the words of that nutjob.

73
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,980
He called a second ago...

74
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,050
and poured his frustration out
on me.

75
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:09,720
Don't take his calls ever again.

76
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,090
He's a total nutjob.

77
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,230
A total nutjob?

78
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,730
(Eagle Brewery)

79
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,930
Of course.

80
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,330
That can't be true.

81
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,270
She may be my daughter,
but she and a hotel chairman?

82
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,800
Come on.

83
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,740
That's ridiculous.

84
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,180
Absolutely ridiculous.

85
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,450
I'll be meeting with the team
from Feel So Good,

86
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,880
and I'm considering
negotiating a deal...

87
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,350
using that as the quantity
we can provide.

88
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,120
Sure.

89
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,460
A low-price, high-volume strategy
isn't our objective anyway.

90
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:49,190
I don't see the need to supply
too much of our product all at once.

91
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,730
Also, to be fair
to our other partners,

92
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,630
we can't set the price
below our usual wholesale rate.

93
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
What do you say?

94
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,900
I agree.

95
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,340
Sure.

96
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,610
We should take Mi Sun out
if we manage to secure this deal.

97
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:08,610
Mi Sun?

98
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,420
If it hadn't been for her,

99
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,780
we wouldn't have even dreamed
of supplying to convenience stores.

100
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,490
It seems as though
she's looking out for you.

101
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,730
We've been close friends
since childhood.

102
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,490
There's more to it than that.

103
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,560
What do you mean?

104
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,730
By the looks of it,

105
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,270
she seems to like you a great deal.

106
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,880
Gosh, no.

107
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,610
Mr. Go said Mi Sun was single too.

108
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,350
Why don't you consider
getting together?

109
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,020
Don't be silly.

110
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,190
Why would you say that
when I just got divorced?

111
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,690
You only just got divorced,

112
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,130
but you've been on your own
for over ten years.

113
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:03,800
I finished the brief,
so I'll head to the office, CEO Ma.

114
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,340
Think about it seriously,
Vice-CEO Oh.

115
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,370
What are you doing here,
skipping class?

116
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,470
I may be a fool,

117
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,240
but I'm not in the mood for Zumba.

118
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,080
Work and life should be separate.

119
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,350
You can't skip a class
just because Ms. Kim moved away.

120
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,410
Don't you know better?

121
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,390
You're the one who should keep
work and life separate.

122
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,020
Why are you getting involved
in my life?

123
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,390
How did you find out where I lived?

124
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,630
I asked the center office.

125
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,540
Be honest.

126
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,210
About what?

127
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,640
Did Seon Ah really not
tell you anything?

128
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,710
She disappeared during the night.

129
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,510
She must've had a good reason.

130
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,280
She didn't even tell you,

131
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,490
so there's no way
she would've told me.

132
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,820
Does she...

133
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,790
Does she what?

134
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,560
Does she have a terminal illness?

135
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,430
Is that why she didn't tell me?

136
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,170
Do you think you're in a movie?

137
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:46,670
Stop talking nonsense...

138
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,440
and reel in your emotions.

139
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,080
Why did she disappear, then?

140
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,650
Are you crying?

141
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,490
It's not fair or right,

142
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,690
and I'm hurt.

143
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:12,100
If she dumped me, then fine.
But at least tell me the reason.

144
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,730
Getting dumped
without notice like this...

145
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,000
It's infuriating and saddening.

146
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,370
How am I to live?

147
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,960
Are you crying?

148
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,230
I didn't say much.

149
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,330
I wasn't blaming you.

150
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,480
Seeing how hurt you are...

151
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:03,380
makes me so sad.

152
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,790
Even so,
why would you cry about that?

153
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,920
Calm down.

154
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,970
I didn't think
you'd suffer this much.

155
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,900
I really didn't know.

156
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,640
Seeing how much it hurts you...

157
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,780
makes my heart sink.

158
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,450
Oh, come on.

159
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,990
Stop crying.

160
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:46,990
That's it. Stop.

161
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:50,960
Stop crying.

162
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,170
Enjoy your meal.

163
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,370
All that crying...

164
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,610
made me so hungry.

165
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:17,990
It's so warm and tasty.

166
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,440
Hello?

167
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:37,580
Hi. It's me.

168
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,810
Ok Bun.

169
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,180
I was about to call you to ask.

170
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,720
How are things going?

171
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,550
Ms. Kim...

172
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:51,720
packed up and left last night
to move to the countryside.

173
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,290
- Did she really?
- Yes.

174
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,660
Mr. Oh doesn't know the details,

175
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,000
and he's crying his heart out.

176
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,200
He didn't come to class today.

177
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,200
I feel sorry for the poor guy.

178
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,080
Wouldn't it be better
to just tell him...

179
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,880
what Ms. Kim's really like?

180
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,710
You can't do that.

181
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,720
The shock might actually kill him.

182
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:20,950
You can't ever do that.

183
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,540
Hi, Gyeol.

184
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,010
Where are you?

185
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,840
I'm on campus.

186
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,480
Come outside.

187
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,450
What? You're here?

188
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,480
Gyeol.

189
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,120
Victory.

190
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,020
Captain Han Gyeol hereby reports...

191
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,630
he was permitted to be discharged.

192
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,800
Victory.

193
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,900
Congratulations.

194
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,810
You're the first person
I came to see.

195
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,410
Thank you for waiting for me.

196
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,600
Professor.

197
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,680
Is he your professor?

198
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,410
What? Yes.

199
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,920
Hello. I'm Han Gyeol.

200
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,150
I'm Se Ri's professor Oh Beom Soo.

201
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,690
Please take good care of her for me.

202
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,720
She helps me a great deal.

203
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,660
You have a great girlfriend.

204
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,300
Thank you.

205
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,530
Take all the time you need.

206
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,070
Bye.

207
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,770
Do you have a lecture?

208
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,480
If not, can we go somewhere
for some tea?

209
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,710
I'm sorry, Gyeol.
I have a lecture soon.

210
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,620
You do?

211
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,050
Okay.

212
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,020
You should go, then.

213
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,390
I'll see if I can find Bom.

214
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,630
I'm sorry.

215
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,800
Don't apologize.
I'll see you at home in the evening.

216
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,130
See you then.

217
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,050
You're back already?

218
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,790
Yes.

219
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,990
I had some paperwork to finish.

220
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,460
You can do that later.
Spend some time with your boyfriend.

221
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,640
He finished his service today,
so it's an important milestone.

222
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,070
I could get chewed out
for making you work.

223
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,040
It's fine. You can go.

224
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,510
Se Ri.

225
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,020
He's not my boyfriend.

226
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,890
He's not my boyfriend.

227
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,300
I'm sorry. I assumed he was.

228
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,700
He's not.
He's my friend's older brother.

229
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,100
I see.

230
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:04,510
I need to freshen up.

231
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,170
Well done, Gyeol.

232
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:37,070
Congratulations
on serving well and safely.

233
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:40,080
How is your back?

234
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,180
I went to the doctor this morning,
so I'm feeling a lot better now.

235
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:46,320
I think you should be admitted
and get a full examination.

236
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,390
And you can get some tests done.

237
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,220
I don't need to be admitted.

238
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,390
I'll get better after some rest.

239
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,290
You need to identify the problem
and take care of it...

240
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:55,730
so you won't suffer later.

241
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:59,060
I asked the doctor to come up
with an exercise therapy program,

242
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,430
so you should be admitted
to the hospital and rest.

243
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,700
I'm too busy to do that.

244
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,300
Dad, I'm a doctor.

245
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,310
Please do as I say this once.

246
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,410
My gosh.

247
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,440
All right. Fine.

248
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,350
LX Fashion?

249
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,090
Yes.

250
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,560
They are reorganizing
their premium golf clothing line,

251
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,720
and I'm in charge of the project.

252
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:31,460
I was wondering if you were
interested in working with me.

253
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,470
I don't know. This is so sudden.

254
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,800
Actually, it was my dad's offer.

255
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,470
I guess he had a good impression...

256
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:44,110
when he met you the other day.

257
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:51,010
You will start as an intern
and experience things one by one.

258
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,450
There's no pressure.

259
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,690
Actually, this is my first time too,

260
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,890
so I want to have someone...

261
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:01,360
like you who I can rely on.

262
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,800
What do you say?

263
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,770
I appreciate the offer,

264
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,380
but I want to do things on my own...

265
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,180
and see what I can do.

266
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,220
For now, I'd like to finish
the scheduled interviews.

267
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:35,690
Well... I'm not refusing the offer
from you and the chairman.

268
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,860
I'm honored.

269
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,430
But I'm new in this field,

270
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,770
so I'm afraid I might not be able
to do my job properly.

271
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,400
Then I'll feel bad for the chairman
and you who trusted me.

272
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,970
And it will eventually cause trouble
to Kwang Sook.

273
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,520
(Eagle Brewery)

274
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,500
Gosh, I'm tired.

275
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,300
I'm exhausted.

276
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,140
This is killing me.

277
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,780
You look like a little kid.
What are you doing?

278
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,400
No way!

279
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,730
You're awesome, sir!

280
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,470
I guess Chairman Han...

281
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,270
is cute in a way.

282
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,780
You want the purse back?

283
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,480
What do you mean?

284
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,750
Did you not hear anything
from Kwang Sook?

285
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,750
Our relationship ended
as of yesterday.

286
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,690
I heard.

287
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,230
But didn't you say
it had nothing to do with her?

288
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,530
It's just a figure of speech.

289
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,200
I mean, it cost a lot of money.

290
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,930
Now that I'm no longer
seeing Kwang Sook,

291
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,430
it's just not right for you...

292
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,870
to have that purse.

293
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,170
I'm coming to get it
tomorrow afternoon.

294
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,870
Hello?

295
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,420
I shouldn't have sold it.

296
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,550
What do I do?

297
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,390
What now?

298
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,090
Kwang Sook.

299
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,530
- Mom. What is it?
- Hey.

300
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:55,670
What?

301
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,600
Is something wrong?

302
00:19:57,870 --> 00:19:59,740
Well... It's no big deal.

303
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,810
Do you have some money?

304
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,440
Money? How much?

305
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,480
Fifty dollars?

306
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,580
No.

307
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,680
Five hundred dollars?

308
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,850
No.

309
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,090
You mean 5,000 dollars?

310
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,690
Yes.

311
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,020
Why do you need that much money?

312
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,260
Well... The thing is...

313
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,300
One of my friends
urgently needs some money.

314
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,430
After paying
the employees' salaries,

315
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
taxes, and insurance premiums,

316
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,370
I have no money left.

317
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,600
Really?

318
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,470
All right, then.

319
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,350
What's the matter?

320
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,450
(Eagle Brewery)

321
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,550
Mi Sun.

322
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,720
Hey, Chun Soo.

323
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,590
Where are you going?

324
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,860
The sink faucet is leaking,

325
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,060
I went to the convenience store
to get the toolbox.

326
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,270
Are you going to fix it yourself?

327
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,270
Yes.

328
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,070
I thought
I should just tighten things.

329
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,420
It's done.

330
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,990
Good.

331
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:25,660
Great. The water is coming out well
without leaking.

332
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,430
The rubber gasket here
was worn out, so it was leaking.

333
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,860
Look at you.
You're a jack-of-all-trades.

334
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,400
Come on.
This is what all men can do.

335
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,540
Thank you.
Do you want to have dinner?

336
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,070
No, it's okay.

337
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,670
Why? Are you busy?

338
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,210
I don't want to bother you.

339
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,080
I just don't want to eat alone.

340
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,350
Let's eat together. Okay?

341
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,550
My gosh.

342
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,290
Awesome.

343
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,220
It smells great.

344
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,260
I don't know
if it'll suit your taste.

345
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,560
- There you are.
- Okay.

346
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,630
- Try some.
- Okay.

347
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,480
My goodness.

348
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,280
It's amazing.

349
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:24,310
You're a good cook, Mi Sun.

350
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:26,920
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

351
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,590
This is the best doenjang jjigae
I've ever had.

352
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:32,620
- I'm glad to hear that.
- I mean it.

353
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,930
I have a lot of rice in the cooker,
so you can have some more.

354
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,460
Okay. Thanks.

355
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,660
I should have two bowls.

356
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,310
Why are you staring at me?

357
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,380
It's been a long time
since someone has enjoyed...

358
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,820
the food I made like this.

359
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,590
And it's been a long time
since I've eaten food...

360
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,230
that someone made for me.

361
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,060
These things may be common
for others,

362
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,430
but why were they so difficult
for us?

363
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,240
I know.

364
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,100
I guess you're right.

365
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,180
You can come anytime
if you want to eat doenjang jjigae.

366
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,710
I'll make it delicious for you.

367
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,910
Okay. Thank you.

368
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,680
It doesn't taste as good
when it's cold.

369
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,720
- Go ahead and eat.
- Okay.

370
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,290
Try the meat too.

371
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,490
Okay.

372
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,660
It's really good.

373
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,770
What's your problem?

374
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,240
Why are you being so sulky?

375
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,440
I think everyone
is getting too carried away.

376
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,340
What?

377
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,510
I mean, how Gyeol showed up
at school out of the blue today...

378
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:09,050
and how you and Dad are trying
to impress Gyeol.

379
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,490
I don't like it at all.

380
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,600
Stop being ridiculous
and come on out.

381
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,430
Now.

382
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:25,600
Welcome.

383
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,540
Congratulations on your discharge.

384
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:30,370
Thank you. Have you been doing well?

385
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,240
Hi, Bom.

386
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,440
Hello.

387
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,610
I wouldn't recognize you
if I saw you on the street.

388
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:39,150
Look at the lady you've become.

389
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,120
Thank you.

390
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,150
- Let us sit.
- Sure.

391
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,150
Go ahead.

392
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,530
Don't just stand here.

393
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,890
There's no one sitting
next to Gyeol.

394
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:50,960
Take your seat.

395
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,760
Take your seat already.

396
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,100
Go.

397
00:24:56,770 --> 00:25:00,140
So, how does it feel
to be a civilian again?

398
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,210
The air is fresher, sir.

399
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,380
Good.

400
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,150
Can I help you with anything?

401
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,590
Goodness. Aren't you a sweetheart?

402
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:18,820
It's fine.
I only have to reheat the soup.

403
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,490
How is Lieutenant Oh doing?

404
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,900
I actually met him
before coming here.

405
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:33,140
Have you two
finally made it official?

406
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,540
It's not like that.

407
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,980
Dad must've gotten
a good impression of him...

408
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,940
as he offered Lieutenant Oh a job
at LX Fashion.

409
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,250
Really?

410
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,480
I asked if he'd like to work
with me,

411
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,720
but he turned me down.

412
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,390
Why did he turn down
an opportunity that good?

413
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,560
He doesn't know the field well,

414
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,560
and he's worried
he might end up being a burden.

415
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,260
I see.

416
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,370
Of course,
he grew up to be a fine young man.

417
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,240
Sorry?

418
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,700
What?

419
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,710
Aren't I right?

420
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,810
Jobs aren't easy
to come by these days,

421
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,450
and anyone would jump
at the chance...

422
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,850
to accept an offer like that.

423
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,050
It tells me he's an upstanding
and thoughtful young man.

424
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,320
You can tell a lot about someone
from just one aspect of them,

425
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:28,020
and those destined for success
show promise from an early age.

426
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,330
Most men out there...

427
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,730
would want to be with you
considering your background,

428
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,630
but he's not like them at all.

429
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,030
I guess.

430
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,810
Men like him are hard to come by.

431
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,310
Will you be working
at the university hospital again?

432
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,880
The bureaucratic nature of it...

433
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,620
doesn't sit right with me,

434
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,120
so I'm going to gain more experience
at a friend's clinic.

435
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,060
Sure. Good thinking.

436
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:04,130
You missed out a lot with Se Ri
being miles apart,

437
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,130
so enjoy your time together.

438
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,900
It'd be nice to relax
and enjoy your days...

439
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,270
as newlyweds.

440
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,840
What do you mean as newlyweds?

441
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,440
That's ridiculous.

442
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,610
There's no need to be shy.

443
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,380
I'll meet with Chairman Han
and settle on a plan,

444
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,280
so don't worry about anything...

445
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,050
and follow your parents' lead.
Got it?

446
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,490
Yes, sir.

447
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,930
Be at Han River tomorrow afternoon
if you're free.

448
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:42,870
I'll be there with Ha Ni.

449
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,370
Thank you, Beom Soo.

450
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,810
People could see us,
so an open space would be better.

451
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,210
When are you free?

452
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,010
Sure. I'll see you tomorrow.

453
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,190
Hey, Ha Ni.

454
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,530
It's all right.

455
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,560
Everything's fine.

456
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,770
Your mom misses you a lot.

457
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,940
That's why you'll see her
for the last time tomorrow.

458
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,280
But is this the right choice?

459
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,580
I'm still not sure.

460
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,680
It's all right.

461
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,620
There.

462
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,790
Aren't you too busy
to make visits like this?

463
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,720
I was in the neighborhood
and thought I'd stop by.

464
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,760
I was hoping to grab a drink
if you're free.

465
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,460
I'm afraid
you caught me on a bad day.

466
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,000
I'm being admitted
to the hospital tomorrow.

467
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,100
What for? Are you ill?

468
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,770
A few days in pain
from a sore back...

469
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,910
had my son worried
like a mother hen.

470
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:59,080
He booked an appointment
and kept pushing it,

471
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,440
so I gave in.

472
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,680
Goodness.
We have to be careful at our age.

473
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,420
It's crucial to stay on top
of our health...

474
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,920
by working out whenever we can.

475
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,690
I can manage a tweaked back...

476
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,360
with the necessary treatments,

477
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,130
but...

478
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,530
I've been feeling odd lately.

479
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,840
I've been flooded with emotions...

480
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,640
that I don't recognize.

481
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,880
All right.
Tell me about these emotions.

482
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,350
She's clearly not my type,

483
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,950
but I can't seem
to stop thinking about her.

484
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,190
Hold on.

485
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,790
Are you talking about a woman?

486
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,730
My gosh.

487
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,200
This is huge.

488
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,430
Don't tease me.

489
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,430
After your wife passed away,

490
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,600
you locked your heart away...

491
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,810
and showed no interest
even in the finest women.

492
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,040
But now you're telling me
someone has piqued your interest.

493
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,980
How is that not huge?

494
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,680
Is it old age?

495
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,550
Am I going soft?

496
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,420
Age has nothing to do with it.

497
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:20,360
There's a strong energy
at play here.

498
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:24,890
Someone as sharp
and cynical as you...

499
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,860
is feeling
a whole range of emotions.

500
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,700
That's fate working its magic.

501
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,270
Fate working its magic?

502
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,010
(Hankuk University Hospital)

503
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,520
(B Wing)

504
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,920
Unbelievable.
Wearing a patient's gown...

505
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,450
when I'm not even sick...

506
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,060
makes me feel like I should be.

507
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,090
The hospital
isn't only for sick people.

508
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,390
Think of this...

509
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,590
as a precautionary checkup.

510
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,460
When do you start work?

511
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,860
Next Monday.

512
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,500
Don't you think
you're rushing back in?

513
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:06,140
It's my friend's clinic,
so there isn't much to do.

514
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,810
I'll be working there
as a means to adjust.

515
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,340
Sure.

516
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,710
Bom, are you ready
to start working at the office?

517
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,810
Yes.

518
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,510
Did you talk to Lieutenant Oh
about the job?

519
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,480
Lieutenant Oh?

520
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:22,820
Yes, I'm putting together
a group of people to work with,

521
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,690
and Dad recommended...

522
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,920
Lieutenant Oh as an intern.

523
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,530
I see. What did he say?

524
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,830
He turned the offer down.

525
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,960
He's new to the field,

526
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,130
and didn't want to be a burden...

527
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,840
by accepting the job rashly.

528
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,340
There's nothing we can do
if he doesn't want the job,

529
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,610
but his answer alone tells me
he's a fine young man.

530
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,550
Everyone wants a head start in life
to get ahead.

531
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,780
I say this from having known him
for a long time.

532
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,950
He's a thoughtful young man
with integrity.

533
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,320
Sure.

534
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,660
It's time for some IV fluids.

535
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:07,960
Is this really necessary?

536
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:09,230
Of course.

537
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,330
Goodness.

538
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:19,640
Please be gentle so it doesn't hurt.

00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,460

Five boxes of Jang-Kwang Makgeolli?

542
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:41,030
Of course, I can.

543
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,730
Sure. I'll be right there.

544
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:51,610
Are you all right?

545
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,180
Goodness. It's CEO Ma.

546
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,410
Ms. Ma, please wake up.

547
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,450
- I'll call an ambulance.
- Sure.

548
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:03,390
I'm good.

549
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,420
Don't bother...

550
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:08,620
calling an ambulance.

551
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,490
Are you okay?

552
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
Yes.

553
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,700
I'm so sorry.

554
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,830
I didn't see you back there.

555
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:20,000
I was on the phone...

556
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,070
and didn't see you backing up.

557
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,710
I'm all right.

558
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:27,040
- My gosh.
- Let us take you to the ER.

559
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:28,880
No.

560
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,780
I just felt a bit dizzy.

561
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,850
Excuse me. Make way.

562
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,320
Ms. Ma, are you all right?

563
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,360
Yes, I think I'll be fine.

564
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,500
You should get checked out
by a doctor.

565
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:48,100
What? How?

566
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,230
How bad is it?

567
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,270
Take her
to the hospital immediately.

568
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,810
It's impossible for me...

569
00:33:58,410 --> 00:33:59,610
to be out of the office.

570
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,940
Darn.

571
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,110
My gosh.

572
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,760
Are you feeling
any kind of discomfort?

573
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,060
I was a bit dizzy a while back,

574
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,160
but now I'm fine.

575
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,730
We'll have you admitted,

576
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,530
and a thorough checkup
will be conducted...

577
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:23,830
including scans
of your spine and brain.

578
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:26,440
You'll be staying here
for about two days.

579
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,670
Two days?

580
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:31,940
No way. I have so much work to do
including my delivery runs.

581
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,710
Please do as the doctor suggests.

582
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,180
We'll compensate you...

583
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,950
for the work you'll be missing
due to your hospital stay,

584
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,320
so please don't worry.

585
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:42,990
First, let's get you
in a room upstairs.

586
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:52,660
My gosh.

587
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,900
Is this a hotel room
or a hospital room?

588
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:58,940
You were hurt...

589
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,340
while conducting business
on hotel grounds.

590
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,040
The chairman insisted...

591
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,340
that we arrange for you
to stay in the VIP room...

592
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,610
so you can rest.

593
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,110
But that isn't necessary.

594
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,450
Can you just move me
to a four-bed room?

595
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:13,050
Please accept the chairman's offer.

596
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,020
But it's too much.

597
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,720
My gosh.

598
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,160
Yes?

599
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,100
Hey.

600
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,200
How did it go?

601
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,940
She insisted on
moving to a shared room,

602
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,840
but I managed to convince her
to stay in the VIP room.

603
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,980
Good work.
Have they begun the tests?

604
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,140
They'll start the tests...

605
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,010
once she's had IV fluids
and some time to rest.

606
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,650
If that's all you need,
I'll head back to the hotel.

607
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,250
Good work today.

608
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:51,990
Please get some rest, sir.

609
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,190
Mr. Park.

610
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,760
Yes, sir?

611
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,960
Which room is CEO Ma in?

612
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,170
In the room next to yours, sir.

613
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:04,830
All right.

614
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,970
Hold on.

615
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,840
On the left?

616
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,440
Yes.

617
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:12,980
I see.

618
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,860
There's no need to be alarmed.

619
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,700
It was only a slight bump
into the bus,

620
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,870
but they wanted
to keep me here for observation.

621
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,300
That's why I was admitted.

622
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,570
Which hospital is it, Kwang Sook?

623
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,010
I'll be right there.

624
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,110
What?

625
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,310
What about Kwang Sook?

626
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,050
- I'm home.
- I'm glad I ran into you.

627
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,720
Come with me to the hospital.

628
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,220
Why?

629
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,550
Kwang Sook was admitted
after being bumped into by a bus.

630
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,060
What?

631
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,960
She says it's nothing serious,

632
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,960
but I won't feel at ease
unless I see her myself.

633
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,260
What on earth?

634
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,030
Bok Hee, is that you?

635
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,270
It's Ju Sil.

636
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,870
Could you perhaps
lend me 5,000 dollars?

637
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,840
You don't even have a single penny?

638
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,010
Your bank account...

639
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,880
is totally empty?

640
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,520
What on earth?

641
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,560
(Daughter)

642
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,930
Hey, Kwang Sook. Is that you?

643
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:44,030
Who were you on the phone with?

644
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,840
I've been trying to reach you.

645
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,870
I've been calling my friends
from high school.

646
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,170
Why? Is something up?

647
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:53,780
I'm at the hospital.

648
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,310
What for?

649
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,780
Were you able to reach Beom Soo?

650
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,090
No. He must be teaching a class.

651
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:04,450
But I sent him a text.

652
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,590
Good.

653
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,490
What's all this?

654
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,960
Underwear, towels, books,

655
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,660
and everything else
she said she needed.

656
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,930
Talk about the unexpected.
Can you believe it?

657
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,510
What?

658
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,540
Hold on.

659
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,450
What are you doing here?

660
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:36,250
Do people come to hospitals for fun?
I'm in pain, that's why.

661
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,390
Where are you hurting?

662
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,830
My back's hurting
among other things.

663
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:44,860
Oh, no.

664
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,530
I think your back injury
became chronic because of me.

665
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,300
I'm glad you finally realize that.

666
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,300
I'm sorry about everything.

667
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,940
Also, thank you.

668
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:00,240
The hospital room
is remarkably nice.

669
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,550
It's company policy,
so there's no need to thank me.

670
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,420
Goodness.

671
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,120
Are you staying in that room?

672
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,460
We're neighbors.

673
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:18,890
I'm off to get my CT scan.

674
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,700
We should gather once I'm done.

675
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,310
A get-together, my foot.

676
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,420
Gosh, what a mess.

677
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,290
Oh, gosh. This is gross.
There are moths too.

678
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:52,700
My goodness.

679
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,600
They can't make makgeolli
with rice that should be thrown out.

680
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,300
Don't they fear retribution?
Oh, dear.

681
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,000
Come in.

682
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:06,840
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

683
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,140
Did you meet with her?

684
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,150
Yes, sir.

685
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,650
A few days ago, she met...

686
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,580
with a producer who makes
an investigative program...

687
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,250
and handed over the material.

688
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,580
And her silence?

689
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:17,820
Don't worry about that.

690
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,820
No one is as tight-lipped as she is
in this line of work.

691
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:24,530
Of all the years
you've worked for me,

692
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,860
I haven't been
as fond of you as I am now.

693
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:28,760
I'll work even harder, sir.

694
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,400
Director Seo.

695
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,040
Silla.

696
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,570
Brewery.

697
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,180
She helps me a great deal.

698
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,050
You have a great girlfriend.

699
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:52,250
Why did he have to see us
at that time?

700
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,070
Why have you been cooped up
in your room all day?

701
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:07,770
Take advantage of this nice weather
to enjoy a meal...

702
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,040
and flowers with Gyeol.

703
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,410
Will you stop mentioning him?

704
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,780
What has gotten into you?

705
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,480
Mom. Is Gyeol the only thing...

706
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,080
you want to talk to me about?

707
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,080
I have my limits too.

708
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,950
Are you going to keep this up?

709
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,850
What do you mean?

710
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:27,190
You sulked through dinner last night
and complained nonstop.

711
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,190
I couldn't eat properly.

712
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,390
I was too worried about
what Gyeol would think.

713
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,030
What has gotten into you?

714
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,300
This isn't how you used to be.

715
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:41,240
Why the sudden change of heart?

716
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,770
It's not sudden.

717
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,910
How many times
do I have to tell you...

718
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:46,680
I'm not interested
in marrying Gyeol?

719
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:54,550
Exactly. What I want to know is why.

720
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,290
Don't give me this nonsense...

721
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,220
about you only
seeing him as a brother...

722
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,320
and be honest with me.

723
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,360
What's the real reason?

724
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,270
It's because of Professor Oh,
isn't it?

725
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,270
You're not even denying it.

726
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,740
Does that mean I'm right?

727
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,440
To be honest,

728
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,480
I don't know.

729
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,310
What?

730
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:26,020
It did cross my mind
that marrying Gyeol...

731
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:28,250
would be a good option for me.

732
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,020
But it doesn't excite me anymore.

733
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,660
I'm not sure...

734
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:38,830
if Professor Oh
is the reason though.

735
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,360
What nonsense is this?

736
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,970
It's the truth.

737
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,770
I can't be sure
of my own feelings, Mom.

738
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,700
Ha Ni.

739
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:26,710
It's your mom, Ha Ni.

740
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,280
My baby.

741
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,550
Mom's so sorry.

742
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,690
I'm sorry for being a bad mom,
Ha Ni.

743
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,360
Calm down.

744
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,260
You might scare Ha Ni.

745
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,130
Thank you.

746
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:51,370
Thanks for letting me see her.

747
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:55,240
I'll wait somewhere else.
Spend some time with her.

748
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,810
Do you know how much I missed you?

749
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,150
I thought of you every single day.

750
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,420
I swear.

751
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:13,920
My dear baby.

752
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,330
I'm sorry.

753
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:18,860
Mom's sorry.

754
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:21,000
Mommy's so sorry.

755
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:56,370
It's okay.

756
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,010
Ha Ni. Dad's here.

757
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,510
Give her to me.

758
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:07,110
Yes, I know. It's okay.

759
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:09,780
You're fine. Dad's here.

760
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,210
Dad's right here. Don't cry.

761
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,020
I think she's sleepy.

762
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:17,620
We should go.

763
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,760
It's okay. I know.

764
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,390
Ha Ni.

765
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:23,990
Oh, dear.

766
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:28,760
Beom Soo.

767
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:37,870
Why don't the three of us
live together?

768
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,040
What if I don't go to the wedding?

769
00:45:43,450 --> 00:45:45,750
Tell me what to do.

770
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,320
Get a grip, Na Young Eun.

771
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,090
I haven't walked down the aisle yet.

772
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:55,260
Nothing has changed.

773
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,160
Beom Soo.

774
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:00,900
Can we start over?

775
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:02,870
This is why
I didn't want to see you.

776
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:04,930
Forget the nonsense.

777
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:06,770
Why is this nonsense?

778
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,340
I don't think
I can live without Ha Ni.

779
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,040
You managed fine so far.

780
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,310
And you'll go on to do fine.

781
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:19,620
You can never be satisfied
with a life with Ha Ni and me.

782
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,650
You already stepped into
another world,

783
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:24,750
and you must live in that world
for you to find meaning.

784
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,830
I'll raise Ha Ni so well...

785
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:32,860
that she doesn't miss having a mom.

786
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,130
So live your own life.

787
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:39,870
I couldn't do anything for days...

788
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:42,770
because Ha Ni was all
I could think about.

789
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:47,340
I really think I might die,
Beom Soo. Please...

790
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:50,180
Listen carefully.

791
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:54,920
This is the last time.

792
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:57,050
It must be the last time.

793
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,760
Don't look back.

794
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:02,560
You can't look back...

795
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:04,830
for your sake, mine, and Ha Ni's.

796
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:07,460
Do you understand?

797
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,900
Bye.

798
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:22,180
No...

799
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:37,160
Welcome.

800
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:38,460
Are you all right?

801
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:43,200
My gosh.
What hospital room is this fancy?

802
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:45,400
The hotel booked it for me.

803
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:48,400
- I see.
- How do you feel?

804
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:51,170
I felt dizzy
and had a headache at first,

805
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:52,670
- but I'm fine now.
- Oh, dear.

806
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:55,740
I just got a CT scan.

807
00:47:56,310 --> 00:47:57,780
Where do you want this?

808
00:47:58,350 --> 00:47:59,410
Right here.

809
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:03,220
Here.

810
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,420
You're an adult.
Why did you ask for comic books?

811
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,960
I got them a while back,
but never had time to read them.

812
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:13,260
It's a great way to kill time here.

813
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:14,400
Goodness.

814
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:21,370
Why did you bring a bathrobe?

815
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:23,170
You won't shower?

816
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,010
You need to.

817
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,080
Okay.

818
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,380
Why did you bring playing cards?

819
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,920
I might get bored
staying up looking after you.

820
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:38,990
I brought them to play.

821
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,720
Why would you look after me
when I'm fine?

822
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:45,060
Are you really fine?

823
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:47,760
I have strong bones.

824
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,270
I bumped my head when I fell,

825
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:52,330
and I grazed an arm and a knee,

826
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,440
but that's nothing.

827
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,310
Heung Soo.

828
00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:00,640
You look worse than I do.

829
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:01,780
What?

830
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,910
You do. Your skin's rough,
and your eyes have sunk.

831
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,750
Is something wrong?

832
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,290
Actually,

833
00:49:12,090 --> 00:49:13,890
I'm suffering from a breakup.

834
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,760
Why would you suffer from a breakup?

835
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:20,260
I noticed the hairdresser lady.

836
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,130
She's a perfect match for you.

837
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:24,200
Ms. Gong.

838
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:26,600
How can you crack such a joke...

839
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,770
when I'm heartbroken?

840
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,670
It's not a joke.

841
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:31,010
The hairdresser...

842
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,080
is the exact type I hate.

843
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:35,310
How about...

844
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:38,250
you all sit down so we can talk?

845
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,480
- Sit down.
- Okay.

846
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:44,120
- I brought this too.
- Great.

847
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:06,740
She suggested we meet up,
so why hasn't she called?

848
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:10,250
(Hankuk University Hospital)

849
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,490
Is she still getting tested?

850
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,900
Hello, sir.

851
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,270
Hello.

852
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:35,770
Sorry.

853
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,440
I called to ask for a favor earlier,

854
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:40,240
but I'll call you back.

855
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:46,250
You're admitted here as well?

856
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:49,750
Yes. My back is acting up.

857
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:53,760
Oh, gosh. Kwang Sook's here too.

858
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,320
Yes. My staff told me.

859
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:59,590
What an incredible coincidence.

860
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,500
Are you here to look after her?

861
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
What? Well, yes.

862
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:09,170
No. I got to see her,
so I should go now.

863
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:12,240
I'm busy and will leave very soon.

864
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,580
I see. Bye, then.

865
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:25,520
Chairman Han and Kwang Sook.
They're dating, aren't they?

866
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:29,890
That can't be.

867
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,560
It's very unlikely.

868
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:41,200
Beom Soo must be teaching.
We couldn't reach him,

869
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,640
so we came without him.

870
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,510
We left him a message.

871
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:46,010
He'll call when he gets it.

872
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:49,080
Why would you call him
when he's busy?

873
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,350
It'll be such a nuisance.

874
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:55,080
If you said what you came to say,

875
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:56,380
we can go.

876
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:57,990
Already?

877
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,090
She'll be tired after all the tests.

878
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:01,760
She needs to rest,

879
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:04,330
and you can get back
to your livelihoods too.

880
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:07,700
Why are you leaving so soon
when you just got here?

881
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:10,670
You worked like crazy day and night.

882
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:13,540
This is your chance
to sleep all you want...

883
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,000
and rest up.

884
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:18,040
Yes. Let's go
so Kwang Sook can rest.

885
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:21,840
Tell me if you need anything.

886
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,980
I'll get it for you.

887
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,810
There's a convenience store
and a coffee shop downstairs,

888
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,480
and they sell everything.

889
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,850
I'm sure she can get
whatever she needs.

890
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:34,860
It's time for us to go.

891
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:36,690
- Okay.
- Walk on out.

892
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,630
- Bye, Kwang Sook.
- Why...

893
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,300
Let's go.

894
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:55,710
Why don't the three of us
live together?

895
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,350
What if I don't go to the wedding?

896
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:04,150
Ha Ni.

897
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,490
Let's let Mom go.

898
00:53:08,290 --> 00:53:10,460
That's the best way to keep her...

899
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,790
and us from becoming miserable.

900
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,340
Ha Ni. I'll take some medicine
and come right back.

901
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,000
(Dancing Prince)

902
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,870
Dear subscribers of Dancing Prince.

903
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,340
It's been a long time.

904
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:59,540
I haven't streamed for a while
due to some circumstances.

905
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,310
I'm back in front of the camera
after a while.

906
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:05,910
At this moment,

907
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:10,050
about 20 subscribers
are watching this.

908
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:15,320
Seon Ah.

909
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:19,130
Are you watching this now?

910
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,830
If you're watching,

911
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:23,770
please give me a call.

912
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,770
How could you do this to me?

913
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,710
How could you leave me like that
without saying goodbye?

914
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:34,910
Even if you have to leave,
you should at least tell me why.

915
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,410
You're not supposed to stream
when you're drunk.

916
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:38,450
What...

917
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:40,180
You seem quite drunk.

918
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,050
I didn't drink at all.

919
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:45,950
I'm not drunk.

920
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,820
I'm completely sober now.

921
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:50,530
I'm already sick of dealing
with my drunk husband.

922
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:51,860
- What's wrong with him?
- My gosh.

923
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:52,960
Why do they keep saying that?

924
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,930
Stop being ridiculous
and just dance.

925
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,430
I'll cancel my subscription.

926
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,130
Fine! Go ahead and cancel it!

927
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,240
Cancel your subscription!

928
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,500
- I'm canceling it now.
- My gosh.

929
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,840
- I'm canceling it.
- I'm canceling the subscription.

930
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:09,580
I'm...

931
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:11,710
looking for someone.

932
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,980
Her name is Kim Seon Ah.

933
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:17,320
She's 34 years old.

934
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:20,320
Her height is...

935
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:22,520
It's about...

936
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:25,860
She's about 165cm and 45kg.

937
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:28,760
What's special about her is
that she plays the piano very well.

938
00:55:30,770 --> 00:55:32,770
If you see Seon Ah,

939
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,770
please contact me.

940
00:55:37,970 --> 00:55:39,440
I'll offer a generous reward.

941
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,980
Seon Ah!

942
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,250
(Oh Heung Soo, the versatile dancer
who can do anything, is here!)

943
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:51,220
If you're watching this,
please give me a call!

944
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,690
(Dancing Prince)

945
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,820
Seriously, I'm not drunk!

946
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:59,390
My gosh.

947
00:56:00,230 --> 00:56:02,660
He's being so pathetic.

948
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:06,600
(Hankuk University Hospital)

949
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,240
I'm feeling a bit peckish.

950
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,420
Did they bring what I asked for?

951
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,790
(Oat of Mom)

952
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:26,390
This is a lot.

953
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:36,600
This is quite filling.

954
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:37,600
It's delicious.

955
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,500
By the way, is Ms. Gong still here?

956
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,540
She said she'd leave soon.

957
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,590
Chairman Han.

958
00:57:07,730 --> 00:57:10,060
Hey. Did you go somewhere?

959
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,670
I was hungry,

960
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:13,770
so I went to the convenience store
to buy some snacks.

961
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:15,570
Did you not have dinner?

962
00:57:15,970 --> 00:57:17,340
Of course, I did.

963
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,970
But I felt hungry all of a sudden.

964
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:21,710
Do you want to eat with me?

965
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,050
No. I'm fine.

966
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:26,710
But this is too much to eat alone.

967
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,820
Why don't you join me?

968
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:44,300
Please have a seat.

969
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,730
Thanks.

970
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:03,320
I'm fine. You should eat it.

971
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,520
Would you like
something to drink then?

972
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:07,590
It's okay.

973
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:11,890
By the way, you're reading
comic books like a little kid?

974
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:18,200
This isn't just a comic book.

975
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,240
This is like the bible
among wine enthusiasts.

976
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:22,370
I see.

977
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:24,270
"The Celestial Drops?"

978
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,270
You read it?

979
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:28,540
I've heard of the title.

980
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:30,010
So you know it.

981
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,650
Since I run a brewery,

982
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:34,980
I thought it'd be good to read it,
so I bought it.

983
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:37,190
But I was too busy
to find time to read it.

984
00:58:37,190 --> 00:58:39,420
I asked Mom to bring it
and am reading it now.

985
00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:40,990
It's really fun.

986
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:42,990
Is it that good?

987
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:45,730
Do you want to give it a try?

988
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:49,360
No, I'm not interested.

989
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,360
("The Celestial Drops")

990
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:42,320
Yes, Chairman Han.

991
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,620
Did you finish Volume Three?

992
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:46,450
Of course.

993
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:48,560
I'm reading Volume Five now.

994
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,270
I'll remove the needle.

995
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,270
Okay.

996
01:01:12,270 --> 01:01:15,240
I'm feeling a little icky.
Can I take a shower?

997
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,750
Sure. Be careful
not to let it touch the water.

998
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:18,880
Okay.

999
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:57,820
Is she asleep?

1000
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:00,460
It's not time for bed yet.

1001
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:08,730
CEO Ma.

1002
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,770
CEO Ma?

1003
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,640
May I come in for a moment?

1004
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:22,580
Did you finish Volume Ten?

1005
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:27,480
I guess she went out.

1006
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:30,920
Well...

1007
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:37,860
Volume 5, 6, 7...

1008
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:39,590
Volume Eight.

1009
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:43,330
Volume Ten.

1010
01:03:39,890 --> 01:03:42,360
(For Eagle Brothers)

1011
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:44,560
Today's class has been canceled.

1012
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,790
- Why?
- Mr. Oh is absent again.

1013
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:49,630
Mi Sun, let's not give up too soon.

1014
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,100
We're still young.

1015
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,030
Congratulations
on your new beginning.

1016
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:56,070
Isn't it boring and stuffy
being in the hospital?

1017
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,510
Why? Are you uncomfortable here?

1018
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:01,040
Still, having you around
made it less boring,

1019
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:03,080
and I actually had fun.

1020
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:04,910
CEO Ma.

1021
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:08,350
Good night.
