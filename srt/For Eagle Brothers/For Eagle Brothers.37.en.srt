1
00:00:01,813 --> 00:00:03,553
I apologize for barging in at this late hour.

2
00:00:05,053 --> 00:00:08,093
I thought I should speak to the family in person,

3
00:00:08,853 --> 00:00:10,253
despite knowing I wouldn't be welcome.

4
00:00:12,093 --> 00:00:14,523
How are you not welcome? I'm glad you're here.

5
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:17,063
Please have a seat.

6
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:23,373
(Episode 37)

7
00:00:26,343 --> 00:00:28,013
Is that the hotel chairman?

8
00:00:28,813 --> 00:00:30,173
Stay out of it.

9
00:00:30,673 --> 00:00:32,083
Don't stick your nose into another family's business...

10
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,343
and cause us trouble.

11
00:00:33,713 --> 00:00:35,453
This is my family too, you know.

12
00:00:35,883 --> 00:00:36,913
I was ready...

13
00:00:38,023 --> 00:00:40,553
to tell her brothers-in-law about us,

14
00:00:41,323 --> 00:00:43,653
but Kwang Sook wanted to do it her way,

15
00:00:45,163 --> 00:00:46,593
so I held back.

16
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:50,163
Because of that, things happened out of order.

17
00:00:51,463 --> 00:00:52,533
"Kwang Sook?"

18
00:00:56,003 --> 00:00:57,203
She asked me...

19
00:00:57,403 --> 00:00:59,043
to wait until things settled at the brewery...

20
00:00:59,543 --> 00:01:03,373
and the brothers-in-law were on a stable path.

21
00:01:04,073 --> 00:01:05,413
I'm the one who pushed it.

22
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,013
I hope there's no misunderstanding about that.

23
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:09,013
Of course not.

24
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,653
It was just unexpected for my brothers. That's all.

25
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:13,883
Really, don't worry about it.

26
00:01:14,423 --> 00:01:15,453
Chun Soo!

27
00:01:17,963 --> 00:01:21,223
Heung Soo. Calm down and let him finish.

28
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:25,403
Kwang Sook and I took long enough to get to know each other,

29
00:01:26,063 --> 00:01:29,503
and I believe we were cautious enough as well.

30
00:01:30,503 --> 00:01:32,403
I'm well aware that the brewery...

31
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:34,303
and all her brothers-in-law...

32
00:01:34,773 --> 00:01:38,013
must settle down for Kwang Sook to be happy.

33
00:01:39,413 --> 00:01:41,913
I won't rush anyone to satisfy my needs.

34
00:01:43,153 --> 00:01:44,283
So please,

35
00:01:46,353 --> 00:01:48,693
could you brothers-in-law watch how we do?

36
00:01:49,153 --> 00:01:50,393
So basically,

37
00:01:51,193 --> 00:01:54,123
you're saying you'll take our sister-in-law.

38
00:01:54,123 --> 00:01:55,733
- Oh Heung Soo. - Heung Soo.

39
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:03,673
You should go, sir.

40
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,673
We'll talk about it among ourselves.

41
00:02:07,203 --> 00:02:08,313
Yes.

42
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:11,583
We're flustered because we just found this out.

43
00:02:12,043 --> 00:02:13,743
Please don't get the wrong idea.

44
00:02:18,023 --> 00:02:20,783
Okay. Let's meet again.

45
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,803
Kwang Sook, you should see him off.

46
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:34,733
Go on.

47
00:02:46,813 --> 00:02:49,983
I'm sorry I left you with extra homework.

48
00:02:50,913 --> 00:02:52,353
Not at all.

49
00:02:54,053 --> 00:02:55,793
Sorry for keeping you so late.

50
00:02:57,893 --> 00:02:59,993
I'll call you when I get home.

51
00:03:29,993 --> 00:03:32,163
They blurted stuff out in shock.

52
00:03:32,223 --> 00:03:33,563
Don't take it to heart.

53
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:36,393
They'll all come around when we talk calmly again tomorrow.

54
00:03:48,743 --> 00:03:50,373
Is the chairman gone?

55
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:52,683
I guess the others went to bed.

56
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:54,583
You should too.

57
00:03:56,213 --> 00:03:57,213
Okay.

58
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:08,593
Why would a hotel chairman...

59
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:12,133
go for someone like your sister-in-law?

60
00:04:12,763 --> 00:04:14,033
Does he have weird taste?

61
00:04:17,873 --> 00:04:19,403
It's none of your business.

62
00:04:19,743 --> 00:04:21,173
Butt out and go back to the motel.

63
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:26,043
What will happen to the brewery?

64
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:30,483
We must get our share before she gets remarried.

65
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,953
Stay out of my family's business.

66
00:04:37,723 --> 00:04:41,193
You'll lose your share again, acting like you're sweet and nice.

67
00:04:45,103 --> 00:04:47,233
I flew in at the perfect time.

68
00:04:54,543 --> 00:04:56,273
It hasn't been that long since Jang Soo passed away,

69
00:04:56,943 --> 00:04:59,143
yet you're already dating another man.

70
00:04:59,343 --> 00:05:02,783
Jang Soo would be turning in his grave.

71
00:05:02,883 --> 00:05:04,483
He'd be devastated.

72
00:05:33,413 --> 00:05:34,783
After Jang Soo died,

73
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:37,283
as soon as the funeral was over,

74
00:05:37,383 --> 00:05:39,053
we even tried to send Kwang Sook home.

75
00:05:39,753 --> 00:05:41,353
Why are you complaining now?

76
00:05:43,653 --> 00:05:46,223
It was easier to consider letting her go back then...

77
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:47,593
because we weren't too close.

78
00:05:49,693 --> 00:05:51,393
Be honest for once.

79
00:05:52,463 --> 00:05:54,733
Is it all good that Kwang Sook's dating...

80
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,003
a hotel chairman?

81
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,673
Do you think that's how I feel?

82
00:05:58,243 --> 00:06:01,003
I know I should wish for her happiness,

83
00:06:02,413 --> 00:06:04,743
but part of me is sad to let her go.

84
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:07,743
But we can't keep her with us forever.

85
00:06:08,143 --> 00:06:10,113
I'm not saying it's forever.

86
00:06:11,283 --> 00:06:12,453
It's just that...

87
00:06:16,623 --> 00:06:19,223
I never imagined that Kwang Sook...

88
00:06:20,363 --> 00:06:22,193
would get over Jang Soo so soon.

89
00:06:22,893 --> 00:06:24,393
That's what hurts the most.

90
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:27,533
Kang Soo. Don't you have anything to say?

91
00:06:29,033 --> 00:06:30,103
Well...

92
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:34,103
I didn't think Kwang Sook would fall in love again.

93
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:37,373
It's a surprise.

94
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:39,413
See?

95
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:42,953
Not everyone welcomes her marriage wholeheartedly.

96
00:06:43,353 --> 00:06:46,583
To be honest, I'm not completely up for it.

97
00:06:49,223 --> 00:06:52,423
I don't think I'll like this place without her.

98
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,963
I know. But we shouldn't be like this.

99
00:06:57,793 --> 00:07:00,403
We should put her first.

100
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,173
I actually don't like the chairman either.

101
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:05,143
This was Jang Soo's home,

102
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:07,443
and it's not right for him to walk in whenever he wants.

103
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:44,743
Did you see the chairman off?

104
00:07:49,183 --> 00:07:50,213
Yes.

105
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:53,083
This is why...

106
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,423
they say you shouldn't show too much favor to others.

107
00:07:58,793 --> 00:08:01,593
You slaved away for them and restored the brewery.

108
00:08:02,393 --> 00:08:03,863
Out of guilt, at the very least,

109
00:08:04,533 --> 00:08:05,663
they should say,

110
00:08:06,563 --> 00:08:08,833
"Kwang Sook. You met a great guy."

111
00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:10,733
"Don't worry about us."

112
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:12,503
"Marry him."

113
00:08:12,673 --> 00:08:14,743
That's what a decent person would say.

114
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:17,113
How dare they react like this?

115
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:30,553
Were you very hurt?

116
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:38,963
I didn't think...

117
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,773
they'd welcome the news.

118
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:48,303
But I didn't expect this reaction.

119
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:54,583
That's why...

120
00:08:55,783 --> 00:08:58,183
you can never truly be family with in-laws.

121
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:01,953
You always talked about caring for them...

122
00:09:03,193 --> 00:09:04,693
like they were your real brothers.

123
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:06,963
Goodness.

124
00:09:10,493 --> 00:09:12,233
I want to sleep, Mom.

125
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:15,473
Okay.

126
00:09:16,873 --> 00:09:18,503
Don't think about anything tonight.

127
00:09:46,963 --> 00:09:48,433
Goodness...

128
00:09:49,873 --> 00:09:51,733
Why is it so complicated?

129
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:09,623
Good morning.

130
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:17,833
Sit and have breakfast.

131
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,533
Why should I cook...

132
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:26,873
for people who are standing in my daughter's way?

133
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:28,773
You should know better.

134
00:10:29,673 --> 00:10:31,413
The food I served you was all a waste.

135
00:10:31,843 --> 00:10:33,713
Let's all eat.

136
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:45,863
I had too much to drink yesterday.

137
00:10:49,063 --> 00:10:50,393
I apologize.

138
00:10:51,563 --> 00:10:53,163
Don't blame the alcohol.

139
00:10:53,603 --> 00:10:55,603
Now, I know exactly how you feel.

140
00:10:58,373 --> 00:10:59,673
You're all the same.

141
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:02,773
Not one of you congratulated her to my satisfaction.

142
00:11:02,873 --> 00:11:04,213
You're all the same.

143
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:08,613
Where is Kwang Sook?

144
00:11:08,613 --> 00:11:09,813
At the brewery!

145
00:11:09,813 --> 00:11:11,113
Where else would she be?

146
00:11:11,653 --> 00:11:14,123
I'll go and talk to her.

147
00:11:15,993 --> 00:11:17,953
I have some materials to go over.

148
00:11:18,353 --> 00:11:20,093
I need to go to work early.

149
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:21,723
I also...

150
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:23,393
Stop moving.

151
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:25,663
I'm giving you a final warning.

152
00:11:26,263 --> 00:11:29,433
If you make my daughter cry, I won't let it slide.

153
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:31,703
You know what I mean, right?

154
00:11:36,443 --> 00:11:37,473
Yes.

155
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:51,753
(Eagle Brewery)

156
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:04,133
What brings you here so early in the morning?

157
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,803
You didn't have breakfast, did you?

158
00:12:05,803 --> 00:12:07,073
Let's go and get some food.

159
00:12:08,343 --> 00:12:09,513
Now.

160
00:12:25,463 --> 00:12:28,493
Gosh, what is he doing here so early in the morning?

161
00:12:30,193 --> 00:12:32,403
I was going to talk to Kwang Sook.

162
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:46,513
Your eyes are all puffy.

163
00:12:46,513 --> 00:12:49,053
I guess you had a good night's sleep.

164
00:12:52,723 --> 00:12:55,823
You must've been upset yesterday.

165
00:12:57,493 --> 00:12:58,593
I'm sorry.

166
00:12:58,993 --> 00:13:01,593
I'm a businessman, you know.

167
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:03,533
When I face a crisis,

168
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,303
my fighting spirit kicks in.

169
00:13:07,133 --> 00:13:08,233
I'm fine.

170
00:13:16,243 --> 00:13:17,813
Please enjoy.

171
00:13:23,153 --> 00:13:26,683
Here. Take your time and chew it well.

172
00:13:30,723 --> 00:13:31,753
What?

173
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:34,563
Do you not want me to cool your food?

174
00:13:35,223 --> 00:13:39,133
Come on. On a day like today, I should cool it down myself.

175
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:44,633
Gosh, it's hot.

176
00:13:45,203 --> 00:13:46,543
- My gosh. - Oh, dear.

177
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:54,813
Why don't you...

178
00:13:55,653 --> 00:13:56,883
leave the brewery?

179
00:13:59,883 --> 00:14:00,883
What?

180
00:14:01,253 --> 00:14:02,393
Right now,

181
00:14:03,423 --> 00:14:05,153
all I can think about is...

182
00:14:05,153 --> 00:14:07,623
getting you out of that house as soon as possible.

183
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:12,133
When you said they were like your brothers,

184
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:15,933
I believed it too easily.

185
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:21,243
It's not as easy as it sounds to date someone new...

186
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:23,513
while living with your in-laws.

187
00:14:25,413 --> 00:14:26,483
This is...

188
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:29,083
my choice.

189
00:14:30,053 --> 00:14:32,883
Just like how my relationship with you is my life,

190
00:14:33,753 --> 00:14:35,653
my relationship with my brothers-in-law...

191
00:14:36,723 --> 00:14:38,123
is also my life.

192
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:40,963
It's not like...

193
00:14:41,363 --> 00:14:44,163
I can give one of them up.

194
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:49,803
How can you say that after seeing what happened yesterday?

195
00:14:51,673 --> 00:14:52,773
Of course,

196
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:56,273
I was a little flustered too.

197
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,413
But that just makes me...

198
00:15:01,713 --> 00:15:03,613
want to try harder to make things right.

199
00:15:06,023 --> 00:15:07,483
Please wait and let me take care of it.

200
00:15:15,493 --> 00:15:17,233
I understand what you mean.

201
00:15:17,233 --> 00:15:18,903
Let's just eat.

202
00:15:29,813 --> 00:15:32,183
(Gongjubuyang Shampoo)

203
00:15:47,093 --> 00:15:48,763
It feels so good.

204
00:15:52,763 --> 00:15:54,403
It's really smooth.

205
00:15:57,633 --> 00:15:58,673
Come in.

206
00:16:03,773 --> 00:16:05,373
Come out and have breakfast.

207
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:06,813
Okay.

208
00:16:06,813 --> 00:16:09,253
What? Your hair looks more voluminous than usual today.

209
00:16:09,313 --> 00:16:10,483
Did you use my shampoo?

210
00:16:11,253 --> 00:16:13,723
Yes. It's really good.

211
00:16:14,923 --> 00:16:17,153
You were already pretty, but you look even prettier now.

212
00:16:18,593 --> 00:16:19,793
Thank you.

213
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:24,593
(Calls)

214
00:16:26,463 --> 00:16:27,863
He hasn't called.

215
00:16:28,463 --> 00:16:30,273
What is going on?

216
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:34,173
Hey.

217
00:16:34,443 --> 00:16:35,813
Thank you for the food.

218
00:16:36,643 --> 00:16:38,543
You're an early bird.

219
00:16:38,543 --> 00:16:40,483
Professor doesn't have a class today,

220
00:16:40,483 --> 00:16:41,813
so we're meeting later.

221
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:43,583
Is it a date?

222
00:16:44,413 --> 00:16:45,453
Yes.

223
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:47,483
Good for you.

224
00:16:50,453 --> 00:16:53,123
Did something happen to Professor's big brother?

225
00:16:54,163 --> 00:16:55,263
I don't know.

226
00:16:56,193 --> 00:16:57,693
He hasn't called.

227
00:16:58,903 --> 00:17:00,663
I'm sure it's not a big deal.

228
00:17:00,663 --> 00:17:02,903
Let's eat. Go ahead.

229
00:17:10,043 --> 00:17:12,173
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

230
00:17:12,173 --> 00:17:15,853
Have you heard anything about your birth parents?

231
00:17:16,383 --> 00:17:17,383
Honey.

232
00:17:18,213 --> 00:17:20,023
What could I possibly know?

233
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:24,393
Kang Soo was brought to the brewery...

234
00:17:25,393 --> 00:17:27,523
long before I started working there.

235
00:17:33,163 --> 00:17:34,263
There must be something.

236
00:17:35,303 --> 00:17:36,603
Something doesn't feel right.

237
00:17:39,303 --> 00:17:40,343
Come in.

238
00:17:45,113 --> 00:17:46,383
I'm back, sir.

239
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:48,413
Did you take care of it secretly?

240
00:17:49,183 --> 00:17:52,353
Yes. I sent the samples to a private genetic testing agency.

241
00:17:52,353 --> 00:17:53,723
I didn't use the real names,

242
00:17:53,923 --> 00:17:56,223
and the comparison target was recorded with anonymous codes.

243
00:17:57,023 --> 00:17:58,223
When will the results come out?

244
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:00,463
I think they will be available tomorrow.

245
00:18:01,323 --> 00:18:02,333
Good job.

246
00:18:02,863 --> 00:18:03,963
Make sure to keep it to yourself.

247
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:05,393
Yes, sir.

248
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:14,373
I need to make things clear.

249
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,543
Of course, I do.

250
00:18:31,823 --> 00:18:32,863
Hello?

251
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:36,633
Can we talk now?

252
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:38,363
Yes, go ahead.

253
00:18:38,663 --> 00:18:39,833
Did you...

254
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,673
hear anything from Kang Soo?

255
00:18:43,973 --> 00:18:44,973
What do you mean?

256
00:18:46,273 --> 00:18:47,503
The thing is,

257
00:18:48,873 --> 00:18:51,013
my husband asked me to have dinner together yesterday,

258
00:18:51,013 --> 00:18:52,813
so I went to the restaurant,

259
00:18:53,513 --> 00:18:54,943
and Kang Soo was there.

260
00:18:55,713 --> 00:18:58,183
He called Kang Soo over without telling me.

261
00:18:58,553 --> 00:18:59,953
What for?

262
00:19:00,423 --> 00:19:01,983
He had no special reason.

263
00:19:02,693 --> 00:19:05,023
I guess he felt bad about what he'd said to Kang Soo.

264
00:19:05,523 --> 00:19:07,493
He wanted to apologize.

265
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:12,293
But it wouldn't be good for the two of them to meet.

266
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:14,363
I agree.

267
00:19:17,903 --> 00:19:20,003
How is Se Ri doing?

268
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,143
Actually, I was going to give you a call.

269
00:19:23,813 --> 00:19:26,083
Do you have time this afternoon?

270
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,713
- You're here. - Yes, hello.

271
00:19:33,783 --> 00:19:34,823
Gureum.

272
00:19:36,053 --> 00:19:38,223
It's time for us to say goodbye.

273
00:19:38,923 --> 00:19:40,823
Stay healthy, okay?

274
00:19:45,193 --> 00:19:46,533
Come here, Gureum.

275
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:48,563
Come here.

276
00:19:51,103 --> 00:19:53,743
Say bye to them, Gureum.

277
00:19:55,143 --> 00:19:56,773
I'll call you, Doctor Baek.

278
00:19:56,773 --> 00:19:57,773
Okay.

279
00:20:05,613 --> 00:20:06,623
Gureum.

280
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:08,783
Bye.

281
00:20:09,853 --> 00:20:10,953
Take care.

282
00:20:15,933 --> 00:20:19,203
(Vet)

283
00:20:38,313 --> 00:20:39,483
Calm down.

284
00:20:44,753 --> 00:20:46,223
What are you two doing?

285
00:20:48,793 --> 00:20:50,033
In broad daylight,

286
00:20:50,363 --> 00:20:52,463
how can you be touching her like that out on the street?

287
00:20:56,863 --> 00:20:58,073
Ok Bun, you.

288
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,633
How can you cry in front of another man?

289
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,043
Can you stop interfering in what's clearly our business?

290
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,943
He knows you're innocent and has been using the puppy...

291
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:11,853
to make a move on you.

292
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,683
Now, you're crossing the line.

293
00:21:13,713 --> 00:21:15,153
What do you mean I'm crossing the line?

294
00:21:16,523 --> 00:21:17,693
I get it.

295
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:19,723
I saw right through you.

296
00:21:22,293 --> 00:21:24,693
Whether he makes a move on me or not...

297
00:21:25,063 --> 00:21:26,763
is none of your business.

298
00:21:28,303 --> 00:21:29,333
What?

299
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:32,133
What am I to you?

300
00:21:33,703 --> 00:21:35,273
What are we to each other?

301
00:21:38,173 --> 00:21:39,843
Am I your girlfriend?

302
00:21:40,813 --> 00:21:42,383
Hey, that's...

303
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:46,853
I knew it.

304
00:21:48,283 --> 00:21:51,053
You're running the shop I invested in,

305
00:21:51,323 --> 00:21:52,923
and I was a fan of yours back when you were a dancer.

306
00:21:52,993 --> 00:21:54,253
That's all there is to it.

307
00:21:54,253 --> 00:21:55,993
Correct me if I'm wrong!

308
00:22:05,873 --> 00:22:08,573
You should collect yourself and head inside for now.

309
00:22:10,443 --> 00:22:11,513
Okay, Doctor Baek.

310
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:18,953
Hey, wait.

311
00:22:33,563 --> 00:22:34,963
I'm sorry about that.

312
00:22:36,103 --> 00:22:38,003
I bet that offended you.

313
00:22:43,103 --> 00:22:44,103
Use me...

314
00:22:45,073 --> 00:22:46,343
all you want.

315
00:22:48,783 --> 00:22:49,783
Sorry?

316
00:22:49,983 --> 00:22:52,483
You're both obviously playing hard to get.

317
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:54,623
Doctor Baek.

318
00:22:55,223 --> 00:22:58,153
You want to make the sandwich shop owner jealous...

319
00:22:58,153 --> 00:22:59,853
so that he'd confess his feelings for you.

320
00:23:00,853 --> 00:23:01,863
Aren't I right?

321
00:23:03,363 --> 00:23:06,463
Well, not exactly, but...

322
00:23:12,103 --> 00:23:13,103
I'm sorry.

323
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:14,973
There's no need to apologize.

324
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,873
I've always known...

325
00:23:17,873 --> 00:23:20,013
that you had feelings...

326
00:23:21,283 --> 00:23:22,413
for the sandwich shop owner.

327
00:23:22,783 --> 00:23:25,783
You knew that, but you were still so nice to me?

328
00:23:26,913 --> 00:23:27,983
Why?

329
00:23:29,423 --> 00:23:30,753
Because you have...

330
00:23:31,793 --> 00:23:33,723
a heart warmer than anyone else's...

331
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,723
and a lot of love to spare.

332
00:23:37,663 --> 00:23:40,493
I'm happy to know that I can help.

333
00:23:41,563 --> 00:23:43,263
I'll do my best to help you,

334
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:46,073
so hang in there until he confesses his feelings.

335
00:23:48,003 --> 00:23:49,073
Doctor Baek.

336
00:23:50,143 --> 00:23:51,743
But if it doesn't go as planned,

337
00:23:52,713 --> 00:23:54,343
you have to give me a chance too, okay?

338
00:24:02,883 --> 00:24:04,253
Welcome.

339
00:24:05,253 --> 00:24:06,393
Hey, Chun Soo.

340
00:24:14,393 --> 00:24:16,203
You look awful.

341
00:24:19,803 --> 00:24:21,033
Is something up?

342
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,753
Yeoung Ju's mom...

343
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,783
is back from the US.

344
00:24:37,253 --> 00:24:38,253
Right.

345
00:24:39,193 --> 00:24:40,653
I see.

346
00:24:40,853 --> 00:24:42,193
She doesn't want a divorce...

347
00:24:43,593 --> 00:24:45,693
and has been insisting that we get back together.

348
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:52,833
Just know...

349
00:24:53,603 --> 00:24:55,803
that I don't intend to do that one bit.

350
00:24:56,503 --> 00:24:57,603
I mean it.

351
00:24:59,113 --> 00:25:00,143
Right.

352
00:25:00,713 --> 00:25:02,183
I'll try to talk some sense into her...

353
00:25:02,883 --> 00:25:04,313
and convince her to go back to the US.

354
00:25:04,313 --> 00:25:05,783
Mi Sun, don't worry so much.

355
00:25:08,653 --> 00:25:09,853
Got it.

356
00:25:10,283 --> 00:25:12,553
You shouldn't get antsy about this either.

357
00:25:20,893 --> 00:25:21,963
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

358
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:24,163
Goodness.

359
00:25:25,903 --> 00:25:27,703
I'm sorry I interrupted your busy day.

360
00:25:27,703 --> 00:25:28,803
That's nonsense.

361
00:25:29,043 --> 00:25:30,143
- Let's have a seat. - Sure.

362
00:25:33,373 --> 00:25:34,413
My gosh.

363
00:25:37,743 --> 00:25:39,383
I won't beat around the bush.

364
00:25:39,783 --> 00:25:41,483
I'll cut right to the chase.

365
00:25:44,323 --> 00:25:45,923
How about...

366
00:25:46,693 --> 00:25:49,793
you take over the brewery as the CEO?

367
00:25:50,793 --> 00:25:52,863
Have you ever thought about that?

368
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,303
Why would you say that out of the blue?

369
00:25:55,933 --> 00:25:57,263
Kwang Sook...

370
00:25:57,903 --> 00:26:00,073
seems to be taking on a huge responsibility...

371
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:01,473
all by herself.

372
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:05,173
I was wondering if you could take...

373
00:26:05,443 --> 00:26:08,183
some of the weight off her shoulders.

374
00:26:09,013 --> 00:26:10,643
I've been helping her with the bookkeeping...

375
00:26:10,643 --> 00:26:11,883
and administration,

376
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:16,223
but brewing the liquor itself is a whole different story.

377
00:26:17,353 --> 00:26:19,093
I'm trying to tread lightly,

378
00:26:19,993 --> 00:26:22,363
but the brewery has been in the family...

379
00:26:22,463 --> 00:26:24,223
for three generations.

380
00:26:25,593 --> 00:26:27,093
If you took over as CEO,

381
00:26:27,433 --> 00:26:29,763
it'd be like returning the brewery to its rightful owner.

382
00:26:33,573 --> 00:26:34,573
Chairman Han.

383
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,343
With all due respect,

384
00:26:39,673 --> 00:26:41,413
I don't think it's your place to involve yourself...

385
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:42,813
in how we run our business.

386
00:26:42,813 --> 00:26:44,013
Goodness, no.

387
00:26:44,113 --> 00:26:46,213
I wasn't telling you how to run your business.

388
00:26:46,883 --> 00:26:48,923
I just thought it would be nice for Kwang Sook...

389
00:26:48,923 --> 00:26:50,953
to lighten her responsibilities a bit.

390
00:26:51,053 --> 00:26:53,793
I understand it hasn't been easy...

391
00:26:53,793 --> 00:26:56,763
to watch Kwang Sook go through all this,

392
00:26:57,423 --> 00:26:59,963
but maybe you could have a little patience.

393
00:27:01,763 --> 00:27:04,603
Kwang Sook and us brothers will try to resolve this on our end.

394
00:27:04,603 --> 00:27:06,203
That's how it's been so far.

395
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:10,043
I'm wishing you two the best,

396
00:27:10,043 --> 00:27:12,543
but family matters should be handled...

397
00:27:12,543 --> 00:27:14,313
within the family.

398
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,743
On that note, I'll pretend...

399
00:27:17,713 --> 00:27:19,283
this conversation never happened.

400
00:27:31,023 --> 00:27:32,963
(Eagle Brewery)

401
00:27:32,963 --> 00:27:33,993
Honey.

402
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:41,903
Didn't I warn you not to come near our house?

403
00:27:42,503 --> 00:27:44,003
It's still not too late to sell the brewery...

404
00:27:44,003 --> 00:27:45,313
and take what we're entitled to.

405
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:46,913
Unbelievable.

406
00:27:47,213 --> 00:27:48,283
By the looks of it yesterday,

407
00:27:48,283 --> 00:27:50,743
your sister-in-law will soon marry that hotel chairman.

408
00:27:50,743 --> 00:27:51,913
Once she marries into that family,

409
00:27:51,913 --> 00:27:53,853
we'll lose everything...

410
00:27:53,853 --> 00:27:55,483
and be left with nothing.

411
00:27:55,523 --> 00:27:57,783
Stop sticking your nose in our family's business.

412
00:27:57,923 --> 00:27:59,993
Do you have to put it that way?

413
00:27:59,993 --> 00:28:01,253
Let me make myself clear.

414
00:28:01,363 --> 00:28:02,923
Our second court-mandated date is coming up next week.

415
00:28:03,463 --> 00:28:05,963
You'll have another thing coming if you don't show again. Got it?

416
00:28:07,663 --> 00:28:12,203
(Eagle Brewery)

417
00:28:15,943 --> 00:28:17,543
Stubborn as always.

418
00:28:30,353 --> 00:28:31,923
Your mother is inside.

419
00:28:33,693 --> 00:28:34,863
Talk to her.

420
00:28:35,023 --> 00:28:37,423
- Professor... - She's worried sick about you,

421
00:28:38,063 --> 00:28:39,633
so let her see you.

422
00:28:41,163 --> 00:28:43,933
I tagged along excited, thinking we were going on a date.

423
00:28:44,203 --> 00:28:45,833
We can go on one some other time.

424
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:48,103
I'll wait for you in the car.

425
00:29:20,173 --> 00:29:21,203
Mom.

426
00:29:23,473 --> 00:29:24,543
Se Ri.

427
00:29:27,173 --> 00:29:28,283
Have a seat.

428
00:29:43,463 --> 00:29:45,233
Do you hate me that much?

429
00:29:46,163 --> 00:29:47,633
You won't even meet my gaze.

430
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:55,203
Professor Oh told me.

431
00:29:57,443 --> 00:29:59,213
You got a job at a convenience store.

432
00:30:01,443 --> 00:30:02,443
Right.

433
00:30:03,983 --> 00:30:06,613
I thought you relied on me for everything.

434
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,083
I'm impressed.

435
00:30:16,323 --> 00:30:18,093
I know you're disappointed in me and your dad.

436
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:22,063
I'm also aware that I can't talk my way out of this.

437
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,303
But back then,

438
00:30:27,273 --> 00:30:30,773
your dad and I had nothing to our name.

439
00:30:31,273 --> 00:30:33,073
Our future seemed dim,

440
00:30:34,343 --> 00:30:36,283
which is why we did the unthinkable.

441
00:30:37,513 --> 00:30:39,083
What we did was wrong.

442
00:30:39,983 --> 00:30:42,923
So please forgive us, Se Ri.

443
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:46,093
Why ask me for forgiveness?

444
00:30:46,923 --> 00:30:49,563
You should be apologizing to Professor Oh's family.

445
00:30:50,523 --> 00:30:53,333
I'll go to them soon and ask for their forgiveness too.

446
00:30:54,263 --> 00:30:56,633
I will. I promise you that, okay?

447
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:58,933
But Dad has no intention of doing so.

448
00:30:59,073 --> 00:31:02,603
Give it some time, and he'll also come around.

449
00:31:03,843 --> 00:31:05,773
He's being stubborn right now,

450
00:31:07,143 --> 00:31:08,713
but he'll see that he was wrong.

451
00:31:09,083 --> 00:31:10,613
I'll talk to him.

452
00:31:14,153 --> 00:31:16,583
So please, come back home already.

453
00:31:17,823 --> 00:31:19,493
I'm miserable...

454
00:31:20,093 --> 00:31:21,823
without you in my life.

455
00:31:23,123 --> 00:31:25,433
I'm as good as a living corpse.

456
00:31:27,163 --> 00:31:30,563
You know better than anyone what you mean to me.

457
00:31:42,543 --> 00:31:43,543
Please.

458
00:31:55,593 --> 00:31:57,063
If you and Dad...

459
00:31:57,723 --> 00:32:01,393
sincerely apologize to Professor Oh and his family...

460
00:32:01,393 --> 00:32:02,503
and bury the hatchet with them,

461
00:32:03,733 --> 00:32:05,273
I'll come home then.

462
00:32:07,003 --> 00:32:10,143
Does that matter that much to you?

463
00:32:10,703 --> 00:32:11,713
Yes.

464
00:32:13,273 --> 00:32:15,043
Only then will I be able to see you and Dad...

465
00:32:15,043 --> 00:32:16,313
the same way again.

466
00:32:25,093 --> 00:32:26,123
All right.

467
00:32:27,253 --> 00:32:28,893
Give me some time, though.

468
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:41,403
I'm sorry, Mom.

469
00:32:56,023 --> 00:32:57,153
Thanks.

470
00:32:57,953 --> 00:33:00,723
I feel better now that I've talked to my mom.

471
00:33:01,663 --> 00:33:02,723
Good for you.

472
00:33:03,963 --> 00:33:07,263
Your mother looked as though she was about to cry.

473
00:33:08,503 --> 00:33:10,103
Maybe you should head back home.

474
00:33:12,973 --> 00:33:15,143
Once they do as promised,

475
00:33:15,603 --> 00:33:17,243
I'll go home.

476
00:33:19,643 --> 00:33:20,673
What did they promise?

477
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:24,643
You'll find out soon.

478
00:33:31,023 --> 00:33:32,053
Just a second.

479
00:33:33,423 --> 00:33:34,453
Yes, Chairman Han.

480
00:33:34,693 --> 00:33:36,463
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

481
00:33:36,463 --> 00:33:37,463
Yes?

482
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:39,863
- Hello. - Right.

483
00:33:43,003 --> 00:33:44,033
Welcome.

484
00:33:45,303 --> 00:33:46,333
Let's have a seat.

485
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:55,413
I know I caught you off guard last night.

486
00:33:55,813 --> 00:33:57,483
It was surprising, yes.

487
00:33:58,243 --> 00:34:00,983
I spoke to you in person about the outside director position,

488
00:34:00,983 --> 00:34:02,283
so I was more accepting.

489
00:34:02,683 --> 00:34:04,223
But the third brother...

490
00:34:04,653 --> 00:34:06,493
had only met you once,

491
00:34:06,493 --> 00:34:08,253
which is why he took it personally.

492
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:10,263
I guess that's possible.

493
00:34:12,463 --> 00:34:14,333
I'd like to ask you something.

494
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:19,003
Don't you think I'm a suitable match...

495
00:34:19,003 --> 00:34:20,633
for your sister-in-law?

496
00:34:23,403 --> 00:34:26,573
No one would doubt your social status,

497
00:34:27,173 --> 00:34:29,683
but we're not sure if you'll care for her...

498
00:34:29,683 --> 00:34:32,053
as much as we want you to.

499
00:34:33,753 --> 00:34:37,253
Frankly, we don't know what kind of person you are,

500
00:34:37,253 --> 00:34:39,753
so I can't give you a straight answer right now.

501
00:34:41,093 --> 00:34:44,863
You'll give me an answer after getting to know me better?

502
00:34:44,863 --> 00:34:45,893
That's right.

503
00:34:46,263 --> 00:34:49,633
Kwang Sook is no longer just our sister-in-law.

504
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:52,073
She's like our big sister, our big brother,

505
00:34:52,073 --> 00:34:53,503
and even our parent at times.

506
00:34:55,273 --> 00:34:57,573
That's why I think you can't ever be...

507
00:34:57,573 --> 00:34:59,373
too cautious.

508
00:35:01,473 --> 00:35:02,913
This won't be easy, will it?

509
00:35:04,083 --> 00:35:07,553
However, what the brothers think doesn't matter at this point.

510
00:35:07,553 --> 00:35:08,723
We should respect...

511
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:11,383
Kwang Sook's wishes.

512
00:35:12,793 --> 00:35:16,323
I don't know if I should be glad or worried.

513
00:35:29,703 --> 00:35:31,343
Am I your girlfriend?

514
00:35:31,873 --> 00:35:33,073
You're running the shop...

515
00:35:33,813 --> 00:35:35,483
I invested in,

516
00:35:35,483 --> 00:35:36,913
and I was a fan of yours back when you were a dancer.

517
00:35:36,913 --> 00:35:38,143
That's all there is to it.

518
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,383
Correct me if I'm wrong!

519
00:35:46,623 --> 00:35:49,123
I was going to propose to her after I had found my footing,

520
00:35:50,393 --> 00:35:52,033
but it's time to step on the gas.

521
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:55,433
If I don't, some sleaze will take her from me.

522
00:36:09,213 --> 00:36:10,543
I've thought about it,

523
00:36:11,543 --> 00:36:14,213
and you are my girlfriend, Ok Bun.

524
00:36:15,683 --> 00:36:18,183
This is our first day as a couple.

525
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:26,063
It's day one.

526
00:36:37,243 --> 00:36:38,373
Welcome.

527
00:36:47,953 --> 00:36:49,253
What brings you here?

528
00:36:50,653 --> 00:36:52,293
I have something to say,

529
00:36:53,723 --> 00:36:55,223
but I'll wait until you're done.

530
00:36:56,323 --> 00:36:57,723
I'll wait over here.

531
00:36:57,723 --> 00:36:59,533
- Wait. That... - Goodness.

532
00:37:01,163 --> 00:37:02,303
Are those flowers?

533
00:37:03,003 --> 00:37:04,003
Oh, right.

534
00:37:04,963 --> 00:37:06,703
This is also for later.

535
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:11,273
Sure thing. I won't be long.

536
00:37:50,713 --> 00:37:51,813
Wait, who's this?

537
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:54,113
("The lives of animals come before the family name.")

538
00:37:54,113 --> 00:37:55,553
It's the vet.

539
00:37:59,553 --> 00:38:01,223
The doctor who owns the vet...

540
00:38:01,963 --> 00:38:03,993
is the youngest son of Sangjin Group's CEO?

541
00:38:04,993 --> 00:38:07,533
("The lives of animals come before the family name.")

542
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:09,533
- All done. - What?

543
00:38:10,463 --> 00:38:11,633
Do you like it?

544
00:38:11,803 --> 00:38:14,233
Of course. Thanks, Ms. Ji.

545
00:38:15,743 --> 00:38:17,043
Thank you.

546
00:38:17,973 --> 00:38:19,443
Please come again.

547
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,753
What did you want to say?

548
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:36,193
It's nothing.

549
00:38:37,193 --> 00:38:39,063
What do you mean it's nothing?

550
00:38:39,063 --> 00:38:41,193
You had something to say just a second ago.

551
00:38:41,633 --> 00:38:43,333
I did, up until a second ago,

552
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:45,063
but I won't say it.

553
00:38:45,933 --> 00:38:47,003
I'll get going.

554
00:38:47,403 --> 00:38:48,473
- But... - By the way,

555
00:38:49,573 --> 00:38:50,843
these flowers...

556
00:38:51,843 --> 00:38:53,013
Someone had thrown them away.

557
00:38:53,643 --> 00:38:55,073
Do the same if you want.

558
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,143
I'll get going.

559
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,083
But...

560
00:39:01,013 --> 00:39:03,483
Is this a joke or what?

561
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:19,673
Ok Bun could marry into a wealthy family.

562
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:22,043
I shouldn't get in the way of that.

563
00:39:23,873 --> 00:39:26,573
The clunker should know when to clear the road.

564
00:39:34,013 --> 00:39:35,013
Yes, hello.

565
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:37,183
I'm with LX Hotel and called a few days ago...

566
00:39:37,183 --> 00:39:39,253
I was just about to call you myself.

567
00:39:39,693 --> 00:39:41,753
I won't be delivering the sandwiches anymore.

568
00:39:43,523 --> 00:39:44,563
What?

569
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:48,233
He refused to deliver the sandwiches?

570
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:51,563
That's what he told Mr. Kim.

571
00:39:54,373 --> 00:39:56,573
All right. You may leave.

572
00:39:57,343 --> 00:39:58,473
Yes, sir.

573
00:39:59,243 --> 00:40:02,643
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

574
00:40:06,213 --> 00:40:09,683
These brothers aren't messing around, are they?

575
00:40:15,223 --> 00:40:17,563
I know you're busy with your new store,

576
00:40:17,993 --> 00:40:20,693
but I asked to see you to clear up a misunderstanding.

577
00:40:21,993 --> 00:40:24,863
May I ask why you refused to supply...

578
00:40:25,433 --> 00:40:26,733
our sandwich order?

579
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:29,773
A large order like that...

580
00:40:30,273 --> 00:40:32,003
is a great boost to our sales.

581
00:40:33,243 --> 00:40:35,783
But I rejected it because I sensed an ulterior motive.

582
00:40:37,783 --> 00:40:40,983
"Ulterior motive?" What exactly do you mean by that?

583
00:40:42,423 --> 00:40:45,793
I don't want to sell more at the expense of my sister-in-law.

584
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:50,323
I'll ask you point blank.

585
00:40:52,163 --> 00:40:54,863
Do you dislike the idea of Kwang Sook remarrying?

586
00:40:55,063 --> 00:40:56,903
Or is it me you disapprove of?

587
00:41:00,973 --> 00:41:02,003
It's both.

588
00:41:03,073 --> 00:41:04,473
It's both?

589
00:41:05,203 --> 00:41:08,613
I don't like that Kwang Sook's seeing someone...

590
00:41:09,683 --> 00:41:12,283
when Jang Soo hasn't been gone that long.

591
00:41:13,613 --> 00:41:15,313
And I don't like...

592
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:17,953
how you used your wealth to approach us brothers.

593
00:41:18,253 --> 00:41:20,653
I used my wealth to approach you?

594
00:41:20,723 --> 00:41:24,293
Don't you think you jumped too far to reach that conclusion?

595
00:41:24,463 --> 00:41:26,693
I don't know what you'd say about it,

596
00:41:27,263 --> 00:41:28,663
but that's how I felt.

597
00:41:29,303 --> 00:41:32,273
It feels like you're trying to buy our approval.

598
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:35,233
Your intention seems very impure.

599
00:41:36,373 --> 00:41:37,443
"Impure?"

600
00:41:37,673 --> 00:41:40,973
Yes. It feels very foul.

601
00:41:52,891 --> 00:41:54,221
Welcome.

602
00:41:55,661 --> 00:41:58,191
Do you broker sales of business properties too?

603
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:02,001
It's a brewery.

604
00:42:04,431 --> 00:42:05,431
Yes.

605
00:42:10,141 --> 00:42:13,011
It has a license to manufacture traditional alcoholic drinks.

606
00:42:13,371 --> 00:42:16,311
The property includes manufacturing facilities,

607
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:19,181
storage, and office space.

608
00:42:22,021 --> 00:42:23,751
You know Eagle Brewery, right?

609
00:42:24,991 --> 00:42:26,451
The transaction's complete.

610
00:42:27,351 --> 00:42:28,561
That's right.

611
00:42:30,261 --> 00:42:31,491
The trademark?

612
00:42:32,891 --> 00:42:35,631
I'll ask my husband about that.

613
00:42:38,171 --> 00:42:39,971
Okay. Call me back soon.

614
00:42:41,801 --> 00:42:42,941
Just a moment.

615
00:42:50,241 --> 00:42:51,351
Here you go.

616
00:42:52,081 --> 00:42:54,721
Goodness. I left these here?

617
00:42:55,021 --> 00:42:57,181
I looked for them everywhere.

618
00:42:59,191 --> 00:43:01,191
You must have a good eye.

619
00:43:01,921 --> 00:43:02,961
What?

620
00:43:03,521 --> 00:43:05,931
I was here just once before.

621
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:07,531
How did you remember me?

622
00:43:09,061 --> 00:43:10,761
You left a strong impression.

623
00:43:13,101 --> 00:43:15,041
Thanks anyway.

624
00:43:24,411 --> 00:43:26,551
She's trying to put the brewery...

625
00:43:27,211 --> 00:43:29,151
up for sale without telling anyone.

626
00:43:35,591 --> 00:43:37,491
Hello, Eagle Brewery.

627
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,531
A real estate agent?

628
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:43,201
Why would you call...

629
00:43:46,031 --> 00:43:49,441
No, we never put the brewery up for sale.

630
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:52,371
We didn't.

631
00:43:54,741 --> 00:43:55,841
Okay.

632
00:44:06,591 --> 00:44:08,321
Is Chun Soo out?

633
00:44:08,821 --> 00:44:09,821
Did you...

634
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:13,831
put the brewery up for sale?

635
00:44:14,531 --> 00:44:15,561
Yes.

636
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,461
You should sort things out...

637
00:44:17,461 --> 00:44:19,671
before you remarry and leave the family.

638
00:44:22,241 --> 00:44:24,841
You seem to have things very wrong.

639
00:44:25,241 --> 00:44:27,911
I have no plans to "sort out" the brewery.

640
00:44:29,611 --> 00:44:30,681
Then what?

641
00:44:31,651 --> 00:44:34,111
You're going to marry a hotel chairman...

642
00:44:34,111 --> 00:44:35,921
and keep the brewery too?

643
00:44:35,981 --> 00:44:37,521
What are you talking about?

644
00:44:38,091 --> 00:44:40,321
Whatever happens, I will...

645
00:44:40,321 --> 00:44:42,491
keep the brewery up and running.

646
00:44:44,061 --> 00:44:46,531
Don't you think you're being a bit too greedy?

647
00:44:47,331 --> 00:44:49,031
You'll become a rich man's wife.

648
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:51,771
Will you turn your back on your struggling brothers-in-law...

649
00:44:51,771 --> 00:44:54,941
to scrape together every cent and leave with it?

650
00:44:55,001 --> 00:44:56,901
Who said I was leaving?

651
00:44:56,901 --> 00:44:58,211
The brewery...

652
00:44:58,641 --> 00:45:01,741
belonged to the Oh family for generations.

653
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:04,441
I still can't believe...

654
00:45:04,441 --> 00:45:07,311
someone completely unrelated took ownership from the family.

655
00:45:07,781 --> 00:45:09,521
Now, you want to take...

656
00:45:09,521 --> 00:45:11,551
the family business and marry a rich man...

657
00:45:11,851 --> 00:45:14,051
when you're no longer a member of the Oh clan?

658
00:45:15,661 --> 00:45:19,231
I'm not the one who no longer belongs to the Oh clan.

659
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:21,731
It's you.

660
00:45:22,131 --> 00:45:25,301
You shouldn't be so involved in another family's business.

661
00:45:25,871 --> 00:45:27,231
I made it very clear.

662
00:45:28,031 --> 00:45:30,871
Legally, I'm still Chun Soo's wife.

663
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:34,111
And I'm the mother of Yeoung Ju,

664
00:45:34,441 --> 00:45:36,541
who holds the Oh family name.

665
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:41,011
That means nothing...

666
00:45:41,881 --> 00:45:43,981
because the brewery...

667
00:45:44,581 --> 00:45:46,421
is in my name.

668
00:45:46,751 --> 00:45:49,991
Don't even think you have a claim to anything.

669
00:45:51,361 --> 00:45:53,991
The brewery is not...

670
00:45:54,291 --> 00:45:55,461
up for sale.

671
00:45:57,261 --> 00:46:00,301
You want to turn your life around with another marriage.

672
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:03,941
You took the brewery from your husband.

673
00:46:04,441 --> 00:46:05,911
Will you take...

674
00:46:06,671 --> 00:46:09,041
the chairman's hotel next?

675
00:46:13,051 --> 00:46:14,211
How dare you?

676
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,181
Watch what you say.

677
00:46:17,321 --> 00:46:18,851
We'll see...

678
00:46:20,091 --> 00:46:21,221
if you get your way.

679
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:30,701
If I see you near the brewery again,

680
00:46:31,001 --> 00:46:34,571
I'll report you for trespassing!

681
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,971
Kwang Sook!

682
00:46:42,511 --> 00:46:43,541
What happened?

683
00:46:44,411 --> 00:46:45,981
Wake up.

684
00:46:46,511 --> 00:46:48,481
You might die at this rate.

685
00:46:48,521 --> 00:46:51,321
I'll take you to the hospital. This is not good.

686
00:46:51,451 --> 00:46:52,551
I'm fine.

687
00:46:52,551 --> 00:46:54,151
Do as I say!

688
00:46:54,151 --> 00:46:56,091
Get up. Come on!

689
00:47:06,931 --> 00:47:08,001
Hello.

690
00:47:08,241 --> 00:47:10,601
I came to check on the store and buy a gift.

691
00:47:11,301 --> 00:47:13,111
Something for your boyfriend?

692
00:47:13,611 --> 00:47:16,841
No. My father has plans to play a round of golf,

693
00:47:16,841 --> 00:47:18,481
and I want to get him something.

694
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:25,591
How about these?

695
00:47:25,751 --> 00:47:28,221
The air moves through easily and cools the heat right down.

696
00:47:28,361 --> 00:47:29,661
It's a nice, casual look.

697
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:32,631
I like it.

698
00:47:33,761 --> 00:47:35,731
He might need a cap too.

699
00:47:36,301 --> 00:47:37,601
How about this?

700
00:47:38,371 --> 00:47:40,031
It'll go well with the shirt.

701
00:47:40,101 --> 00:47:41,201
Pack them both for me.

702
00:47:42,271 --> 00:47:44,241
Your father will be so pleased.

703
00:47:47,411 --> 00:47:48,441
Kang Soo.

704
00:47:48,641 --> 00:47:50,081
I'm off to the head office...

705
00:47:50,081 --> 00:47:51,681
to discuss details of the golf outing.

706
00:47:52,081 --> 00:47:53,881
- Sure. I'll see you later. - Bye.

707
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:01,761
I'm well aware that the brewery...

708
00:48:02,061 --> 00:48:03,921
and all her brothers-in-law...

709
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:07,631
must settle down for Kwang Sook to be happy.

710
00:48:08,131 --> 00:48:10,631
I won't rush anyone to satisfy my needs.

711
00:48:11,831 --> 00:48:15,601
So please, could you brothers-in-law watch how we do?

712
00:48:19,311 --> 00:48:20,471
I'm back.

713
00:48:21,371 --> 00:48:22,411
Hi.

714
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:24,111
Where is everyone?

715
00:48:24,681 --> 00:48:26,181
The manager went to the head office.

716
00:48:26,281 --> 00:48:28,981
The others are at the country club to prepare for the VIP outing.

717
00:48:30,681 --> 00:48:32,321
Did you check on a few stores?

718
00:48:32,521 --> 00:48:34,921
Yes. I got a golfing outfit for my dad too.

719
00:48:38,121 --> 00:48:40,891
Did you know about it too, Bom?

720
00:48:41,231 --> 00:48:42,231
Know what?

721
00:48:42,531 --> 00:48:45,571
That your father is dating my sister-in-law.

722
00:48:46,331 --> 00:48:47,371
What?

723
00:48:47,531 --> 00:48:49,371
The woman my dad is dating...

724
00:48:49,371 --> 00:48:51,001
is your sister-in-law?

725
00:48:56,441 --> 00:48:57,511
(Bongyoung Clinic)

726
00:48:57,511 --> 00:48:58,881
You're in this state...

727
00:48:59,551 --> 00:49:00,851
because of your brothers-in-law.

728
00:49:01,281 --> 00:49:03,181
I'll make them pay for this!

729
00:49:03,821 --> 00:49:06,451
Why is this their fault?

730
00:49:06,451 --> 00:49:07,551
You still can't stand...

731
00:49:08,391 --> 00:49:10,821
listening to me blame them?

732
00:49:11,021 --> 00:49:12,491
Will you stop that, Mom?

733
00:49:12,691 --> 00:49:15,701
You were married only for ten days.

734
00:49:16,101 --> 00:49:19,631
So, you should never say that you can't do this...

735
00:49:20,031 --> 00:49:21,671
to your late husband...

736
00:49:21,871 --> 00:49:23,771
or that you feel bad for your brothers-in-law.

737
00:49:24,071 --> 00:49:26,341
Don't even have such foolish thoughts.

738
00:49:27,611 --> 00:49:28,711
But still,

739
00:49:29,641 --> 00:49:32,951
I don't want to make my brothers-in-law upset.

740
00:49:33,251 --> 00:49:35,721
Did you not hear what your mom just said?

741
00:49:36,281 --> 00:49:39,221
Mom, why are you hitting me when I'm sick?

742
00:49:39,221 --> 00:49:41,691
It's them who have no shame if they are upset.

743
00:49:42,421 --> 00:49:45,461
No one can blame you.

744
00:49:46,631 --> 00:49:47,831
So,

745
00:49:49,101 --> 00:49:51,561
when there's someone who loves and cares about you,

746
00:49:52,371 --> 00:49:55,271
go your way without looking back.

747
00:49:55,941 --> 00:49:58,911
Even if you sacrifice yourself, no one will appreciate it.

748
00:50:00,671 --> 00:50:01,671
(LX Hotel Chairman Han Dong Seok)

749
00:50:07,011 --> 00:50:08,281
Hello, Chairman Han.

750
00:50:09,821 --> 00:50:11,381
This is Kwang Sook's mom.

751
00:50:12,021 --> 00:50:14,251
Kwang Sook is in the hospital now.

752
00:50:14,921 --> 00:50:15,961
Mom!

753
00:50:15,961 --> 00:50:18,221
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

754
00:50:18,221 --> 00:50:19,631
Hospital?

755
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:21,391
What's wrong?

756
00:50:21,531 --> 00:50:22,661
She was...

757
00:50:23,331 --> 00:50:25,401
stressed out because of her brothers-in-law,

758
00:50:25,871 --> 00:50:26,871
so she collapsed.

759
00:50:26,871 --> 00:50:29,001
It's not because of my brothers-in-law!

760
00:50:30,241 --> 00:50:31,771
Which hospital is it?

761
00:50:34,711 --> 00:50:35,981
I'm home.

762
00:50:38,181 --> 00:50:39,551
Heung Soo, you're home.

763
00:50:40,351 --> 00:50:41,611
Why is the house empty?

764
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:44,221
Aren't Ms. Gong and Kwang Sook home?

765
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:45,951
Kwang Sook is in the hospital.

766
00:50:46,491 --> 00:50:47,491
Why?

767
00:50:47,491 --> 00:50:49,961
It's nothing serious. She was feeling faint,

768
00:50:49,961 --> 00:50:52,331
so Ms. Gong took her to a doctor for an IV drip.

769
00:50:54,391 --> 00:50:57,131
Was she stressed out because of me?

770
00:50:57,901 --> 00:50:59,071
So you know.

771
00:51:00,901 --> 00:51:02,101
Which hospital is it?

772
00:51:13,151 --> 00:51:15,951
I was going to leave after getting the IV.

773
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:17,351
Why did you come?

774
00:51:17,881 --> 00:51:19,591
I came because I was worried.

775
00:51:19,591 --> 00:51:21,791
Do you have any other problems?

776
00:51:22,061 --> 00:51:23,121
I'm fine.

777
00:51:23,691 --> 00:51:27,291
I just came because Mom kept nagging me.

778
00:51:27,591 --> 00:51:28,661
Where's Mother?

779
00:51:29,861 --> 00:51:32,431
Something came up at work, so she went there.

780
00:51:42,241 --> 00:51:45,411
Please take good care of yourself.

781
00:51:45,411 --> 00:51:47,311
Stop surprising me.

782
00:51:50,581 --> 00:51:51,951
When I heard you were in the hospital,

783
00:51:52,221 --> 00:51:55,291
I thought you were badly hurt and worried about you a lot.

784
00:51:57,691 --> 00:52:00,961
Please don't get sick, at least for my sake.

785
00:52:03,401 --> 00:52:05,601
Okay, I won't.

786
00:52:08,131 --> 00:52:09,171
Kwang Sook.

787
00:52:10,371 --> 00:52:11,371
My gosh.

788
00:52:11,871 --> 00:52:12,871
Well...

789
00:52:13,271 --> 00:52:15,411
Hi, Heung Soo.

790
00:52:16,281 --> 00:52:17,281
You're here.

791
00:52:18,081 --> 00:52:19,951
I came because I was worried about Kwang Sook,

792
00:52:20,781 --> 00:52:22,881
but you got here before me, Mr. Han.

793
00:52:23,381 --> 00:52:25,921
Well... I got a call a little while ago,

794
00:52:25,921 --> 00:52:27,651
so I rushed over here.

795
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:32,361
When something happens to Kwang Sook,

796
00:52:33,391 --> 00:52:36,531
she has someone to come running even before me and my brothers.

797
00:52:38,631 --> 00:52:40,431
I'll get going, then.

798
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:49,711
What do I do?

799
00:52:51,681 --> 00:52:53,081
It's not like he's a little kid.

800
00:52:57,121 --> 00:52:58,151
Kwang Sook.

801
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:03,421
You've been dearly loved by your brothers-in-law.

802
00:53:15,371 --> 00:53:17,341
I met Se Ri earlier today.

803
00:53:19,641 --> 00:53:21,511
Beom Soo came with her.

804
00:53:26,581 --> 00:53:29,681
Se Ri says she will come home...

805
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:32,721
if we apologize to the family...

806
00:53:32,721 --> 00:53:33,951
of Eagle Brewery...

807
00:53:34,191 --> 00:53:35,621
and bury the hatchet with them.

808
00:53:35,961 --> 00:53:38,491
What nonsense is that?

809
00:53:39,131 --> 00:53:41,931
What did I do wrong that I should apologize to them?

810
00:53:41,931 --> 00:53:45,231
Denying what we did won't make it go away.

811
00:53:45,901 --> 00:53:47,201
Let's take this opportunity...

812
00:53:47,201 --> 00:53:50,041
to deal with our past and move on. Okay, honey?

813
00:53:50,941 --> 00:53:52,141
Stop being ridiculous.

814
00:53:53,441 --> 00:53:55,041
Honey...

815
00:54:04,721 --> 00:54:05,721
My goodness.

816
00:54:06,091 --> 00:54:07,951
Deal with the past and move on?

817
00:54:08,721 --> 00:54:10,761
That's what I'm supposed to say.

818
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:26,971
What?

819
00:54:28,471 --> 00:54:29,581
Professor.

820
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:34,751
I'll stay here with you until you're done.

821
00:54:36,521 --> 00:54:40,491
I still have two hours left until I get off work.

822
00:54:41,491 --> 00:54:43,091
I'll be reading this, so it's okay.

823
00:54:43,691 --> 00:54:44,791
Where's Ha Ni?

824
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:46,261
I put her to bed.

825
00:54:46,261 --> 00:54:47,661
If she wakes up, her uncles will take care of her.

826
00:54:49,831 --> 00:54:50,861
Get back to work.

827
00:55:12,491 --> 00:55:15,721
Then I'll read sitting next to you.

828
00:55:16,361 --> 00:55:17,391
A book of poems?

829
00:55:18,021 --> 00:55:19,591
It's Mi Sun's book.

830
00:55:57,531 --> 00:55:58,631
Why are you staring at me?

831
00:55:59,301 --> 00:56:00,701
Is something on my face?

832
00:56:02,371 --> 00:56:03,371
Where?

833
00:56:04,801 --> 00:56:05,811
Here?

834
00:56:09,141 --> 00:56:10,281
And here.

835
00:56:10,541 --> 00:56:11,781
What is it?

836
00:56:12,511 --> 00:56:13,511
What?

837
00:56:14,451 --> 00:56:15,481
Something.

838
00:56:15,651 --> 00:56:16,651
Something?

839
00:56:18,181 --> 00:56:19,591
A handsome thing.

840
00:56:24,691 --> 00:56:26,661
Why are you teasing me?

841
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:46,251
Don't think about anything tonight. Just sleep well.

842
00:56:47,711 --> 00:56:48,921
Drive home safely.

843
00:56:49,651 --> 00:56:51,551
I'll leave after you go in.

844
00:56:51,551 --> 00:56:52,591
Go ahead.

845
00:56:53,991 --> 00:56:55,661
You should go first.

846
00:56:55,661 --> 00:56:58,161
You're a patient today, so you should go first.

847
00:57:00,661 --> 00:57:01,831
All right.

848
00:57:02,231 --> 00:57:04,701
I'm going in, then.

849
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:30,461
Hello, sir.

850
00:57:32,761 --> 00:57:35,031
You're home late.

851
00:57:35,701 --> 00:57:36,701
Yes.

852
00:57:37,701 --> 00:57:39,401
Did you just meet Kwang Sook?

853
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:42,541
Yes.

854
00:57:46,911 --> 00:57:48,371
Can I ask you a favor?

855
00:57:49,141 --> 00:57:50,181
What is it?

856
00:57:51,111 --> 00:57:52,711
Since we met...

857
00:57:52,711 --> 00:57:55,311
before I met your brothers,

858
00:57:56,151 --> 00:57:58,681
I'd like you to understand how I feel and help me.

859
00:58:02,821 --> 00:58:05,631
Before that, may I ask you a few questions?

860
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:10,631
When did you start developing feelings for Kwang Sook?

861
00:58:14,531 --> 00:58:15,601
I don't know.

862
00:58:17,671 --> 00:58:18,771
At first,

863
00:58:19,471 --> 00:58:20,741
there were misunderstandings,

864
00:58:21,341 --> 00:58:22,911
so I didn't like her.

865
00:58:24,211 --> 00:58:25,711
But as we worked together,

866
00:58:26,551 --> 00:58:29,551
I gradually began to see good things about her.

867
00:58:31,421 --> 00:58:33,291
So, I can't say exactly when it started,

868
00:58:34,391 --> 00:58:35,491
but it's been quite a while.

869
00:58:37,291 --> 00:58:40,431
Then, are you sure you can take care of her...

870
00:58:40,431 --> 00:58:42,801
with a sense of responsibility?

871
00:58:45,971 --> 00:58:48,801
How would I like someone without such feelings...

872
00:58:49,341 --> 00:58:50,601
at my age?

873
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:57,281
What do you like about Kwang Sook so much?

874
00:59:10,861 --> 00:59:12,121
Her brothers-in-law...

875
00:59:13,031 --> 00:59:14,691
are no joke.

876
00:59:16,301 --> 00:59:17,901
I need to bring my A game.

877
00:59:18,501 --> 00:59:19,571
Goodness.

878
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:29,281
(Pot Number 12)

879
00:59:34,581 --> 00:59:35,581
Hello?

880
00:59:35,881 --> 00:59:38,721
Hey, I just got home.

881
00:59:38,921 --> 00:59:40,191
How are you feeling?

882
00:59:40,891 --> 00:59:43,221
I'm feeling much better, so don't worry.

883
00:59:44,561 --> 00:59:46,261
What were you up to?

884
00:59:47,161 --> 00:59:48,191
Oh, that.

885
00:59:48,291 --> 00:59:50,831
I was checking the fermentation of the makgeolli.

886
00:59:52,201 --> 00:59:54,371
You just got back on your feet.

887
00:59:54,371 --> 00:59:56,071
You shouldn't be back at work so soon.

888
00:59:56,071 --> 00:59:57,741
You're not doing yourself any favors.

889
00:59:58,201 --> 00:59:59,811
Head home and rest, right now.

890
00:59:59,841 --> 01:00:02,941
It's all right. This is only routine for me.

891
01:00:03,741 --> 01:00:05,641
I have to get back to work, so I'll hang up.

892
01:00:09,081 --> 01:00:12,351
Is she haunted by a ghost who died a workaholic?

893
01:00:13,391 --> 01:00:15,521
That's just wrong.

894
01:00:18,561 --> 01:00:20,331
Unbelievable.

895
01:00:24,361 --> 01:00:25,801
I looked into it,

896
01:00:26,601 --> 01:00:28,931
and many traditional breweries in rural areas...

897
01:00:28,931 --> 01:00:30,601
have shut down.

898
01:00:31,201 --> 01:00:33,141
The expertise and craftsmanship...

899
01:00:33,141 --> 01:00:35,171
of the masters who once worked there are being wasted.

900
01:00:35,641 --> 01:00:38,241
Maybe you could hire some of them.

901
01:00:39,411 --> 01:00:40,411
Sorry?

902
01:00:40,481 --> 01:00:42,381
There's the yakju you're exporting,

903
01:00:42,621 --> 01:00:44,581
and you'll need the extra hands...

904
01:00:44,581 --> 01:00:46,621
once people start ordering more makgeolli.

905
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,821
Shouldn't you be prepared?

906
01:00:50,661 --> 01:00:53,731
It kills me to see you doing all the work.

907
01:00:54,761 --> 01:00:56,061
The technical aspects...

908
01:00:56,061 --> 01:00:58,861
are being taken care of by the brewery manager and Kim.

909
01:00:59,271 --> 01:01:00,971
We're good for now.

910
01:01:01,631 --> 01:01:03,501
What I'm suggesting...

911
01:01:04,071 --> 01:01:06,841
is that you should let the experts take over the brewery...

912
01:01:07,941 --> 01:01:10,581
and take some time off.

913
01:01:11,941 --> 01:01:13,351
Take time off?

914
01:01:13,411 --> 01:01:14,451
Yes.

915
01:01:14,751 --> 01:01:17,351
Don't you think it'd be better to rest...

916
01:01:17,551 --> 01:01:19,621
while others manage the brewery?

917
01:01:21,291 --> 01:01:23,591
Chairman Han, don't you think...

918
01:01:23,891 --> 01:01:25,761
you're overstepping?

919
01:01:27,791 --> 01:01:30,561
How am I overstepping when I'm only concerned...

920
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:32,161
about your health?

921
01:01:34,371 --> 01:01:35,731
You should know...

922
01:01:36,501 --> 01:01:37,901
that I won't ever...

923
01:01:38,171 --> 01:01:40,611
stop working at the brewery.

924
01:01:42,611 --> 01:01:43,681
Also,

925
01:01:44,441 --> 01:01:48,111
I don't want anyone interfering or meddling in my work.

926
01:01:48,451 --> 01:01:50,621
You have Chun Soo as the vice-CEO,

927
01:01:50,951 --> 01:01:54,391
so why are you adamant about running the brewery yourself?

928
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:56,361
Are you trying to torture yourself?

929
01:01:56,861 --> 01:01:58,261
Torture myself?

930
01:01:59,761 --> 01:02:02,601
Don't you think that's a bit harsh?

931
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:05,001
I'm only asking because I don't understand...

932
01:02:05,001 --> 01:02:07,271
why you're taking on all the responsibilities...

933
01:02:07,271 --> 01:02:09,031
at the risk of your health.

934
01:02:09,401 --> 01:02:13,141
Is this some kind of hero fantasy?

935
01:02:14,571 --> 01:02:16,411
- What did you just say? - Also,

936
01:02:16,981 --> 01:02:18,611
it's not normal...

937
01:02:18,881 --> 01:02:22,081
to live under the same roof as your brothers-in-law.

938
01:02:22,211 --> 01:02:25,891
Hold on. Are you calling me weird or something?

939
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:27,491
Like I mentioned before,

940
01:02:27,891 --> 01:02:30,321
it's tough to date someone new when you're living...

941
01:02:30,321 --> 01:02:31,691
with your in-laws.

942
01:02:32,021 --> 01:02:35,391
Is this your way of saying I should move out of the house?

943
01:02:37,661 --> 01:02:41,371
I have no intention of finding my own happiness...

944
01:02:41,371 --> 01:02:43,571
at the expense of hurting my brothers-in-law.

945
01:02:44,101 --> 01:02:45,641
The way I see it is...

946
01:02:46,241 --> 01:02:47,241
My gosh.

947
01:02:48,171 --> 01:02:50,411
Before you realized what was happening,

948
01:02:50,411 --> 01:02:52,141
you let yourself be crushed under the weight...

949
01:02:52,141 --> 01:02:53,781
of all these responsibilities.

950
01:02:54,281 --> 01:02:56,181
That's also an illness, you know.

951
01:02:56,651 --> 01:02:57,681
Are you now saying...

952
01:02:58,351 --> 01:03:00,221
there's something wrong with me?

953
01:03:48,731 --> 01:03:51,241
(For Eagle Brothers)

954
01:03:51,401 --> 01:03:53,211
It's not like I'm one of his employees.

955
01:03:53,341 --> 01:03:55,171
Who does he think he is, bossing me around?

956
01:03:55,371 --> 01:03:57,241
Kwang Sook's a bit stubborn, isn't she?

957
01:03:57,441 --> 01:04:00,451
That's an understatement. She's extremely stubborn.

958
01:04:00,481 --> 01:04:01,981
Because I was worried about your health,

959
01:04:01,981 --> 01:04:03,381
I suggested you take a break...

960
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,221
while letting others run things.

961
01:04:05,251 --> 01:04:06,691
How was I wrong to say that?

962
01:04:06,791 --> 01:04:08,621
I already made myself clear.

963
01:04:08,651 --> 01:04:11,191
I won't stop working at the brewery!

964
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:13,931
Honey, why did you marry me?

965
01:04:14,061 --> 01:04:17,061
Even though you were broke, you always talked a big game.

966
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:18,761
I felt like I could rely on you.
