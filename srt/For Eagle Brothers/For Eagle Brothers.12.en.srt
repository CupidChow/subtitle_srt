00:00:01,370 --> 00:00:03,440
(Episode 12)

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,580
I want a divorce.

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,150
Let's get divorced.

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,020
We should.

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,420
What?

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,390
We should do what?

7
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,700
We've been separated for too long.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,430
You seem like a stranger to me now.

9
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,300
So that Yeoung Ju could receive
a fine education,

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,700
you chose...

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,270
this life for yourself.

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,710
Yes, this was my choice.

13
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,650
I chose this life...

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,020
because I thought being apart
would make me appreciate you more.

15
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,150
But life without you
has been surprisingly peaceful.

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,890
You were a workaholic,

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,320
and I didn't have to spend
my nights...

18
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,530
wondering when you'd be home.

19
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,800
I didn't have to be annoyed...

20
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,830
by you always being the good guy...

21
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,530
who went the extra mile
for those he knew.

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,570
I didn't have to step in
for your late parents...

23
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,310
and take on the responsibility
as the eldest sister-in-law.

24
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,540
It has been nice and easy to live
for just me and Yeoung Ju.

25
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,550
You.

26
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,920
Did you come to Korea
just to tell me this?

27
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,180
That and other things.

28
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,090
I came back to divide our assets...

29
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,560
and figure out a way...

30
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,720
to live my life with Yeoung Ju
after we separate.

31
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,860
Sell the brewery
and give me what I'm entitled to.

32
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,700
How many times must I tell you this?

33
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,200
Creditors almost took the brewery,

34
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,970
but my sister-in-law protected it
with the money she poured into it.

35
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,940
You must not even know
that its land value skyrocketed.

36
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,110
Have you been looking into that?

37
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:46,680
You wouldn't, so I did.

38
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,280
How could you let her have...

39
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,680
what had been in your family
for generations?

40
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,720
You're one to talk
when you've never cared...

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,690
about your in-laws.

42
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,990
Don't be sarcastic.

43
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,330
I'm only asking for
what is rightfully mine.

44
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,990
As if you have a share
in that brewery.

45
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,560
You never even once stirred
one of its pots.

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,830
Don't be emotional about this
and think rationally.

47
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,340
In the US,
divorce is approached logically...

48
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,170
as a business transaction.

49
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,640
I believe that to be right.

50
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,140
Drinking American water
made you shameless.

51
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,840
Is divorce a joke to you?

52
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,880
Who said you could get a divorce?

53
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,910
Getting worked up about it
won't change anything.

54
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,690
Let's think about this calmly.

55
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,150
I gritted my teeth
through the hard times,

56
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,560
thinking of you and Yeoung Ju.

57
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,260
But all I get in return
is a divorce?

58
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,290
You weren't the only one
who had it rough.

59
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,160
I had to raise Yeoung Ju
in a country...

60
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,570
that spoke a foreign language.

61
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,530
I had it as rough as you too.

62
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,970
You only think about
what you had to go through.

63
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,380
I did my best.

64
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,950
I don't deserve
to hear you speak to me like this.

65
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,160
(Jinchon Train Station)

66
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,710
The humiliation. What a disgrace.

67
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,250
Oh, dear. I also have
Dr. Hwang's reputation to consider.

68
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:05,080
What do I do?

69
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:11,620
Mom, are you asleep?

70
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,170
I know you're not sleeping,

71
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,370
so get up already.

72
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,340
Shoot.

73
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,050
You are one strong woman.

74
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,650
What now?

75
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,820
You've been
criticizing me all day...

76
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:40,150
and it's ringing in my ears
like tinnitus.

77
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,190
Are you proud of what you did, then?

78
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,450
I never said that.

79
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,360
My attempt to help you...

80
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,260
backfired badly
despite my good intentions.

81
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,030
Anyhow,

82
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,860
your father is never of any help.

83
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,670
Why did it have
to be a fake porcelain jar...

84
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,470
that he got from a debtor
instead of money?

85
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,940
What are you blaming him for?

86
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,940
You're in the wrong...

87
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,840
for taking it to the chairman
without checking with me first.

88
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,570
Fine! I got carried away. So what?

89
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,740
Should I get on my knees
and beg for his forgiveness?

90
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:09,480
Don't you dare make it worse.

91
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,180
Stay away from that hotel!

92
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,090
That's the last time
I'm going to try and help you.

93
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,800
Why don't I ask Dr. Hwang
to meet Chairman Han...

94
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,570
and put in a good word for us?

95
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,170
You're going overboard again!

96
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,500
What then?

97
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,910
What else?

98
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,840
What can we do about spilled milk?

99
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,340
The chairman
won't be fond of you anymore.

100
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,980
Whatever.

101
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,180
I was never on his good side anyway.

102
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,250
Could this lead to him...

103
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,750
canceling our supply contract
with the hotel?

104
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,060
I doubt he's someone...

105
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,960
that petty or ill-mannered.

106
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,560
He'll probably be generous...

107
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,330
and forgive us
for something like that.

108
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,330
Right?

109
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,570
I doubt he's someone...

110
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,270
that...

111
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,010
understanding.

112
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,350
Did you two make up?

113
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,550
A mother-daughter quarrel
is never too serious.

114
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:27,460
You just got here,

115
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,960
and I made you uncomfortable
with all the yelling.

116
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,830
Sorry about that.

117
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,100
No, it's all right.

118
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,440
It's normal for me and my mom
to be this loud.

119
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,070
There's nothing to it,
so don't worry.

120
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,940
How are you feeling?

121
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,840
I'm good.

122
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,380
You'll feel much better
once you're out of that cast.

123
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,850
Since we're on the subject,

124
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:53,420
how about you drink a bowl
of ox knee soup?

125
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,850
Gosh, no. I'm all right.

126
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,490
Good night, Kwang Sook.

127
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,530
Good night, Kang Soo.

128
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,960
I'll heat it up just in case.

129
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,470
I'm home.

130
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,770
You've been
coming home late these days.

131
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:12,970
Why are you staying out so late?

132
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,970
I'm busy with the final touches
to my graduation project.

133
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,840
Considering what happened to you,

134
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,950
shouldn't you have
a bodyguard following you?

135
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,850
I'm not a celebrity.
Why would I need a bodyguard?

136
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,720
I'll come home earlier from now on.

137
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,220
I mean it.

138
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,920
I'll work during the day,

139
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,660
so don't worry about me
and go to bed.

140
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,760
If you don't keep your promise,
I'll get you a bodyguard right away.

141
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,470
Don't go back on your word.

142
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,300
Okay.

143
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,940
Oh, dear.

144
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,380
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

145
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,300
What now?

146
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:48,430
But this jar means everything to me.

147
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,870
It's a black and white porcelain jar
from the Joseon Dynasty!

148
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,010
A black and white
porcelain jar, my foot.

149
00:08:57,510 --> 00:08:58,610
My goodness.

150
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,790
Gosh, how unsettling.

151
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,900
What if he thinks
Mom and I are frauds?

152
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,740
Be bold, Ma Kwang Sook.

153
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,610
It's not the first time
I've messed up with Chairman Han.

154
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,740
I didn't make a good impression
on him to begin with.

155
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:34,980
I don't have to worry about it.

156
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,550
(Heung Soo)

157
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,760
Hello, Heung Soo.

158
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,090
Did I wake you up?

159
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,890
No.

160
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,830
Did something good happen?

161
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,700
You sound so happy.

162
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,600
My gosh,
you recognized it right away?

163
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,010
Kwang Sook, you might get
a new sister-in-law soon.

164
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,510
My goodness. Are you seeing someone?

165
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,680
I'm planning to propose tomorrow.

166
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,380
That's amazing.

167
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,520
Am I finally getting
a younger sister-in-law?

168
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,790
I wonder what she is like.

169
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,800
She's nice, kind, and innocent.

170
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,770
Anyway, she's someone
you don't see often these days.

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,770
It sounds like you're so into her.

172
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,910
I hope I can meet her soon.

173
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,810
Do you have time tomorrow?

174
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,040
I'll introduce her to you
right away.

175
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,280
Tomorrow?

176
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,720
(Her mom? Her daughter?)

177
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,320
(The old lady, Eunseo)

178
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,680
Do you live in this neighborhood?

179
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,820
My daughter works here.

180
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,220
My mom isn't interested in me.

181
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,460
Eun Seo,

182
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,830
stop talking to her.

183
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,660
You don't want to bother her
at work.

184
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,500
I can't even call her Mom...

185
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,800
when people are around.

186
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,100
My mom likes the piano
more than she likes me.

187
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,410
I'm pretty sure she's her daughter,

188
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,250
but I don't have any evidence,
which drives me crazy.

189
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,450
(Mr. Heung Soo, handsome,
low standards for women)

190
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,250
(Ms. Kim, two-faced,
hiding a big secret?)

191
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,790
I'm sure my guess is right.

192
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,670
It can never happen,
not on my watch.

193
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,840
I have to stop this relationship
no matter what.

194
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:47,910
Hello?

195
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,170
Chun Soo,
are you ready to go to the US?

196
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,510
I was going to go,

197
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,750
but my wife came here today.

198
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,480
Is your wife in Seoul?

199
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,480
Let me talk to her.
I want to say hi.

200
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,150
Well...

201
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,420
She's not with me now.

202
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,620
Where is she now?

203
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,190
She's staying with her brother.

204
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,760
She wants a divorce.

205
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,760
What?

206
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,990
The woman was married
for just ten days,

207
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,720
and she took over the brewery...

208
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,260
that had been in his family
for generations.

209
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,190
Does that make any sense?

210
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,370
I'm here.

211
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,710
Hi, you're here.

212
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,910
I think a customer left this behind.

213
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,410
- Keep it safe.
- Okay.

214
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,950
Did we have
a lot of customers today?

215
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,680
Is it because the weather is chilly?
It's been quiet all day.

216
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,350
Eat something warm while you work.

217
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,820
Okay. You should go.

218
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,670
(Oh Chun Soo)

219
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,870
Did you arrive safely in the US?

220
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,770
I was just worried.

221
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,510
(Did you arrive safely in the US?
I was just worried.)

222
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,430
Go.

223
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,190
Drive safely.

224
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,500
(Eagle Brewery)

225
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,860
- Let's have breakfast.
- Oh, right.

226
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,070
You didn't have breakfast, did you?

227
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:56,370
Let's go and eat.

228
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,530
I'm okay.

229
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,040
I'll just have some hangover soup
on my way.

230
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,610
You eat hangover soup every morning.
Aren't you tired of it?

231
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:05,910
Let's eat at Ms. Ma's place.

232
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,540
You go and eat.

233
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,350
I don't want to.

234
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,620
This is about Ms. Ma's mother,
right?

235
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,820
I don't know why,

236
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,690
but whenever I meet her,
we end up fighting.

237
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,530
They keep fighting like crazy.

238
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,200
Please don't be like that
and come with us.

239
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:32,000
Ms. Ma made some ox knee soup,
and it's really good.

240
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:35,840
Ox knee soup?

241
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,460
I prefer soup to meat.

242
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,100
You'll have to go around
making deliveries all day,

243
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,400
so you should take good care
of your knee joints.

244
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,300
Eat it.

245
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,970
I've been eating this every day.

246
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:11,380
Change it with mine.

247
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,350
Ox knees are good
for healing broken bones.

248
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,280
You have to eat ox knee soup...

249
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,280
for every meal and even as a snack.

250
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,790
What are you doing?
Just eat what you're given!

251
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,650
The soup is so rich.

252
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,820
I enjoyed drinking it.

253
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,030
What are you waiting for?
Enjoy your food.

254
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,960
The soup is so rich.

255
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,080
We called a meeting to discuss
the Traditional Liquor Festival...

256
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,980
with the North American Diplomatic
Mission to be held next month.

257
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,850
How many people will be
attending the festival?

258
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,620
We've sent the official notice
to the US and Canadian embassies,

259
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,550
chambers of commerce,
and press offices...

260
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,820
in the respective countries.

261
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,360
We'll soon be able to confirm
the number of attendees...

262
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,460
and their details.

263
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,000
Hello, sir.

264
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,140
I saw you come in
and waited to see you.

265
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,880
What is it now?

266
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,380
As I said
in the text I sent yesterday,

267
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,450
we really thought
the jar was Joseon porcelain...

268
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,920
and cherished it.

269
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,090
I totally understand...

270
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:07,460
if you misunderstood the situation,

271
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,630
but my mother
wanted to show her gratitude...

272
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,430
I got your excuse loud and clear.

273
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,800
Let's stop talking about that.

274
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,200
It's not an excuse.
I'm telling you the facts.

275
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Then...

276
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,440
shall I share a fact too?

277
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,880
I warned you.

278
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,110
If you ever caused another nuisance,

279
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,750
I'd cancel your supply contract.

280
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,480
You can't do that now.

281
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,290
My mother came to see you
without talking to me first.

282
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:37,350
You can't count this incident.

283
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,560
This incident...

284
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,200
won't be counted.

285
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:47,800
Let's be more careful, shall we?

286
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,630
Yes, of course, sir.
I'll be more careful.

287
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,700
Thank you.

288
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,810
Get upstairs safely.

289
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,180
He threatens
to cancel the contract...

290
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,520
whenever he's disgruntled.

291
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,950
He's so weird.

292
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,560
Get upstairs safely.

293
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,780
They're just the same,

294
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,050
as if they were copy-pasted.

295
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,080
Who do you mean?

296
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,350
CEO Ma and her mother.

297
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,250
Oh, right.

298
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,350
They're noisy,

299
00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:46,920
clumsy, and imprudent.

300
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,160
They give me a headache.

301
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,030
We tried a few times...

302
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:57,130
and the conclusion is that it's hard
to produce a premium product...

303
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,600
at our current facilities.

304
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,940
Our Research and Development says...

305
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,840
we must review three things
to produce a premium product.

306
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,510
There's no time. Get to the point.

307
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,640
Yes, sir.

308
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,280
Okay. Number one.

309
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,620
We can't create that taste
with the filtered water we use.

310
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,220
Eagle Brewery uses...

311
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,060
natural bedrock water.

312
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,490
I know that water.

313
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,160
It's no big deal.
It's not that special.

314
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,690
Number two.

315
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,960
We must find...

316
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,370
a new nuruk
that suits a premium product.

317
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,830
You want to splurge
on digging a well and making nuruk.

318
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,340
Lastly, there's the issue of rice.

319
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,940
Eagle Brewery
deals directly with farmers...

320
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,810
and uses pesticide-free
organic rice only.

321
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,620
Eagle Brewery uses organic rice?

322
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,120
Yes. The makgeolli
they supply LX Hotel with...

323
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,220
is made only with organic rice.

324
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,920
Goodness.

325
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,060
There's not much profit
in makgeolli.

326
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,400
Is that we need to spend more
the only thing you can say?

327
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,010
Are you off to class?

328
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,010
Yes.

329
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,820
Isn't your professor
making you work too hard?

330
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,450
Why must you be there all the time?

331
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,320
I told you it's not like that.

332
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:23,950
See you.

333
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,860
Hey.

334
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,330
This woman...

335
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,800
She's engaged to Jang Je Hyeong,
Daeheung Group's chairman.

336
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,730
She's 25 years his junior.

337
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,770
What?

338
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,940
She's marrying
Daeheung Group's chairman?

339
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,740
They both insist it's love,

340
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:45,410
but why would a young woman...

341
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,080
marry a man
old enough to be her dad?

342
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,150
She wants his money.

343
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,620
My gosh.

344
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,020
No way.

345
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,450
You're so naive
that you'd never imagine such a thing.

346
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,990
That's how the world is.

347
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,460
That's how scary money can be.

348
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,300
Even so, how could she?

349
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:09,830
This is ridiculous.

350
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,670
It's so cruel.

351
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:22,950
(TA Dokgo Se Ri)

352
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:33,990
Hello, Professor.

353
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,490
Where are you? Can we talk?

354
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,930
I'm in your office
preparing for the meeting.

355
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,670
Oh, dear. I see.

356
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,700
I should've called earlier.

357
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:44,840
I feel terrible.

358
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,470
What's wrong?

359
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,040
Something urgent came up.

360
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,370
I need to postpone
the research meeting.

361
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,940
Can you contact the PhD students
and apologize for me?

362
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,380
Okay. I'll do just as you said.

363
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,590
What's going on?

364
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,120
Did Ha Ni's mom
ask to see him again?

365
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:19,100
I heard you asked Chun Soo
for a divorce.

366
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,470
He's struggling with the shock
because it was so sudden.

367
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,980
I get it if he does.

368
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,050
But I've wanted a divorce
for a long time.

369
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,150
I'm sure you have reasons
of your own,

370
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:36,690
but you know how hard he worked
for you and Yeoung Ju.

371
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,890
You could think so.

372
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,090
But to him,
family doesn't hold the most value.

373
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,500
What he thinks is right
is more important to him.

374
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,830
What do you mean by that?

375
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,000
He didn't fight for
what was rightfully ours.

376
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,740
And he didn't hold back
when he should've for us.

377
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,110
Others might think that's cool,

378
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:04,920
but as his family, it's frustrating.

379
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,120
Look at him.

380
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,050
He helped others...

381
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,520
and lost his job in the process.

382
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,060
That was because...

383
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,290
Your brother and I
led different lives.

384
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,600
That's why we fought a lot,

385
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,100
and that's why
I left with Yeoung Ju.

386
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:23,470
Watching how he lived...

387
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,970
would kill me, I thought.

388
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,170
The brewery too.

389
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,140
How could he let Jang Soo's widow...

390
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,340
take over
what belonged to the family?

391
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,680
If he cared about me and Yeoung Ju,

392
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,920
shouldn't he have
asked for his share?

393
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,550
I know the details
because I dealt with the lawyer.

394
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:44,090
There was no inheritance to split.

395
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,290
If Kwang Sook hadn't helped out,

396
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,660
we'd have had to sell the brewery
to pay off the creditors.

397
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,760
I don't agree with that.

398
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,100
From what I found out,

399
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,860
redevelopment is booming
in that area.

400
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:56,300
You can sell the property
for a great price.

401
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,240
There was a large amount
of hidden debt.

402
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,170
We had no choice but to refuse
to inherit the brewery.

403
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,170
Yes, but right now,
things are going well.

404
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,380
How can you hand over
the whole business...

405
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,410
to someone
who just joined the family?

406
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,450
Does that even make sense?

407
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,080
To be honest,

408
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,420
I'm disappointed in you too.

409
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:17,950
So Yeon.

410
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,260
You'd have
understood the situation...

411
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,390
if you'd been there.

412
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,760
No.

413
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,430
I don't think I'll ever get it.

414
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,230
I don't know...

415
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,870
what you brothers were thinking,

416
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,070
but I'm different.

417
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,840
I will take my share.

418
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,050
You've changed a lot.

419
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,420
I can expect nothing...

420
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,590
from your brother
who lives in a tiny gosiwon.

421
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,660
How can I live without changing?

422
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,260
A gosiwon?

423
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,830
Chun Soo lives in a gosiwon?

424
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
You didn't know?

425
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,440
He lost our apartment.

426
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,270
He's staying at a gosiwon now.

427
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,650
(Areum Gosiwon)

428
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,020
Hey.

429
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,620
Chun Soo.

430
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,060
Sorry.

431
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,590
Why didn't you tell me?

432
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,730
After selling the apartment,
I lived in a studio for a year.

433
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,100
Paying the utility bills
felt like a waste of money.

434
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,740
The place still felt
just as cramped.

435
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:42,270
Why should I waste money
when I only need a place for myself?

436
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,670
That money was better spent
on Yeoung Ju.

437
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,740
Your wife isn't grateful for that.

438
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,140
She's more disappointed
that you live here...

439
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,580
and wants a divorce because of it.

440
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,280
I would've moved back to a studio
if I'd known she was coming.

441
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,190
It all went south
because she came unannounced.

442
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,920
So? Are you going
to keep on living here?

443
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,090
Once So Yeon and I
get back together,

444
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,730
I'll look for an apartment...

445
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,330
on a monthly rent
or a long-term lease.

446
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,660
It seems like...

447
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:10,030
So Yeon's hell-bent
on getting a divorce.

448
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,200
That's the anger talking.

449
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,140
How can we split
when we have Yeoung Ju? No way.

450
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,310
Don't worry.

451
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,340
I'll try to sort this out.

452
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,920
Now, exhale.

453
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,450
We'll do the twist.

454
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,230
Exhale three times.

455
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,060
To the other side.

456
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,770
Don't push too hard.

457
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,340
Goodness.

458
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:51,040
By the way, did you hear about
Ms. Oh who owns the jokbal place?

459
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,410
What about her?

460
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,980
She caught her husband
in the act of cheating.

461
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,980
Things were chaotic last night.

462
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,720
Oh, dear.

463
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,950
An ambulance took her...

464
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,720
to the ER last night,

465
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,490
but things aren't looking great.

466
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,190
Poor her.

467
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,170
Are we done?

468
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,670
What now?

469
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,510
- What?
- What is it?

470
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,270
- What on earth?
- Goodness.

471
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,340
What is this?

472
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,590
My gosh.

473
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,230
Goodness.

474
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,470
No way.

475
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,370
Oh, my.

476
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:11,220
I'll officially ask you
in the presence of others.

477
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,120
Please be my lady.

478
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,170
No. No way.

479
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:33,680
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

480
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,550
- Kiss her!
- Kiss him!

481
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,980
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

(Hanbit Nuri Pharmacy)

483
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:55,430
Goodness me. Come with me.

484
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:56,900
Sit here.

485
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,300
Is she ill?

486
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,740
I think she's suffering
from sudden indigestion.

487
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,570
She was fine a minute ago,

488
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,270
but she collapsed
saying she was dizzy,

489
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,580
and now she can't hold herself up.

490
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,210
What caused the indigestion?

491
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,910
I don't have indigestion.

492
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,480
Can you give me a calming pill?

493
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,150
Here you go.

494
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,490
Goodness. What is it?
Is something wrong?

495
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,490
Did someone run away
with your money?

496
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,500
No, it's not that.

497
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,500
If you didn't have indigestion,

498
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,370
we should've gone
to the restaurant with them.

499
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:33,200
Ms. Kim's treating us...

500
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,370
to jumbo pork cutlets
to celebrate the love confession.

501
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:39,280
Why would you go there
and stuff yourself?

502
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,880
Goodness me.
You were dying a second ago,

503
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,010
but you must be better
now that you're yelling.

504
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:46,880
What...

505
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,550
No.

506
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,650
I don't want to live.

507
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,460
I'd rather close...

508
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,990
my eyes and never wake up.

509
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:05,900
No one took off
with your money, right?

510
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,670
No, it's not that!

511
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,670

Kang Soo, is that you?

515
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,570
When did you arrive in Korea?

516
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,570
Didn't your brother tell you?

517
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,670
It's been a few days.

518
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,910
Why are you here though?

519
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,440
I was in an accident,

520
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:51,150
and Kwang Sook told me to stay here
while I got better.

521
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,120
I'll be staying here for a while.

522
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,150
I heard about it from Chun Soo,

523
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,990
but still, it's not appropriate
since Jang Soo isn't around.

524
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,760
I'm glad your injuries
weren't severe.

525

Anyway, where is that woman?

529
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:22,750
That woman?

530
00:32:23,550 --> 00:32:25,620
It'd be weird to call her
by her name.

531
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,550
I don't know what I should call her.

532
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,790
Are you talking about
my oldest sister-in-law?

533

That's right. Her.

534
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,890
She went to the hotel
to deliver makgeolli.

535
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:41,030
Does the brewery supply makgeolli
to a hotel?

536
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,870
Yes, LX Hotel to be exact.

537
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,500
LX Hotel?

538
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,610
She'll be making millions.

539
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,210

Hey, Kang Soo.

541
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,660
Is something up?

542
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,120
Chun Soo's wife is here...

543
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:10,090
and would like to talk to you.

544
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,760
Sure. Just a second.

545
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:20,770
Hello, I'm Chun Soo's wife.

546
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,770
I'd like for us to meet.

547
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,780
No, I'll come to you.

548
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,050
Sure.

549
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:33,220
Please call me once you get here.

550
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,590
(Eagle Brewery)

551
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:45,060
- Hello.
- Hello, CEO Ma.

552
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:47,160
- Please have a seat.
- Sure.

553
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,300
Anyway, why did you want to see me?

554
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,700
It's nothing serious.

555
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,070
Next month, a festival will be held
for foreign key figures...

556
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,240
where we pair our traditional food
with traditional liquor.

557
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,280
Then, could Eagle Brewery
participate in that festival?

558
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,480
Yes, of course.

559
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,220
Goodness. Thank you so much.

560
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,850
There's something
we must request though.

561
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,890
Makgeolli doesn't have
a variety of flavors...

562
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,460
unlike Western liquor.

563
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,690
Could there be a way
for our drinks to stand out?

564
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,030
I see.

565
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,960
Coincidentally,
the brewery manager...

566
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,530
and I have been discussing...

567
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,230
developing a 17-percent yakju...

568
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,700
based on Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

569
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,670
We'll be able to showcase
the new product at the event.

570
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,240
That's great news.

571
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,940
I'll report that to the chairman.

572
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,450
Please...

573
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,980
put in a good word for me.

574
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:44,750
I bet I surprised you
with this unannounced visit.

575
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,320
It's all right.

576
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,990
I thought you'd avoid me
if I called in advance,

577
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,400
so I barged in instead.

578
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,400
So what's the occasion?

579
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,300
I'll be participating
in Art Busan in May,

580
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,000
and the painting you bought
the other day...

581
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,210
is desperately needed
considering the concept.

582
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:08,040
Could you lend it to me
for about two weeks?

583
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:10,410
Sure. That should be fine.

584
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,420
I appreciate you
agreeing so willingly.

585
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,390
Let me treat you to lunch
as a token of my appreciation.

586
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,520
That's all right.

587
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,530
Please don't make me feel like
I have no shame.

588
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,230
- Sorry?
- I'm here to ask you...

589
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,400
if I can borrow the painting
that has already been sold to you.

590
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,200
Don't make me out to be someone...

591
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,610
who asks for a favor
without giving something in return.

592
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,640
Please at least let me
take you out for lunch.

593
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:44,580
That's the only way
I'll feel at ease.

594
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,920
Then...

595
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,490
we can have tea instead of a meal.

596
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,990
I'm afraid
I'm still full from breakfast.

597
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,370
Goodness.

598
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:07,540
Are you all right?

599
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,940
I'm good.

600
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,210
I don't normally wear heels,

601
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,980
but I did to make a good impression.
How silly of me.

602
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:15,650
Goodness.

603
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,190
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

604
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,400
I just sprained my ankle a little.
I'm fine.

605
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,270
- Let's go.
- Okay.

606
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,340
Please go on in.

607
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,810
I have something to take care of.

608
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,110
It won't take long.

609
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,810
Okay.

610
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,090
Excuse me.

611
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,090
Hello.

612
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,130
What's that supposed to mean?

613
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,030
What?

614
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:12,770
What does this mean?

615
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:16,570
You two look great together.

616
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:19,710
- What?
- The lady you were with.

617
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,140
She seems elegant and sophisticated.

618
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,210
She seems like
a perfect match for you.

619
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:27,320
Don't say such nonsense
when you don't know anything!

620
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:29,990
You startled me.

621
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,420
Why are you so upset
when I said something nice?

622
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,060
Whether it's nice or not,

623
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,590
I don't want you to say such things
with no foundation.

624
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:39,330
She is the artist
who created the paintings...

625
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,530
that hang in our hotel.

626
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,970
This is really upsetting!

627
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:47,800
Darn it.

628
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,110
What...

629
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,380
I might be wrong,

630
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,110
but why is he so angry?

631
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,250
Is he going through andropause?

632
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:10,560
Hey, Kang Soo.

633
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,300
So Yeon went to meet Kwang Sook?

634
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,840
Okay. I'll talk to her.

635
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:30,650
The call cannot be connected.
Transferring to voicemail.

636
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,380
What on earth is she up to?

637
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,530
(Eagle Brewery)

638
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,270
Excuse me.

639
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,180
I'm Oh Chun Soo's wife.

640
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,040
My gosh. Nice to meet you.

641
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,750
I was sad that I couldn't meet you
at my wedding.

642
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,080
It's so nice to finally see you.

643
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,680
Welcome back.

644
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:12,860
We need to talk.

645
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,660
Okay. Sure.

646
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,260
Shall we go to the coffee shop?

647
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,060
Hotel coffee is expensive.
Why waste money on it?

648
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,670
Let's go outside.

649
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,770
Oh, okay. Shall we?

650
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,150
I'll cut to the chase.

651
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,290
We'd like to get our share
of the inheritance...

652
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,660
from the brewery.

653
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:53,100
Your share?

654
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:55,430
After Jang Soo passed away,

655
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,470
my husband is now the eldest
in the family.

656
00:39:57,830 --> 00:40:00,270
Don't you think he deserves
to receive his share?

657
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:04,570
Did you discuss this with Chun Soo?

658
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:06,080
You know what he's like.

659
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,480
There's no way
he would ask for that.

660
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:12,720
I think...

661
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,020
you should talk to Chun Soo first.

662
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,690
I came here to see you
because he wouldn't listen to me.

663
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,160
I don't know
what you heard about the brewery,

664
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,760
but there was a lot of hidden debt,

665
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,600
so I had to take on the debt...

666
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,600
instead of inheriting a fortune.

667
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,540
Anyway, things are going well now,

668
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,300
and you're even supplying liquor
to the hotel.

669
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:38,570
So, shouldn't there be a share
for the brothers and their families?

670
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,280
Are you telling me...

671
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,780
to liquidate the brewery...

672
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,480
while I have to pay back
all the debt?

673
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,150
What needs to be done
needs to be done.

674
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,590
I enjoyed the tea, thanks to you.

675
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:57,330
And I'll have my employees
take care of things...

676
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,430
so you can pick up your painting
whenever you want.

677
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:03,070
The gallery will send some people
within this week.

678
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,830
Okay. All right then.

679
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,040
Now that I bought you tea today,

680
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,010
you should buy me lunch next time.

681
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,850
I'll see you later.

682
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,160
I'm not feeling well.

683
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,190
Maybe I should go out for a walk.

684
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,540
Let's say...

685
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,470
we end up getting some money
with all the debt.

686
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,880
Then the family legacy that holds
the brothers together will be gone,

687
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,050
and I'll lose all the traces
of my husband.

688
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,280
That's why I decided
to take on all the burden,

689
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,420
and his brothers agreed to do that.

690
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,120
The brewery is...

691
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,460
what connects
the remaining family members,

692
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,520
and that's why it has...

693
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:04,030
important values
that we must protect.

694
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,760
Why do you keep...

695
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,200
acting like the owner
when you're not one?

696
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,200
What did you say?

697
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,240
I've been the daughter-in-law
of Eagle Brewery...

698
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,040
for much longer than you.

699
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:20,140
What did you say?
Where are your manners?

700
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,640
When Jang Soo is gone,

701
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,910
why would I have to treat you
as my sister-in-law?

702
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:28,350
And it happened only ten days
after you got married.

703
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,960
There was a real estate boom
in the neighborhood,

704
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,730
so the land value
has increased a lot.

705
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:46,240
Don't tell me you didn't know that.

706
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,400
I have no intention
of selling the brewery.

707
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,240
What does the land value
have to do with me?

708
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:54,110
You're one greedy lady.

709
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,510
What did you say?

710
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:59,780
You're trying to have the brewery
all to yourself.

711
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,120
You never cared about it before,

712
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,450
and now you suddenly show up
and ask for your share.

713
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,520
You're the greedy one here.

714
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,720
Don't you think so?

715
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,330
If you sell it now,
you'll pay off all the debt,

716
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,660
and everyone will be at ease.

717
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:14,300
But you're just being stubborn
because you want it all.

718
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,370
That's right. I do want to keep it
all for myself.

719
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:22,170
Find someone who'll take on the debt
and give us ten million dollars.

720
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,110
Then I'll sell the brewery
right away.

721
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:26,410
Did you say ten million dollars?

722
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:29,580
I worked my tail off
to keep the brewery running.

723
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:32,210
If I can't get ten million dollars,
it's my loss.

724
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,420
Now you're showing your true colors.

725
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,190
Maybe you knew
that the Oh brothers were naive,

726
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,060
so you planned to make a fortune
using them, right?

727
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,860
That's right.

728
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,360
I wanted the brewery,

729
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,760
so I married a man
who would die young.

730
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,460
And I cajoled my brothers-in-law
with soft hearts...

731
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,770
into handing the brewery over to me.

732
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,040
- Are you happy now?
- You want a piece of me?

733
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,770
I do want a piece of you!

734
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,140
I'd rather bite my tongue and die.

735
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,070
There's no way I'll have
the brewery be taken away.

736
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,010
Do you want to take legal action?

737
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,150
Whether it's legal or not,
do whatever you want!

738
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,880
The brewery is mine!

739
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,680
I will never let you
take it away from me!

740
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:17,290
Well...

741
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,730
Wait, Chairman Han.

742
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,080
Darn it.

743
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,120
Why am I crying like a fool?

744
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,590
(Heung Soo)

745
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,500
Hi, Heung Soo.

746
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,360
Kwang Sook, you didn't forget
our appointment, did you?

747
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,130
What?

748
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:00,840
Oh, right. Of course not.

749
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:03,010
I'll be there on time.

750
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:06,640
Okay. I'll see you then.

751
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:24,690
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

752
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:28,630
Why do you think...

753
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,600
the widow of the last CEO...

754
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,530
would take over a failing brewery...

755
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,470
when they were
only married for ten days?

756
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:38,470
The talk is that
she took over the brewery...

757
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,080
because there were...

758
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,210
hidden assets such as property.

759
00:45:42,310 --> 00:45:45,110
She's fighting her brothers-in-law
over the inheritance.

760
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:52,050
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

761
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:06,030
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

762
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:07,940
Oh, my gosh.

763
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:11,840
Hello.

764
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:15,210
I had an amazing dream last night...

765
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:17,650
and thought something good
would happen today.

766
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,480
I guess that was a call from you.

767
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,680
I called to ask you...

768
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,490
to dinner
if you were free this evening.

769
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,060
Of course, I am.

770
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,730
I'm very free.

771
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:33,730
As youngsters would say these days,
I'm up for anything.

772
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,330
(Chairman Jang announces marriage.)

773
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:37,530
(His fiancee is talented
and 25 years younger.)

774
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,770
She has an adorable daughter...

775
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:43,570
and an amazing husband.

776
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,180
How could she leave them for him?

777
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,480
Hello, Professor.

778
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:51,950
You're still here.

779
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,020
Did you hear about
the new meeting schedule?

780
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,490
Yes. I'll keep all the material...

781
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:00,590
and set it back out for the meeting.

782
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:02,390
I'm sorry you have to do that twice.

783
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,690
Something urgent came up.

784
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:06,330
Was it something bad?

785
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:09,460
Well, it wasn't great.

786
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,770
Did you have lunch?

787
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:16,810
Not yet. I'll eat after the lecture.

788
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:22,710
I got one of each, so there's a lot.

789
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:23,750
Do you want one?

790
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:27,980
Thanks.

791
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:40,530
Here's some water.

792
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,830
Thank you.

793
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,240
Well...

794
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,370
It was so tasty...

795
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,410
that I ate too fast.

796
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,810
It's nice and soft.

797
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,880
Isn't it?

798
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:05,750
Excuse me.

799
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:09,520
Hello, ma'am.

800
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,260
I'll be a bit late today.

801
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:16,200
I'll get what you need
on the way home.

802
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:17,830
Just a moment.

803
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:21,870
Go ahead.

804
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,740
Okay, I got it.

805
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,280
Is Ha Ni asleep?

806
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,750
Okay. I'll see you later.

807
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:32,950
Bye.

808
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,690
I'll go straight home
after the lecture.

809
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:40,760
Don't mind me and do what you want.

810
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:42,090
Yes, Professor.

811
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:44,530
- Thanks for this.
- Sure.

812
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,500
- See you.
- Bye.

813
00:48:59,610 --> 00:49:02,010
(Diapers, wet wipes,
diaper rash cream, baby lotion)

814
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:08,950
I explained it well enough.

815
00:49:09,350 --> 00:49:10,550
How could you...

816
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:12,490
go to Kwang Sook
and demand our share?

817
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:14,860
She supplies a famous hotel...

818
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,760
and property prices are soaring now.

819
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:19,630
The brewery's worth much more.
You don't know what you're saying.

820
00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:22,900
All that came about
after she took over the brewery.

821
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:25,070
My brothers and I agreed to this.

822
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:27,100
What right do you have
to demand a share now?

823
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,570
Yeoung Ju has your family name,

824
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:29,940
and I'm her mom.

825
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,510
I have a right.

826
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,180
My gosh...

827
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,980
You don't know what other dads do
for their kids who study abroad.

828
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:40,280
You don't care
because you think you're awesome.

829
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,120
They're so devoted.

830
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,350
They'll take any job
for their wives and kids.

831
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:47,760
But what do you do?

832
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,130
You handed over...

833
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,090
your rightful share to a stranger.

834
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,460
Money. Darn money!

835
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,740
Is money all you care about
after living abroad for a while?

836
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,870
How could someone normal
turn into such a mess?

837
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,770
You lost your job overnight...

838
00:50:05,770 --> 00:50:07,840
and lost our apartment
in the process.

839
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:09,880
How couldn't I turn into a mess?

840
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:16,250
I can afford to support Yeoung Ju
until she graduates.

841
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,820
I'm staying at the gosiwon
to spend less.

842
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:22,260
Do you expect me
to be moved by that?

843
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:24,530
- What?
- She'll graduate,

844
00:50:24,530 --> 00:50:26,090
but then she must settle down
and marry.

845
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,430
That's years away.

846
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:28,900
A degree is more than enough.

847
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,170
She must fend for herself then.

848
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,800
What dad says that?

849
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,840
- I did the best I could.
- What about me?

850
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,470
Didn't I do my best?

851
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:39,310
I served tables at a diner.

852
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:40,880
I don't ask for much.

853
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,950
I just want
my share and Yeoung Ju's.

854
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:46,780
Do you have to stoop so low?

855
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:52,520
Get up.

856
00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:55,920
Let's go to apologize to Kwang Sook.

857
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,890
Don't be stupid.
Why would I apologize to that woman?

858
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:01,760
- I deserve the apology.
- What?

859
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,000
You have no idea
what she screamed at me.

860
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,540
She should apologize to me!

861
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,790
You're back, Professor.

862
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,600
(Hi Bebe)

863
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,960
What's all that?

864
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,240
(Hi Bebe)

865
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:45,710
Why did you get these?

866
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:48,110
My mom asked me to get something,

867
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:51,110
and I decided to shop for you
while I was at the store.

868
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:53,880
Here's the receipt.

869
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,290
You seem to be mistaken.

870
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,590
A TA isn't the professor's
personal assistant.

871
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:03,360
You help with my lectures
and research.

872
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:06,700
It's unacceptable
to make you do this.

873
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
You didn't make me do this.

874
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:13,500
I was already at the store,
so I got a few more items.

875
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,640
It's not that big a deal.

876
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,940
I'm thankful,

877
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,880
but don't do it again, okay?

878
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,210
Okay.

879
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:24,880
I won't do it again
if it makes you feel uncomfortable.

880
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,780
Let it go this once.

881
00:52:28,850 --> 00:52:29,850
Will you?

882
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,590
Okay.

883
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:33,790
Hang on.

884
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:36,320
How much was it?

885
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:40,560
- Here.
- Thank you.

886
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,740
What's the occasion?
You're too stingy to eat galbitang.

887
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:55,480
I had too much on my mind
to eat properly,

888
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,950
and I was running out of energy.

889
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:59,710
I added some extra galbi.
Enjoy the food.

890
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:02,350
You're the best.

891
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,890
We're friends.

892
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:08,060
Mr. Oh and Ms. Kim?

893
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:12,260
Are you here
to celebrate the proposal?

894
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:18,000
He wanted to introduce me
to his sister-in-law.

895
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:20,440
You're meeting his family already?

896
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,540
It's nothing that serious.

897
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,370
My sister-in-law is
like a real sister to me.

898
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,440
I wanted them to meet up first.

899
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,250
Sit where you want.

900
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,650
Hey. You're here too, Ms. Ji?

901
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,130
Enjoy your meal.

902
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:58,340
(Eagle Brewery)

903
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:10,150
Over here, Kwang Sook.

904
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,190
This is my sister-in-law,
my friend, and actual sister figure.

905
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,160
I'm Ma Kwang Sook. It's a pleasure.

906
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:25,370
I'm Kim Seon Ah.

907
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:28,100
Take a seat.

908
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:42,450
Heung Soo bragged about you so much.

909
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,120
I was dead curious.

910
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:46,690
You're beautiful.

911
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:48,820
Thank you.

912
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,890
You majored in piano?

913
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,360
Yes.

914
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,230
She's won many piano competitions
since she was a child.

915
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,400
She's a great pianist.

916
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:01,870
I have quite a few pianist friends.

917
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,640
Which university did you go to?

918
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:08,180
Isn't it a bit rude
to ask where I studied...

919
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,740
when we just met?

920
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,050
Pardon?

921
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:16,620
Oh, yes.

922
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,720
I'm sorry if I offended you.

923
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:25,290
I have a few friends
who studied classical piano,

924
00:55:25,690 --> 00:55:28,030
and asked in case you knew them too.

925
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:30,930
I'm sorry.

926
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:34,070
Gosh, Kwang Sook.
There's no need to apologize.

927
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:37,610
I was just talking about
basic manners.

928
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,510
Forgive me
if I offended you in any way.

929
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:43,110
Gosh, no. I wasn't offended at all.

930
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,580
Goodness, I'm hungry.

931
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,550
Let's have something delicious.

932
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:48,820
It'll be on me.

933
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:50,690
Sure. Thank you.

934
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:53,720
What would you like?

935
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:59,190
Goodness, the dishes here...

936
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,630
The emperor's braised short ribs.
It's Kwang Sook's treat.

937
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,200
I should've asked you out
some other day.

938
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,410
Don't mind me...

939
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:12,470
and head inside
to finish your dinner.

940
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:14,010
Are you sure you're okay?

941
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,440
I get migraines sometimes.

942
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,550
It'll clear up
with a pill and some sleep,

943
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:19,650
so don't worry.

944
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,550
What did you think of Seon Ah?

945
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,820
She's like you described.

946
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:32,130
Pretty, amiable, and sharp.

947
00:56:33,630 --> 00:56:35,230
You like her too, right?

948
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,430
My gosh.

949
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:39,030
It doesn't matter
whether I like her or not.

950
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:41,400
All is well as long as you like her.

951
00:56:44,770 --> 00:56:47,640
Are you thinking about marrying her?

952
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,840
Of course.

953
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,410
Don't dive into anything too fast.

954
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:53,920
It might be a good idea...

955
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,680
to take your time
to get to know each other.

956
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,020
Don't keep Seon Ah waiting
and head back.

957
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:01,490
I will once I see you off.

958
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:03,630
But I'm driving out of here.

959
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:04,960
Head back in.

960
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:06,690
Get home safely, then.

961
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:07,930
I'll call you later.

962
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,110
Hello.

963
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,050
Do I know you?

964
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:29,020
We met at the funeral.

965
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,520
I'm one of the students...

966
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,760
in Mr. Oh's Zumba class.

967
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:36,490
Oh, right.

968
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:38,290
Hold on.

969
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:46,330
(K-beauty pioneer G Hair Salon)

970
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,340
Anyway, what is this about?

971
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:52,270
Well...

972
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:57,810
That woman Mr. Oh is dating.

973
00:57:59,410 --> 00:58:01,050
There's something wrong about her.

974
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:05,420
Wrong about her?
What do you mean by that?

975
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:06,990
She's one with many secrets.

976
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:10,790
I'll expose all her secrets soon,

977
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:11,960
so until then,

978
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,760
please keep an eye on Mr. Oh...

979
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:19,070
so that things don't get too serious
between them.

980
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,040
What?

981
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,140
I'm begging you.

982
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,440
His life depends on it.

983
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:29,110
Please treat this as a matter
of utmost importance.

984
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,640
How bad is it?

985
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:57,710
Let's go see a doctor.

986
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,280
I can probably sleep this off.

987
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:03,180
There's no need for a doctor.

988
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,880
Of course, your body gave up.

989
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,320
You haven't rested for even a day.

990
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:13,720
Even machines
will break down at this pace.

991
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:20,900
Why are you crying?

992
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:26,570
Did something happen?

993
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,440
It's nothing.

994
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:30,840
Then why are you crying?

995
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,440
I don't know.

996
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,640
Maybe my body is releasing
all the tension.

997
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:39,880
Who are you trying to fool?

998
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:40,950
What happened?

999
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:42,520
It's nothing.

1000
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:44,520
Is it the brewery?

1001
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,520
Or did the hotel chairman...

1002
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:48,120
cancel your contract
because of the jar incident?

1003
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:52,590
He's not that petty.

1004
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:55,960
I'm going to sleep now.

1005
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:57,900
Turn the light off as you leave.

1006
01:00:20,990 --> 01:00:23,620
Many parents of married couples...

1007
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,930
have a close relationship.

1008
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:29,230
I've always been jealous of them.

1009
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,630
Chairman Han... No, wait.

1010
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:36,140
Just the thought
that it could be the same for us...

1011
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,540
makes me so happy.

1012
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:41,940
We'll get together for workouts...

1013
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,380
and meals.

1014
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,580
You can always count me in.

1015
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:46,910
Call me at any time.

1016
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:56,220
I actually asked to meet you...

1017
01:00:57,690 --> 01:01:01,060
because what you said the other day
has been bothering me.

1018
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:03,030
What...

1019
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:06,900
About CEO Ma Kwang Sook
of Eagle Brewery.

1020
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,810
CEO Ma Kwang Sook?

1021
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:22,280
After watching her for a while,
what's your impression?

1022
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,890
I wasn't lying, was I?

1023
01:01:25,950 --> 01:01:27,190
I don't know about anything else,

1024
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:31,160
but the family is surely
fighting over the assets.

1025
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:33,260
Of course.

1026
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:36,630
She only married into the family
to take control of the brewery.

1027
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:41,470
I say this cautiously,

1028
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:42,970
but in our field,

1029
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:45,910
there's a rumor
that CEO Oh Jang Soo's death...

1030
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:49,380
was part of her grand scheme.

1031
01:01:50,610 --> 01:01:51,910
Obviously,

1032
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:54,750
those are only the words
from people who like to gossip.

1033
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:58,390
There's no smoke without fire.

1034
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:02,290
There must be some truth to it.

1035
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:06,790
Either way, that's one scary lady.

1036
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:08,900
You never know
how she'll hurt your people,

1037
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:12,100
so make sure your employees
do business with her cautiously.

1038
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,740
Goodness me.

1039
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:21,640
I can't believe CEO Oh
married a gold digger like her...

1040
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:25,110
and left his family to fall apart.

1041
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:27,480
A golddigger?

1042
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,720
It doesn't mean
anything complicated.

1043
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,090
Marrying a wealthy man
with a hidden agenda...

1044
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:37,090
and taking the family assets
following his death?

1045
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:39,330
That's the definition
of a golddigger.

1046
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:43,530
That Ma Kwang Sook is a golddigger.

1047
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:48,170
A golddigger like a venomous snake.

1048
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:55,340
A venomous snake?

1049
01:03:39,290 --> 01:03:41,720
(For Eagle Brothers)

1050
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,990
What nonsense is this?

1051
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:45,890
Don't you think it's just too much?

1052
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:47,800
Stop leeching off her!

1053
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:49,560
I apologize for not seeing
how you truly felt.

1054
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,370
The woman I love...

1055
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:54,240
isn't Ms. Kim, but you, Ms. Ji.

1056
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:56,200
I'm here to deliver good news.

1057
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,440
- Good news?
- I've set up a blind date for you.

1058
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:01,640
I can't stop thinking about snakes
all day.

1059
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,710
There are no misunderstandings
whatsoever.

1060
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:06,910
I have no interest
in the personal life...

1061
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:08,450
of CEO Ma.
