00:00:00,289 --> 00:00:02,419
(Eagle Brewery)

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:04,288
(Episode 6)

3
00:00:06,891 --> 00:00:09,260
When I call for him,

4
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,030
I feel like Jang Soo will walk out that door.

5
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,571
I was thinking the same thing.

6
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:23,481
Kwang Sook will be waiting.

7
00:00:26,381 --> 00:00:27,411
Let's head inside.

8
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,021
My legs are refusing to take me inside.

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,720
Chun Soo!

10
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:46,271
Why are you still out here?

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,570
Did you have a drink?

12
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,100
Yes.

13
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:52,610
I couldn't stop thinking about Jang Soo,

14
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,040
so I had a drink to get me through the night.

15
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:57,740
I smell more than one drink on him.

16
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,780
What?

17
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,020
Behave yourself in front of Kwang Sook and her mother.

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,720
You and your nagging again.

19
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:07,851
Come on. We'll take all night at this rate.

20
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,410
Why would you care for your brothers-in-law...

21
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,380
when your husband is no longer by your side?

22
00:01:32,481 --> 00:01:34,380
There's nothing tying you to them anymore.

23
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,151
Anything that gets disconnected...

24
00:01:36,151 --> 00:01:38,550
can be mended and reconnected.

25
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,550
Is that so?

26
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,890
I feel bad about treating my brothers-in-law to a meal...

27
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:43,261
that was just ordered in.

28
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,491
It's getting worse.

29
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,330
Wait. You make delicious zucchini pancakes.

30
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,530
Can you make a few?

31
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,701
That goes perfectly with makgeolli.

32
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:53,201
You, Ma Kwang Sook!

33
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:57,541
They should be here by now. What's taking them so long?

34
00:01:57,871 --> 00:01:58,910
- Kwang Sook. - Kwang Sook.

35
00:01:59,741 --> 00:02:01,211
- We're here. - They're here.

36
00:02:01,211 --> 00:02:02,681
Welcome!

37
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,551
I'm coming!

38
00:02:05,551 --> 00:02:06,780
Why is she running out to greet them?

39
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,010
They hardly deserve to be welcomed.

40
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:11,021
There's something seriously wrong with her.

41
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:16,491
The gang hasn't been together for a while.

42
00:02:17,421 --> 00:02:19,630
Have you all been well?

43
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,660
Yes.

44
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,301
You guys look even better.

45
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,700
You seem gaunter than the last time we saw you.

46
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,771
It also looks like you've lost weight.

47
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,641
Running a brewery has been more challenging than I expected.

48
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:34,241
I've been losing weight without even trying.

49
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:36,980
Every outfit looks great on me these days.

50
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,551
As if.

51
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,021
You look like you've aged ten years in just a few months.

52
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,621
Kwang Sook, I'm sorry.

53
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:48,921
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:51,660
I called you all here for drinks,

55
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:54,130
but I see Heung Soo is already drunk.

56
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,500
The thought of coming back here when Jang Soo's gone...

57
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,901
made my insides scream,

58
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,700
so I had a drink.

59
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,000
It was just one drink though.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,211
Come on. You can't cheat by getting drunk alone.

61
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:12,651
Ta-da.

62
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,311
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

63
00:03:14,311 --> 00:03:16,320
Here's the drink of the hour.

64
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,290
Like I said in my letter,

65
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,921
this is the last makgeolli recipe Jang Soo created.

66
00:03:22,591 --> 00:03:24,220
"Jang" from Oh Jang Soo...

67
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,130
and "Kwang" from Ma Kwang Sook.

68
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,160
This is Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

69
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:30,961
I love the name.

70
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:32,970
To brew this makgeolli,

71
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:34,700
he insisted on using bedrock water,

72
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,741
which is why he bought all the land behind the brewery.

73
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:40,771
It was his dream to make the best makgeolli...

74
00:03:40,771 --> 00:03:42,311
with the water from there,

75
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,081
and the makgeolli brewed with that water...

76
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,010
is Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

77
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,581
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

78
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,051
He felt bad for not being able to care for his brothers as much...

79
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,121
because he had to focus on this project.

80
00:03:57,391 --> 00:03:58,790
What do you mean he didn't care for us?

81
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,591
Jang Soo did everything he could for us.

82
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,771
Jang Soo!

83
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,781
By creating makgeolli...

84
00:04:17,741 --> 00:04:19,781
that is clean, medicinal and good for the body...

85
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,880
with precious flavours and aroma,

86
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:23,981
he wished to bring honour to his family business.

87
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,690
That lifelong wish of his...

88
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:28,791
has been poured into this makgeolli.

89
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:32,231
Let's try it together.

90
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:35,661
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli!

91
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:37,161
- Bravo! - Bravo!

92
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:50,340
How is it?

93
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,640
Goodness.

94
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:54,681
The crisp and refined flavours make this taste like champagne.

95
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:56,880
Even the younger generation would like it.

96
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,950
You're right.

97
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,320
It's not like the makgeolli you can currently buy.

98
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,431
He put all his time and effort into this makgeolli...

99
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:11,500
but wasn't even able to taste it.

100
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,741
What was so urgent that you had to leave so soon, Jang Soo?

101
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:23,580
Our poor brother.

102
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,250
I miss you, Jang Soo.

103
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:28,721
Kwang Sook's mother is with us,

104
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,150
so stop it. Don't do this on a good day.

105
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,590
I'm sad because...

106
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:40,390
Jang Soo isn't here to enjoy this good day with us.

107
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,590
You're not the only one who's sad.

108
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,130
We're all holding back.

109
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:49,371
You don't have the right to say anything, Chun Soo.

110
00:05:50,371 --> 00:05:51,371
What?

111
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,640
Your wife didn't even bother to fly back from the US.

112
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,871
Is this family?

113
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:57,140
Why should only Kwang Sook bear all the responsibility...

114
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,010
while your wife lives in luxury in the US?

115
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,580
You're drunk, Heung Soo. That's enough.

116
00:06:00,911 --> 00:06:02,121
Here. Have some water.

117
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:03,320
I'm not thirsty.

118
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,351
It's not like I'm wrong.

119
00:06:05,551 --> 00:06:08,291
Let's be honest. Now that Jang Soo's gone,

120
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,190
don't you think you should take over the brewery, Chun Soo?

121
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,260
But he's choosing to ignore his responsibilities.

122
00:06:13,361 --> 00:06:15,031
Before, he was busy with work,

123
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:16,500
but he's now out of a job.

124
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:19,601
Why are you making Kwang Sook bear all the responsibility?

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,041
- That's enough. - As if.

126
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,070
You are out of work now!

127
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:26,210
You darn punk!

128
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:28,681
- What... - Shut that mouth!

129
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:31,241
What? Are you going to hit me? Go ahead.

130
00:06:31,241 --> 00:06:32,650
Shut that mouth, you punk!

131
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,650
Enough!

132
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,281
- Hit me, then. - Stop it!

133
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:36,750
- Chun Soo, don't. - Get back here!

134
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,421
Calm down, Chun Soo.

135
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:40,690
That's only the alcohol talking. Calm down.

136
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,291
I'm sorry, Kwang Sook.

137
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:47,460
I apologize, Ms. Gong.

138
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,500
Right.

139
00:06:53,101 --> 00:06:54,731
We weren't done talking!

140
00:06:54,731 --> 00:06:57,140
Oh Chun Soo, where do you think you're going?

141
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,710
Heung Soo, that's enough.

142
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,570
What on earth?

143
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,241
What a ruckus that was. Goodness.

144
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:21,130
Heung Soo's drunk, so don't take it to heart.

145
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:23,200
Actually,

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
it's not like he's wrong.

147
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,971
Everything he said was right.

148
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,741
Chun Soo.

149
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,971
I should follow Jang Soo's path, take over the family business,

150
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:33,440
and care for you all.

151
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:37,611
I can't forgive myself for being this helpless.

152
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:39,411
Why would you say that?

153
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:41,080
No one thinks that way.

154
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,061
Kwang Sook, I'm sorry.

155
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:53,991
I'm too ashamed.

156
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,471
Blame the alcohol, not the messenger.

157
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:01,971
That's why one should drink fine liquor.

158
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:04,671
I guess Heung Soo drank something bad.

159
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:07,770
I have no face to show to you.

160
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,241
And I feel bad for my brothers.

161
00:08:09,481 --> 00:08:10,681
Don't be like that.

162
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,681
I chose to take over the brewery because I wanted to.

163
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:15,551
It's not like I was forced to do it.

164
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:17,880
It was my own decision.

165
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:21,291
We are grateful you say that.

166
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,561
But we all including Chun Soo feel bad for you.

167
00:08:24,721 --> 00:08:25,791
Come on.

168
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:28,061
How many times do I have to tell you to make you believe me?

169
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,301
I'm not just saying this. I really mean it.

170
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,271
Anyway, you did a great job.

171
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,311
Heung Soo went out like a light.

172
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,980
Oh, dear.

173
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:49,251
I'll let Heung Soo and Kang Soo...

174
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:51,421
spend the night here.

175
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,921
You two should go home now.

176
00:08:53,551 --> 00:08:54,551
Oh, right.

177
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:57,690
Take this with you.

178
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:01,490
Try this at home.

179
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,171
It tastes amazing.

180
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:13,641
Chun Soo, you didn't move, did you?

181
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:15,381
Can we go to the apartment you were living in back then?

182
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:18,681
No. Just drop me off at the subway station.

183
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:21,311
It's okay. It's late, so I'll take you home.

184
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,381
I want to get some fresh air and take a walk.

185
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,720
Drop me off at the subway station.

186
00:09:25,651 --> 00:09:28,051
Sir, please pull over there.

187
00:09:28,391 --> 00:09:29,460
Okay.

188
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,320
Are you waiting for someone?

189
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,021
Hey.

190
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:03,021
No, I was just thinking.

191
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,661
What are you doing here?

192
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,791
I had some business to do in Seoul, and I'm on my way home now.

193
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,230
And I saw you sitting there gawking.

194
00:10:11,801 --> 00:10:13,001
Is something wrong?

195
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:19,541
My sister-in-law made a new makgeolli,

196
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,570
so my family gathered together.

197
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:22,911
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

198
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:24,181
"Jang-Kwang Makgeolli?"

199
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,751
Your sister-in-law is impressive.

200
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,620
She really is.

201
00:10:34,421 --> 00:10:36,120
But the more I'm thankful...

202
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,061
and respectful to her,

203
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:41,131
the more awkward my position becomes.

204
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,631
I can't do anything to help her, and it makes me feel helpless.

205
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:49,370
It's hard.

206
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,070
Mi Sun.

207
00:10:56,811 --> 00:10:58,811
I guess I'm a selfish and horrible person.

208
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:02,151
I do feel bad and distressed,

209
00:11:02,881 --> 00:11:05,620
but I just can't bring myself to shoulder the burden...

210
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,021
for my sister-in-law.

211
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,561
Hey, friend.

212
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,261
How much better do you have to be?

213
00:11:18,631 --> 00:11:21,730
You're a good enough person already.

214
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,740
Don't beat yourself up too much.

215
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,210
To a good person like you,

216
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,911
something good like a gift will happen for sure.

217
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,281
Oh, right.

218
00:11:34,551 --> 00:11:36,080
I'll check with headquarters to see...

219
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,820
if she can supply them with the new makgeolli.

220
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,690
Eagle Makgeolli is famous in the area for its good taste,

221
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,421
so I'm sure it will be possible.

222
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,490
Can you do that for me?

223
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:47,631
Here.

224
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:50,960
Once you try this, you'll see how good it is.

225
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,200
Mi Sun, take this with you.

226
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,271
Actually, I was feeling like having a drink.

227
00:11:57,271 --> 00:11:58,570
Thanks.

228
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,411
The train is coming.

229
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:08,651
It's late. I'll take you home.

230
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:12,521
This is my neighbourhood. Don't worry about me and just go.

231
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,751
Now.

232
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:20,761
My gosh.

233
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,171
I'm coming in.

234
00:12:31,171 --> 00:12:32,411
Yes, come in.

235
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,051
I turned up the boiler, so it should get warm soon.

236
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,190
It feels so quiet when Heung Soo is asleep.

237
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:53,761
I'm sorry we're causing you trouble when Jang Soo isn't around.

238
00:12:55,761 --> 00:12:58,761
Don't say that. I find it really upsetting.

239
00:12:59,771 --> 00:13:02,671
You're Jang Soo's brother, so you're my brother too.

240
00:13:02,671 --> 00:13:05,340
I'm not drunk. Let's have one more round.

241
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,681
It's just that my brothers are eating and sleeping at my place.

242
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,511
There's nothing to apologize for.

243
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:14,551
This is where you were born.

244
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,980
You can come and rest anytime.

245
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,421
I'm running the brewery because that's what I want.

246
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,021
If you keep saying that, I'll be sad.

247
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,830
Thank you for saying that.

248
00:13:29,031 --> 00:13:30,330
I'll sleep at ease.

249
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,271
Bingo. That's the spirit.

250
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:35,870
Goodnight.

251
00:13:36,301 --> 00:13:38,771
Well... Thank you for the letter.

252
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,411
When I unexpectedly received your letter,

253
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:47,080
I was reminded how I got letters from Jang Soo every week,

254
00:13:47,281 --> 00:13:48,580
and I felt happy.

255
00:13:50,151 --> 00:13:51,281
Thank you.

256
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,791
I may not be able to write to you often because I'm busy,

257
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,620
but I'll send you a letter from time to time.

258
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,860
Don't tell your brothers though.

259
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:07,570
I love you, Kwang Sook.

260
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:11,700
My goodness.

261
00:14:13,171 --> 00:14:14,210
What?

262
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:18,381
- Are you out of your mind? - What do you mean?

263
00:14:19,381 --> 00:14:20,950
Why are your brothers-in-law spending the night here...

264
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,281
when your husband isn't around?

265
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,391
Didn't you see Heung Soo was in a drunken stupor?

266
00:14:26,391 --> 00:14:28,620
You should've called a taxi for him.

267
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:31,960
Come on. How would I do that?

268
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,230
Think about the time we've spent together.

269
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,001
You're supposed to stop spending time with them now.

270
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,561
Getting attached to them will only ruin your life. Okay?

271
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,301
They're like my brothers.

272
00:14:41,531 --> 00:14:43,940
So you should think that you got new sons...

273
00:14:44,171 --> 00:14:46,970
Do you expect me to think your brothers-in-law as my sons?

274
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,681
Have I lost my mind or what?

275
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:51,641
I'm not crazy, you fool.

276
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,011
- I'm not stupid. - Gosh, it hurts. Mom!

277
00:14:54,011 --> 00:14:55,980
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

278
00:14:59,521 --> 00:15:02,220
I'm too busy working to visit often.

279
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:05,460
I might end up homeless if the new product...

280
00:15:05,521 --> 00:15:07,391
we're launching doesn't do well.

281
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:12,531
Why are you giving me that look?

282
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,240
You said something tragic so nonchalantly.

283
00:15:17,801 --> 00:15:20,070
My husband died ten days after our wedding.

284
00:15:21,271 --> 00:15:23,881
Most tragedies don't feel tragic to me now.

285
00:15:28,311 --> 00:15:30,051
She doesn't seem to be well-off.

286
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,791
I don't feel good about getting free drinks from her.

287
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:40,190
I should've paid for the drinks even if she refused it.

288
00:15:41,531 --> 00:15:43,501
(Eagle Brewery)

289
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:51,470
Look. How dazzling you are.

290
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,541
It's been so long since I saw you in an apron.

291
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:00,350
Did you make hangover soup for my brothers-in-law?

292
00:16:02,051 --> 00:16:03,751
They aren't the only ones who need to eat.

293
00:16:03,751 --> 00:16:05,021
I made it for myself.

294
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,651
You sound harsh,

295
00:16:07,921 --> 00:16:10,360
but you're so thoughtful at heart.

296
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,590
You have an unexpected charm.

297
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:16,131
- Move these to the table. - All right.

298
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,200
(Eagle Brewery)

299
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,240
Good morning.

300
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,041
I'm sorry.

301
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,041
I'm so sorry, Ms. Gong.

302
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:34,881
I made a huge mistake, Kwang Sook.

303
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:35,980
Come on.

304
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:38,080
It wasn't a huge mistake.

305
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,251
My mom made some hangover soup. Enjoy it.

306
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:44,061
No. I don't deserve hangover soup.

307
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:45,360
No shame, no honour.

308
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:47,631
I don't want to cause you trouble.

309
00:16:48,261 --> 00:16:49,600
Go ahead and eat. I'm not eating.

310
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,901
Gosh.

311
00:16:54,671 --> 00:16:56,041
Just have some.

312
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:57,840
What? My gosh.

313
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,870
Only then can I feel at ease.

314
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,910
All right then.

315
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:05,311
I'll just have a bowl and leave.

316
00:17:17,061 --> 00:17:20,561
Jang Soo's biggest pride was his good relationship with brothers.

317
00:17:21,231 --> 00:17:22,701
If you care about Jang Soo,

318
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:25,761
you should never do that to Chun Soo, okay?

319
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,430
All right.

320
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,301
He just called Chun Soo, and they agreed to meet.

321
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,640
You have to apologize...

322
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,711
and beg his forgiveness no matter what, okay?

323
00:17:40,211 --> 00:17:41,451
I will.

324
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,150
Stop nagging. You sound so condescending.

325
00:17:45,781 --> 00:17:48,021
I'm done nagging now.

326
00:17:50,191 --> 00:17:51,991
The dried pollack soup is really good.

327
00:17:52,191 --> 00:17:53,360
Thank you, Ms. Gong.

328
00:18:01,031 --> 00:18:04,640
I'm not sure how this will sound right now,

329
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,900
but whenever we meet,

330
00:18:06,441 --> 00:18:09,711
I realize that you're young and beautiful, Ms. Gong.

331
00:18:12,981 --> 00:18:14,880
Why would you say that?

332
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:17,120
No. I met many female celebrities,

333
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,551
and I taught many members at many centers,

334
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:21,951
but I've never met someone this beautiful...

335
00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:23,860
in your age group.

336
00:18:24,221 --> 00:18:25,360
It's almost mysterious.

337
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,090
Everyone says the same.

338
00:18:30,061 --> 00:18:32,330
People think I'm Kwang Sook's sister.

339
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,070
Right? People think alike.

340
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:38,001
You look...

341
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:40,041
You look so young.

342
00:18:41,441 --> 00:18:44,281
There's a lot of soup in the pot.

343
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:47,051
Take your time and eat all you want.

344
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:48,451
Yes, I will.

345
00:18:48,981 --> 00:18:50,051
I'll get some more.

346
00:18:58,261 --> 00:18:59,590
Are you that busy?

347
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,930
I rarely see you at the dance class.

348
00:19:02,561 --> 00:19:04,531
I had a lot of clients,

349
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,301
and I was stressed out, so I took some time off.

350
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,100
Why? Is something wrong?

351
00:19:10,801 --> 00:19:12,241
Did someone take your money?

352
00:19:12,771 --> 00:19:14,211
No.

353
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,551
About Ms. Kim.

354
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,850
What about her?

355
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,781
She's so sneaky.

356
00:19:23,951 --> 00:19:26,120
Why is she sneaky?

357
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,090
She's sweet and smart.

358
00:19:28,951 --> 00:19:30,261
She's not sweet.

359
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:33,531
She's a vixen with 99 tails.

360
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:36,231
You're mistaken about her.

361
00:19:36,231 --> 00:19:38,031
Her parents must've taught her well.

362
00:19:38,031 --> 00:19:40,670
She's polite and doesn't have problems with men.

363
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:41,731
She's a nice woman.

364
00:19:42,301 --> 00:19:44,170
She was taught well at home?

365
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:47,041
Her dad's a hospital director, and her mom's a professor.

366
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,011
Her family's loaded.

367
00:19:49,011 --> 00:19:51,041
All her clothes are designer labels,

368
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,410
and her car's expensive too.

369
00:19:52,711 --> 00:19:54,781
She's so good at teaching piano.

370
00:19:54,781 --> 00:19:56,721
She's popular with all the parents.

371
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Darn it.

372
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,350
Hey.

373
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:04,261
What... You're done already?

374
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:05,920
What about the sides?

375
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,130
Forget it.

376
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,731
You look just perfect right now.

377
00:20:11,261 --> 00:20:12,830
My goodness.

378
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:18,301
You won't wash my hair for me?

379
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:23,041
Do it yourself. I'll take a dollar off.

380
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:26,180
Why the sudden change? You seem to be in a bad mood.

381
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:31,320
Things might get more complicated than I expected.

382
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,890
What things?

383
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,691
Don't ask. You don't need to know.

384
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:44,660
Eagle Brewery released a new makgeolli.

385
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,471
They're promoting it, so I got a bottle.

386
00:20:49,771 --> 00:20:50,900
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

387
00:20:51,301 --> 00:20:52,570
"Jang-Kwang Makgeolli?"

388
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,041
Goodness. What a stupid name for a makgeolli.

389
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,910
Mr. Oh's widow is no pushover.

390
00:20:59,511 --> 00:21:01,451
She has no experience in the field,

391
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:04,380
but she's aggressively promoting her makgeolli...

392
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,390
to famous restaurants and medium and large chain stores.

393
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:09,961
Should I call it "tactile marketing?"

394
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,761
What a joke. How much is it?

395
00:21:13,761 --> 00:21:15,991
It's 12 dollars at large stores, 14 dollars at smaller stores,

396
00:21:15,991 --> 00:21:17,600
and over 20 dollars at restaurants.

397
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,701
High-end Korean restaurants charge over 30 dollars a bottle.

398
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,900
The woman's out of her mind.

399
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,870
Who would pay that much for makgeolli?

400
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:27,941
That is true but...

401
00:21:29,711 --> 00:21:32,140
I tasted it with staff from Development.

402
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,110
The bubbles are refreshing,

403
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,920
and the sweetness is balanced with the acidity perfectly.

404
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,920
Everyone thought it lifted their spirits.

405
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:43,390
You felt uplifted?

406
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:47,561
Was it uplifting to take my money...

407
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:50,761
while drinking and enjoying a competitor's makgeolli?

408
00:21:53,501 --> 00:21:54,630
What about our new product?

409
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,741
You wanted to reduce the price by 30 percent,

410
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:01,041
so we're trying to streamline production.

411
00:22:01,471 --> 00:22:02,840
We haven't produced...

412
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,981
something that tastes satisfactory.

413
00:22:05,981 --> 00:22:08,811
Development can't even do that...

414
00:22:08,811 --> 00:22:11,380
when they're always asking for a raise?

415
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,521
(Silla Brewery)

416
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:14,551
Makgeolli is all about market share.

417
00:22:14,551 --> 00:22:16,320
We must produce and release...

418
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,420
something to counter Eagle Brewery.

419
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,630
Right. I'll keep that in mind.

420
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:22,691
Darn you.

421
00:22:23,531 --> 00:22:25,961
It would be quicker to buy Eagle Brewery.

422
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,670
When your wife...

423
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:31,100
came by a few days ago,

424
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,070
she asked about our plans to buy Eagle Brewery.

425
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:37,041
I told her those plans were scrapped.

426
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,880
Good.

427
00:22:40,711 --> 00:22:44,420
Until I bring it up first, you feign ignorance, okay?

428
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,521
Yes, sir.

429
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:48,420
You can go.

430
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,590
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

431
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,761
Why is that woman pretending to be nice now?

432
00:22:59,801 --> 00:23:01,930
Is she that pleased with her life?

433
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,501
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

434
00:23:09,436 --> 00:23:11,767
I could take a taxi.

435
00:23:11,767 --> 00:23:13,007
This is a bother.

436
00:23:13,507 --> 00:23:16,377
It's not. It's just a few days while the car's being fixed.

437
00:23:17,377 --> 00:23:19,817
If you're up for it,

438
00:23:19,817 --> 00:23:23,547
I'd willingly be your driver every single day.

439
00:23:23,916 --> 00:23:25,746
Thank you.

440
00:23:26,587 --> 00:23:29,827
I'm both fortunate and blessed to have you for a mom.

441
00:23:29,827 --> 00:23:32,287
I should be saying that to you.

442
00:23:32,287 --> 00:23:33,357
No.

443
00:23:33,357 --> 00:23:36,827
Se Ri, you will inherit LX Hotel.

444
00:23:36,996 --> 00:23:39,597
I must've done something amazing in my past life.

445
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:43,436
I'll inherit LX Hotel?

446
00:23:44,067 --> 00:23:45,107
Really?

447
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:46,607
Of course.

448
00:23:47,377 --> 00:23:50,307
Gyeol can't because he'll be busy with the hospital,

449
00:23:50,307 --> 00:23:53,716
and Bom can't because all she does is draw and paint.

450
00:23:54,646 --> 00:23:57,287
I planned everything well in advance.

451
00:23:57,287 --> 00:23:59,587
That's why I made you get an MBA.

452
00:23:59,587 --> 00:24:02,117
Come on. You're way too far ahead.

453
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:04,827
How so? I am not.

454
00:24:04,827 --> 00:24:06,656
If you just marry Gyeol,

455
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,996
LX Hotel will become yours for sure.

456
00:24:23,976 --> 00:24:26,377
I'll be off early since it's my first day.

457
00:24:26,377 --> 00:24:28,777
I'll look around the campus, have a coffee,

458
00:24:28,777 --> 00:24:31,087
and enjoy some alone time.

459
00:24:31,087 --> 00:24:34,216
Don't worry about me and concentrate on the lecture.

460
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:36,686
See you.

461
00:24:40,557 --> 00:24:42,027
My puppy dog.

462
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,067
Have a good day.

463
00:24:53,436 --> 00:24:54,777
- "Puppy dog?" - My gosh.

464
00:24:54,777 --> 00:24:55,976
What was that?

465
00:24:57,547 --> 00:24:59,577
Mom will be right here.

466
00:24:59,946 --> 00:25:02,517
You're awesome, my campus goddess!

467
00:25:02,517 --> 00:25:04,347
Get to it!

468
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:27,406
The new professor's a genius who came first in the civil exam...

469
00:25:27,406 --> 00:25:29,706
and worked at the Ministry of Strategy and Finance.

470
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:32,446
I heard he's awesomely handsome.

471
00:25:33,946 --> 00:25:35,547
He must be married, right?

472
00:25:36,386 --> 00:25:38,117
He's single.

473
00:25:38,117 --> 00:25:40,017
- What? - No way.

474
00:25:48,656 --> 00:25:49,696
Hey.

475
00:25:50,267 --> 00:25:52,527
It's the guy who came to fix the copier.

476
00:25:52,996 --> 00:25:54,767
I'll teach Financial Accounting this semester.

477
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:56,067
I'm Oh Beom Soo.

478
00:25:58,067 --> 00:25:59,267
He was a professor.

479
00:25:59,267 --> 00:26:00,436
This is...

480
00:26:00,436 --> 00:26:03,507
my first teaching position at a university in Korea.

481
00:26:03,507 --> 00:26:05,246
I'm partially excited...

482
00:26:05,246 --> 00:26:06,976
and partially nervous.

483
00:26:10,186 --> 00:26:12,216
I will do my best,

484
00:26:12,216 --> 00:26:14,156
but I'll need your help too.

485
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:15,257
I won't teach...

486
00:26:15,257 --> 00:26:17,287
and expect you to just listen.

487
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:20,827
I expect our lecture to be a two-way communication between us.

488
00:26:20,827 --> 00:26:21,857
I'm done for.

489
00:26:22,557 --> 00:26:24,396
This is really bad.

490
00:26:24,867 --> 00:26:27,837
It's our first lecture, but I won't just hand out...

491
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:30,307
the syllabus, introduce myself, and be done.

492
00:26:30,706 --> 00:26:32,636
Let's get into it.

493
00:26:39,817 --> 00:26:42,017
- Oh, no. - I'll pay for the dry cleaning.

494
00:26:43,117 --> 00:26:46,357
It's annoying.

495
00:26:46,357 --> 00:26:48,017
What will happen to me now?

496
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,267
I can make no excuse.

497
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:02,767
I don't know why I was like that.

498
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:04,507
Something must've come over me.

499
00:27:16,746 --> 00:27:18,847
I did the unthinkable, but it won't happen again.

500
00:27:20,216 --> 00:27:22,216
Please forgive me this once, Chun Soo.

501
00:27:24,486 --> 00:27:25,787
That's right.

502
00:27:26,196 --> 00:27:27,656
After how I treated you,

503
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,267
of course, you wouldn't be able to forgive me...

504
00:27:30,726 --> 00:27:32,466
even though you have the heart of Buddha.

505
00:27:41,406 --> 00:27:42,436
What are you doing?

506
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:45,146
I'll beg on my knees until you forgive me.

507
00:27:47,577 --> 00:27:49,446
Stop that. People can see you.

508
00:27:49,446 --> 00:27:51,017
As if that's an issue.

509
00:27:52,386 --> 00:27:54,787
I can even do a handstand if that'll make you forgive me.

510
00:27:55,386 --> 00:27:56,456
Watch.

511
00:27:56,827 --> 00:27:58,127
Hey.

512
00:27:59,257 --> 00:28:00,757
- Forgive me. - What...

513
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:02,257
Hey!

514
00:28:03,396 --> 00:28:04,767
Heung Soo, hey.

515
00:28:06,466 --> 00:28:08,597
That's enough. Stop this.

516
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:11,466
Should I stop? Does that mean you'll forgive me?

517
00:28:12,436 --> 00:28:13,936
Fine. Just stop it.

518
00:28:15,976 --> 00:28:19,047
To make it official, flash me a smile.

519
00:28:19,817 --> 00:28:21,117
Smile.

520
00:28:26,587 --> 00:28:28,486
Baby brother, Chun Soo smiled.

521
00:28:36,666 --> 00:28:38,496
Thanks for forgiving me, Chun Soo.

522
00:28:42,396 --> 00:28:45,307
It's okay. It's not like I did anything to be proud of.

523
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:47,837
I have no peace of mind,

524
00:28:49,136 --> 00:28:51,607
so I get angry at things instead of letting them go.

525
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:55,416
I don't know enough to run the brewery myself,

526
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:57,186
so what help could I be to Kwang Sook?

527
00:28:57,617 --> 00:28:59,186
I'll only be a burden to her.

528
00:28:59,757 --> 00:29:03,057
I'll try and think of a way to help her,

529
00:29:03,627 --> 00:29:06,926
so please be understanding, Heung Soo, Kang Soo.

530
00:29:07,297 --> 00:29:08,656
Don't be silly.

531
00:29:09,597 --> 00:29:11,527
We're all in the same shoes.

532
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:22,176
The MVG Diamond Club dinner party is tonight.

533
00:29:22,307 --> 00:29:24,446
Wait. Is that tonight?

534
00:29:24,507 --> 00:29:25,507
Yes, sir.

535
00:29:25,507 --> 00:29:28,716
Only the highest-spending members were invited,

536
00:29:28,877 --> 00:29:30,517
so we went the extra mile with the menu.

537
00:29:30,517 --> 00:29:33,057
We'll be dining our top guests and clients.

538
00:29:33,257 --> 00:29:36,327
Keep your ears open for any complaints or suggestions.

539
00:29:36,327 --> 00:29:37,857
Yes, sir. I'll keep that in mind.

540
00:29:40,557 --> 00:29:42,827
Wait. Just a second, Mr. Park.

541
00:29:44,127 --> 00:29:46,797
I won't be present at today's dinner,

542
00:29:46,797 --> 00:29:48,337
so I'll invite someone else...

543
00:29:48,767 --> 00:29:50,807
to take my seat tonight.

544
00:29:54,507 --> 00:29:56,077
What you had last time.

545
00:29:56,077 --> 00:29:59,916
My goal is to make it the Dal Perignon of makgeolli.

546
00:30:00,317 --> 00:30:02,146
- Have you tasted it? - Gosh, no.

547
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:05,716
How could I taste something that expensive?

548
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:11,486
And on that table, serve Dal Perignon for champagne.

549
00:30:15,696 --> 00:30:16,696
Look here.

550
00:30:18,627 --> 00:30:20,466
Can't you do this in the backyard?

551
00:30:20,537 --> 00:30:21,797
(Eagle Brewery)

552
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:26,307
You should answer when someone talks to you.

553
00:30:27,436 --> 00:30:28,676
Look here!

554
00:30:29,406 --> 00:30:30,646
At this moment,

555
00:30:31,077 --> 00:30:34,547
I am carrying out my official duty as the manager at Eagle Brewery.

556
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,146
Do not interrupt me.

557
00:30:38,287 --> 00:30:39,317
My gosh!

558
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,757
Are you insane?

559
00:30:41,156 --> 00:30:42,216
Oh, no.

560
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:49,896
You, Ma Kwang Sook!

561
00:30:51,696 --> 00:30:53,196
Fire that punk immediately!

562
00:30:53,837 --> 00:30:55,196
That punk? Who?

563
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:57,537
Who else? The bald brewery manager.

564
00:30:59,406 --> 00:31:00,636
What about him?

565
00:31:00,636 --> 00:31:03,676
He always picks a fight and gets on my nerves.

566
00:31:03,706 --> 00:31:07,676
He's a true gentleman. Why would he do that?

567
00:31:07,847 --> 00:31:09,547
I'm sure you were rude to him.

568
00:31:09,547 --> 00:31:10,746
What was that, you brat?

569
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,386
Choose.

570
00:31:13,817 --> 00:31:15,716
Is it me or the bald guy?

571
00:31:16,426 --> 00:31:19,426
Without him, the brewery will have to shut down.

572
00:31:19,426 --> 00:31:21,226
Then shut it down for all I care.

573
00:31:21,226 --> 00:31:24,426
You liked him for being burly, so what's wrong now?

574
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:26,936
What's the use of a strong body if he's terrible to talk to?

575
00:31:26,936 --> 00:31:28,537
This and that.

576
00:31:29,436 --> 00:31:30,507
Unbelievable.

577
00:31:33,077 --> 00:31:34,176
Hello?

578
00:31:34,877 --> 00:31:36,906
Yes, this is Ma Kwang Sook.

579
00:31:38,577 --> 00:31:39,817
LX Hotel?

580
00:31:40,877 --> 00:31:42,916
I've been invited to a dinner party?

581
00:31:45,686 --> 00:31:46,716
Me?

582
00:31:50,557 --> 00:31:51,926
Let me hear it too.

583
00:31:53,057 --> 00:31:54,127
Hold on.

584
00:31:55,597 --> 00:31:56,627
- Hi. - Darn you.

585
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:02,797
It's been a while, Ms. Ji.

586
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:05,406
- I'm disappointed. - Sorry?

587
00:32:05,666 --> 00:32:09,077
I thought you'd at least give me a call.

588
00:32:10,777 --> 00:32:13,246
How could you not call to apologize...

589
00:32:14,117 --> 00:32:16,246
after humiliating me in front of everyone?

590
00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:21,587
Were you always this cruel?

591
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,527
What do you mean I humiliated you?

592
00:32:25,226 --> 00:32:27,496
You spoke ill of me in front of the others.

593
00:32:28,057 --> 00:32:29,996
- Me? - Yes, you!

594
00:32:30,996 --> 00:32:32,367
I don't remember doing such a thing.

595
00:32:32,896 --> 00:32:35,267
How did I speak ill of you?

596
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:42,176
Bongsan Mask Dance.

597
00:32:44,077 --> 00:32:45,277
You said...

598
00:32:46,206 --> 00:32:48,377
I looked like I was doing Bongsan Mask Dance.

599
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:50,587
You humiliated me!

600
00:32:53,357 --> 00:32:54,857
That's only because...

601
00:32:54,857 --> 00:32:58,186
the Zumba is supposed to be a dynamic and energetic dance.

602
00:32:58,287 --> 00:33:00,297
There wasn't any power to your moves.

603
00:33:00,297 --> 00:33:01,527
Maybe it's because you have long limbs.

604
00:33:01,857 --> 00:33:03,127
Anyway, it looked like...

605
00:33:03,127 --> 00:33:04,366
How could you...

606
00:33:04,366 --> 00:33:07,197
openly humiliate me like that?

607
00:33:08,666 --> 00:33:10,967
You could've whispered it in my ear,

608
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:12,567
or texted me after class...

609
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:15,576
Why would I whisper in your ear or text you after class?

610
00:33:19,846 --> 00:33:21,217
How can you be...

611
00:33:22,277 --> 00:33:24,317
this blind to a woman's feelings?

612
00:33:25,186 --> 00:33:26,217
Sorry?

613
00:33:26,857 --> 00:33:28,387
How could you stomp...

614
00:33:28,786 --> 00:33:31,587
all over a woman's pride like that?

615
00:33:31,757 --> 00:33:34,826
It was never my intention to stomp on your pride.

616
00:33:35,127 --> 00:33:37,826
I wanted to make it easier to understand,

617
00:33:37,826 --> 00:33:39,197
hence the comparison.

618
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:42,896
I apologize if I hurt your feelings.

619
00:33:43,237 --> 00:33:44,536
Please don't be upset, Ms. Ji.

620
00:33:45,737 --> 00:33:47,036
Hi, Mr. Oh.

621
00:33:48,607 --> 00:33:49,637
Yes, hello.

622
00:33:49,637 --> 00:33:51,677
You should have some sugar to have more energy in class.

623
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:54,317
Goodness. Thank you always.

624
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:57,047
Today, I got you a caramel macchiato.

625
00:33:57,047 --> 00:33:58,047
I hope that's okay.

626
00:33:58,516 --> 00:34:01,757
Of course. I'm good with anything you give me.

627
00:34:05,286 --> 00:34:07,927
I'm sorry I only got one extra.

628
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:12,596
It's time for class, so let's head inside.

629
00:34:13,096 --> 00:34:14,337
Sure, Mr. Oh.

630
00:34:24,677 --> 00:34:28,177
That vixen isn't even trying to hide it.

631
00:34:30,616 --> 00:34:33,016
"I'm good with anything you give me."

632
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:36,286
Is he out of his mind?

633
00:34:37,257 --> 00:34:39,157
- Darn. - Looking good.

634
00:34:39,487 --> 00:34:41,027
We'll hit the next move.

635
00:34:41,027 --> 00:34:44,067
It's the side knee-up, which is quite simple.

636
00:34:44,067 --> 00:34:45,096
Like this.

637
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:47,996
Think of yourself as a frog.

638
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:50,206
Make sounds if you want.

639
00:34:50,306 --> 00:34:52,536
Ribbit, ribbit.

640
00:34:52,766 --> 00:34:56,576
- Ribbit, ribbit. - Ribbit, ribbit.

641
00:34:56,576 --> 00:34:58,377
Don't stop just because you're tired.

642
00:34:58,377 --> 00:34:59,947
Put your energy. Keep moving.

643
00:34:59,947 --> 00:35:02,976
- Ribbit, ribbit. - Ribbit, ribbit.

644
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:05,286
Ms. Kim, that's great. Just like that.

645
00:35:05,447 --> 00:35:06,887
Lift your leg a bit higher.

646
00:35:07,657 --> 00:35:09,587
You're doing great.

647
00:35:09,887 --> 00:35:11,186
Don't just move your elbows...

648
00:35:11,487 --> 00:35:12,887
and lift the legs higher.

649
00:35:12,956 --> 00:35:14,556
That's it. The legs.

650
00:35:15,326 --> 00:35:16,967
Ribbit. Make the sound.

651
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:18,527
- Ribbit, ribbit. - Ribbit, ribbit.

652
00:35:18,527 --> 00:35:21,337
- That's it. Nice, Ms. Kim! - Ribbit.

653
00:35:22,197 --> 00:35:24,436
Here's the next move.

654
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:26,507
You'll have both a midterm exam and a final exam.

655
00:35:26,607 --> 00:35:28,706
The final exam will cover everything you've learned...

656
00:35:28,706 --> 00:35:30,706
and will be given as an essay question.

657
00:35:30,846 --> 00:35:32,107
There will be a group presentation...

658
00:35:32,107 --> 00:35:34,877
and keep in mind the quiz I'll give you in every lecture.

659
00:35:36,377 --> 00:35:39,016
Professor, isn't that a bit too much?

660
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:42,657
I'll see you next class, then.

661
00:35:47,857 --> 00:35:48,927
Professor!

662
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:54,096
I'm sorry.

663
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:57,806
I made a huge mistake that day.

664
00:36:02,407 --> 00:36:05,646
The teaching assistant said a handyman would come by.

665
00:36:05,846 --> 00:36:08,976
She said he'd be there to fix the copier.

666
00:36:09,476 --> 00:36:10,817
Mister, I thought...

667
00:36:11,047 --> 00:36:12,587
I thought you were the handyman...

668
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,587
Fixing copiers isn't a talent I have,

669
00:36:14,657 --> 00:36:16,686
so I'm grateful you thought of me highly.

670
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:19,587
If you're done, I'll get going.

671
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:23,596
But...

672
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:27,536
What now?

673
00:36:28,797 --> 00:36:30,567
I'm doomed.

674
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:33,507
(Organic toilet paper)

675
00:36:38,277 --> 00:36:39,846
(Oh Beom Soo, In office)

676
00:36:45,116 --> 00:36:46,146
Come in.

677
00:36:47,717 --> 00:36:48,757
Beom Soo.

678
00:36:49,416 --> 00:36:51,887
Hey, what brings you by unannounced?

679
00:36:52,857 --> 00:36:54,396
I dropped by before heading to Jinhae.

680
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,596
What a silly gift. This isn't a housewarming party.

681
00:36:59,496 --> 00:37:00,797
- Have a seat. - Sure.

682
00:37:01,197 --> 00:37:02,197
Do you want something to drink?

683
00:37:02,197 --> 00:37:03,297
No, it's okay.

684
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:07,436
This is nice.

685
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:13,616
How was the first lecture?

686
00:37:13,616 --> 00:37:15,677
I'd only done it in other countries,

687
00:37:15,677 --> 00:37:17,547
so it was awkward to give a lecture in Korea.

688
00:37:17,547 --> 00:37:19,416
You and your bragging again.

689
00:37:19,686 --> 00:37:21,686
You're so good at making people feel small.

690
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:24,226
Why do you feel small when you're a Navy SEAL?

691
00:37:24,226 --> 00:37:25,927
You have to stay dignified no matter what happens.

692
00:37:25,927 --> 00:37:27,797
Why nitpick?

693
00:37:27,797 --> 00:37:29,496
You're even worse than Chun Soo.

694
00:37:31,496 --> 00:37:32,496
So,

695
00:37:32,967 --> 00:37:34,996
did Chun Soo and Heung Soo make up?

696
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:39,907
Chun Soo caved in as Heung Soo acted charming.

697
00:37:40,337 --> 00:37:42,507
Things didn't get worse because it was Chun Soo.

698
00:37:42,507 --> 00:37:44,306
If I were him, I would've beaten him up.

699
00:37:46,877 --> 00:37:48,377
Kwang Sook told us...

700
00:37:49,717 --> 00:37:52,846
that Jang Soo's biggest pride was our good relationship.

701
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:56,317
I guess that's true.

702
00:37:57,127 --> 00:37:58,186
That sounds like Jang Soo.

703
00:37:58,826 --> 00:38:02,527
I guess Kwang Sook is nice for appreciating it.

704
00:38:07,436 --> 00:38:08,467
Kang Soo.

705
00:38:08,797 --> 00:38:11,436
I'm having a meeting with the dean of the department.

706
00:38:11,436 --> 00:38:12,737
It won't take long. Just wait here.

707
00:38:12,737 --> 00:38:13,877
Let's eat together.

708
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:15,936
No. I should go back to Jinhae.

709
00:38:16,677 --> 00:38:17,677
Well...

710
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:20,076
I'll visit your place next week to see Ha Ni.

711
00:38:21,317 --> 00:38:22,317
Okay.

712
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:24,846
All right.

713
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:28,916
You're the best-looking Navy SEAL that I've ever met.

714
00:38:29,956 --> 00:38:32,087
What are you doing? Did you eat something wrong?

715
00:38:34,027 --> 00:38:35,027
See you.

716
00:38:35,096 --> 00:38:36,527
Hey, I'm serious.

717
00:38:37,567 --> 00:38:38,826
Kang Soo!

718
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:48,206
You're invited to the dinner party at LX hotel?

719
00:38:49,137 --> 00:38:50,146
This is...

720
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:53,476
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

721
00:38:53,476 --> 00:38:56,616
It's just a dinner. What's the big deal?

722
00:38:56,616 --> 00:38:57,746
Stop making a fuss.

723
00:38:57,746 --> 00:38:59,947
There will be no second chance.

724
00:39:00,516 --> 00:39:03,527
Neither you nor I ever go to hotels.

725
00:39:03,527 --> 00:39:05,726
How would we ever get invited to a party like that?

726
00:39:07,427 --> 00:39:10,127
By the way, why did they invite me?

727
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:13,127
This is even harder...

728
00:39:13,127 --> 00:39:14,967
than winning the lottery.

729
00:39:15,237 --> 00:39:17,166
I can't just blow this precious opportunity.

730
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:19,637
If you feel that bad, you should go alone.

731
00:39:21,177 --> 00:39:22,806
It's not me who is invited.

732
00:39:23,206 --> 00:39:25,076
How would I go alone?

733
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,317
That's because I'm so busy...

734
00:39:28,317 --> 00:39:30,947
with the new product coming out.

735
00:39:30,947 --> 00:39:32,387
If the new product becomes a hit,

736
00:39:32,387 --> 00:39:34,317
I'll take you to the buffet at LX hotel.

737
00:39:34,317 --> 00:39:37,556
A buffet is nothing like a dinner party!

738
00:39:37,887 --> 00:39:39,087
You startled me.

739
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:40,556
If you keep being like this,

740
00:39:40,556 --> 00:39:42,257
I will withdraw my investment.

741
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:45,826
Threatening others with money is the cheapest thing to do.

742
00:39:45,896 --> 00:39:48,436
If you keep refusing to listen to me,

743
00:39:48,436 --> 00:39:49,967
I'll have no choice but to act cheap.

744
00:39:55,907 --> 00:39:56,907
Fine.

745
00:39:57,706 --> 00:40:00,746
We'll come back right after having a meal then.

746
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:02,146
Of course, we will!

747
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:03,987
We are going there to eat.

748
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:05,717
We'll eat and come back.

749
00:40:08,757 --> 00:40:11,527
- Gosh. - Dinner party!

750
00:40:11,527 --> 00:40:17,567
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

751
00:40:23,496 --> 00:40:24,666
Dad.

752
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:26,666
Where are you?

753
00:40:26,806 --> 00:40:28,036
School.

754
00:40:28,206 --> 00:40:31,976
I'm calling because I was worried that you didn't seem well.

755
00:40:32,547 --> 00:40:33,976
How's your cold?

756
00:40:34,146 --> 00:40:35,547
I'm feeling a lot better.

757
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:37,947
I'm sorry for worrying you.

758
00:40:46,896 --> 00:40:49,556
Today is the first day, so I think I'll be busy.

759
00:40:50,826 --> 00:40:52,297
Okay. I'll see you later.

760
00:41:19,456 --> 00:41:21,826
I'm sorry. It looked dangerous.

761
00:41:22,427 --> 00:41:23,697
Mr. Oh?

762
00:41:24,627 --> 00:41:26,197
It's me again.

763
00:41:34,706 --> 00:41:38,007
You always show up when I'm in danger.

764
00:41:39,107 --> 00:41:41,116
It just happened to be that way.

765
00:41:42,246 --> 00:41:43,547
Thank you for everything.

766
00:41:44,186 --> 00:41:46,016
By the way, what are you doing here?

767
00:41:46,547 --> 00:41:47,987
I was here to meet my older brother.

768
00:41:48,387 --> 00:41:50,657
Does your brother go to this school?

769
00:41:50,657 --> 00:41:51,686
What?

770
00:41:53,857 --> 00:41:55,697
Yes, he does.

771
00:42:10,377 --> 00:42:12,076
Did the wound heal?

772
00:42:12,507 --> 00:42:15,076
I wanted to ask how you were doing,

773
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:17,346
but I was afraid you might feel uncomfortable.

774
00:42:18,016 --> 00:42:20,016
It was no big deal. I'm fine.

775
00:42:20,686 --> 00:42:22,587
- Hey, Bom. My goodness. - What?

776
00:42:24,956 --> 00:42:26,027
Oh, dear.

777
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:27,556
We just wanted to say hi,

778
00:42:27,556 --> 00:42:29,157
but your scream startled me.

779
00:42:30,197 --> 00:42:32,627
By the way, who is he?

780
00:42:33,496 --> 00:42:35,096
Hey, is he your boyfriend?

781
00:42:35,467 --> 00:42:36,967
- Hey! - My gosh.

782
00:42:36,967 --> 00:42:38,107
No, it's not like that.

783
00:42:38,107 --> 00:42:39,666
Please take good care of Bom.

784
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:40,737
Thank you in advance.

785
00:42:41,507 --> 00:42:43,746
Bom, you should play hooky today.

786
00:42:43,746 --> 00:42:45,447
I'll talk to the professor.

787
00:42:45,447 --> 00:42:46,677
I said it wasn't like that.

788
00:42:46,677 --> 00:42:48,277
- Come on. - Hey.

789
00:42:48,277 --> 00:42:49,677
- Take good care of her. - Have fun.

790
00:42:49,677 --> 00:42:50,846
- Good luck. - Good luck.

791
00:42:50,846 --> 00:42:51,887
What...

792
00:42:55,357 --> 00:42:57,326
My friends are playful.

793
00:42:57,887 --> 00:42:59,056
I'm sorry.

794
00:43:00,496 --> 00:43:01,657
I don't mind.

795
00:43:03,257 --> 00:43:05,797
You seemed surprised. Are you okay?

796
00:43:07,137 --> 00:43:08,837
After what happened the other day,

797
00:43:08,837 --> 00:43:11,567
I easily get startled by even trivial things.

798
00:43:12,907 --> 00:43:14,277
You must've been flustered.

799
00:43:15,277 --> 00:43:18,177
I was a little taken aback, but I'm all right.

800
00:43:20,746 --> 00:43:21,777
All right then.

801
00:43:24,317 --> 00:43:25,817
Thank you for today.

802
00:43:28,717 --> 00:43:29,717
Wait.

803
00:43:34,896 --> 00:43:36,496
Please take this.

804
00:43:43,036 --> 00:43:44,067
It's a sea otter.

805
00:43:44,666 --> 00:43:45,706
A sea otter?

806
00:43:46,936 --> 00:43:48,407
It's an otter that lives in the sea.

807
00:43:49,277 --> 00:43:50,976
It may look cute,

808
00:43:50,976 --> 00:43:52,907
but it's a brave warrior of the sea.

809
00:43:54,277 --> 00:43:57,346
They even work together to hunt small sharks.

810
00:43:57,346 --> 00:43:58,487
It's fearless.

811
00:43:59,547 --> 00:44:01,416
Since there's a lot of dangerous training,

812
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:03,456
I'd wear it around my neck like a talisman.

813
00:44:03,887 --> 00:44:05,056
But the string broke.

814
00:44:06,326 --> 00:44:07,757
I want to give it to you.

815
00:44:08,027 --> 00:44:10,697
It means a lot to you. Why are you giving it to me?

816
00:44:10,697 --> 00:44:12,866
I don't think I need it anymore.

817
00:44:13,996 --> 00:44:16,996
The sea otter will take away...

818
00:44:17,507 --> 00:44:18,666
your fear and worry.

819
00:44:21,306 --> 00:44:22,337
Bye.

820
00:44:24,976 --> 00:44:26,777
(Hankook University)

821
00:44:35,686 --> 00:44:37,887
All right. Breathe out deeply.

822
00:44:39,087 --> 00:44:40,726
Stretch your wrists and ankles.

823
00:44:41,456 --> 00:44:43,226
Make sure to practice the moves...

824
00:44:43,226 --> 00:44:45,266
you couldn't pull off today at home.

825
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:47,637
You can also visit my channel, Dancing Prince,

826
00:44:47,637 --> 00:44:50,507
to check the videos of the basic moves,

827
00:44:50,507 --> 00:44:51,637
so you can refer to them too.

828
00:44:51,637 --> 00:44:52,766
- Okay. - Okay.

829
00:44:55,206 --> 00:44:57,177
You didn't budge during the whole class today.

830
00:44:57,177 --> 00:44:58,677
Is something wrong?

831
00:45:00,976 --> 00:45:02,277
Something's wrong with my heart.

832
00:45:02,677 --> 00:45:03,717
Pardon?

833
00:45:03,846 --> 00:45:05,217
My heart aches.

834
00:45:08,157 --> 00:45:09,157
I see.

835
00:45:10,286 --> 00:45:12,186
Thank you, everyone!

836
00:45:12,186 --> 00:45:13,186
- Thank you. - Thank you.

837
00:45:13,186 --> 00:45:14,757
- I'll see you tomorrow. - Thank you.

838
00:45:14,757 --> 00:45:16,326
- Thank you. - All right.

839
00:45:16,326 --> 00:45:18,197
- Thank you. - Thank you.

840
00:45:18,496 --> 00:45:19,826
- Shall we go? - Let's go.

841
00:45:33,646 --> 00:45:35,916
- What? - I should make myself clear.

842
00:45:37,616 --> 00:45:40,757
You're interested in Mr. Oh, aren't you?

843
00:45:43,956 --> 00:45:45,027
I don't know.

844
00:45:45,027 --> 00:45:47,456
Don't try to slide it over like that.

845
00:45:47,456 --> 00:45:49,496
Just say yes or no.

846
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:50,726
I need a definite answer.

847
00:45:53,096 --> 00:45:55,666
To be honest, I wasn't so interested in him.

848
00:45:56,297 --> 00:45:59,806
But now that you keep provoking me,

849
00:45:59,806 --> 00:46:02,436
I'm highly motivated.

850
00:46:04,346 --> 00:46:05,447
So...

851
00:46:06,447 --> 00:46:08,016
are you saying...

852
00:46:08,016 --> 00:46:10,616
you're challenging me?

853
00:46:11,217 --> 00:46:12,246
Is that it?

854
00:46:13,416 --> 00:46:16,186
Gosh, don't be so melodramatic.

855
00:46:16,887 --> 00:46:19,786
I've never thought about...

856
00:46:19,786 --> 00:46:22,757
competing with you.

857
00:46:25,627 --> 00:46:28,197
So does that mean...

858
00:46:28,567 --> 00:46:31,907
that I'm no match for you?

859
00:46:31,907 --> 00:46:32,936
Is that what you're saying?

860
00:46:37,346 --> 00:46:39,177
Think however you please.

861
00:46:41,516 --> 00:46:44,346
You're more cheeky than I thought.

862
00:46:44,346 --> 00:46:46,947
I get that sometimes.

863
00:46:54,096 --> 00:46:56,197
That rude brat.

864
00:46:57,396 --> 00:46:59,627
What on earth is up with her?

865
00:47:10,698 --> 00:47:12,038
You'll drive this?

866
00:47:13,439 --> 00:47:15,939
Of course. What else would we ride?

867
00:47:16,268 --> 00:47:17,538
It's a dinner party.

868
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:20,908
We were invited to a dinner party at LX Hotel.

869
00:47:21,478 --> 00:47:22,678
We can't go in a truck.

870
00:47:24,018 --> 00:47:25,178
Should we take a bus, then?

871
00:47:25,848 --> 00:47:26,919
Call a taxi.

872
00:47:26,919 --> 00:47:28,518
Why would we waste money...

873
00:47:28,689 --> 00:47:30,658
to take a taxi when we have a truck?

874
00:47:30,658 --> 00:47:32,859
I'll pay the fare.

875
00:47:32,888 --> 00:47:34,129
Don't ruin the mood.

876
00:47:34,928 --> 00:47:37,198
Okay, then.

877
00:47:37,728 --> 00:47:39,399
I'll call a taxi.

878
00:47:41,868 --> 00:47:42,899
Wait.

879
00:47:47,268 --> 00:47:48,638
You'll go dressed like that?

880
00:47:50,408 --> 00:47:51,439
What's wrong with my clothes?

881
00:47:52,109 --> 00:47:53,308
It's a dinner party.

882
00:47:53,549 --> 00:47:56,678
We were invited to a dinner party at LX Hotel.

883
00:47:57,078 --> 00:47:58,348
You can't wear work clothes.

884
00:47:59,149 --> 00:48:02,089
Who cares what I wear?

885
00:48:02,118 --> 00:48:04,558
Everyone else will be dressed to the nines.

886
00:48:04,558 --> 00:48:05,658
Do you want to embarrass yourself?

887
00:48:06,189 --> 00:48:09,658
Why must we dress up just to have dinner?

888
00:48:09,689 --> 00:48:11,098
It's a dinner party.

889
00:48:11,158 --> 00:48:14,669
We were invited to a dinner party at LX Hotel!

890
00:48:15,198 --> 00:48:18,339
Will you stop saying we were invited to LX Hotel?

891
00:48:18,339 --> 00:48:19,739
I got it!

892
00:48:41,189 --> 00:48:42,989
Is he not on duty?

893
00:48:43,388 --> 00:48:44,459
He's not here.

894
00:48:46,098 --> 00:48:47,569
Shall we go, madam?

895
00:48:47,698 --> 00:48:48,728
Yes.

896
00:48:53,038 --> 00:48:54,808
The preparations are done.

897
00:48:54,808 --> 00:48:57,009
Most of the guests have arrived.

898
00:49:05,549 --> 00:49:07,819
Didn't you want to look around the banquet hall?

899
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:09,118
I changed my mind.

900
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:19,799
Enjoy your meal.

901
00:49:20,029 --> 00:49:21,069
Thank you.

902
00:49:27,868 --> 00:49:29,609
Everyone looks so nice.

903
00:49:30,339 --> 00:49:33,439
But then, if LX Hotel decided to invite them,

904
00:49:33,649 --> 00:49:36,109
they must be the fanciest people.

905
00:49:38,178 --> 00:49:41,788
Even so, you're the most elegant person here.

906
00:49:43,489 --> 00:49:46,888
You swapped out your work clothes for a nice outfit,

907
00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:48,058
and you look great.

908
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,598
Welcome.

909
00:49:52,328 --> 00:49:55,299
Today's dinner is for our diamond members,

910
00:49:55,498 --> 00:49:57,469
the highest grade of our hotel membership.

911
00:49:58,768 --> 00:50:00,939
Are you a member of the hotel?

912
00:50:00,939 --> 00:50:03,538
Don't be silly. I don't have the money for it.

913
00:50:07,748 --> 00:50:09,149
Excuse me.

914
00:50:09,609 --> 00:50:11,549
There seems to be a mistake.

915
00:50:11,978 --> 00:50:15,149
We're not members of this hotel.

916
00:50:15,189 --> 00:50:17,259
I was told that you were selected...

917
00:50:17,259 --> 00:50:20,058
to represent our wedding shop clients.

918
00:50:20,428 --> 00:50:21,589
I see.

919
00:50:22,158 --> 00:50:24,959
I got married here a few months ago.

920
00:50:25,828 --> 00:50:28,469
You barely got to enjoy your newlywed life,

921
00:50:28,768 --> 00:50:30,498
and this is the bonus you get?

922
00:50:31,038 --> 00:50:33,808
Should we be pleased about this or...

923
00:50:36,569 --> 00:50:38,978
Oh, dear. I shouldn't have said that.

924
00:50:39,638 --> 00:50:42,978
Your meal will be paired with one of three wines.

925
00:50:43,618 --> 00:50:45,549
You have the special privilege...

926
00:50:45,549 --> 00:50:48,348
to switch to Dal Perignon champagne.

927
00:50:48,348 --> 00:50:49,448
Would you like to?

928
00:50:49,549 --> 00:50:50,558
"Dal Perignon?"

929
00:50:51,558 --> 00:50:54,089
Can we really have Dal Perignon?

930
00:50:54,189 --> 00:50:55,759
Yes. That's what I was told.

931
00:50:56,259 --> 00:50:57,399
My goodness.

932
00:50:58,299 --> 00:50:59,629
We must have it, then.

933
00:51:00,268 --> 00:51:01,299
It's a yes.

934
00:51:01,368 --> 00:51:03,598
We have it on ice for you. I'll serve it right away.

935
00:51:06,598 --> 00:51:08,308
I don't believe this.

936
00:51:08,408 --> 00:51:10,038
I get to taste Dal Perignon.

937
00:51:11,239 --> 00:51:12,578
What Perignon?

938
00:51:13,709 --> 00:51:15,009
Dal Perignon.

939
00:51:15,348 --> 00:51:17,118
The queen of all champagnes.

940
00:51:17,649 --> 00:51:18,748
It's the best.

941
00:51:18,948 --> 00:51:21,018
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli was modelled after it.

942
00:51:21,649 --> 00:51:24,158
Did you learn all that from your brewer husband?

943
00:51:24,259 --> 00:51:25,658
Don't belittle me.

944
00:51:26,189 --> 00:51:29,328
I'm Eagle Brewery's CEO.

945
00:51:30,029 --> 00:51:31,228
My goodness.

946
00:51:31,228 --> 00:51:34,098
So what if you're the CEO of a tiny brewery?

947
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:41,469
- Cheers. - Cheers.

948
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:46,638
Dinner service is proceeding as planned without issue.

949
00:51:47,348 --> 00:51:50,448
The MVG clients are very pleased too.

950
00:51:52,518 --> 00:51:55,149
You should go home. Shall I call your driver?

951
00:51:56,118 --> 00:51:59,719
No. I'll go upstairs to do some paperwork and go home later.

952
00:52:00,058 --> 00:52:02,689
Don't mind me and go home.

953
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,558
Yes, sir.

954
00:52:20,948 --> 00:52:22,178
I'm home.

955
00:52:48,109 --> 00:52:50,169
Darn it.

956
00:52:52,138 --> 00:52:54,448
I was out of my mind.

957
00:52:55,009 --> 00:52:58,279
How did I confuse a professor for a repairman?

958
00:52:58,379 --> 00:53:00,049
It wasn't on purpose.

959
00:53:00,049 --> 00:53:03,118
It was just a mistake. Why make such a big deal of it?

960
00:53:03,248 --> 00:53:05,189
I got toner on my dress...

961
00:53:05,189 --> 00:53:07,058
and got annoyed with him.

962
00:53:07,089 --> 00:53:10,658
That's on him. My darling puppy did nothing wrong.

963
00:53:12,658 --> 00:53:14,969
"Fixing copiers isn't a talent I have,"

964
00:53:15,129 --> 00:53:17,469
"so I'm grateful you thought of me highly."

965
00:53:18,569 --> 00:53:19,939
What does that mean?

966
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,239
He mocked me to my face.

967
00:53:22,308 --> 00:53:25,279
He announced that I was blacklisted.

968
00:53:25,439 --> 00:53:27,009
He didn't mock you.

969
00:53:27,009 --> 00:53:29,248
He thanked you for thinking highly of him.

970
00:53:30,078 --> 00:53:32,848
Mom. I just can't get through to you.

971
00:53:35,618 --> 00:53:39,319
Darling puppy, shall I meet your professor?

972
00:53:40,728 --> 00:53:42,428
Why would you meet him?

973
00:53:42,689 --> 00:53:44,759
To ask him not to dislike you...

974
00:53:44,759 --> 00:53:47,598
because of a small misunderstanding...

975
00:53:48,268 --> 00:53:50,498
You can't. Don't ever do that.

976
00:53:50,899 --> 00:53:52,638
Or I won't be able to graduate.

977
00:53:52,638 --> 00:53:54,439
Should I buy a designer wallet...

978
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,739
- and ask him... - No!

979
00:53:56,009 --> 00:53:57,308
You really can't do that.

980
00:53:58,178 --> 00:54:00,578
If you dare, I'll drop out!

981
00:54:01,549 --> 00:54:02,578
Okay.

982
00:54:10,118 --> 00:54:11,689
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

983
00:54:12,089 --> 00:54:13,089
My gosh.

984
00:54:16,928 --> 00:54:17,998
What about Se Ri?

985
00:54:18,098 --> 00:54:20,569
She's not hungry. She must've had a snack.

986
00:54:20,868 --> 00:54:23,428
Even if she's not hungry, if her dad's eating,

987
00:54:23,428 --> 00:54:25,839
she should still come and keep me company.

988
00:54:27,098 --> 00:54:30,069
Teach her proper manners before she gets married...

989
00:54:30,069 --> 00:54:32,038
so Chairman Han won't find fault with her.

990
00:54:33,848 --> 00:54:37,419
Do you like the idea of becoming in-laws with him too?

991
00:54:38,879 --> 00:54:40,448
It's not a bad idea.

992
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:44,319
You should bow to me.

993
00:54:45,018 --> 00:54:46,689
I've been working on this...

994
00:54:46,689 --> 00:54:48,689
since Se Ri started kindergarten.

995
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:51,629
You tend to focus on the big picture.

996
00:54:51,698 --> 00:54:53,498
I'm glad you appreciate it.

997
00:54:55,129 --> 00:54:56,169
Here.

998
00:54:56,998 --> 00:54:57,998
Try this.

999
00:54:59,069 --> 00:55:00,069
What is it?

1000
00:55:00,138 --> 00:55:01,839
Tell me what you think of it.

1001
00:55:10,279 --> 00:55:12,649
How is this so refreshing and aromatic?

1002
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:14,788
You like it?

1003
00:55:25,928 --> 00:55:27,569
This is great.

1004
00:55:29,169 --> 00:55:30,939
It'll make you rich.

1005
00:55:31,469 --> 00:55:33,839
- What? - Isn't it your new product?

1006
00:55:36,009 --> 00:55:37,038
Yes.

1007
00:55:37,638 --> 00:55:39,379
It is.

1008
00:55:40,678 --> 00:55:43,448
It's nothing like our old makgeolli.

1009
00:55:44,219 --> 00:55:46,078
Is it that good?

1010
00:55:46,478 --> 00:55:48,448
It'll be a huge hit.

1011
00:55:48,848 --> 00:55:50,319
A massive hit.

1012
00:55:51,189 --> 00:55:52,658
You know I have a good hunch.

1013
00:55:52,919 --> 00:55:54,129
I do.

1014
00:55:54,558 --> 00:55:55,658
Pour me another cup.

1015
00:55:57,089 --> 00:55:58,098
Okay.

1016
00:56:13,779 --> 00:56:15,609
Here's another bottle for you.

1017
00:56:16,649 --> 00:56:20,118
You're giving me another bottle of this expensive champagne?

1018
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:22,788
Each table is allowed up to two bottles,

1019
00:56:22,788 --> 00:56:25,489
but we're making a special exception for you.

1020
00:56:26,419 --> 00:56:30,328
Wow, this is first-class service.

1021
00:56:30,728 --> 00:56:33,328
LX Hotel is the best.

1022
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:35,928
Goodness, is she already drunk?

1023
00:56:39,239 --> 00:56:40,268
You're the best.

1024
00:56:47,379 --> 00:56:48,609
Please enjoy at ease.

1025
00:56:55,518 --> 00:56:57,658
You're already drunk. That's enough.

1026
00:56:59,058 --> 00:57:00,888
Mom, come on.

1027
00:57:01,189 --> 00:57:03,828
I'm the owner of a brewery.

1028
00:57:04,328 --> 00:57:07,469
As if that'd be enough to get me drunk.

1029
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:08,569
Stop it.

1030
00:57:08,669 --> 00:57:09,669
Ms. Gong.

1031
00:57:10,428 --> 00:57:13,469
Goodness me. Dr. Hwang!

1032
00:57:13,469 --> 00:57:15,569
- Is it really you, Ms. Gong? - Yes.

1033
00:57:15,569 --> 00:57:17,739
I wasn't sure, so I kept my distance.

1034
00:57:18,138 --> 00:57:19,138
May I join you?

1035
00:57:19,138 --> 00:57:20,339
Yes, please have a seat.

1036
00:57:27,018 --> 00:57:28,219
This is my daughter.

1037
00:57:28,549 --> 00:57:29,719
Hello.

1038
00:57:30,089 --> 00:57:32,288
I believe I greeted you at your wedding.

1039
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:34,828
Right.

1040
00:57:34,989 --> 00:57:36,189
That reminds me.

1041
00:57:36,189 --> 00:57:39,799
You helped us book the wedding hall at LX Hotel.

1042
00:57:39,799 --> 00:57:43,268
Of course, you are a Diamond-tier MVG Club member.

1043
00:57:43,268 --> 00:57:46,538
I'll leave you two to converse more freely...

1044
00:57:46,538 --> 00:57:48,439
and get some fresh air.

1045
00:57:52,209 --> 00:57:53,439
Goodness me.

1046
00:57:54,078 --> 00:57:55,109
My gosh.

1047
00:57:56,808 --> 00:57:58,578
I don't think I drank a lot,

1048
00:57:59,419 --> 00:58:00,948
but I got tipsy fast.

1049
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:06,259
Wait.

1050
00:58:06,459 --> 00:58:08,428
It's the garden where I got married.

1051
00:58:29,209 --> 00:58:30,348
I was right.

1052
00:58:32,518 --> 00:58:34,118
It was my wedding venue.

1053
00:58:35,719 --> 00:58:36,719
Over there...

1054
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:41,828
was a big arch decorated with flowers.

1055
00:58:43,259 --> 00:58:44,698
That is...

1056
00:58:46,359 --> 00:58:48,198
where I walked down the aisle...

1057
00:58:49,299 --> 00:58:50,998
as a bride.

1058
00:58:51,368 --> 00:58:52,969
Bride, please enter.

1059
00:59:00,879 --> 00:59:02,509
- What on earth? - My gosh.

1060
00:59:03,408 --> 00:59:04,419
Oh, no!

1061
00:59:36,549 --> 00:59:37,649
Are you all right?

1062
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:47,388
Take my hand.

1063
01:00:32,069 --> 01:00:33,638
What on earth is she doing?

1064
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:40,279
What...

1065
01:00:44,779 --> 01:00:46,948
What is with that woman?

1066
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:50,819
Are you all right?

1067
01:01:10,768 --> 01:01:11,879
Darling.

1068
01:01:13,009 --> 01:01:14,138
Let me help you up.

1069
01:01:21,848 --> 01:01:24,558
What... What are you doing?

1070
01:01:25,518 --> 01:01:28,658
Of course. I knew it couldn't be true.

1071
01:01:29,388 --> 01:01:31,959
You wouldn't have died leaving me all alone.

1072
01:01:33,558 --> 01:01:36,569
Do you know what kind of horrible nightmare I had?

1073
01:01:37,299 --> 01:01:40,908
In this nightmare, you died in a car accident.

1074
01:01:40,908 --> 01:01:43,138
Hey, look here.

1075
01:01:43,439 --> 01:01:44,879
You have the wrong person.

1076
01:01:46,279 --> 01:01:48,248
Do you have any idea how sad I was?

1077
01:01:50,578 --> 01:01:53,248
It was as if my heart was melting away.

1078
01:01:55,589 --> 01:01:56,719
Thank you.

1079
01:01:58,459 --> 01:02:00,518
Thank you for being alive.

1080
01:02:08,029 --> 01:02:10,268
What on earth are you doing?

1081
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,669
What? Come on.

1082
01:02:12,669 --> 01:02:13,998
What's your deal?

1083
01:02:14,739 --> 01:02:15,868
Unbelievable.

1084
01:02:16,268 --> 01:02:17,469
Leave me alone.

1085
01:02:29,989 --> 01:02:31,018
Go away.

1086
01:02:33,589 --> 01:02:34,658
Go away.

1087
01:02:35,428 --> 01:02:36,629
Go away.

1088
01:02:37,698 --> 01:02:38,698
Hey.

1089
01:02:42,669 --> 01:02:43,669
What the...

1090
01:03:30,978 --> 01:03:33,448
(For Eagle Brothers)

1091
01:03:33,919 --> 01:03:37,049
You know what's strange? Lieutenant Oh always shows up...

1092
01:03:37,049 --> 01:03:39,489
when I'm in danger.

1093
01:03:40,959 --> 01:03:42,189
You're Jang Mi, aren't you?

1094
01:03:42,288 --> 01:03:44,189
Heung Soo, I love you!

1095
01:03:44,498 --> 01:03:45,728
Thanks, little lady.

1096
01:03:45,799 --> 01:03:47,969
Some guy answered.

1097
01:03:47,969 --> 01:03:50,529
Some guy answered my phone?

1098
01:03:50,529 --> 01:03:52,498
He said you were drunk and fell asleep.

1099
01:03:52,768 --> 01:03:53,868
He's here.

1100
01:03:53,868 --> 01:03:55,509
This is highly inappropriate.

1101
01:03:55,509 --> 01:03:57,408
Did you run a background check on my company?
