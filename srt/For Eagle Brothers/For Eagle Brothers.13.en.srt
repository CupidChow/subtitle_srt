1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:03,210
(Children and teenagers were filmed
under production guidelines.)

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,010
(Episode 13)

3
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,160
I knew you'd be like this.

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,160
How long have you been out here?

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,860
I'm too mortified
to face Kwang Sook.

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,300
I had no idea...

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,400
So Yeon would chew her out
at the hotel.

8
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,940
Unaware of that, I bothered her...

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:34,110
by asking her to meet Seon Ah.

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,440
Who's Seon Ah?

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:37,510
What?

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,540
Oh, her.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,510
I'll tell you later on.

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,020
Why aren't you coming in?

15
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:00,170
What brings you all by unannounced?

16
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,870
Is something up?

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,170
It's nothing alarming.

18
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,540
We just had something to say
to Kwang Sook.

19
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,870
I see. She was aching all over,

20
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,380
so she took some medicine
and went to bed.

21
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,380
She could be asleep.

22
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:15,450
You should head inside.

23
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,550
- Right.
- Right.

24
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,290
Kwang Sook, it's us.

25
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:30,230
(Have a broad mind,
and have big hopes.)

26
00:01:30,230 --> 00:01:31,360
Hi, guys.

27
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,670
We must've woken you up.

28
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,400
No, I was only lying down.

29
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,180
Kwang Sook.

30
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,910
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,520
I'm ashamed.

32
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,530
Chun Soo, what's the matter?

33
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,430
Let's talk while seated comfortably.

34
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,800
Everyone, have a seat.

35
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,500
Let's sit.

36
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,680
My wife told me.

37
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,780
You must've been alarmed
and also upset.

38
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,820
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,220
She was never this disrespectful,

40
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,620
so this is all on me.

41
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,690
It's my fault.

42
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,290
I was taken aback
and was angry with her earlier,

43
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,960
but after I got thinking at home,

44
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,230
I understood her point.

45
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,970
The brewery had been
in the family for generations...

46
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:45,570
starting with your grandfather.

47
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,570
But now,

48
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,640
I happened to take it over
when I'm a stranger to this family.

49
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,280
It's understandable for someone
who didn't know the situation...

50
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,250
to be mistaken.

51
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,890
I tried to explain
what had happened,

52
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,250
but she wasn't having it.

53
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,690
Even before So Yeon went to the US,

54
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,560
she couldn't care less
about our family.

55
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:10,300
She wasn't even
at Jang Soo's funeral.

56
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,100
But now she wants a piece
of the brewery?

57
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,700
You've got to be kidding me.

58
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,500
I've been keeping quiet
for the sake of Chun Soo.

59
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,410
But his wife?

60
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,710
To be honest, it'd be a stretch
to even call her family.

61
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,510
Unbelievable.

62
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,550
I believe it's to get more alimony.

63
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,090
- Alimony?
- Alimony?

64
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,960
She wants a divorce.

65
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,660
Has So Yeon lost her mind?

66
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,660
Heung Soo!

67
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,060
Darn.

68
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,270
She seems to have been struggling
with money for a while.

69
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,000
Apparently, she even waited tables.

70
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,270
I did the best I could,

71
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,040
but it probably wasn't enough.

72
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,180
She's been upset and disappointed.

73
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,710
That's why she's being unreasonable.

74
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,350
I'll meet with my wife again
and talk to her.

75
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,460
Anger is causing her
to be disrespectful.

76
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,260
She's never been this unreasonable.

77
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,030
I'll be able to talk to her
once she calms down.

78
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,430
How can I help?

79
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,430
I can't sell the brewery
at this moment,

80
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,540
but maybe I could help pay...

81
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,210
for Yeoung Ju's education
and living expenses...

82
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,740
No, that's not what I meant.

83
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,280
What nonsense is this?

84
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,210
Mom.

85
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,050
She took over the brewery
that was going under...

86
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,750
and should be praised
for her achievements.

87
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,120
But now she'll even pay...

88
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,620
for your daughter's education
and living expenses?

89
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,030
You, Ma Kwang Sook!
Have you lost it?

90
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,290
It's not like that, Mom.

91
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,500
As if!

92
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,700
How dare you leech off my daughter?

93
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,400
Don't you think it's just too much?

94
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,610
The fact that she became a widow...

95
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,810
after just ten days of marriage
keeps me up at night,

96
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,810
but now you want her to take care...

97
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,710
of her brother-in-law's wife
and daughter?

98
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:12,020
No one in their right mind
would demand that.

99
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,290
Kwang Sook only said that
out of concern,

100
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,360
but that will never happen.

101
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:20,160
I give you my word.
That will never happen, Ms. Gong.

102
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,890
How did my one and only daughter...

103
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,730
become someone the Oh family
takes advantage of?

104
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,440
It has me fuming
every time I'm reminded of it!

105
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,710
What's wrong with you, Mom? Stop it.

106
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,870
Why should I stop?

107
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,940
Why should I stop
when I'm finally saying...

108
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,280
what I've been forced to bottle up?

109
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,480
If I'm to say everything on my mind,

110
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,950
it'd take at least 100 days,
you brat!

111
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,790
Leave, Mom. Please.

112
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,790
Let go!

113
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,090
My daughter...

114
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,160
isn't someone
you can take advantage of.

115
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,300
Stop leeching off her!

116
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,870
Let go.

117
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,840
We didn't take advantage of her.

118
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,150
That was harsh of Ms. Gong.

119
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,820
She has every right
to think that way.

120
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,520
I'm sorry.

121
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,160
Come on.

122
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,260
It's all my fault.

123
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,930
How is this your fault?

124
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,360
Don't blame yourself when it's not.

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,100
Let go of me, you brat.

126
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,640
You're driving me crazy.

127
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,100
What was that?

128
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,310
They did nothing wrong.

129
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,810
I only offered out of concern.

130
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,240
You brat.

131
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,150
You go out of your way
to worry about your brothers-in-law.

132
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,790
How come you dismiss
your one and only mother like that?

133
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:56,420
All right, fine.

134
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,990
Once I make some profit,

135
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,920
I'll pay back your investment first.
Happy now?

136
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:02,630
Does it seem like that's my concern?

137
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,100
Do you think it's about the money?

138
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,630
My head is pounding as is,
so why are you making it worse?

139
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,970
Fine, you brat.

140
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,710
Have a good life
with your brothers-in-law.

141
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Mom!

142
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,080
Don't call me that, you brat.

143
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,610
But...

144
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,450
Shoot.

145
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:34,460
The one after the frog.

146
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,260
That is the tiger keelback.

147
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,800
Its beautiful, vivid pattern
earned it...

148
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,500
the nickname "kkotbaem."

149
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,140
The frog that wishes to survive...

150
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,970
and the snake that wants to eat it.

151
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,910
The ultimate chase begins.

152
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,950
This time around, the tiger keelback
was one step behind.

153
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:00,380
Again, it hunts its prey.

154
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,650
It approaches the frog in silence...

155
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,090
and snatches the frog by the leg.

156
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,360
My gosh.

157
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,070
That Ma Kwang Sook is a gold digger.

158
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,910
A gold digger like a venomous snake.

159
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:26,310
A venomous snake.

160
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,350
(Ma Kwang Sook, Tiger keelback)

161
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,580
Goodness me.

162
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:35,890
That's freaky.

163
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,060
Come in.

164
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,190
Have some fruit, Dad.

165
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,290
Thanks.

166
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:47,430
You met Professor Kim today?

167
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,900
Goodness.
Did she report to you already?

168
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,770
She speaks too freely
for a professor.

169
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,540
Come on, Dad.

170
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,410
Don't think of her so negatively.

171
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,440
Can you try to like her?

172
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,310
Let me make something very clear.

173
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,180
I'm not interested in
getting married again.

174
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,120
So don't get your hopes up.

175
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,860
Eat or be eaten.

176
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,890
The victor
in the cruel wilderness...

177
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,960
- A snake?
- That's the tiger keelback.

178
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,930
A tiger keelback.
Its nickname is "kkotbaem."

179
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:22,300
- Pumped full of venom...
- It's a horrifying thing.

180
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,700
If you ever come across this snake,

181
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,040
get away!

182
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,910
Darn it.

183
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,680
That might give me nightmares.

184
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,280
I'll get ready for bed.

185
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,750
Okay. Good night.

186
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:38,050
Sleep well, Bom.

187
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,820
My gosh.

188
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,700
- Gosh.
- A venomous snake.

189
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,830
What the heck?

190
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,230
A venomous snake.

191
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,670
Darn it.

192
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,500
It startled me.

193
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,570
Goodness.

194
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,340
I can't stop thinking about snakes
all day.

195
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,850
It's all because of Ma Kwang Sook.

196
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,920
Shoot.

197
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,250
Darn it.

198
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,360
I'm sorry for everything.

199
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,100
I'm too ashamed to speak.

200
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,500
We're family,
not complete strangers.

201
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,770
Why would you say that?

202
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,570
Here, we have friends and family,

203
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,510
and lots of people
to ask for help when we need it.

204
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,410
It's hard to find help overseas.

205
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,980
You have nothing
if you're out of money.

206
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,350
She would feel panicked...

207
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:46,720
if she were financially strapped.

208
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,690
Still, it's not right.

209
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:52,660
It's insubordination to ask you
for money as soon as she met you.

210
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,030
Watch your language.

211
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,290
Am I wrong?

212
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,660
She's ripping Kwang Sook off.

213
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,700
Heung Soo.

214
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,500
You lecture me whenever I speak.

215
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,370
This is insubordination too.

216
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,340
What?

217
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,210
- Shoot.
- Darn.

218
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,850
Meet up with your wife
and talk to her.

219
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,050
So you're left with no regrets.

220
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,050
Okay?

221
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,290
Okay.

222
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
Your mother...

223
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,990
seemed to be very angry.

224
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,060
It's okay.

225
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,260
I'll appease her so she comes round.

226
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,600
Let's all go so Kwang Sook can rest.

227
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,870
Don't come any further.

228
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,370
Good night.

229
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:39,540
Get home safely.

230
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,710
I'll see them off.

231
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
My gosh.

232
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,390
(Daughter)

233
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,420
Where did she go...

234
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,930
leaving her phone behind?

235
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,300
Have some kimchi.

236
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,200
It's just a snack.

237
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,540
Thanks.

238
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,980
Just now,

239
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,380
Chun Soo came to the brewery.
Did you see him?

240
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,350
He said he'd go to the US
to see his family.

241
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:29,650
He didn't. His wife flew in.

242
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,390
I see.

243
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,530
How did a sweetie like Chun Soo
marry a viper like her?

244
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,660
They're a bad match.

245
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,030
Chun Soo should've married you,
Mi Sun.

246
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,530
Don't be silly.

247
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,700
Why would you say that?

248
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,200
Don't act coy around me.

249
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,770
I saw you hang out as kids...

250
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,110
and go on so many dates.

251
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,310
We didn't go on dates.

252
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,520
It wasn't like that.

253
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,080
My gosh.

254
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,650
Welcome.

255
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,120
Hey.

256
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,130
What's the boss's mother doing here?

257
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,300
- What?
- She's the mother...

258
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,960
of Jang Soo's wife.

259
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,430
Oh, I see.

260
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,210
(Soju)

261
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:22,210
(Jerky)

262
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:29,810
That's 4 dollars 20 cents.

263
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,150
Thank you.

264
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,000
My gosh.

265
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,580
Ms. Ji!

266
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,360
Is someone here?

267
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:15,560
Open the door. It's me.

268
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,730
Mr. Oh.

269
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,770
My gosh.

270
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,980
Why did you come here
without calling ahead?

271
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:42,920
What's this for?

272
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,820
This is an official proposal.

273
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,060
Will you be Oh Heung Soo's muse?

274
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,670
You proposed to Ms. Kim today.

275
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,300
I was out of my mind then.

276
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,740
I thought about it at home.

277
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,370
The woman I love...

278
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,970
isn't Ms. Kim, but you, Ms. Ji.

279
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,040
Mr. Oh.

280
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,980
I apologize for not seeing
how you truly felt.

281
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,610
I'm truly sorry.

282
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,280
Oh, my goodness.

283
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,720
This isn't a dream, is it?

284
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,620
If it is, I can't wake from it.

285
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,430
It's not a dream.

286
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,660
It's real. It's happening.

287
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,200
You're right.

288
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,340
It's not a dream.

289
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,040
Will you take this?

290
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,540
Yes.

291
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,480
Of course, I'll take it.

292
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,920
Thank you.

293
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,860
I should thank you.

294
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,860
Thanks, Mr. Oh.

295
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,460
Thank you.

296
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:02,970
I upset you, didn't I?

297
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,470
I'm sorry.

298
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,740
It's okay.

299
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,770
You came around,

300
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,510
and I'm so relieved.

301
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,580
You were there all along.

302
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,010
An adorable and decent woman.

303
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,380
And I fell for a woman
who wore a mask.

304
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,620
I was out of my mind.

305
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,090
It wasn't your fault.

306
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,790
Ms. Kim, that evil woman.

307
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,900
She blocked your eyes and ears.

308
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,740
You are so understanding.

309
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,870
You're the woman I dreamed of.

310
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,840
Oh, gosh.

311
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,110
That hurt.

312
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,480
Mr. Oh.

313
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,050
Mr. Oh.

314
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,790
It was a dream?

315
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,530
It should've lasted longer, then.

316
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,930
I woke from it too soon.

317
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,010
All right.

318
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,090
I'll go and unpack the groceries.

319
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,190
Sleep well, okay?

320
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,410
They had a buy-3-and-get-1-free deal
at the supermarket, so I bought it.

321
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,610
I'm giving you
the extra can as a gift.

322
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,980
Thank you for your hard work today.

323
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,740
Why are you drinking beer
before going to bed?

324
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,180
I was thirsty.

325
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,110
- Mom.
- Yes?

326
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,050
About this woman.

327
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,150
Do you think she's marrying...

328
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:07,850
the chairman of Daeheung Group
for money?

329
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,050
Why else would she marry a man
who's 25 years older than her...

330
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,220
if it wasn't for money?

331
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,830
It's just obvious.

332
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,830
By the way, do you know her?

333
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,160
What?

334
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,030
You keep asking about her.

335
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,570
So I wonder
if she's someone you know.

336
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,610
How would I know her?

337
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,010
I just find it shocking.

338
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,810
What?

339
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,350
It's Gyeol.

340
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,410
How punctual.

341
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,020
He always calls you
at the same time every day.

342
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,020
Go ahead and pick it up.

343
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:47,490
Hi, Gyeol.

344
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,660
I'm going to Seoul this Saturday.

345
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,760
It's not that
I have any special plans though.

346
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,770
I just want to see you, Se Ri.

347
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,170
And I'd like to meet your parents...

348
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,640
since it's been a while.

349
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:03,970
Okay. I'll tell Mom.

350
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,210
I'll see you on Saturday then.

351
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:09,650
Is Gyeol coming to our place?

352
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:10,750
Yes.

353
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,780
He wants to say hello
to you and Dad.

354
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,780
My gosh.

355
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,220
I guess he will start acting
as our son-in-law.

356
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,590
How nice.

357
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,930
It's so good.

358
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,040
Honey!

359
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,340
Did a fire break out or what?
What's the fuss?

360
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,850
Gyeol is coming to our house
this Saturday.

361
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,580
Gyeol?

362
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,290
I guess he wants to start acting...

363
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,820
like our son-in-law.

364
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,090
Oh, boy.

365
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,390
I was worried he'd be just nice
but a little passive.

366
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,560
But that's not the case.

367
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,330
Give me your card.

368
00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:04,670
You have my card.

369
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,440
Not the one
with the limit of 500 dollars.

370
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,740
I want your black card.

371
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,510
What nonsense are you talking about?

372
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:12,580
They say
a son-in-law is forever a guest.

373
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,750
I need to get
a new tablecloth and curtains.

374
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,750
And I should buy
luxurious tableware.

375
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,080
I should do grocery shopping too.

376
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,250
Don't make such a big deal
out of it.

377
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,650
We will just offer what we eat...

378
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:24,120
and show him how we live
the way we do.

379
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,920
We should at least try to imitate
what his family does.

380
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,190
While trying to save a few pennies,
we might end up letting him...

381
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,760
look down on Se Ri
even before their wedding.

382
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:34,560
Darn it.

383
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,900
Are you possessed by a ghost
who died of frugality?

384
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,670
All you do is
think about spending more money.

385
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,840
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

386
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,910
My goodness.

387
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,020
That's right.

388
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,990
I wanted the brewery,

389
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:02,430
so I married a man
who would die young.

390
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,160
And I cajoled my brothers-in-law
with soft hearts...

391
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,660
into handing the brewery over to me.

392
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,960
Are you happy now?

393
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,510
It doesn't mean
anything complicated.

394
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,910
Marrying a wealthy man...

395
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,080
with a hidden agenda...

396
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,950
and taking the family assets
following his death?

397
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,850
That's the definition
of a gold digger.

398
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,330
Gosh, that really bothers me.

399
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,300
(Pot Number 4)

400
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,400
(Pot Number 2)

401
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,240
(Pot Number 3)

402
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:55,810
(Eagle Brewery)

403
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,490
Bye.

404
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,490
- Bye, Mr. Go.
- See you.

405
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,520
See you.

406
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,820
Look at her. She's dead.

407
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,760
She will freeze
if I let her sleep here.

408
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,030
Oh, dear.

409
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,940
Wake up. Come on.

410
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,370
Ma'am!

411
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,240
You should go home, okay?

412
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,150
I'm not going home.

413
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,720
I don't want to see Kwang Sook.
I'm not going home.

414
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,050
- Hey, go ahead and help her up.
- I'm not going.

415
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,420
- Oh, dear.
- My gosh.

416
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,690
Hello.

417
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,130
This won't do.
I should carry her on my back.

418
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,660
Are you going to be okay?

419
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,860
I'll be fine.

420
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,660
- Put her on my back.
- Be careful.

421
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,240
She's so light.

422
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,910
Does she live only on dew or what?

423
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,370
Do you want me to come with you?

424
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,710
It's okay.

425
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,080
Get home safely.

426
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,550
Bye.

427
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,620
(Mr. Go)

428
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,560
Hello, Mr. Go.

429
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,430
My mom?

430
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,770
I don't want to go home.

431
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:25,300
Let me off now!

432
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,740
Gosh, people might think
I'm kidnapping you.

433
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,280
Will you stay quiet?

434
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,080
I want to go back to Golden Castle.

435
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:43,150
Take me to Golden Castle, Baldy.

436
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,090
(Eagle Brewery)

437
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,190
Mom!

438
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:53,630
Where has she been drinking?

439
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,430
She drank soju and beer together...

440
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,200
at the convenience store.

441
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,370
My goodness.

442
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:59,570
You can put her down now.
She must be heavy.

443
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,140
It's easier this way. Let's just go.

444
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,340
Mom, wake up.

445
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,880
I'm not your mom!

446
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:07,440
I don't have a daughter like you.

447
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,450
Call me ma'am, you brat!

448
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,280
Gosh, you're driving me crazy.

449
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,120
- Wake up.
- I'll carry her.

450
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,190
It's all right. Let's just go. Go.

451
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:20,790
Run!

452
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:23,590
- Fine. I'm running.
- Run!

453
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:26,100
- I'm running.
- I can't believe this.

454
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,900
- Gosh.
- Unbelievable.

455
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,970
- Mom.
- Run.

456
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,540
- Gosh, Mom.
- Run.

457
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,310
Stop saying that. Come on, Ms. Gong.

458
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,670
Run.

459
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,080
We should get going then. Let's go.

460
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,080
Gosh, seriously...

461
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,890
I'm so sad.

462
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,230
You don't know how I'm feeling.

463
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,040
I'll go back to Golden Castle.

464
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,940
I want to go.

465
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:48,010
Do you think...

466
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,280
taking over the brewery
was a good thing, Jang Soo?

467
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,020
I thought
it was the best thing to do.

468
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,520
That's why I've come this far.

469
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,430
But was it the best decision...

470
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,760
for others too?

471
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,290
I don't think
you have any appetite these days.

472
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,190
I made abalone rice porridge,
your favorite.

473
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,460
Abalone rice porridge sounds great.

474
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,900
You haven't been drinking
makgeolli these days.

475
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:43,430
Sorry?

476
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,970
The makgeolli in the fridge
has been left untouched.

477
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,240
I won't be having any
for the time being.

478
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,040
- Have you slept well?
- Come and sit.

479
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,920
Gyeol's coming this Saturday.

480
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,220
So I heard.

481
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,560
Once he goes, it'll be your turn.

482
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,060
What?

483
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,530
Didn't he say anything?

484
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,030
About what?

485
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:15,630
He's coming to Seoul
to formally greet Se Ri's parents.

486
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,930
He wants to marry her...

487
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,500
once he's discharged
from the military.

488
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,240
Really?

489
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,810
Didn't you know about those two?

490
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,140
I knew
Gyeol was interested in Se Ri,

491
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,650
but I didn't know
he wanted to marry her.

492
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,150
That's great news.

493
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,890
Are you sure you're not interested
in Professor Kim?

494
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,160
Not this again.

495
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,860
Before Gyeol marries,

496
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,160
- you should...
- Your mom...

497
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:47,030
was the only woman
I needed in my life.

498
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,870
There hasn't been a single woman
I've been attracted to...

499
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,000
or have cared about.

500
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,810
Good morning.

501
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,950
Have some honey water, Mom.

502
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,450
Bring me some poison instead.

503
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,350
I'll drink it and die.

504
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,820
Why would you be so harsh
first thing in the morning?

505
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,190
As if you need to ask.

506
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,460
I'm sick and tired of seeing
how pathetic your life has become...

507
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,730
now that you're letting...

508
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,370
your brothers-in-law leech off you.

509
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,100
Kang Soo will hear you.
Stop being unreasonable.

510
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,210
You don't care about your mom...

511
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,180
but worry about
your brothers-in-law all the time.

512
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,980
I know you're upset,

513
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:39,780
but have faith in me
and let this play out.

514
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,390
That's what you always say.
Unbelievable.

515
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,760
I understand how upset you were,

516
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,760
but you shouldn't have drunk
so much.

517
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,530
Do you remember
that Mr. Go carried you home?

518
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:00,740
Baldy carried me home?

519
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,040
Don't you remember that?

520
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,410
Not at all.

521
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,150
Hello, Professor.

522
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,350
Good morning.

523
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,920
Would you like some coffee?

524
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,460
I'd love some.

525
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,400
Thank you.

526
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,830
Thank you for yesterday.

527
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,470
I didn't have to stop by
the supermarket,

528
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,810
so I had more time on my hands.

529
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,540
Thanks for the beer as well.

530
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,050
Are you complimenting me now,
Professor?

531
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,580
I wasn't complimenting you.
I was thanking you.

532
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,150
Either way, I'm glad I was of help.

533
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,450
Could I perhaps ask for
another favor?

534
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:52,860
Of course.

535
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,890
Hold on.

536
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:58,630
Can you get these from the library?

537
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:01,060
- Sure.
- I requested them last week,

538
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,430
but I have a lecture now.

539
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:04,300
- Sure thing.
- Thanks.

540
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,640
- Have a good class.
- Sure.

541
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,590
Darn.

542
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,630
(Zumba dance)

543
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,170
Why are you out here?

544
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,500
I was waiting for you.

545
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,210
Why? Did you have something to say?

546
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:48,850
What on earth were you thinking,
proposing to Ms. Kim in public?

547
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,320
I did it on purpose for you to see.

548
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,250
What?

549
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,520
I was going...

550
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,790
to get her a ring and book a table
at a fancy restaurant,

551
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,890
but I figured...

552
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:06,060
you needed a reality check
as soon as possible.

553
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,960
That's why. So what?

554
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,300
Do you...

555
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,000
hate me that much?

556
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,340
How many times must I say this?

557
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,840
You're not my type.

558
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:22,880
I like someone petite, gentle,

559
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,010
sweet, and classy.

560
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,620
I also like someone
I can easily talk to.

561
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:30,050
I'm sorry to say this,
but you are...

562
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,990
the opposite of what I look for
in a woman.

563
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:35,060
You're only seeing
what Ms. Kim painted herself to be.

564
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,460
- Why can't you see that?
- Not this again.

565
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,030
I told you where I stood,

566
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,360
so stop being clingy.

567
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,970
If you take this further,
it'll be stalking.

568
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,370
Stalking?

569
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,540
Don't you think
you're being too harsh?

570
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,980
So I suggest we keep
our conversation pleasant.

571
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,110
As long as you don't say
anything weird,

572
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:56,810
we'll get along well...

573
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,920
as instructor and student.

574
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,620
I ask this one last time.

575
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,390
It's still not too late.

576
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,990
Take back your proposal.

577
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:09,260
Hear me loud and clear.

578
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,560
Even if things don't work out
between Ms. Kim and me,

579
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,860
I have no intention
of making things work with you.

580
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,630
- Mr. Oh...
- So stop this.

581
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,500
If you take this further,
I might lose my mind.

582
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,040
I won't be as nice.

583
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,910
But...

584
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,080
You blind dimwit!

585
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,020
What's your problem?

586
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,590
Why that...

587
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,000
That nutjob.

588
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,670
(Eagle Brewery)

589
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,410
No way.

590
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,250
Look how clear it is.

591
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:06,620
Since this is a prototype,
I used a wooden strainer.

592
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,990
However, for mass production,

593
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,290
we'll need to use
a filter press filtration system.

594
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,730
We made yakju from makgeolli.

595
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,330
The world of makgeolli
is deep and vast.

596
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,360
There's a lot you can make
with makgeolli.

597
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,430
Yakju,

598
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:24,770
vinegar, bread,

599
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:27,640
and even cosmetics these days.

600
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,770
Let's find success...

601
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,940
so that we can make
bread, cosmetics,

602
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,980
and everything else.

603
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,850
Then that'll make us
a major company.

604
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,080
Our new product is served.

605
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,550
(Jang-Kwang Yakju)

606
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:44,050
It's 17 percent alcohol by volume,
so only take a sip.

607
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:53,060
Mr. Go was worried...

608
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,330
that the alcoholic taste
might be overpowering.

609
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:56,930
It's nice though, right?

610
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,840
It comes at you
with a pleasant force...

611
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,170
and sets you on fire.

612
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,410
That slight bitterness you taste...

613
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:10,080
makes it clean.

614
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:11,850
You're absolutely on point.

615
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,050
This would be good enough
for LX Hotel.

616
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,150
Of course.

617
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:19,090
Why don't I take this to them
right now?

618
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:20,390
Deal.

619
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,620
Deal.

620
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,330
Kim, can you pack this with ice
for transport?

621
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,430
Yes, boss.

622
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,670
It was brewed...

623
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,610
with newly discovered mineral water
and nuruk from our new supplier.

624
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,530
The taste is one thing.

625
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,900
What's the production cost
per bottle?

626
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,960
Even if we try to cut costs,

627
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,430
- at least three times...
- Three times?

628
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,340
If we can't sell this
at a decent price,

629
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,670
we'll be bleeding money
on every bottle we sell.

630
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,640
Yes, that's true.

631
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,510
Unbelievable.

632
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:16,350
How is that woman
at Eagle Brewery...

633
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,080
able to maintain the price?

634
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,350
- Here you go, sir.
- The late CEO Oh Jang Soo...

635
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,590
secured a water source for them...

636
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,920
and spent a long time
investing in the relationship...

637
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,920
between his brewery and the farms
that produce organic rice.

638
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,760
On top of that,
they make their own nuruk.

639
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:33,130
At first, the industry mocked him...

640
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,860
for what seemed like
an excessive investment,

641
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,830
but now,
the late CEO Oh's perseverance...

642
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,200
is finally paying off.

643
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,140
Director Seo.

644
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:43,940
Are you seriously...

645
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,980
praising our competitor
at a time like this?

646
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,680
You... Get over here.

647
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,580
- Follow me out!
- Sir, please.

648
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,780
- Sir.
- I'll reveal your true identity.

649
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:54,220
Are you a spy?

650
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,590
- Gosh, no.
- Did Eagle Brewery send you?

651
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,490
Are you a darn spy?

652
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,120
Follow me out!

653
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:02,530
This is what we'll do.

654
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,560
I like how the prototype tastes,

655
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,460
but we'll be in the red
considering the cost.

656
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,630
First...

657
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:10,930
That brat.

658
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:15,970
First, brew the makgeolli
with organic rice...

659
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,980
and promote it
as a premium organic makgeolli.

660
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,680
As for water...

661
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,410
Tweak our filtering system...

662
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,950
so that it can taste
as close as possible...

663
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,450
- to bedrock water. Okay?
- Bedrock water?

664
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:27,020
You can do that, right?

665
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,350
Well, I'll try... I can do it, sir.

666
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,020
Good job, sir.

667
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,020
("Economic Theory
of the Korean Peninsula")

668
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,300
Professor.

669
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,780
I'm fine carrying those.

670
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,850
Gosh, no.

671
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,390
If I'd known
the class would end early,

672
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,850
I would've taken out
the books myself.

673
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,390
Thanks.

674
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,090
That's what I'm here for.

675
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,990
Actually, I have something for you.

676
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,260
Ta-da.

677
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,230
What's this?

678
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,270
I took a few photos of Ha Ni
on my phone that day.

679
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,570
I was copying study materials
in the library...

680
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,740
when I saw a photo printer,
so I printed these.

681
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,130
What is it?

682
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,430
Is something on my face?

683
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,130
No.

684
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,340
You had that smile of a dad.

685
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,170
Did I?

686
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,040
Se Ri!

687
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,640
Hey.

688
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,650
Is she a friend?

689
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,350
Yes.

690
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,290
She's my best friend...

691
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,020
and my schoolmate
from kindergarten to grad school.

692
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,120
I'll leave you two to chat
and get going.

693
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:22,360
Sure. I'll see you around.

694
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,390
Thanks for this.

695
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,270
Who's he?

696
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,640
My professor.

697
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,640
He's so young.

698
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,380
He may be young
but is highly qualified.

699
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:43,480
He passed the civil service exam
in college as the top scorer,

700
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,880
got his degree at Stanford,

701
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,220
and then came to teach here.

702
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,920
Cool, right?

703
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,450
Absolutely.

704
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,760
By the way, why didn't you tell me?

705
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,930
About what?

706
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,830
My brother.

707
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,630
He's going to propose to you
once he leaves the military.

708
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,060
What?

709
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:06,540
We won't know
until we cross that bridge.

710
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,800
He could change his mind.

711
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,540
Oh, please.

712
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,370
My brother's not someone
who'd change his mind easily.

713
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,150
I guess that's true.

714
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,320
Do we have a list of guests
attending the festival?

715
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,320
Yes, sir.

716
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,450
The North American
Diplomatic Mission,

717
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,620
relevant public organizations,

718
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:27,990
and those at the Seoul branches
of North American news agencies.

719
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,390
There will be about 30 people
in total.

720
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:30,960
The seating chart
has been completed,

721
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,660
so a rehearsal
will take place next week.

722
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,330
I'll be present for that
if nothing comes up.

723
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,970
Yes, sir. I'll let you know.

724
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,130
Also,

725
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,570
at the festival,

726
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,140
rather than just Eagle Brewery,

727
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:47,910
I'd like to give other breweries
a chance as well.

728
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,110
Other breweries as in...

729
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:52,950
The top breweries in the market
should be given an equal chance...

730
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:55,920
if we want to dispel
any rumors of favoritism.

731
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:57,520
I see. Then...

732
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,490
I'll contact the top five breweries
currently in Korea...

733
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:04,290
and request a premium product
for us to taste.

734
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,460
Let's do that.

735
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,900
All right.

736
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,070
(Han Dong Seok)

737
00:42:10,430 --> 00:42:11,470
Oh, dear.

738
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,370
(Han Dong Seok)

739
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,310
Darn.

740
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,310
I printed out another copy.

741
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,680
What?

742
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:27,380
Right. Thank you.

743
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,950
(Han Dong Seok)

744
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,900
(Eagle Brewery)

745
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:46,700
Through filtration,
we turned Jang-Kwang Makgeolli...

746
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,570
into a yakju that is
17 percent alcohol by volume.

747
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,640
(Jang-Kwang Yakju)

748
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:06,920
Thank you.

749
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,060
All right.

750
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,300
Goodness me. This...

751
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,800
The aroma and taste
hit me strongly...

752
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,270
with the burning sensation
of the alcohol,

753
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,470
but it left behind
only a clean finish.

754
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:24,570
I love...

755
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:27,210
how Eagle Brewery's liquor
tastes clean without any heaviness.

756
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,810
We kept the sourness...

757
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:30,950
so that it'd balance the sweetness.

758
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:33,580
So the crisp taste of fresh water...

759
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,980
lingers on your tongue.

760
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:36,050
You're right.

761
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:38,290
It'll be great to have
before a meal...

762
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:40,890
and after a meal with dessert.

763
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,390
Does that mean you two...

764
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,960
approve?

765
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,800
Thank you.

766
00:43:53,070 --> 00:43:55,340
The final approval
will come from the chairman.

767
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:59,540
I hope that you two can put in...

768
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,910
a good word for me to the chairman.

769
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,080
Sure.

770
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,360
(Chun Soo's wife Kang So Yeon)

771
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:25,800
Hello?

772
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,270
This is Ma Kwang Sook.

773
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:32,440
I'd like to meet up to talk.

774
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:36,750
Sure. I'll come to you.

775
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,710
If I leave now,

776
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,550
I'll be there in about 30 minutes.

777
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,860
(Eagle Brewery)

778
00:44:58,170 --> 00:44:59,400
Aren't you getting in?

779
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,500
Yes, I am.

780
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:19,920
By the way, Chairman Han,

781
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,830
I know I alarmed you yesterday.

782
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:28,560
I can see how the situation
might've been misleading.

783
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,800
There are no misunderstandings
whatsoever.

784
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:34,270
I have no interest
in the personal life...

785
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:35,900
of CEO Ma.

786
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:40,210
I see that you got the wrong idea
about me.

787
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,550
Do I seem like someone...

788
00:45:43,550 --> 00:45:46,550
who has time to waste
getting the wrong idea about people?

789
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,820
That woman
you saw me with yesterday...

790
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,820
is actually
my brother-in-law's wife.

791
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,190
It was my first time meeting her.

792
00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:59,160
She's been living
in the US for a long time...

793
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,000
and came to Korea to visit.

794
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,670
Being clueless
about the family's situation,

795
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:06,070
she insisted
that I sell the brewery...

796
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:07,600
- to give her a cut...
- Why...

797
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,270
must I listen to your family story?

798
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,510
I told you already.

799
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,110
I couldn't care less
about your personal life.

800
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:20,550
So there's no need for you
to explain your situation.

801
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:32,460
But...

802
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,500
He didn't even hear me out...

803
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:37,470
and just got angry.

804
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,340
Why did she keep yapping
when I said I wasn't interested?

805
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,450
My gosh.

806
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:52,550
My head aches.

807
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:56,220
Oh, dear.

808
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:06,600
(Dr. Hwang Dong Guk)

809
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,340
Dr. Hwang.

810
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:14,870
How are you?

811
00:47:15,470 --> 00:47:18,070
I called to arrange a blind date.

812
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:20,110
A blind date?

813
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:22,310
I told a pupil of mine
about your daughter,

814
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,910
and he's willing to meet her.

815
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:26,010
Is he really?

816
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,090
I went a bit too far yesterday.

817
00:47:40,330 --> 00:47:42,700
I asked to meet to apologize.

818
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,640
If you put it that way,
I was just as bad.

819
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:51,510
Thanks for being understanding.

820
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:55,580
I'll get right to the point.

821
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:59,850
We put the brewery in my name
in the inheritance process,

822
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:02,120
but I think my brothers-in-law...

823
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:05,020
are joint owners of the business.

824
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:07,390
So...

825
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:10,260
I'll share the profits we make.

826
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,800
Right now,
we're still paying off our debts,

827
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,630
and the brewery's slowly
getting back on track.

828
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,670
I have
nothing to give you right now.

829
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:25,610
Exactly. So sell the business.

830
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:27,640
The realtor said...

831
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,110
the brewery's pretty big
and located in a prime area.

832
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:32,350
There will be many buyers
if you just put it up for sale.

833
00:48:32,350 --> 00:48:35,220
I promise to divide
the profits each year.

834
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:38,490
At the current rate,
in about five years,

835
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,960
each of us
will make a decent salary.

836
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,230
So...

837
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:48,360
how about you give up
your plans to divorce?

838
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:57,440
Everyone seems to be mistaken.

839
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,080
My divorce and the brewery sale...

840
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,110
are unrelated.
They're completely separate issues.

841
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,880
I decided to divorce Chun Soo
a while ago,

842
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:09,150
and we no longer
live like husband and wife.

843
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:11,850
I only put things off...

844
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:13,460
until Yeoung Ju started college.

845
00:49:14,290 --> 00:49:15,490
Chun Soo is...

846
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,760
an upright and kindhearted man.

847
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,800
I'm here to talk about
my share of the inheritance.

848
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,530
I'm not here for marriage therapy.

849
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,440
Do you know what it means...

850
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,310
to sell the brewery?

851
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,140
Did you never stop to think
some values...

852
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,580
mean more than money?

853
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:39,280
Don't try to lecture me.

854
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,150
I'm about to leave my husband,

855
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,820
and I don't have to treat you
with respect.

856
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,860
We seem to be similar ages anyway.

857
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:19,320
Hi, Mi Sun.

858
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,660
Hey. I saw
the brewery manager yesterday.

859
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,290
He said you'd come by.

860
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,630
Didn't you fly to the US?

861
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,030
I was going to.

862
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:31,170
But my wife flew in.

863
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,540
Oh, I see.

864
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,100
It worked out for you.
You didn't have to travel far.

865
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:39,710
I saved the plane fare.

866
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:44,180
Are you drinking?

867
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,880
Yes.

868
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,480
With lunch.

869
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,920
Why are you drinking so early?

870
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,450
Are you upset about something?

871
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:51,720
No.

872
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:56,460
I had a couple of shots
with my meal to think about...

873
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:57,890
this and that.

874
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:00,530
I should leave soon.

875
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,900
Alcohol doesn't solve anything.

876
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,500
It only gives you a headache.

877
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,940
Stop drinking and get out of there.

878
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:11,910
You're right.

879
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:13,880
I should go.

880
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,310
Chun Soo.

881
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,380
Yes, what?

882
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:25,750
There's something...

883
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,920
I regret even now.

884
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:30,860
What's that?

885
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,560
If I think about it,

886
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,800
I always gave up too easily.

887
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,900
I let people leave...

888
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,000
or just pass me by.

889
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,310
I didn't try to get them back.

890
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,880
Don't be like me.

891
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:52,810
Fight while you can...

892
00:51:52,810 --> 00:51:54,650
and cling while you can.

893
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,380
Don't regret it later on.

894
00:51:58,520 --> 00:51:59,620
Okay?

895
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,190
Okay.

896
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,260
I'll do that.

897
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,130
I'll keep that in mind.

898
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:13,760
What did your sister-in-law
say about me?

899
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:18,430
She said you were pretty, sweet,
and hardworking.

900
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,500
She must like you a lot.

901
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:23,540
- Really?
- Yes, really.

902
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:27,510
That day...

903
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,980
I wasn't really ready.

904
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:32,010
I spoke out of line,

905
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,420
and it bothered me.

906
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,620
It's fine.

907
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,220
My sister-in-law's pretty cool
and magnanimous.

908
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:41,060
She doesn't mind the small things.

909
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,760
You must like her a lot.

910
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:45,960
I do.

911
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:48,800
I'd like you and my sister-in-law...

912
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,030
to get along like real sisters.

913
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,870
Then stop calling me "Ms. Kim."

914
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,440
Call me "Seon Ah."

915
00:53:56,710 --> 00:53:57,710
Can I?

916
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,080
You can say my name too, then.

917
00:54:03,180 --> 00:54:04,350
"Heung Soo?"

918
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:11,120
What if people were to see?

919
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,620
Who cares if they do?

920
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:15,060
We outed ourselves as a couple.

921
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:19,330
Even so. It's still embarrassing.

922
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:20,560
Don't be embarrassed.

923
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,560
We'll walk hand-in-hand now.

924
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:26,130
Hey. If you pull back,
I'll kiss you on the lips.

925
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:31,770
Seon Ah.

926
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:34,510
You're the most innocent woman
I've ever met.

927
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,280
I'm glad I stayed single
all this while.

928
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:41,280
Aren't your hands cold?

929
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:46,420
I told you where I stood,

930
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,820
so stop being clingy.

931
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:50,560
If you take this further,
it'll be stalking.

932
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:55,600
I wish you live...

933
00:54:57,770 --> 00:54:59,870
happily every after with Ms. Kim.

934
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:05,040
I'll find...

935
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:09,880
someone way taller than you,

936
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:13,680
way richer than you,

937
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:18,150
and way more handsome than you.

938
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:23,390
And we'll live
way more happily ever after.

939
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:38,210
Then...

940
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,940
Welcome back, CEO Ma.

941
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,650
Why are you still up?

942
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,850
I stayed up to wait
because I missed you.

943
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:51,750
You chewed me out in the morning.

944
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:52,990
What got into you?

945
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:54,990
I get scared when you're like this.

946
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,290
Don't be scared.

947
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:59,360
I'm here to deliver good news.

948
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:00,900
Good news?

949
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,530
I've set up a blind date for you.

950
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,030
A blind date?

951
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:06,100
You promised
to go on a blind date...

952
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,340
if I let Kang Soo...

953
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,770
stay with us.

954
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:14,010
Saturday at 10 a.m.
Park Hotel's coffee shop.

955
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:16,510
- Okay?
- I'm not free. Some other time.

956
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:18,680
You're going to go back
on your promise?

957
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:20,420
I'm not refusing to go on the date.

958
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:23,420
I'm busy with work,
and I need to reschedule.

959
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:26,890
Okay. I'll call
your youngest brother-in-law...

960
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:28,260
and tell him to pack up.

961
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:31,560
Do you have to be so mean?

962
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,670
You're meeting
Dr. Hwang's student this Saturday,

963
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:40,470
Dr. Oh's nephew next Saturday,

964
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:42,740
and Dr. Lee's brother-in-law
on Saturday after next.

965
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,270
If you get one of the three,
it will be a jackpot.

966
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:47,240
They all have a great background.

967
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:48,540
What?

968
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,580
I should go on a blind date
for three weeks in a row?

969
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,180
What can we do?

970
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:55,320
They all like you
and want to go on a date with you.

971
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:58,620
I'm too busy to go on dates
every weekend.

972
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:01,920
Even those who are busier than you
go on dates,

973
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,960
get married, start a family,
and live happily.

974
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:05,990
I don't care.

975
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,460
I'll go on all the dates
this weekend.

976
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,800
I'll just get it over with.

977
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,670
- What?
- I'm telling you.

978
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:12,870
It's this Saturday.
I'll get it all done at once.

979
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:14,900
Or I won't go on
a blind date at all.

980
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:22,080
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

981
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:23,080
Here.

982
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:26,310
There will be
the K-culture Wave Ceremony...

983
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:27,880
hosted by the Korea National
Tourist Organization...

984
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:29,580
at Park Hotel at 10 a.m.

985
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:32,190
The Minister will be there,

986
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:34,120
so they asked you to attend...

987
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,860
through the secretary's office.

988
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:38,530
It is expected
to take about two hours.

989
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,060
And there will be
an additional event.

990
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,800
There's an academic seminar hosted
by the Korea Academic Society...

991
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,000
of Tourism Management at 2 p.m.

992
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,640
You're supposed to give
a special congratulatory speech.

993
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:52,510
I have a tight schedule.

994
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:53,980
I'm afraid you do.

995
00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:55,740
Oh, right. There's more.

996
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:59,110
There will be a golf lesson
for the VIPs of LX Fashion...

997
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:00,380
on Sunday.

998
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,450
I'll attend when I have time.

999
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:04,450
Yes, sir.

1000
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:06,220
Shall I make the car wait?

1001
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,520
It's better to go early,
so I'll leave now.

1002
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,030
Yes, sir. I'll have it ready.

1003
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,670
(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

1004
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:28,110
(Eagle Brewery)

1005
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:33,250
(Eagle Brewery)

1006
00:58:44,590 --> 00:58:46,130
(Eagle Brewery)

1007
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:03,440
The role of hotels is becoming...

1008
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,310
more important...

1009
00:59:05,310 --> 00:59:08,650
as a space for experiences
rather than simply a place to stay.

1010
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,720
The role of hotels is becoming
more important.

1011
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,220
What is she doing here?

1012
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:55,630
My gosh.

1013
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,000
Excuse me.

1014
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:02,770
Are you Ms. Ma Kwang Sook?

1015
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:04,570
Yes, I'm her.

1016
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:07,180
I'm here for a blind date.

1017
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:09,710
I'm Dr. Hwang Dong Guk's student.

1018
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:10,980
My name is Lee Cheol Yong.

1019
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:12,510
(Blind Date 1)

1020
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:13,820
(Executive Director of S Group
who owns an apartment in Gangnam)

1021
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,280
Right.

1022
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:19,920
- Hello.
- Hello.

1023
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:21,560
Please have a seat.

1024
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:22,790
Yes.

1025
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:25,490
A blind date?

1026
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:29,360
What would you have?

1027
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,430
I'll have iced Americano.

1028
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:33,000
I see.

1029
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,900
I'll also have iced Americano.

1030
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,140
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

1031
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:44,650
I heard a lot about you
from Dr. Hwang.

1032
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:46,650
And I saw you on TV.

1033
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:50,220
I watched your interview
on the news.

1034
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:52,890
I look better in person...

1035
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,590
than on TV, right?

1036
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,490
Yes.

1037
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,460
You look more beautiful in person.

1038
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,700
You are really impressive.

1039
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,740
You even do business with a hotel.

1040
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:13,210
The sales must be huge then.

1041
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:20,620
It's all spin and no substance.

1042
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:23,050
Pardon?

1043
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:26,650
I took over the business
my husband was running,

1044
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:27,720
but the debt...

1045
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:32,360
Is it 500,000 dollars?

1046
01:01:34,630 --> 01:01:36,160
It's five million dollars.

1047
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:39,400
Five million dollars?

1048
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,700
Yes.

1049
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,870
Five million dollars.

1050
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,780
To be honest,
how much money would I make...

1051
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,240
from selling a bottle of makgeolli?

1052
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:52,010
Even if I work my tail off,

1053
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,020
I can barely pay the interest,

1054
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:58,290
let alone the principal.

1055
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:00,520
I see.

1056
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:04,460
This must be what it feels like
to be stuck in a trap.

1057
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,730
I keep paying the interest,

1058
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,930
but there's no end in sight.

1059
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:13,940
Life is...

1060
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:16,370
not easy.

1061
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:19,240
You're right.

1062
01:02:19,970 --> 01:02:22,080
I heard from Dr. Hwang...

1063
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,050
that you were a man of great wealth.

1064
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:26,780
I'm a man of great personality.

1065
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:29,620
I've always wondered
where Prince Charming was...

1066
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,750
and why he didn't show up
to save my life.

1067
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,560
I guess...

1068
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:40,430
I'm finally meeting him today.

1069
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:47,570
Oh, dear.

1070
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,970
She reveals her true color
as soon as they meet.

1071
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,610
I guess
Chairman Dokgo Tak was right.

1072
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:55,610
Ma Kwang Sook is...

1073
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:00,850
a gold digger...

1074
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,820
full of poison.

1075
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:49,060
(For Eagle Brothers)

1076
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,800
Isn't it that
Kwang Sook is seeing someone?

1077
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,200
Not everyone lives with sincerity...

1078
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,770
and single-hearted devotion
like you do.

1079
01:03:55,870 --> 01:03:57,270
You win.

1080
01:03:57,370 --> 01:03:58,370
Promise me one thing.

1081
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,310
That you will never break
Mr. Oh's heart.

1082
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:03,440
Are you the only teaching assistant
in your department?

1083
01:04:03,510 --> 01:04:05,250
Where on earth are you
and what are you doing?

1084
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:07,480
Gyeol has been waiting for you.

1085
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:11,320
Is it possible you go on blind dates
three times on the same day...

1086
