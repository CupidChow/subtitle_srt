1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,210
We need to know if you're...

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:04,380
a good and deserving match for her.

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,380
And to find out,
we must put you through a test.

4
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,520
A test?

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,820
Please be understanding,
even if you find it offensive.

6
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:17,960
Kwang Sook is like a big sister
to us, you see.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,660
We're here as her brothers,
not her brothers-in-law.

8
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,090
Just like you'd test a bridge
before crossing it,

9
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,100
we want to be sure.

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,270
I understand
where you're coming from.

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,900
So, in what way will I be tested?

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,480
You will be tested
in four different categories.

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,210
Four?

14
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:41,510
Yes.

15
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:44,220
First, Chun Soo will check
your health status...

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,550
and your reputation in this field.

17
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,420
Are you willing to share the results
of your checkup?

18
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:53,020
Of course.

19
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,460
I have the results...

20
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,490
of a full checkup I had
a few months ago.

21
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,830
Thank you.

22
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,230
Heung Soo will assess
how you behave when drinking.

23
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,770
He will thoroughly check
for any drunken habits...

24
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:05,370
that could show up.

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,340
Please come
to the brewery this Saturday.

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,140
What do you prefer to drink?

27
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,940
I'm not sure.

28
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,410
I can't say I'm a picky drinker.

29
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,220
Okay. We have that in common.

30
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,790
I like that about you.

31
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,190
Meanwhile, Beom Soo...

32
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,420
Please provide three years' worth
of board meeting minutes,

33
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,390
the proceedings
involving your major decisions,

34
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:30,700
the ESG report,

35
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,200
and a collection
of your outgoing CEO messages.

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,470
As an outside director, I believe...

37
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,470
I have the right
to review these materials.

38
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,840
Let's do that.
I'll have them ready for you.

39
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,710
And lastly,

40
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,040
I will test your physical fitness.

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,180
Good health is
the foundation of a strong marriage.

42
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,480
The physical test
will take place this Saturday.

43
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,590
What do you say?

44
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,990
I say, bring it on.

45
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,420
I'm sure you know Kang Soo
previously served in the UDT.

46
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,130
You'd better brace yourself.

47
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:05,160
Each event is worth
up to five points,

48
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,400
and you need
a total score above 15 to pass.

49
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,270
Failing any one test
means elimination.

50
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,980
See you on Saturday, then.

51
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,020
I will have my secretaries
send you...

52
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,120
the documents you asked for
by the end of the day.

53
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,150
Here.

54
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,290
Right.

55
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,630
We'll get going, then.

56
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,110
All right, see you.

57
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,190
Have the documents I mentioned...

58
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,790
sent to our new outside director,
Professor Oh Beom Soo.

59
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,760
And please ask the hospital...

60
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,430
for my physical checkup report.

61
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,200
- Yes, sir.
- Also,

62
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,370
call the hotel gym.

63
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,870
I want to train
with an experienced instructor.

64
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,670
Book me a special training session.

65
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,410
Training sessions for you, sir?

66
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,440
Yes, for me personally.

67
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,650
I need to see progress
as quickly as possible.

68
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,710
There's not a lot of time.

69
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,520
Right. Understood, sir.

70
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,050
I'll arrange for the trainer
to set up...

71
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,890
personalized training sessions
for you.

72
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,160
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

73
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,260
They really are no joke.

74
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,300
Unbelievable.

75
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,280
I'm back.

76
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,650
Did it go well with him?

77
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,790
Fortunately, Chairman Han
wasn't offended by our demands,

78
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,490
so things went smoothly.

79
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,690
But...

80
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,630
is this really necessary?

81
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,100
I wanted this too,

82
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,830
but the others are the ones
truly determined.

83
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,000
To spare you any heartache,

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,640
they'll be testing him
to the extreme.

85
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,740
Just see how it goes.

86
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,450
All I ask is that
you take it easy...

87
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,310
on him.

88
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,350
Why should they go easy on me?

89
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,220
I'm confident in my ability
to pass any test.

90
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,890
Well...

91
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,990
It seems easier said than done.

92
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,630
I'm a pretty competitive person.

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,900
I win every game,
no matter how trivial.

94
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,070
Remember how our Go-Stop game went?

95
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,880
A game of Go-Stop is nothing like
what you're facing this time.

96
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,150
Don't worry.
This will be a walk in the park.

97
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,090
Anyway, I'm grateful for this.
I'm also sorry.

98
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:20,020
You might feel offended and annoyed,

99
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,490
but you're not showing it.

100
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,730
I initially found it ridiculous,

101
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,900
but your brothers-in-law
are like this...

102
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,140
because they love you
and want the best for you.

103
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,970
In a way, it felt nice.

104
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,310
Besides,

105
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,750
this might be an opportunity for me
to get closer to them.

106
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:44,750
I decided to gladly take the test.

107
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,060
You don't usually get off work
at this hour.

108
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,160
Are you not feeling well?

109
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,930
What do you think you're doing?

110
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,600
I was going to take your jacket
for you.

111
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,300
Do you expect us to live
like nothing happened?

112
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,070
Unbelievable.

113
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,070
I had no idea...

114
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:11,610
you were this shameless.

115
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,510
How are you able
to hold your head up...

116
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,850
and act like nothing's wrong?

117
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,820
Of course.

118
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,790
You managed to lie...

119
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,590
about something so incredible
because you had some guts.

120
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,660
What must I do
to make you feel better?

121
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,400
Shall I pack up and leave?

122
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,340
Shall I disappear from your life?

123
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:41,710
I'll make this very clear.

124
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:45,810
You're not setting foot
outside this house.

125
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,210
What do you want, then?

126
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,780
Shall we get divorced?

127
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,220
Who said I'd give you a divorce?

128
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,150
No way!

129
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,220
You say no to this and no to that.

130
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,460
What do you want me to do?

131
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,790
Don't act like you feel wronged.

132
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,390
There's someone who feels...

133
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,630
like a total fool
for being clueless for 30 years.

134
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,730
You're stuck with me...

135
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,800
for the next 30 years.

136
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,840
You're to take the fury, resentment,

137
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,610
and hatred I pour on you!

138
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,780
That's...

139
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,910
the only way
you can pay for what you did.

140
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,490
Darn it.

141
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,780
(Silla Brewery Dokgo Tak)

142
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,290
What do you want?

143
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,900
I called to give you the news
you've been waiting for.

144
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,830
What?

145
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,100
Not long ago, at last,

146
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,170
I happened to find out
who your mother is.

147
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,610
Well?

148
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,380
Aren't you interested?

149
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,450
I considered...

150
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:30,820
keeping it to myself.

151
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,850
That wouldn't be right
since I'm the elder here.

152
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,690
You must know, don't you think?

153
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,500
Let's meet tomorrow.
I'll give you the details.

154
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,400
I told you clearly last time.

155
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,970
I'm not curious
and don't plan to look for her.

156
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,940
Is that so?

157
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,940
Yes.

158
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,380
My parents are both deceased.

159
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,010
That's how you might feel
as an immature young man.

160
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,420
You'll change your mind soon.

161
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,590
Call me if you ever become curious.

162
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,090
I'll kindly explain things to you.

(Treatment Room 1)

164
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,280
Hello. Welcome to...

165
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,790
What brings you here?

166
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,630
You can relax.

167
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,330
I'm not here to start a fight.

168
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,570
I came...

169
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,100
to apologize and to ask for a favor.

170
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,670
For what?

171
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,080
I'm incapable of being long-winded.

172
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,550
So I'll be direct.

173
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,320
I apologize for being rude
and insulting toward you.

174
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,690
And...

175
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,720
my Ok Bun.

176
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,360
Take good care of her.

177
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,360
What do you mean by that?

178
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,830
Ok Bun is
completely out of my league.

179
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,940
You saw her for the gem she is,

180
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,380
so cherish her the way she deserves.

181
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,050
It looks like
things backfired badly.

00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,350
A misunderstanding?

184
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,330
The truth is, Ms. Ji...

185
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,400
put on a show
in order to make you...

186
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,600
feel jealous.

187
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,500
And I willingly assisted her.

188
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,740
Then...

189
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:11,140
the two of you weren't testing
if you were a match?

190
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,140
We're not like that.

191
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,680
The person Ms. Ji is interested in
and cares about...

192
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,380
is you.

193
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,490
Ms. Ji...

194
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,730
is a warmhearted and kind person.

195
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,860
So...

196
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,600
don't lose her.

197
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,070
Thank you. So much.

198
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,900
I think I told you
not to show yourself again.

199
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,960
Hey, you...

200
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,870
Why did you...

201
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,100
put on a show?

202
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,540
"A show?"

203
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,640
I just met with the vet.

204
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,410
He told me everything.

205
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,590
I'm sorry for what happened.

206
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,720
Forget about it.

207
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,290
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

208
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,760
- Get out.
- Wait.

209
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,660
Don't get angry already.

210
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,770
Let me explain where I stand.

211
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:42,900
Why should I?

212
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,070
The day I brought flowers
to propose to you...

213
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:49,740
Who's this?

214
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,680
It's the vet.

215
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,910
("The lives of animals
come before the family name.")

216
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,040
(CEO's Youngest Son Treats Dogs)

217
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,610
The doctor who owns the vet...

218
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:57,780
is the youngest son
of Sangjin Group's CEO?

219
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,850
If the son of a rich CEO likes you,

220
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,950
of course I should give up.

221
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,330
I have nothing to my name
and nothing to brag about.

222
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,470
A man with great credentials
showed up,

223
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,570
so for your happiness,

224
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,300
I had to give up fighting for you.
Wouldn't you agree?

225
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,640
That's the stupidest thing
I've heard.

226
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:25,810
What?

227
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,150
Why would the son of a rich CEO...

228
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,080
like someone like me?

229
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,480
You're a catch.

230
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,950
You're pretty
and have a nice figure.

231
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,080
Also, you're sweet...

232
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,150
and competent.

233
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,860
You know that so well,

234
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,760
and you upset me this much?

235
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,590
- Hey.
- Come here!

236
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:42,730
- Don't.
- Darn you!

237
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,300
- Hey!
- Stop it.

238
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,600
I've had enough of you. Get lost!

239
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,930
My goodness.

240
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,170
My gosh.

241
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,470
He's so infuriating.

242
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,730
Hi, Ok Bun. It has been a while.

243
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,530
Your brother-in-law...

244
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,340
is driving me crazy,
and I can't take it.

245
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,440
What's wrong?

246
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,540
Did you argue again?

247
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,210
I had...

248
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,210
no idea that
Heung Soo was so stupid.

249
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,210
What's the matter?

250
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,280
I can't explain over the phone.

251
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,020
I'll come over.

252
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,490
Can you buy me a cold beer?

253
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,060
Okay.

254
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,890
Wait, actually,

255
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,460
why don't we meet
at Mi Sun's convenience store?

256
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,870
Okay.
Call me right before you arrive.

257
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,070
What happened this time?

258
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,410
Something's always happening.

259
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,250
Why isn't your dad back yet?

260
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,960
Grandma's having a hard time,
so can you stop crying?

261
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,630
What's the matter with you today?

262
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,030
Your sitter fell ill...

263
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,370
because you kept crying.

264
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,170
- Hello.
- I'm glad you're here.

265
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:38,140
- Why are you crying, Ha Ni?
- My goodness.

266
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,710
Can I watch her for a while?

267
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,550
- My gosh.
- I'd appreciate that so much.

268
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,980
My back feels like
it's going to break. Wait.

269
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,120
Hey.

270
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,790
Look at you.

271
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,450
You stopped crying...

272
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,960
as soon as I handed you to Se Ri.

273
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,260
- She must've been sleepy.
- Yes.

274
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,830
I'll set her down for a nap.
You can go to your room and rest.

275
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,570
Thanks so much.

276
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,200
Her dad will be home soon.

277
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,270
Did she eat something?

278
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,400
Beom Soo said he'd feed her
when he got back.

279
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:08,940
I see.

280
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,480
Can I use the kitchen?

281
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,080
You're welcome to.

282
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,780
I need to lie down for a while.

283
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,720
Bye. I'm exhausted.

284
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,480
- Sleep well.
- I will.

285
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,650
Gosh, my back...

286
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,020
Ha Ni.

287
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,490
While you sleep,

288
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,790
I'll make something delicious
for you. Okay?

289
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,390
Shall we go to sleep?

290
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,930
Let's go.

291
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
Ha Ni.

292
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,690
This is the first baby food
I've ever made.

293
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,490
Try it and see what it tastes like.

294
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,130
What do you think? Is it good?

295
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,700
Yes.

296
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,840
You seem to like it, Ha Ni.

297
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,140
I'm home.

298
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,680
Dad is home.

299
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,480
What are you doing, Ha Ni?
Are you eating?

300
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
Yes.

301
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:58,850
Did you make the food, Se Ri?

302
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,690
Yes. I watched a video
and taught myself.

303
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,920
This is my first time,

304
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,890
but Ha Ni seems to like it.

305
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,160
Ha Ni doesn't like to eat baby food.

306
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,460
But I guess she likes your cooking.

307
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,260
Really?

308
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,370
I think I have a talent
for making baby food.

309
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,040
It must be tiring.
You don't have to try so hard.

310
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,440
I can make it when I'm off.

311
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,480
I'm not tired at all.

312
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,340
It's fun.

313
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:34,920
By the way, Professor,

314
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:39,920
I keep feeling nervous.

315
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,190
- Ha Ni's mom...
- I told you.

316
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,830
I will protect you and Ha Ni.

317
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,000
Do you not trust me?

318
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,700
I do.

319
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,840
So, put your worries to rest
and take it easy.

320
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
Okay?

321
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,850
Ha Ni, do you want some more?

322
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,050
- Yes.
- You do?

323
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,450
Open up.

324
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,560
Do you like it?

325
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,870
Is it okay that you're here?

326
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,480
Why?

327
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:34,950
If Yeoung Ju's mom finds out,
she will make a scene.

328
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:37,750
Don't worry about what she does.

329
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,950
She just needs some time.

330
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,450
Nothing will change anyway.

331
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,720
I know.

332
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,090
Thank you for understanding me.

333
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,830
Actually, I was worried
you'd be upset.

334
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,100
Why would I be upset?

335
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,070
Even in a situation like this,
you are being unwavering...

336
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,940
and staying strong.

337
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,670
That makes me trust you even more.

338
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,440
Thank you for saying that.

339
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,150
Don't rush things.
Take your time to settle it.

340
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,210
I can wait
as long as you need me to.

341
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,450
Are you serious?

342
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,660
Your heart is already in mine,

343
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,220
so why would I feel rushed?

344
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,670
Thank you, Mi Sun.

345
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:48,250
I told you not to come.
Why do you keep showing up?

346
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,820
Where are you coming from now?

347
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,290
That's none of your business.

348
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,660
I'll forgive you for seeing
someone else for a moment.

349
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,860
Come back to where you belong.

350
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,660
You'll forgive me?

351
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,330
That's so ridiculous
that it makes me sad.

352
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,800
Chun Soo.

353
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,270
It's you who betrayed me first.

354
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:07,070
And you asked for a divorce.

355
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,040
That's why we submitted
the documents to the court.

356
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,510
It's not like I cheated.

357
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,240
I had every right to date Mi Sun.

358
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,650
I will never divorce you.

359
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,380
Stop being ridiculous.

360
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,780
Just go to the court
and meet the judge next week.

361
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,920
Then go back to the US.

362
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,120
Will you marry her
after I go back to the US?

363
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,220
Of course.

364
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,190
Once I wrap up
the legal process with you,

365
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,290
I'll get married.

366
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,790
I will never let it happen.

367
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,130
I don't need your permission.

368
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,230
So stop the nonsense.

369
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,660
What are you going to say
to Yeoung Ju?

370
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,600
She's being really sensitive
before entering college.

371
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,630
Don't try to use Yeoung Ju
to get your way.

372
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,000
It won't work.

373
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,670
You're crazy about a woman...

374
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,340
and don't even care
about your daughter.

375
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,770
And you call yourself a dad?

376
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,110
It's you who should behave properly
as a mother.

377
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,110
Do you understand?

378
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,480
What's wrong with him?

379
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,830
Welcome.

380
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:06,930
When did it start?

381
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:10,470
I have a customer now.
Keep your voice down.

382
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,740
So you're conscious
of the eyes of others.

383
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,910
Isn't it that you two were dating
even before I got married?

384
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,680
Is that how you deceived me?

385
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,280
I'm working now.
Let's talk after I'm done.

386
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,590
You seduced a man with a family.

387
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,020
What makes you so confident?

388
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,160
My goodness.

389
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,260
What do you think you're doing now?

390
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:41,470
Do you even feel ashamed
of yourself?

391
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,870
Why should I feel ashamed?

392
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:50,310
You got your alimony
to marry a different man.

393
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,510
But after you got scammed,

394
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:53,210
you came back
to leech off your ex-husband.

395
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:54,340
That's what's shameful.

396
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:57,150
What did you just say? Darn you!

397
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,820
There's a limit to my patience.

398
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,650
Let go of it when I'm being nice.

399
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,990
When you seduced
someone else's husband,

400
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,630
shouldn't you have been prepared
to be dragged by your hair?

401
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,660
- Hey!
- I told you to let go.

402
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm not putting up with this
anymore.

403
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,940
Ok Bun.

404
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,180
Kwang Sook.

405
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,380
Why on earth did you fight
with Heung Soo?

406
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,520
My gosh.

407
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:34,950
My goodness.

408
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:38,260
Kwang Sook, look.

409
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,330
- Hey!
- Let go!

410
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,460
Wait. Stop it.

411
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,000
Stop.

412
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,170
What are you doing?
You should know better.

413
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:51,800
You should talk it out instead.

414
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,080
Gosh, Ok Bun! What are you doing?

415
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,750
Who are you?
How dare you pull Mi Sun's hair?

416
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,720
Let go of it this instant!

417
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,390
Ok Bun...

418
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,750
Who are you?

419
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:14,160
Me? I'm Mi Sun's little sister!

420
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:17,290
- My goodness.
- Stop it, Ok Bun.

421
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:20,200
Hang on. Don't be like that, Ok Bun!

422
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,830
Stop it. Let go!

423
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:26,600
Hey, you. Apologize to Mi Sun now.

424
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,870
Then I'll let go of it.

425
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:31,780
I'll report all of you
to the police for assault!

426
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,450
Ok Bun! Let go of it immediately.

427
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,750
You might end up in jail!

428
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,280
I'm serious!

429
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,290
I'm already in a bad mood.

430
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,750
I don't mind going to jail!

431
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,920
- No! Please stop it!
- Let go!

432
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,560
- Please, Ok Bun.
- Stop it.

433
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,090
- Please.
- Let go!

434
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,860
What are you guys doing?

435
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
What?

436
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,870
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

437
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,650
I'm sorry
that you had to see all that.

438
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,950
Don't say that.

439
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:19,590
I believe you pulled her hair
because you had a good reason.

440
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,660
You know,

441
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,200
that woman once got me thrown
into a holding cell.

442
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,760
Darn it.

443
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,070
I should've taught her a lesson.

444
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,570
You already schooled her enough.

445
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,740
Thank you so much, Ok Bun.

446
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:39,410
As if you need to thank me.
Of course, I'd defend you.

447
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:43,980
Se Ri.

448
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,780
Please know...

449
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,750
that I'm not a violent person.

450
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,250
How was that violent?

451
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,690
You were just being loyal.

452
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,460
Loyal?

453
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:58,030
Yes, you were amazing today.

454
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,700
Goodness.

455
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:06,070
It feels great
to get a compliment from you.

456
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,340
To be honest, it was satisfying
to see her like that.

457
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,180
Anyway, what happened between you...

458
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,820
and Heung Soo?

459
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,550
Kwang Sook.

460
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,260
How could a guy be
that much of a coward?

461
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,370
"I may not have anything
to my name,"

462
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:39,340
"but I can make sure
you don't starve."

463
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,740
"So don't worry about a thing.
You can lean on me."

464
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,110
Shouldn't he have the balls
to say that?

465
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,210
Instead,

466
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,510
he got the wrong impression
and gave up on me.

467
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,780
How pathetic.

468
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,520
The men in the Oh family...

469
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:58,290
are too kind and upstanding.

470
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,090
On the other hand,

471
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,730
they lack balls
and aren't that gutsy.

472
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,330
They are a bit like that,
aren't they?

473
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,100
A bit?

474
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,400
They can be such cowards!

475
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,220
Professor Oh isn't like that.

476
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,620
What's right is right,
and what's wrong is wrong.

477
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,520
He always speaks his mind.

478
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,950
Pushing yourself too hard
at this age could cause injuries.

479
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,050
I recommend beginning with cardio.

480
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,350
I get what you mean,
but I'm in a rush.

481
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,890
How about this, then?
I'll consider it...

482
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,790
a boot camp for new recruits.

483
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,830
How do kids put it these days?

484
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,860
Bring the intensity.

485
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:15,370
- A boot camp for new recruits?
- Yes.

486
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,870
All right,
but take it nice and easy.

487
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,640
Okay. Let's do this.

488
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,550
Deeper.

489
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:35,950
Good.

490
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,190
And lift up.

491
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,890
Push yourself.

492
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,530
Looking good, sir.

493
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,200
Good. Push your butt back.

494
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,600
Now, catch.

495
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:57,810
Good.

496
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,440
Nice.

497
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,050
There you go. Good.

498
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,250
You've got this.

499
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,550
Hang in there.

500
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,160
You can do this.

501
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,790
Go, Mr. Han!

502
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,760
You've got this.

503
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,960
You can do it!

504
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
Go, Mr. Han.

505
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,400
My gosh.

506
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,310
- Goodness.
- There you go.

507
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,780
Where's Dad?

508
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,010
He isn't back from work yet.

509
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,080
He's working out at the hotel gym.

510
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,650
He's hitting the gym
now that he has a girlfriend.

511
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:17,690
What is it?

512
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,060
Don't you like
that he's seeing someone?

513
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,330
I'm not against it,

514
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,660
but it feels weird.

515
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,530
Grandma!

516
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,640
Grandma?

517
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,070
Yes, everything is good here.

518
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,540
Are you also doing well?

519
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,710
Dad's not back from the office yet,

520
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,680
but Gyeol's with me. One second.

521
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,720
It's me, Grandma.

522
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,620
I miss you too, of course.

523
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:51,720
Next week?

524
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,620
Sure. I'll see you next week, then.

525
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:56,330
Got it.

526
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,830
Grandma's coming to Korea next week.

527
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,360
- Really?
- Yes.

528
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,630
My gosh.

529
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,700
Looks like
you both got home early today.

530
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:06,200
- You're home.
- Hey.

531
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,000
I'd like one too.

532
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,740
That workout made me hungry.

533
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,910
Sure.

534
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,440
It'll fill you up nicely.

535
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,580
That tastes even better
after a workout.

536
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,650
Grandma will be here next week.

537
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,690
Really? What's the occasion?

538
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,260
I don't think there is one.

539
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,730
Got it.

540
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,860
My gosh.

541
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,530
Grandma will be shocked...

542
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,370
to hear he's seeing someone.

543
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,880
My goodness.

544
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,180
Goodness me.

545
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,090
My gosh.

546
00:31:58,890 --> 00:31:59,920
Oh, boy.

547
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,060
Is it because
I haven't exercised in a while?

548
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,090
I just can't seem
to regain my energy.

549
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,230
Goodness.

550
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:08,460
My gosh.

551
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:11,900
Goodness me.

552
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,240
Oh, boy.

553
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,140
Right.

554
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,510
Hey, Oh Heung Soo!

555
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,210
Get out here!

556
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,450
Ok Bun, you're obviously plastered.

557
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,850
Pull it together.

558
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,120
Kwang Sook!

559
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,990
Right.

560
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,360
Kwang Sook.

561
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,900
I'm not drunk at all.

562
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,760
I'm totally sober.

563
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,830
Yes, of course. I know that.

564
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:47,670
Why don't you lie down in my room?

565
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,280
Hey, Oh Heung Soo!

566
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,450
Where are you hiding?

567
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,810
Get out here this instant.

568
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,510
What's going on?

569
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,720
- But...
- Hey.

570
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,220
Hello.

571
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:09,060
I was...

572
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,830
so mad at Heung Soo...

573
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,900
that I had a drink.

574
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,670
Please be understanding.

575
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,840
Unbelievable.

576
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,170
Anyway,

577
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:26,280
where is that jerk, Oh Heung Soo?

578
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,680
Well, I think
he's still at his shop.

579
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,980
Is that so?

580
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:32,750
Then,

581
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,350
I should go to his shop.

582
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:37,590
- My gosh!
- Ok Bun, goodness.

583
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,590
Seriously! I am sick of this.

584
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,990
Can't we ever have
a moment of peace around here?

585
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,460
You, take her inside
and get her to bed.

586
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,430
Right, of course. Don't worry.

587
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:48,700
I'm home.

588
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,170
Hey, you've been ghosting me
all day.

589
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,410
How come you're here now?

590
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:00,040
You, Oh Heung Soo!

591
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,680
You dare call yourself a man?

592
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,520
This isn't the place
for your drunken antics.

593
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,850
How could you...

594
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:12,290
give up...

595
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:17,030
on me, Ji Ok Bun, that easily?

596
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:20,830
I don't care if he's
the youngest son of a rich CEO.

597
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,000
How could you...

598
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,400
wave the white flag so easily?

599
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,540
Should Oh Heung Soo, the artist,

600
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,910
crumble...

601
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,910
this easily...

602
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,320
just because he lacks money?

603
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,020
Hey, you!

604
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,890
Aren't you at all embarrassed?

605
00:34:43,890 --> 00:34:45,490
- That's enough.
- Hey!

606
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,960
You two! I'll be having nightmares
at this rate.

607
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,130
Take her inside this second!

608
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,660
- Sure.
- Got it.

609
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:55,100
- Heung Soo, take her to my room.
- Yes.

610
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,800
- Right.
- I'm sorry.

611
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,000
- Get over here.
- I'm sorry.

612
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,540
My gosh.

613
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:04,640
Good night.

614
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,340
Unbelievable.

615
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,190
I'm sorry for the commotion,
Kwang Sook.

616
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:24,130
Please don't upset Ok Bun.

617
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,960
Let's face it.

618
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,230
Who else in this world
cares about you...

619
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:32,770
as much as she does?

620
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,970
I know that all too well.

621
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:38,910
But...

622
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,640
being with me...

623
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,310
will only make life harder for her,
and I feel guilty.

624
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,050
If you want to do right by her,

625
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,390
don't ever feel that way.

626
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,990
Ok Bun...

627
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,260
likes you for the man you are.

628
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,730
Right.

629
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,260
I've been thinking
about what I did wrong.

630
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,170
Anyway, where will you sleep...

631
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,400
now that she's taken your bed?

632
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,430
Oh, that.

633
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,340
I can sleep in my mom's room.

634
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:09,570
Don't worry about it.

635
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:10,810
My gosh.

636
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,310
I can't believe her.

637
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,200
Ok Bun.

638
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,110
I'm sorry.

639
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:47,980
I'd love nothing more
than to ask you to be mine,

640
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,720
but I lack in so many ways.

641
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:57,720
I feel like I have nothing to offer.

642
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,660
Honestly,

643
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,470
my conscience is holding me back
at every turn.

644
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,680
Come in.

645
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,590
Hey, Kwang Sook.

646
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,590
I brought you
some refreshing citrus tea.

647
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,090
Thanks.

648
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,260
I was going over the documents
Chairman Han sent me.

649
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,130
Oh, I see.

650
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,070
I don't know about anything else,

651
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:48,040
but he's an excellent entrepreneur.

652
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,810
I've been reviewing both external...

653
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,380
and internal reports,

654
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,580
and it's clear he's managing
a solid and stable business.

655
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,710
- Is that so?
- Yes.

656
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,920
From the financial structure
to ethical management,

657
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,420
there's nothing to criticize.

658
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:06,190
You must be busy with college,

659
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,560
yet here you are,
spending time on this test.

660
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,790
The test is just an excuse.

661
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,330
As the outside director,
I should be aware...

662
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:15,160
of these things anyway.

663
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:18,130
That's good to hear.

664
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,370
Still,

665
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,470
please go easy on him.

666
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,170
Got it?

667
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,580
Don't worry.

668
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,380
I'm on your side, remember?

669
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,110
I'll put my trust in you, then.

670
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,350
Thanks for this.

671
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,260
Are you doing well, Mr. Lee?

672
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,160
I'm busy too with the brewery.

673
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,060
That aside,

674
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,700
I called to ask you something.

675
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,400
It's about LX Group.

676
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,600
How is it doing?

677
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,800
During my time in finance,

678
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,070
LX Group shareholders refused
to sell their shares,

679
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,480
trusting the group's
internal stability.

680
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,140
The CEO poses no risks.

681
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,410
The company is reliable,

682
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:04,910
which is why shareholders
want to retain their shares.

683
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,850
Right.

684
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,190
What's
Chairman Han's reputation like...

685
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,290
in the stock market?

686
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,160
He's regarded as a reliable CEO.

687
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,390
Rather than showing off,
he values internal stability.

688
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,060
The market has reacted positively
to his management skills.

689
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,470
Sure thing. Thanks for this.

690
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:27,100
I'll swing by the neighborhood
sometime.

691
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,370
We'll grab a bite to eat. Sure.

692
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:33,810
Knock, knock.

693
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:34,840
Come in.

694
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,380
Can I come in?

695
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:39,180
Of course, Kwang Sook.

696
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,950
What's this?

697
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:47,920
It's for you.

698
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,890
Are you bribing me
to take it easy on the chairman?

699
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,830
Did you catch on?

700
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,870
Hold on. Come and have a seat.

701
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,270
I've been making calls
here and there.

702
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,780
His reputation precedes him,

703
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,450
and he is recognized
as a capable CEO.

704
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,150
I believe we can trust him with you.

705
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:15,080
I give him a perfect score.

706
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,760
I'm truly relieved
to hear you say that.

707
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,390
Thanks.

708
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:28,560
By the way,

709
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,130
how are things going
with Yeoung Ju's mom?

710
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,070
She was scammed out of her alimony,

711
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:41,640
so she's forcing this
since she has no one to turn to.

712
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,510
Still, I'm trying to take this slow.

713
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,650
If I make a mistake
while trying to rush it,

714
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,850
she'll figure out a way
to hold that against me.

715
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:56,330
Is Mi Sun on the same page?

716
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,830
Yes.

717
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:01,200
We discussed handling this slowly.

718
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,370
Earlier, I saw...

719
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,570
Mi Sun stand up to So Yeon
and grab her by the hair.

720
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:10,340
I was amazed by her charisma.

721
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:12,880
She had to endure a lot as well.

722
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:19,580
Let's think about what we can do...

723
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,680
to solve this matter quietly.

724
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,490
Got it, Kwang Sook.

725
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,550
Thank you.

726
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:36,070
Not long ago, at last,

727
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:39,100
I happened to find out
who your mother is.

728
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,300
Well?

729
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:43,110
Aren't you interested?

730
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,470
I deserve to die for what I did.

731
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,340
For the rest of my life,

732
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:24,350
I'll devote myself to you
to make up for it.

733
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,580
So please forgive me
for Se Ri's sake.

734
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,220
Imagine how shocked she'll be...

735
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,790
when she finds out.

736
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,460
She's disappointed enough as it is,

737
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,460
knowing we embezzled
from Eagle Brewery.

738
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,470
If we disappoint her again...

739
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,470
So?

740
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,670
Are you saying we should move on
and act like nothing ever happened?

741
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,250
Put yourself in my shoes.

742
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,210
Would you be able to do that?

743
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,990
What if I had a child
out of wedlock 30 years ago...

744
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,990
and kept it from you...

745
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,960
when we got married?

746
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:14,430
Could you forgive me easily?

747
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:23,740
Of course, it wouldn't be easy,

748
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,680
but I would forgive you.

749
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,720
Our children should be
our priority now.

750
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:35,880
Our children?

751
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,120
Did you say, "children?"

752
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,690
How is Kang Soo my son?

753
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:42,960
He's yours!

754
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:45,390
Se Ri's the only child I have!

755
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,530
I'm sorry, honey.

756
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:49,260
I wasn't thinking clearly,
and it slipped out by mistake.

757
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,230
It wasn't a mistake.
That's clearly what you think.

758
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,240
Honey...

759
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,270
He's your son,
but no one knows who his father is!

760
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,270
Don't even think
about shoving him into our lives.

761
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,110
It disgusts me.

762
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,010
What?

763
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,680
It disgusts you?

764
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:09,390
That's right. It disgusts me.

765
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,350
Oh, gosh.

766
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,520
Hello?

767
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:49,890
Why do you sound so down?

768
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,000
I ache all over.

769
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,270
I missed work today.

770
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,600
Oh, no.

771
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,270
I guess you exercised too hard.

772
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,470
It looks like it.

773
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,740
Did you see a doctor?

774
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:11,180
No. I can't even lift a finger.

775
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,050
I'll see my doctor later,
when I'm feeling a bit better.

776
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,450
Goodness.

777
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:19,120
This test might kill you.

778
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:21,920
Kwang Sook, I'm back.

779
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,760
Rest up. I'll call you later.

780
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:28,860
I'm coming.

781
00:45:31,430 --> 00:45:32,770
Did things go well?

782
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:33,770
Yes.

783
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,410
I got the bill of lading
for the shipment to LA.

784
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:46,880
Our product is entering
the US market at last?

785
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:48,720
The container will be loaded today.

786
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,320
We sent an actual shipment,

787
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,920
so that marks the beginning of
our exports of Jang-Kwang yakju.

788
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,990
Congratulations.

789
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,630
- Congratulations, Boss.
- Congratulations, Boss.

790
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,830
I'm not the only one
who should be congratulated.

791
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:05,130
We should congratulate each other.

792
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,740
High-five!

793
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:08,200
High-five!

794
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,740
- High-five!
- High-five!

795
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:15,940
- Jang-Kwang yakju is going global!
- Yes!

796
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,050
- Oh, yes!
- Yes.

797
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:24,950
I want to release
a new premium product.

798
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,290
Didn't Research and Development
try that...

799
00:46:29,290 --> 00:46:30,490
before giving up?

800
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:32,760
You explain.

801
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Yes, sir.

802
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:37,430
With the hopes of becoming
LX Hotel's supplier,

803
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:38,930
we used different raw materials...

804
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,040
and existing facilities
to create a new product.

805
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:43,640
The new premium product line...

806
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,570
will be produced in a new factory.

807
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,440
Simply put,

808
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,550
we'll create a separate subsidiary.

809
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:53,180
It's risky to start a new business
when we're already in the red.

810
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,790
Do you think I don't know that?

811
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,690
Our company
is still financially sturdy,

812
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,390
so why don't we wait...

813
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:04,090
and look for an opportunity
to increase sales first?

814
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:06,660
We're in this situation
because Eagle Brewery...

815
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:08,660
made Jang-Kwang Makgeolli...

816
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:11,830
and got a head start
in occupying the premium market.

817
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:13,840
It wouldn't have come to this...

818
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,900
if we'd taken action sooner.

819
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,180
This isn't a competition.

820
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:25,880
It's a war, okay?

821
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:29,590
If we don't crush
Eagle Brewery completely,

822
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:32,290
we could face a crisis like this
again at any time.

823
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:36,430
Do you want to lose
to a tiny brewery like them?

824
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:38,790
Do you?

825
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,240
Get out!

826
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,580
My gosh.

827
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,120
Goodness.

828
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,560
Hello?

829
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:16,470
Hello. It's Oh Kang Soo.

830
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,740
What? Did you change your mind?

831
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:21,800
Yes.

832
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,810
I'll come and see you at lunchtime.

833
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,880
Okay. You made the right decision.

834
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,280
It's a past you'd want to forget,

835
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,620
but you should know
who your parents are.

836
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,260
Yes, honey.

837
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,300
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

838
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,070
Come to my office around lunchtime.

839
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:54,800
What for?

840
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,010
Let's have an honest conversation...

841
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,010
and have lunch together.

842
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,090
Kang Soo?

843
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:21,200
Hello.

844
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:24,470
What are you doing here?

845
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:26,270
I'm here to see your husband.

846
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,670
He asked to see you again?

847
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:32,270
Yes.

848
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:34,980
He said he'd tell me
about my parents.

849
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,110
That's why I'm here.

850
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,250
Leave.

851
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:40,980
What?

852
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,620
You don't need to see my husband.

853
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:44,920
So leave.

854
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,290
What do you mean?

855
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,830
I'll explain everything later.

856
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,200
Please leave for now.
That's best for you.

857
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,600
I beg of you.

858
00:50:04,610 --> 00:50:05,740
Do as I say.

859
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:07,810
Okay?

860
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,420
Who is it?

861
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,450
Hello.

862
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,360
I'm Ma Kwang Sook.

863
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,560
I'm here to see the chairman.

864
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,830
Ms. Ma Kwang Sook? Give me a moment.

865
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,770
Come in.

866
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:40,880
Chairman.

867
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:43,010
Ms. Ma Kwang Sook...

868
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,150
is here to see you. What shall I do?

869
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:48,520
Oh, my gosh.

870
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,550
Let her in.

871
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:51,990
Yes, sir.

872
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,060
Oh, dear.

873
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,600
- Hello.
- Hello.

874
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,470
My gosh.

875
00:51:10,810 --> 00:51:13,240
Why are you here, Kwang Sook?

876
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,310
I got worried and had to come by.

877
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,880
I brought some pain relief patches.

878
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:26,250
Let's talk in my room.

879
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:35,960
My gosh.

880
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,470
That must be his girlfriend.

881
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,610
My gosh. Thanks.

882
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:48,210
- Here.
- Here?

883
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:49,210
Yes.

884
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:51,750
- Oh, boy.
- How does it feel?

885
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:54,280
I think
it's cooling me down already.

886
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:58,620
Then you can lift your shirt now.

887
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:00,220
What?

888
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:03,230
You said your back
and shoulders hurt too.

889
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,830
It's fine.

890
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,030
It's not fine.

891
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:10,570
I'll cover up
every part of you that aches.

892
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:12,270
- Lift your shirt.
- No.

893
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:14,340
What woman knows no shame?

894
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,700
Leave it.

895
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:18,210
I'm asking you
to lift it just enough...

896
00:52:18,210 --> 00:52:20,480
so I can reach,
not to take it all off.

897
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:22,710
Why are you so embarrassed?

898
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:24,550
Forget it. I won't do it.

899
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:25,680
Goodness.

900
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,980
We're both getting older,
so let's not be like this.

901
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:31,420
We might have met later in life,

902
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:34,890
but I want to be a man around you.

903
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,830
My goodness. You're so fussy.

904
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:39,090
Okay, then.

905
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,360
I'll leave the rest here.

906
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:43,570
Be sure to treat
the other sore muscles.

907
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,230
I will.

908
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:49,400
I think we should postpone...

909
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,140
the test date.

910
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:53,340
What for?

911
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:57,180
You can't get tested
when you ache so badly.

912
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,650
No. I'll get tested
on the day we agreed on.

913
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:03,450
I don't want your brothers-in-law
to see me weak.

914
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:06,790
What if you suffer even more
or get hurt?

915
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,720
The best way
to relieve muscle soreness...

916
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,190
is with another workout.

917
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:20,270
Your eyes have sunken
in just one day.

918
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,900
Why would you...

919
00:53:23,470 --> 00:53:25,010
do this to yourself for me?

920
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:27,610
Who cares...

921
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:29,950
if I do this to myself for you?

922
00:53:30,450 --> 00:53:33,250
It's totally worth it to me.

923
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:41,390
Seeing you in person
completely recharged me.

924
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:43,020
I should start over now.

925
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,330
Oh, that hurt.

926
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,620
Thank you for your hard work.

927
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,120
You don't need to thank me.

928
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,920
Thanks to you,
I got to start exercising again,

929
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,060
which was nice.

930
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:58,360
All right.

931
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,870
(Drill Instructor)

932
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:05,030
We will now...

933
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,870
begin Chairman Han's fitness test.

934
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:48,810
All right. Increase the weight.

935
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,990
All right. Add more plates.

936
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:36,260
Nice.

937
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:40,430
Hang in there!

938
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:54,040
(Pass)

939
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:02,420
They said the test was over.

940
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:03,750
Why aren't they coming?

941
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,990
What if he collapsed
on his way here?

942
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:07,860
You're worrying too much.

943
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:09,320
They'll be here soon.

944
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:12,890
- We're home.
- They're here.

945
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,030
- Hello.
- Yes, hello.

946
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:18,530
You must've been through a lot,
Mr. Han.

947
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:20,900
Did you do well?

948
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,040
Yes.

949
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:24,470
What took you so long?

950
00:58:24,470 --> 00:58:26,370
You said
the test was over a while ago.

951
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:27,910
After the test,

952
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:30,110
we went to the sauna together.

953
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,380
I must say we got to know Mr. Han
through and through today.

954
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,150
You must be hungry.
Let's have a seat.

955
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,460
All right.

956
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:45,030
Not all the tests
are completely finished yet.

957
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:47,160
This is the last test.

958
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:49,260
It's the drinking test.

959
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:53,030
He must be tired
from exercising all day.

960
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,170
You should eat before drinking.

961
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:58,370
Kwang Sook, Ms. Gong.
Please excuse us for a moment.

962
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:59,410
What?

963
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:03,850
Do you really have to go that far?

964
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,710
Yes. We need your cooperation.

965
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,180
My gosh, you're being too strict.

966
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:11,990
All right.

967
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:14,360
Call us when the test is over.

968
00:59:14,990 --> 00:59:16,060
Good luck!

969
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:19,960
- Come on. Let's go inside.
- All right.

970
00:59:37,350 --> 00:59:39,350
Please drink it up.

971
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:18,790
The medical checkup results...

972
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:20,190
are good.

973
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,060
And you have a good reputation...

974
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:25,990
among securities firms.

975
01:00:25,990 --> 01:00:28,330
I'll give you...

976
01:00:28,330 --> 01:00:30,770
five out of five.

977
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:32,570
Good.

978
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,370
Aren't you being too generous?

979
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:37,970
I'm not being generous.
It's just accurate.

980
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:40,940
Okay. Next.

981
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,180
Professor Oh.

982
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:48,480
I've checked things thoroughly.

983
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:52,220
He's just flawless.

984
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,720
I give him a perfect score.

985
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,360
Thanks.

986
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,730
Gosh, there's no tension at all.

987
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,170
Kang Soo, do you also give him
a perfect score?

988
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:05,700
Yes!

989
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:09,300
I agree with them.

990
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,240
What? That's not fun. Come on, guys.

991
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,310
I won't give you
a perfect score so easily.

992
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:23,320
If you finish your last drink
in one go,

993
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:25,850
I'll give you a perfect score.

994
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:29,720
All right.

995
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:57,490
Okay?

996
01:01:58,450 --> 01:01:59,520
Okay!

997
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:04,190
Mr. Han, you win!

998
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,690
I give you a perfect score too!

999
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,130
Mission accomplished!

1000
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:20,910
Oh, dear.

1001
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:24,380
My goodness.

1002
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:26,310
Mr. Han...

1003
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,180
Well done, Mr. Han.

1004
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,360
Kwang Sook.

1005
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:40,430
Kwang Sook?

1006
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:46,630
Kwang Sook.

1007
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,040
Kwang Sook.

1008
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:55,640
My goodness. Yes?

1009
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:01,550
How did it go?

1010
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,780
Kwang Sook.

1011
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:04,620
I...

1012
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:07,090
passed the test!

1013
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,630
I passed!

1014
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:20,170
Oh, dear.
