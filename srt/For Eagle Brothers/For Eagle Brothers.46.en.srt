1
00:00:02,055 --> 00:00:03,155
I'm not interested...

2
00:00:03,485 --> 00:00:06,855
in the chairman's money.

3
00:00:09,895 --> 00:00:11,995
You should know that I turned down...

4
00:00:12,535 --> 00:00:13,765
his marriage proposal at first.

5
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:18,105
If I were after his money,

6
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:20,235
would I have done that?

7
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:22,575
Is that the truth?

8
00:00:23,605 --> 00:00:25,375
This isn't something I can show you,

9
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,545
so how can I get you to believe me?

10
00:00:29,145 --> 00:00:31,915
If so, can you come with me to meet a lawyer...

11
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:34,515
and sign away your rights?

12
00:00:35,255 --> 00:00:37,425
My rights?

13
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:40,195
That you'll give up your claim to the inheritance...

14
00:00:40,325 --> 00:00:43,425
and leave it to my grandchildren instead.

15
00:00:45,435 --> 00:00:46,735
Absolutely.

16
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:48,065
Really?

17
00:00:48,235 --> 00:00:50,905
Then, let's wrap this up and take it to a lawyer.

18
00:00:51,675 --> 00:00:53,135
- Sure. - Mother.

19
00:00:56,405 --> 00:00:57,445
Dong Seok?

20
00:00:57,845 --> 00:01:00,315
What do you think you're doing?

21
00:01:05,955 --> 00:01:08,855
You're overstepping your authority.

22
00:01:09,925 --> 00:01:11,795
- Am I? - Yes, you are.

23
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:12,925
It's too much.

24
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:15,965
I'm doing what I must for my grandchildren.

25
00:01:16,465 --> 00:01:18,935
How dare you raise your voice at me?

26
00:01:19,735 --> 00:01:21,835
If this is what she wants,

27
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:24,105
I'm willing to sign it away.

28
00:01:24,105 --> 00:01:25,235
Stay out of it, Kwang Sook.

29
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:26,705
This is between me and her.

30
00:01:27,705 --> 00:01:30,705
A marriage is about trust. It's not a contract.

31
00:01:31,275 --> 00:01:34,215
We don't need documents that outline our gains.

32
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:36,145
It's wiser to be prepared...

33
00:01:36,145 --> 00:01:38,055
than to regret it later.

34
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:39,915
If any problem comes up,

35
00:01:39,915 --> 00:01:42,555
we can sort that out then, depending on the situation.

36
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:46,055
How can a company chairman say that?

37
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:49,125
I ask again, Mother.

38
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:51,865
Don't cross the line.

39
00:01:54,905 --> 00:01:57,705
I'll wait and see how big a price you pay...

40
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,935
for not listening to me.

41
00:02:11,985 --> 00:02:13,815
Go after her and apologize.

42
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:16,185
No. I don't want to.

43
00:02:17,455 --> 00:02:18,455
But...

44
00:02:18,455 --> 00:02:21,465
signing a piece of paper isn't that big a deal.

45
00:02:23,965 --> 00:02:25,465
Are you stupid?

46
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,705
Why would you willingly say you'd sign that?

47
00:02:29,435 --> 00:02:31,635
I don't care about your money.

48
00:02:31,635 --> 00:02:34,275
I can sign what she asks a thousand times over.

49
00:02:34,735 --> 00:02:36,975
If signing a piece of paper will make her happy,

50
00:02:36,975 --> 00:02:38,415
why wouldn't I do that?

51
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:40,145
That's not the problem.

52
00:02:40,145 --> 00:02:41,685
She looks down on you...

53
00:02:41,685 --> 00:02:43,415
and wants to control you.

54
00:02:43,415 --> 00:02:45,815
Her domineering attitude is the problem.

55
00:02:45,815 --> 00:02:48,655
Why do you put up with everything like a fool?

56
00:02:50,085 --> 00:02:51,995
I don't agree with you.

57
00:02:51,995 --> 00:02:55,025
I totally understand where she's coming from.

58
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:57,225
If you start to give in like this,

59
00:02:57,225 --> 00:02:59,095
you'll have to give in all the time.

60
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,795
What's wrong with giving in?

61
00:03:00,795 --> 00:03:02,305
She's not a stranger to you.

62
00:03:04,065 --> 00:03:07,335
As much as I cherish and adore you,

63
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:10,345
I want others to respect you equally.

64
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:11,875
You'll be my wife now.

65
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:14,775
Okay, I get that.

66
00:03:17,285 --> 00:03:18,315
Kwang Sook...

67
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:38,235
Wait.

68
00:03:46,115 --> 00:03:48,445
Oh, no. What do I do now?

69
00:03:52,515 --> 00:03:53,915
Where to, ma'am?

70
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:56,585
Take me home.

71
00:03:56,985 --> 00:03:59,555
Pardon? Oh, where do you live?

72
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:01,825
What?

73
00:04:02,125 --> 00:04:04,425
Tell me the address so I can take you there.

74
00:04:09,905 --> 00:04:11,805
Which neighborhood shall I take you to?

75
00:04:13,435 --> 00:04:14,535
Which neighborhood?

76
00:04:18,515 --> 00:04:19,745
What was it called?

77
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:24,615
Will you just...

78
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:26,555
keep going straight?

79
00:04:26,955 --> 00:04:29,055
I'll tell you the address later.

80
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:31,385
Okay.

81
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:46,535
Do you feel unwell?

82
00:04:47,135 --> 00:04:48,175
No.

83
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:50,475
You look a bit pale.

84
00:04:51,245 --> 00:04:53,845
No. I feel fine.

85
00:05:01,215 --> 00:05:04,525
How could Dong Seok talk to me like that?

86
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:06,725
If he cares about my Min Seo,

87
00:05:06,725 --> 00:05:08,665
he can't do this to me.

88
00:05:19,305 --> 00:05:22,145
If only I could've signed a paper to end it all.

89
00:05:24,545 --> 00:05:27,245
Did he have to appear just then?

90
00:05:45,165 --> 00:05:47,795
I've known this lady for a long time.

91
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:49,465
She ran a childcare center...

92
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:52,375
in the neighborhood until a few years ago.

93
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,935
I've heard a lot about you.

94
00:05:54,935 --> 00:05:56,605
Thanks for making the time.

95
00:05:58,475 --> 00:05:59,775
Her name is Ha Ni, right?

96
00:06:00,345 --> 00:06:02,185
She's adorable.

97
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,785
She's so gentle and sweet.

98
00:06:06,485 --> 00:06:08,585
Don't worry about Ha Ni. Just go to work.

99
00:06:08,885 --> 00:06:10,085
Okay. Thank you.

100
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:13,395
Once my husband can walk again,

101
00:06:13,455 --> 00:06:15,965
I will come back right away. Please hang in there until then.

102
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:17,425
Don't worry.

103
00:06:17,895 --> 00:06:19,735
Oh, right. I'll take her.

104
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:23,065
Okay. I have a meeting to attend, so I'll get going.

105
00:06:23,465 --> 00:06:25,775
Well, I'll call you when I'm on my way to pick up Ha Ni.

106
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,005
Okay. I'll see you later.

107
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:31,305
I should go to the hospital, then.

108
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:34,675
Ha Ni, have fun with her today.

109
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:36,415
Don't cry. Okay?

110
00:06:36,985 --> 00:06:38,145
Have a nice day.

111
00:06:38,145 --> 00:06:40,185
Don't worry about her. I'll call you.

112
00:06:51,795 --> 00:06:52,835
Ha Ni.

113
00:06:53,395 --> 00:06:56,265
It's Mommy. My baby.

114
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:02,375
You seemed so desperate, so I did as you asked.

115
00:07:03,205 --> 00:07:05,115
But I'm not sure if I did the right thing.

116
00:07:06,245 --> 00:07:07,345
Thank you.

117
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,445
I will never forget what you did for me.

118
00:07:10,885 --> 00:07:13,715
If her dad finds out, he will be furious.

119
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:15,685
I'm Ha Ni's mom.

120
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,655
I can take good care of her...

121
00:07:17,655 --> 00:07:19,825
and cherish her more than anyone else.

122
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:25,135
Ha Ni.

123
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:27,695
It's Mommy.

124
00:07:28,235 --> 00:07:29,435
My baby.

125
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:34,435
Let's go home now. Okay?

126
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,155
Mom.

127
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:52,655
Are you really going to divorce Dad?

128
00:07:54,395 --> 00:07:56,865
You're not, are you? You just said that, right?

129
00:07:57,225 --> 00:07:58,795
I wasn't just saying that.

130
00:07:59,865 --> 00:08:00,935
I'll divorce him.

131
00:08:07,005 --> 00:08:08,745
Do you really not understand...

132
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,175
the sense of betrayal Dad must be feeling?

133
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,215
He's been deceived by his wife for 30 years.

134
00:08:15,045 --> 00:08:17,145
Don't you think his reaction is understandable?

135
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:20,715
I'm too tired now.

136
00:08:22,425 --> 00:08:24,285
I'm sick of tiptoeing around him.

137
00:08:25,895 --> 00:08:27,555
I want to live in peace now.

138
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:32,535
Still, divorce isn't the only answer.

139
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:35,095
It's not the only answer.

140
00:08:36,505 --> 00:08:38,805
But for now, it is the only exit I have.

141
00:08:41,505 --> 00:08:42,605
There hasn't been...

142
00:08:43,405 --> 00:08:45,945
a single day that I've lived in peace.

143
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,015
I want to live with peace of mind now.

144
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:55,085
Please understand me, Se Ri. Okay?

145
00:09:18,545 --> 00:09:19,615
Hello?

146
00:09:19,845 --> 00:09:21,215
Ms. Attorney, it's me.

147
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:23,385
Please submit the divorce papers.

148
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:27,755
My husband still doesn't want to get divorced,

149
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:30,085
but I want to end things here.

150
00:09:32,095 --> 00:09:33,555
I've never been able...

151
00:09:33,755 --> 00:09:36,065
to use my credit card without my husband's permission.

152
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,265
I don't want to have to ask for his permission to get a divorce.

153
00:09:40,135 --> 00:09:42,335
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

154
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:52,245
- Hello? - It's me, Chairman Dokgo.

155
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:54,715
Are you drunk?

156
00:09:55,915 --> 00:09:59,885
I miss my wife, and I want to see my kids too.

157
00:09:59,885 --> 00:10:02,855
So I drank a little.

158
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:06,255
Things are going well here without you, Director Seo.

159
00:10:06,255 --> 00:10:08,995
I said you didn't have to worry.

160
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:11,395
Why do you keep getting softhearted?

161
00:10:12,635 --> 00:10:13,765
Do you need some money?

162
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:18,405
I don't need money or anything else.

163
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:22,945
I just...

164
00:10:26,145 --> 00:10:28,785
want to go home.

165
00:10:31,045 --> 00:10:32,955
Are you acting out after day drinking?

166
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,785
I'm not acting out!

167
00:10:36,585 --> 00:10:41,125
At least you should know how I'm feeling now.

168
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:44,665
So I'm being honest with you.

169
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:49,405
Of course, I understand how you are feeling. I really do.

170
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:53,905
So, try and hang in there just a little longer. Okay?

171
00:10:54,035 --> 00:10:56,375
I'll make you return home in glory.

172
00:10:56,675 --> 00:10:57,975
How long do I have to wait?

173
00:10:59,145 --> 00:11:02,585
How long do you want me to hang on?

174
00:11:02,815 --> 00:11:05,415
It's not like you've been there for a year, let alone ten.

175
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:08,955
You should know how to see the big picture and wait.

176
00:11:08,985 --> 00:11:11,025
Why are you whining like this already?

177
00:11:12,895 --> 00:11:13,995
Darn it!

178
00:11:23,035 --> 00:11:24,705
I didn't mind knowing...

179
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,705
you were my little sister.

180
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:29,505
What about you, Se Ri?

181
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:32,915
Having a decent man like you for an older brother?

182
00:11:32,915 --> 00:11:34,615
What's not to like about that?

183
00:11:37,915 --> 00:11:40,715
Not only that, but you also went out of your way...

184
00:11:40,885 --> 00:11:42,455
to help me be with Professor Oh.

185
00:11:43,755 --> 00:11:46,155
I also felt a connection to you,

186
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:49,895
which is why I asked you for many favors.

187
00:11:55,095 --> 00:11:56,365
Aren't you having lunch?

188
00:11:57,635 --> 00:11:59,005
My stomach is feeling a little funny.

189
00:11:59,175 --> 00:12:00,375
You should go and eat without me.

190
00:12:00,735 --> 00:12:02,375
Do you want me to get you some digestive medicine?

191
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:04,745
I don't need medicine. I'm all right.

192
00:12:05,345 --> 00:12:06,375
Okay.

193
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:09,245
By the way, Kang Soo,

194
00:12:10,745 --> 00:12:14,015
I saw Se Ri come to the office to see you...

195
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:15,785
a few days ago.

196
00:12:18,085 --> 00:12:20,625
It seemed somewhat serious.

197
00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:23,325
Is something wrong?

198
00:12:27,535 --> 00:12:29,405
Do you want to grab a beer with me after work?

199
00:12:30,235 --> 00:12:31,235
Beer?

200
00:12:32,105 --> 00:12:33,475
Let's talk over a beer.

201
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:36,375
Okay.

202
00:12:42,985 --> 00:12:45,115
(Pot Number 4)

203
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:53,895
Hello, Ok Bun.

204
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:00,935
Yes. Did you check this?

205
00:13:00,935 --> 00:13:01,935
Kwang Sook.

206
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:04,735
Heung Soo will be on the news soon.

207
00:13:06,135 --> 00:13:09,105
Why? Did he cause trouble?

208
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:12,415
No. It's a good thing.

209
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:14,675
(Dancing Prince, Oh Heung Soo)

210
00:13:14,675 --> 00:13:16,815
He got a call about it in the morning.

211
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:18,085
We're at the broadcasting station.

212
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:20,655
We wanted to tell you sooner,

213
00:13:20,855 --> 00:13:23,185
but we were both so busy that we forgot to call you.

214
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,095
Okay. I'm hanging up.

215
00:13:33,335 --> 00:13:35,505
Everyone, come to the office now!

216
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:37,505
What? What's going on?

217
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:39,635
- Turn on the TV. Hurry. - What?

218
00:13:41,135 --> 00:13:43,305
- It's here. Have a seat. Hurry. - What?

219
00:13:43,705 --> 00:13:44,775
Let's sit.

220
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:48,545
It's on.

221
00:13:50,645 --> 00:13:53,415
Camera, standby. Five seconds left.

222
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,755
(Dancing Prince, Oh Heung Soo)

223
00:13:54,755 --> 00:13:57,525
Three, two, one.

224
00:13:59,955 --> 00:14:02,465
It was hip-hop 20 years ago. Now, he makes sandwiches.

225
00:14:02,765 --> 00:14:06,265
For today's "Now, This Person," we have Mr. Oh Heung Soo here.

226
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:07,365
Welcome.

227
00:14:07,365 --> 00:14:09,205
- Hello. - Hello.

228
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:10,805
Hip-hop pants and the bunny dance...

229
00:14:10,805 --> 00:14:13,005
made a comeback last weekend.

230
00:14:13,205 --> 00:14:17,045
And at the center of it all was a dancer in his 40s.

231
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:23,245
So how did you end up on stage again?

232
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:25,415
While Hyun Jin Young...

233
00:14:25,415 --> 00:14:27,855
was preparing for his 35th debut anniversary concert,

234
00:14:28,255 --> 00:14:31,125
he said he wanted to get the old members back together.

235
00:14:31,555 --> 00:14:34,295
My gosh. Heung Soo looks great on TV.

236
00:14:34,295 --> 00:14:36,225
I know. He looks like a young guy in his 20s.

237
00:14:36,965 --> 00:14:40,035
But due to their health issues and work circumstances,

238
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:42,865
I was the only one who was available.

239
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:43,965
I see.

240
00:14:43,965 --> 00:14:46,205
I hear you're running a sandwich shop.

241
00:14:46,335 --> 00:14:48,375
Yes. I make sandwiches during the day...

242
00:14:48,505 --> 00:14:50,405
and practice dance routines at night.

243
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:53,445
I see. The videos of your performance...

244
00:14:53,445 --> 00:14:56,415
are quickly going viral on social media.

245
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:58,415
There are a lot of comments as well.

246
00:14:58,415 --> 00:15:00,015
- Did you read them all? - Yes.

247
00:15:00,285 --> 00:15:02,085
Was there a comment that you found most memorable?

248
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:07,825
"I want to rewind my life once again."

249
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:10,725
When I read this comment, I got quite emotional.

250
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:15,705
A dancing middle-aged man, driven by a timeless passion.

251
00:15:16,065 --> 00:15:18,265
The performance of Oh Heung Soo, a dancer in his 40s,

252
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:21,675
inspires dreams and passion in many people.

253
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:24,575
Lastly, please say a few words to your fans.

254
00:15:24,775 --> 00:15:25,815
Okay.

255
00:15:28,985 --> 00:15:31,685
If someone saw me...

256
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:36,355
and found the courage to start things over again,

257
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:38,525
that's all that matters to me.

258
00:15:39,295 --> 00:15:40,325
Thank you.

259
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:45,635
- Thank you for joining us today. - Thank you.

260

(On Air)

261
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:05,185
Heung Soo. I saw you in a whole new light today.

262
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,755
How are you so eloquent?

263
00:16:07,815 --> 00:16:09,385
You might not have noticed,

264
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,485
but my legs trembled so much.

265
00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:13,955
I just checked,

266
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:16,095
and your Dancing Prince channel...

267
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:18,465
has over 100,000 subscribers now.

268
00:16:18,865 --> 00:16:19,865
A hundred thousand?

269
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:22,335
I don't believe it.

270
00:16:22,635 --> 00:16:24,205
It's hard to wrap my head around.

271
00:16:25,605 --> 00:16:26,675
Heung Soo!

272
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:31,575
Hey.

273
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:39,815
Hey, who's this? It's Ri An.

274
00:16:39,815 --> 00:16:42,685
Heung Soo. I missed you so much.

275
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:45,325
It has been a while.

276
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,755
Everyone is raving about you on social media.

277
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,025
Congratulations.

278
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,225
Well...

279
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:53,495
Thanks.

280
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:55,195
Wait.

281
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:58,105
Can you join me on stage the next time I perform?

282
00:16:58,705 --> 00:16:59,775
Heung Soo?

283
00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:02,005
What?

284
00:17:06,745 --> 00:17:09,745
I'll have to talk to my manager about it.

285
00:17:10,515 --> 00:17:11,585
Your manager?

286
00:17:15,615 --> 00:17:17,755
To protect my artist's image,

287
00:17:17,755 --> 00:17:20,925
I don't let him perform with just anyone.

288
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:22,825
I'll think about it and get back to you.

289
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:26,365
You have another appointment. Let's go.

290
00:17:26,365 --> 00:17:27,495
Yes, sure.

291
00:17:28,235 --> 00:17:29,405
- Bye. - See you...

292
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:33,405
Wait, Heung...

293
00:17:36,005 --> 00:17:37,205
What was that about?

294
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:40,915
Did you see that?

295
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:49,325
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

296
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:00,035
Hi, Kwang Sook.

297
00:18:00,795 --> 00:18:02,465
Do you feel a bit better now?

298
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:06,205
I wasn't angry.

299
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,545
I said that because I was upset that my mother-in-law...

300
00:18:11,545 --> 00:18:12,975
didn't respect you.

301
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:17,915
I'm really grateful that you care about me,

302
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:22,685
but go to your mother-in-law and apologize.

303
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,095
Why do you keep telling me to apologize...

304
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:29,225
when I did nothing wrong?

305
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:33,365
I know it's not fair of her to make such demands.

306
00:18:34,035 --> 00:18:35,865
But what's the point in beating her?

307
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:40,375
She's just worried about her son-in-law and grandchildren.

308
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:44,975
Let's be honest. If I were her,

309
00:18:44,975 --> 00:18:46,715
I wouldn't trust myself either.

310
00:18:46,715 --> 00:18:48,775
I'd suspect my motives too.

311
00:18:49,245 --> 00:18:50,515
Wouldn't you?

312
00:18:52,615 --> 00:18:56,355
My gosh. You're turning into such a nag.

313
00:18:57,085 --> 00:18:58,725
Okay, fine.

314
00:19:14,275 --> 00:19:15,305
I'm home.

315
00:19:16,805 --> 00:19:17,945
You're back early.

316
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:22,545
I left work early because...

317
00:19:22,545 --> 00:19:24,685
Kwang Sook insisted I apologize to you.

318
00:19:25,715 --> 00:19:26,715
Take a seat.

319
00:19:32,455 --> 00:19:35,355
You've changed way too much.

320
00:19:36,525 --> 00:19:39,435
I didn't know you were such an obedient man.

321
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:44,065
How could you raise your voice to me in her presence?

322
00:19:44,535 --> 00:19:46,005
What about how I feel?

323
00:19:47,675 --> 00:19:48,675
I apologize.

324
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:51,445
As I said earlier,

325
00:19:52,175 --> 00:19:54,345
it's better to be prepared...

326
00:19:54,545 --> 00:19:56,615
than to regret and solve problems later on.

327
00:19:58,145 --> 00:20:00,015
Make her sign away her rights.

328
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:01,185
Do as I say.

329
00:20:04,285 --> 00:20:06,025
I'll respect everything else you say,

330
00:20:07,495 --> 00:20:10,295
but I cannot do as you ask.

331
00:20:11,395 --> 00:20:15,335
This isn't just about signing a piece of paper.

332
00:20:16,665 --> 00:20:19,175
It goes against how I live life, my values,

333
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,405
and how I view marriage.

334
00:20:23,745 --> 00:20:25,075
I want to...

335
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:28,675
marry Kwang Sook because I trust her.

336
00:20:29,045 --> 00:20:31,915
This isn't a contract based on conditions.

337
00:20:34,055 --> 00:20:35,715
When your mother...

338
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:38,555
gave my daughter such a hard time,

339
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,625
why didn't you defend her as actively as you're doing now?

340
00:20:42,355 --> 00:20:43,365
Why not?

341
00:20:44,325 --> 00:20:45,695
Would my daughter...

342
00:20:46,065 --> 00:20:47,795
have suffered that much if she were married...

343
00:20:47,795 --> 00:20:49,135
to the present Dong Seok?

344
00:20:52,365 --> 00:20:53,835
That thought hit me today.

345
00:20:56,145 --> 00:20:59,175
I was so young back then, and I was...

346
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:02,045
immature in many ways.

347
00:21:03,585 --> 00:21:06,115
I live with the guilt and burden...

348
00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:09,115
toward Min Seo that I can never shake off.

349
00:21:10,955 --> 00:21:11,985
I understand.

350
00:21:12,655 --> 00:21:14,095
If you're that against it,

351
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:16,125
I won't push it any further.

352
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:20,165
The ex-mother-in-law has no right to fight on.

353
00:21:20,995 --> 00:21:24,035
Refusing to give in will make me a senile old hag.

(Daehak Cafe, since 1956)

355
00:22:13,285 --> 00:22:15,025
(Daehak Cafe, since 1956)

356
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,780
Welcome.

357
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:39,190
They announce the bar results today, right?

358
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,430
Yes. Jong Woo will call me here...

359
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,200
as soon as the results are out.

360
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,430
You're all smiles,

361
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:47,500
so I'm thinking we can expect good results this time.

362
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,100
Yes, he said it was a done deal.

363
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,500
He told me not to worry about a thing.

364
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,970
This is the third try, right?

365
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:58,210
Yes. You should never give up until you've tried three times.

366
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,350
That's right.

367
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,220
Excuse me.

368
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,960
Hello, this is Daehak Cafe.

369
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,460
Jung Soo.

370
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,330
It's for you.

371
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,770
Okay.

372
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,270
Jong Woo. Are the results out?

373
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,760
What's wrong?

374
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,090
The name...

375
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,300
isn't up there.

376
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,930
Oh, no.

377
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,290
Where's my mother-in-law?

378
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,220
She's not around the house.

379
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,220
Did she go somewhere?

380
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:55,430
I saw her outside the front gate on my way back from the market.

381
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,630
She got into a cab and drove off.

382
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,600
Where could she have gone?

383
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,350
I'm home.

384
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,680
Hey, you.

385
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,020
- The call cannot be connected... - Where's Grandma?

386
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,150
and will be transferred to voicemail.

387
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,690
I'm not sure. She must've stepped out for a bit.

388
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,120
To go where?

389
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,890
Beats me. She's not even picking up her phone.

390
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,560
Oh, boy.

391
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,670
Ha Ni.

392
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,470
Did you have fun?

393
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,110
- It was a long day, wasn't it? - Hardly. She's such a sweetheart,

394
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,580
so it was a breeze.

395
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,910
- Here. I'll take her. - Yes.

396
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:48,550
- There you go. - Goodness.

397
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:50,350
- I'll take the bag. - Sure.

398
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:55,120
- We'll get going, then. - Sure. Have a good night.

399
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,460
- Ha Ni, say bye. - Take care.

400
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,490
Have a pleasant night.

401
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,840
She must be your ex-husband's girlfriend.

402
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,580
She is.

403
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,080
She's young.

404
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:24,150
I'm only doing this because I can't let that child...

405
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,220
take care of my baby.

406
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,260
(Eagle Brewery)

407
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,760
We're home.

408
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,430
It's nice to have you back.

409
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,170
Se Ri, you're here too.

410
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,670
- Welcome. - Hello.

411
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,040
I brought her with me since she wanted...

412
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,180
to see you two before heading to the convenience store.

413
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,350
I'm glad you came.

414
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,660
Head inside. We'll talk in there.

415
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,130
Ha Ni, let's go.

416
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,680
Did you have something to tell the two of us?

417
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,490
Please speak your mind.

418
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:39,160
My mom...

419
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,800
I was hoping you'd forgive her.

420
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,300
I'm well aware that what she did is something that should never...

421
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,000
be forgiven.

422
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,770
I know I have no right to ask,

423
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:56,510
and I really mean that,

424
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,750
but please forgive her.

425
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,250
As if it's even up to us to forgive her.

426
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,460
There's nothing to forgive since Kang Soo...

427
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,730
has already forgiven her.

428
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,470
As a woman myself,

429
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:23,540
I feel for her.

430
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,870
In some ways, I understand her.

431
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,510
Also, I'm one of the people...

432
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:33,180
who hope things work out...

433
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,050
between you two.

434
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,080
You don't have to worry about me.

435
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,960
Thank you, Kwang Sook.

436
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:03,480
Welcome home. It was a long day. Wasn't it, husband?

437
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,320
Is something up?

438
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:12,280
You look troubled.

439
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,690
It's about Beom Soo and Se Ri.

440
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,420
What about them?

441
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,530
If the two marry,

442
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,960
Se Ri will be Kang Soo's sister...

443
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,800
but also his sister-in-law.

444
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,530
Right.

445
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,800
But everyone's acting like it's no big deal.

446
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,700
I'm flustered to say the least.

447
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,910
You're right. It is a bit perplexing.

448
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,610
But what matters most...

449
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,350
is how they feel about each other.

450
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,320
I guess, but...

451
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,350
Don't show that you're upset...

452
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,260
and make things uncomfortable for Beom Soo and Se Ri.

453
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,860
Nothing matters more than their happiness.

454
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,330
Right.

455
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,040
(3H Acupressure Bed)

456
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:08,010
- Hello, Ms. Gong. - Goodness.

457
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,380
Heung Soo, what brings you by?

458
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,610
I stopped by while in the neighborhood.

459
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,380
Between making sandwiches and dance practice,

460
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:17,320
my muscles have been cramping from all the stress.

461
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,120
You were right to come here.

462
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:22,290
Your body will relax in no time after trying one of these beds.

463
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,490
- This way. - Sure.

464
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:25,790
Let's see.

465
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,830
- This is really nice. - Yes.

466
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,130
I'll lie down.

467
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:42,410
How is it? Is it good? Do you feel like it's working?

468
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,980
Oh, my.

469
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,410
My gosh.

470
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,950
I feel refreshed from head to toe.

471
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,620
Hold on.

472
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,990
- Goodness. - Can you sit up?

473
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,390
- This. - Yes?

474
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:00,830
Put this on the muscles that hurt the most.

475
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:02,030
Sure.

476
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:05,330
My shoulders have been killing me.

477
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:14,170
Gosh, that feels good.

478
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:16,410
I'll give you a bottle on your way out.

479
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,380
Apply it before and after dance practice.

480
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,480
Sure.

481
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,120
No way. My shoulder definitely feels more relaxed.

482
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,150
- Excuse me. - Yes?

483
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:29,520
I have flowers for Ms. Gong Ju Sil.

484
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,860
Who sent these?

485
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,860
Hold on.

486
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,000
Right. Mr. Go Ja...

487
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,400
- Hush. - Hush.

488
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,570
Have a good evening.

489
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,140
Goodness me.

490
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,250
Unbelievable.

491
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,880
Who sent you those flowers?

492
00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:00,820
What?

493
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,890
Oh, just someone I know.

494
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,930
Are you dating someone, Ms. Gong?

495
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,630
Don't be absurd. At this age?

496
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,800
I wasn't actually serious.

497
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,390
What are you doing?

498
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,630
I'm sorting out my clothes.

499
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,160
Your clothes?

500
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,870
I filed for divorce today.

501
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,370
You'll be receiving the papers soon.

502
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,310
Fine.

503
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:59,810
Let's see how prepared you actually are.

504
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:16,700
Oh, boy.

505
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,300
Are you okay?

506
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,100
What does that mean?

507
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,000
It's exactly as I said.

508
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:27,670
Se Ri and I have the same mom.

509
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:31,380
Are you saying that Se Ri's mom...

510
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,350
is also your mom?

511
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,150
Yes.

512
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:39,380
How could something like that even happen?

513
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:44,420
Our mother gave birth to me before she got married,

514
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,630
and then Se Ri came along after the wedding.

515
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,130
Does Se Ri know this?

516
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,070
Yes, she just found out recently.

517
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,410
That explains why you've seemed troubled lately.

518
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,780
I tried not to show it, but I guess I couldn't help it.

519
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,380
It must've been hard.

520
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,090
I'm feeling a lot better now.

521
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,750
You don't have to worry.

522
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:22,590
Thank you.

523
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,570
For telling me such an important secret.

524
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,500
It feels as though...

525
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,610
we've grown close,

526
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,540
which I like.

527
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,010
I thought we were already close.

528
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,080
I mean, I saved your life.

529
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,720
You're right.

530
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,560
And aside from my family, you're the only person...

531
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,090
who knows the secret behind my birth.

532
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,130
You're right. We are really close.

533
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,070
Let's drink to that.

534
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:07,940
- Cheers. - Cheers.

535
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,450
Let's eat.

536
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,730
The call cannot be connected and will be transferred...

537
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,030
She's not answering her phone.

538
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,770
Where on earth did she go?

539
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,610
Is she ignoring the calls on purpose because she's upset?

540
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:43,180
Is Grandma upset? Why?

541
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,950
Well, it's something that doesn't concern you.

542
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,880
Her suitcase and stuff are still in her room.

543
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:56,150
My goodness. Where on earth is she?

544
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,030
Hang on.

545
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,430
Hello, Kwang Sook.

546
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:13,410
I'm calling you to ask if you've made up...

547
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,070
with your mother-in-law.

548
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,140
No. I haven't been able to reach my mother-in-law.

549
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,580
What?

550
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,680
What are you saying?

551
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,120
She left the house without telling anyone,

552
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,620
and I haven't been able to reach her for about 5 to 6 hours.

553
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,990
She's not answering her phone.

554
00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:31,520
What? Then...

555
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:34,790
Shouldn't you call the police?

556
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,430
Why would I have to report it to the police?

557
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,730
She's not a little kid.

558
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,770
That's not what I mean. It's...

559
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,640
What do I do?

560
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,540
What?

561
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,740
Well...

562
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:53,110
I have to go. I'm hanging up.

563
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,020
I can't tell him about her condition.

564
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,250
What do I do?

565
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,530
I'm sorry, but we are closing now.

566
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,800
Is that so?

567
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,810
Okay.

568
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,410
- Wait. - Yes?

569
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,310
The curfew siren hasn't gone off yet, has it?

570
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,780
Pardon?

571
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:33,490
I should go home before curfew.

572
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,950
My father is very strict.

573
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,290
Wait.

574
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,360
I think you should have your family...

575
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:45,830
come to pick you up.

576
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,970
Your phone is ringing.

577
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:54,070
Okay. Please excuse me.

578
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:00,510
Hello?

579
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,850
You picked up.

580
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,950
This is Ma Kwang Sook.

581
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,420
Ma Kwang Sook?

582
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Yes.

583
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,960
Where are you now?

584
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,430
I'm in a cafe in front of the school.

585
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,270
A cafe?

586
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:26,770
Can you tell me the name of the cafe?

587
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,240
The name of the cafe?

588
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,150
What was it?

589
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,380
Well...

590
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,750
It's on the tip of my tongue,

591
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:40,420
but I'm not sure what it is.

592
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:45,120
Do you mind if I talk to that person?

593
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,690
No. Go ahead.

594
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,730
Please tell her the name of the cafe.

595
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,760
Okay.

596
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,630
Hello?

597
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,770
The name of this place is...

598
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,770
I've heard this music before.

599
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,940
This is a really famous...

600
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:02,740
Come in.

601
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,150
Mrs. Gong!

602
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,650
You sent me a bouquet of flowers.

603
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,790
You're more romantic than you look.

604
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,060
I sent it as an apology.

605
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,130
Are you accepting my apology?

606
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:23,930
Okay.

607
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,100
I'll forgive you this time.

608
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,500
But you must never...

609
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,500
lie to me again.

610
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:32,740
Of course, I won't.

611
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,610
Come in and have some coffee.

612
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,010
Well...

613
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,050
Shall I?

614
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:42,180
Mr. Go.

615
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,480
My gosh. It's Gwang Sook.

616
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:45,120
- You should hide. - My goodness.

617
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,420
- Where should I hide? Where? - Where's a good spot? Here!

618
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,860
Hurry and go in there.

619
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,600
Are you in there?

620
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,670
Yes.

621
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:05,670
Something urgent came up, so I'm going out now.

622
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,570
Please check the temperature in the fermenting room.

623
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:10,010
Okay. Don't worry about it. I'll get it done.

624
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,640
- All right. Thank you. - Sure.

625
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,140
Yes, Kwang Sook.

626
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,270
I found Ms. Park.

627
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,910
Where?

628
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,880
A cafe in front of the college?

629
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,860
Ms. Park.

630
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,530
What...

631
00:42:07,870 --> 00:42:09,770
What are you doing here?

632
00:42:17,874 --> 00:42:19,384
Drive me to the hotel.

633
00:42:23,614 --> 00:42:25,254
Aren't you going home?

634
00:42:25,854 --> 00:42:27,824
Dong Seok and I are in disagreement now,

635
00:42:28,354 --> 00:42:30,124
so I want to stay away from him for the time being.

636
00:42:40,134 --> 00:42:42,634
Tell me when we arrive at the hotel.

637
00:42:55,184 --> 00:42:59,024
(Eagle Brewery)

638
00:43:17,274 --> 00:43:18,274
What...

639
00:43:18,734 --> 00:43:20,344
What is this place?

640
00:43:21,704 --> 00:43:24,574
This is my place.

641
00:43:26,414 --> 00:43:29,054
I think I asked you to drive me to the hotel.

642
00:43:30,454 --> 00:43:34,254
I don't think it is a good idea to leave you alone at the hotel.

643
00:43:35,084 --> 00:43:36,694
So I brought you here.

644
00:43:37,124 --> 00:43:38,394
Don't be ridiculous.

645
00:43:38,594 --> 00:43:40,694
Drive me to the hotel now.

646
00:43:40,864 --> 00:43:42,364
Please don't be like that.

647
00:43:42,694 --> 00:43:45,164
Just stay at my place for the night.

648
00:43:45,464 --> 00:43:46,564
I'll make sure you're comfortable.

649
00:43:47,034 --> 00:43:48,104
I don't want to.

650
00:43:52,744 --> 00:43:53,744
Earlier today,

651
00:43:56,114 --> 00:43:57,814
you weren't...

652
00:43:58,314 --> 00:44:00,344
in the best of states.

653
00:44:00,884 --> 00:44:03,384
At the cafe, for a brief while,

654
00:44:03,954 --> 00:44:06,784
you lost track of your memory.

655
00:44:08,224 --> 00:44:11,354
I'd feel better, knowing you're close.

656
00:44:12,254 --> 00:44:14,224
I told the chairman already.

657
00:44:14,924 --> 00:44:18,394
Spend the night here with me, even though it's a bit shabby.

658
00:44:19,304 --> 00:44:20,304
Please?

659
00:44:24,374 --> 00:44:26,104
- Don't lie. - That's hilarious.

660
00:44:27,574 --> 00:44:28,844
I'm home.

661
00:44:30,844 --> 00:44:32,744
What's the ex-mother-in-law doing here?

662
00:44:35,954 --> 00:44:37,054
"Ex-mother-in-law?"

663
00:44:39,224 --> 00:44:40,654
Say hello.

664
00:44:41,724 --> 00:44:44,224
She's Chairman Han's mother-in-law.

665
00:44:45,324 --> 00:44:46,864
Oh, hello.

666
00:44:47,264 --> 00:44:50,894
I'm her first brother-in-law, Oh Chun Soo.

667
00:44:51,894 --> 00:44:53,364
This is my wife.

668
00:44:54,534 --> 00:44:55,734
Nice to meet you.

669
00:44:56,804 --> 00:44:59,004
I'm Oh Heung Soo, the second brother-in-law.

670
00:45:01,004 --> 00:45:02,974
I'm the third, Oh Beom Soo.

671
00:45:03,974 --> 00:45:05,844
I'm the youngest, Oh Kang Soo.

672
00:45:10,254 --> 00:45:11,754
Are you celebrating something?

673
00:45:12,054 --> 00:45:13,784
The whole family is here.

674
00:45:15,484 --> 00:45:17,524
They're not here because it's a special day.

675
00:45:17,824 --> 00:45:21,694
We all live in this house together.

676
00:45:22,964 --> 00:45:25,634
All these people live here together?

677
00:45:25,964 --> 00:45:28,664
Yes. It's crowded and noisy.

678
00:45:29,134 --> 00:45:31,334
Just how a family should be. It's nice.

679
00:45:39,814 --> 00:45:41,114
You must be hungry.

680
00:45:42,244 --> 00:45:43,914
I'll set the table.

681
00:45:43,954 --> 00:45:45,314
I'll help you.

682
00:45:45,384 --> 00:45:47,054
No. You stay right here.

683
00:45:47,184 --> 00:45:49,954
You worked at the brewery all day, and then drove for a while.

684
00:45:50,294 --> 00:45:51,354
Stay right here.

685
00:45:51,924 --> 00:45:54,394
No, you stay here too. I'll help.

686
00:45:54,524 --> 00:45:57,394
You had a long day at the TV station.

687
00:45:57,394 --> 00:45:58,434
I'll help instead.

688
00:45:58,434 --> 00:46:00,334
Beom Soo. I'll do it since I'm the youngest.

689
00:46:00,504 --> 00:46:02,874
- Let's all help, then. - Okay. Why not?

690
00:46:02,874 --> 00:46:05,134
- You don't know what to do. - You stay here, then.

691
00:46:05,134 --> 00:46:07,274
- I'll help instead. Come back. - You're done already?

692
00:46:07,274 --> 00:46:09,074
- I'll do it. - Where's the soup?

693
00:46:19,154 --> 00:46:22,484
How do you like the food?

694
00:46:23,394 --> 00:46:24,794
It's light but tasty.

695
00:46:27,264 --> 00:46:30,534
My sister-in-law is a great cook.

696
00:46:37,034 --> 00:46:38,104
Why were you at...

697
00:46:39,374 --> 00:46:40,444
that cafe?

698
00:46:43,274 --> 00:46:44,814
Why did you go there?

699
00:47:00,164 --> 00:47:01,264
What do you think...

700
00:47:02,394 --> 00:47:04,734
Kwang Sook is thinking?

701
00:47:04,994 --> 00:47:06,964
Why did she bring that woman here?

702
00:47:08,334 --> 00:47:09,674
Does the chairman know?

703
00:47:09,874 --> 00:47:12,974
Yes. I think I heard Kwang Sook on the phone with him.

704
00:47:13,204 --> 00:47:14,244
Okay.

705
00:47:14,444 --> 00:47:16,174
His mother-in-law...

706
00:47:16,244 --> 00:47:18,944
seems pretty elegant and intellectual.

707
00:47:19,214 --> 00:47:21,284
She speaks in a classy way too.

708
00:47:22,084 --> 00:47:23,584
She looks rich.

709
00:47:23,854 --> 00:47:25,954
That's what I expect a rich madam to be like.

710
00:47:25,954 --> 00:47:27,324
Don't you be silly.

711
00:47:28,954 --> 00:47:30,654
She's just an ex.

712
00:47:30,994 --> 00:47:33,294
The one with the actual power is me.

713
00:47:40,564 --> 00:47:42,634
(Eagle Brewery)

714
00:47:51,514 --> 00:47:52,614
Where's my mother-in-law?

715
00:47:52,844 --> 00:47:55,044
She just had dinner.

716
00:47:55,244 --> 00:47:57,414
I arranged her bed for her before coming outside.

717
00:47:58,684 --> 00:48:01,724
What on earth happened?

718
00:48:05,624 --> 00:48:08,194
I was going to keep the secret,

719
00:48:09,564 --> 00:48:13,334
but I think it would be best if her family knew.

720
00:48:14,834 --> 00:48:17,134
We can't let what happened today happen again.

721
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:20,874
What are you so hesitant to say?

722
00:48:20,904 --> 00:48:22,274
Get to the point.

723
00:48:24,174 --> 00:48:25,174
Then...

724
00:48:25,974 --> 00:48:29,114
you must keep the secret as well.

725
00:48:32,414 --> 00:48:33,424
Your mother-in-law...

726
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,194
has dementia.

727
00:48:39,894 --> 00:48:42,124
She has what?

728
00:48:43,834 --> 00:48:46,304
I'm not a doctor, so I don't know much,

729
00:48:47,664 --> 00:48:49,734
but it has reached a certain stage,

730
00:48:50,534 --> 00:48:53,174
and she's taking medication to delay its advance.

731
00:48:56,514 --> 00:48:57,544
But...

732
00:48:59,414 --> 00:49:01,314
That's impossible.

733
00:49:01,984 --> 00:49:05,054
My mother-in-law is so precise and clearheaded,

734
00:49:05,314 --> 00:49:07,424
and she knows right from wrong.

735
00:49:09,624 --> 00:49:12,764
That can't be. Aren't you mistaken?

736
00:49:14,524 --> 00:49:17,334
She left her pill bottle in my office...

737
00:49:18,194 --> 00:49:20,634
when she came to see me on her own.

738
00:49:22,034 --> 00:49:24,234
When I saw my doctor to get my dressing changed,

739
00:49:25,104 --> 00:49:27,404
I showed her the pill bottle.

740
00:49:28,944 --> 00:49:31,744
She said it was medication for Alzheimer's.

741
00:49:36,514 --> 00:49:38,354
I asked Ms. Park about it,

742
00:49:39,384 --> 00:49:40,724
and she admitted to it.

743
00:49:46,124 --> 00:49:47,664
At the cafe where I found her,

744
00:49:48,324 --> 00:49:49,564
the owner said...

745
00:49:50,234 --> 00:49:54,004
it looked like she'd lost her memory briefly.

746
00:49:56,374 --> 00:49:57,604
I thought...

747
00:49:58,934 --> 00:50:01,344
she was a bit different from before.

748
00:50:04,044 --> 00:50:06,514
Why didn't I notice what was going on?

749
00:50:08,414 --> 00:50:09,854
I wouldn't have known...

750
00:50:10,554 --> 00:50:12,114
if it hadn't been for her pills.

751
00:50:12,614 --> 00:50:15,624
Who could know if she won't tell anyone?

752
00:50:19,464 --> 00:50:20,464
Okay.

753
00:50:22,094 --> 00:50:24,164
I'll go home on my own tonight.

754
00:50:24,634 --> 00:50:26,304
I'll come back for her tomorrow.

755
00:50:28,604 --> 00:50:29,734
Drive safely.

756
00:50:33,544 --> 00:50:35,574
(Eagle Brewery)

757
00:50:42,814 --> 00:50:43,954
Kwang Sook.

758
00:50:45,484 --> 00:50:46,554
Thank you.

759
00:50:48,324 --> 00:50:51,594
Things could've gotten really bad if it hadn't been for you.

760
00:51:08,344 --> 00:51:10,374
Don't be too sad.

761
00:51:24,894 --> 00:51:28,824
(Eagle Brewery)

762
00:51:34,604 --> 00:51:35,734
Where's Grandma?

763
00:51:38,034 --> 00:51:40,274
She'll spend the night there.

764
00:51:40,274 --> 00:51:41,944
I came back on my own.

765
00:51:43,074 --> 00:51:46,784
I have something to say. Can you sit down?

766
00:52:02,064 --> 00:52:03,494
Is it bad news?

767
00:52:07,064 --> 00:52:08,734
Is it about Grandma?

768
00:52:12,704 --> 00:52:13,804
This is...

769
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:17,114
to be our secret.

770
00:52:17,644 --> 00:52:19,374
I need you to keep quiet...

771
00:52:19,844 --> 00:52:21,944
so your grandmother never finds out.

772
00:52:26,114 --> 00:52:27,254
Your grandmother...

773
00:52:29,854 --> 00:52:30,954
has dementia.

774
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:33,064
What?

775
00:52:34,594 --> 00:52:36,964
No way. Why would my grandma...

776
00:52:37,534 --> 00:52:38,834
No way.

777
00:52:40,334 --> 00:52:42,504
Fortunately for her, it's in the early stage,

778
00:52:42,734 --> 00:52:45,274
so we can look after her as best we can.

779
00:52:47,044 --> 00:52:48,204
Is there anything we can do?

780
00:52:48,204 --> 00:52:50,314
You're a doctor. You must know.

781
00:52:51,444 --> 00:52:54,444
Once you get dementia, it's hard to turn things back.

782
00:52:54,984 --> 00:52:56,884
You just slow the disease to keep it...

783
00:52:56,984 --> 00:52:58,254
from progressing too quickly.

784
00:53:00,224 --> 00:53:03,124
The doctor said the pills your grandmother is taking now...

785
00:53:03,124 --> 00:53:05,224
were prescribed in the US.

786
00:53:05,454 --> 00:53:08,194
Gyeol, find out what you can about it.

787
00:53:08,694 --> 00:53:11,664
Then we'll discuss what we can do.

788
00:53:13,534 --> 00:53:14,564
Okay.

789
00:53:15,204 --> 00:53:18,504
And Bom. Do all the crying tonight.

790
00:53:19,004 --> 00:53:22,344
Don't cry in front of her or let her know that you know.

791
00:53:22,674 --> 00:53:23,674
Do you understand?

792
00:53:24,144 --> 00:53:25,144
Yes.

793
00:53:29,484 --> 00:53:31,354
- My gosh... - Poor Grandma.

794
00:53:31,414 --> 00:53:32,454
It's okay.

795
00:53:47,504 --> 00:53:48,504
Come in.

796
00:53:53,974 --> 00:53:56,274
Do you feel uncomfortable in any way?

797
00:53:56,844 --> 00:53:58,044
I'm fine.

798
00:53:58,744 --> 00:54:01,844
By the way, I feel bad for causing you inconvenience.

799
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:05,184
I'm fine with sleeping in my mom's room.

800
00:54:05,184 --> 00:54:06,524
Please don't feel bad about it.

801
00:54:09,824 --> 00:54:10,824
Wait.

802
00:54:15,424 --> 00:54:16,464
Thank you...

803
00:54:17,364 --> 00:54:18,564
for today.

804
00:54:20,834 --> 00:54:22,464
You said you'd be like a daughter to me.

805
00:54:23,404 --> 00:54:25,274
I guess it was more than just talk.

806
00:54:28,274 --> 00:54:30,714
I hope you rest well.

807
00:54:55,534 --> 00:54:56,734
Did you sleep well?

808
00:54:57,634 --> 00:54:59,674
I actually slept better than I did at your place.

809
00:55:00,344 --> 00:55:03,444
No way. You were more comfortable at our place?

810
00:55:03,874 --> 00:55:05,074
What an honor.

811
00:55:06,374 --> 00:55:07,414
I'm sorry.

812
00:55:07,414 --> 00:55:10,054
I'll do a better job of making you comfortable.

813
00:55:10,154 --> 00:55:13,224
Maybe it's the fresh air, but I slept like a baby.

814
00:55:16,054 --> 00:55:18,254
Since the weather's nice today,

815
00:55:18,254 --> 00:55:20,824
why don't we go out somewhere with a great view?

816
00:55:20,994 --> 00:55:21,994
An outing?

817
00:55:23,634 --> 00:55:24,694
I'd love that.

818
00:55:26,194 --> 00:55:27,804
Join us if you're not too busy.

819
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:29,034
Sorry?

820
00:55:31,334 --> 00:55:33,844
Are you letting me join you?

821
00:55:33,974 --> 00:55:34,974
Sure.

822
00:55:44,014 --> 00:55:45,054
Dong Seok.

823
00:55:46,014 --> 00:55:47,584
Do you remember...

824
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:50,694
how Min Seo and I...

825
00:55:51,324 --> 00:55:54,294
used to come here sometimes?

826
00:55:54,864 --> 00:55:55,894
Of course.

827
00:55:56,164 --> 00:55:58,264
That's the reason we came here today.

828
00:56:01,304 --> 00:56:02,634
So, about Ms. Ma.

829
00:56:03,934 --> 00:56:04,934
Yes?

830
00:56:06,174 --> 00:56:08,544
She seems like a much better person...

831
00:56:08,544 --> 00:56:10,274
than I assumed when we first met.

832
00:56:11,914 --> 00:56:14,644
Seeing the loving relationship she has with her brothers-in-law...

833
00:56:15,544 --> 00:56:17,114
shows me she has a big heart.

834
00:56:19,514 --> 00:56:22,984
Does this mean the prenup is off the table now?

835
00:56:25,194 --> 00:56:26,224
That...

836
00:56:27,394 --> 00:56:29,764
I'll think about that some more.

837
00:56:31,794 --> 00:56:33,334
Sure thing.

838
00:56:34,804 --> 00:56:36,134
Why are you chuckling like that?

839
00:56:37,034 --> 00:56:39,574
Were you laughing at me?

840
00:56:39,574 --> 00:56:41,944
Goodness. Mother, come on.

841
00:56:41,944 --> 00:56:44,044
Why would I ever laugh at you?

842
00:56:44,044 --> 00:56:45,144
That's not it.

843
00:56:45,774 --> 00:56:46,814
Unbelievable.

844
00:56:52,514 --> 00:56:54,354
Just a second.

845
00:56:55,184 --> 00:56:57,354
Let me take a photo of you two.

846
00:56:58,154 --> 00:56:59,154
A photo?

847
00:56:59,254 --> 00:57:01,894
Yes, can you look my way?

848
00:57:04,794 --> 00:57:06,364
Here we go.

849
00:57:06,964 --> 00:57:08,734
One, two, three.

850
00:57:11,234 --> 00:57:12,674
I'll take one more.

851
00:57:12,904 --> 00:57:15,544
One, two, three.

852
00:57:25,654 --> 00:57:28,024
I truly appreciate this.

853
00:57:29,324 --> 00:57:30,694
If not for you,

854
00:57:31,594 --> 00:57:34,024
she would've returned to the US...

855
00:57:34,794 --> 00:57:37,034
without any of us knowing about her condition.

856
00:57:40,234 --> 00:57:41,664
I got lucky.

857
00:57:42,364 --> 00:57:43,774
I wouldn't have known either...

858
00:57:44,504 --> 00:57:45,834
if it weren't for the pill bottle.

859
00:57:46,804 --> 00:57:48,004
Tell me about it.

860
00:57:49,604 --> 00:57:50,944
I think Gyeol's mother...

861
00:57:51,874 --> 00:57:55,714
gave me the opportunity to connect with her mom.

862
00:58:08,524 --> 00:58:12,334
Mother, would you like to take a walk that way?

863
00:58:23,104 --> 00:58:25,374
This place is beautiful. I love it.

864
00:58:43,734 --> 00:58:44,864
Goodness.

865
00:58:45,494 --> 00:58:47,904
Look at those lotus flowers. Aren't they stunning?

866
00:58:48,064 --> 00:58:49,064
They are.

867
00:58:50,004 --> 00:58:51,304
They're stunning.

868
00:58:52,934 --> 00:58:55,074
Why don't we take a photo here?

869
00:58:55,074 --> 00:58:56,574
- Mother, go ahead. - Why don't you stand over there?

870
00:58:57,144 --> 00:58:58,544
I'll take a photo for you.

871
00:58:58,914 --> 00:59:00,584
All right. Here we go.

872
00:59:01,014 --> 00:59:02,844
One, two, three.

873
00:59:05,514 --> 00:59:06,584
Oh, my.

874
00:59:07,354 --> 00:59:08,754
I'll take one more.

875
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:10,424
One, two, three.

876
00:59:11,824 --> 00:59:13,994
You look amazing. Kwang Sook, stand over there too.

877
00:59:13,994 --> 00:59:15,464
Yes. Stand here with me.

878
00:59:15,864 --> 00:59:17,534
I'll take the photo.

879
00:59:17,534 --> 00:59:19,564
One, two, three.

880
00:59:22,534 --> 00:59:24,634
- Let's take one together. - Together?

881
00:59:24,804 --> 00:59:26,304
Over here.

882
00:59:26,904 --> 00:59:28,644
One, two, three.

883
00:59:33,944 --> 00:59:36,614
- Mother, aren't you hungry? - What?

884
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:37,914
You see,

885
00:59:37,914 --> 00:59:40,124
there's a famous corn dog stand here in Dumulmeori.

886
00:59:40,554 --> 00:59:42,584
What do you say to corn dogs?

887
00:59:42,584 --> 00:59:43,854
Would that be okay?

888
00:59:44,654 --> 00:59:45,894
Is this your treat?

889
00:59:46,254 --> 00:59:48,694
Of course. I'll treat you both.

890
00:59:49,024 --> 00:59:52,234
Okay. Go on and treat me.

891
00:59:52,234 --> 00:59:53,294
Sure thing.

892
00:59:53,664 --> 00:59:54,664
Shall we?

00:59:54,664 --> 00:59:56,404
(Eagle Brewery)

894
01:00:01,274 --> 01:00:03,044
(Detective Kim Jong Hoon)

895
01:00:04,614 --> 01:00:05,814
Hello, Detective Kim.

896
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,884
Have you seen the news?

897
01:00:07,914 --> 01:00:08,914
The news?

898
01:00:09,444 --> 01:00:11,054
Director Seo Gil Yong of Silla Brewery,

899
01:00:11,054 --> 01:00:12,654
who had fled to the Philippines,

900
01:00:12,654 --> 01:00:14,084
was apprehended by local police...

901
01:00:14,084 --> 01:00:15,984
and has now been transferred to our custody.

902
01:00:16,854 --> 01:00:17,894
What?

903
01:00:18,754 --> 01:00:20,094
Are you sure?

904
01:00:20,864 --> 01:00:22,594
Yes, of course.

905
01:00:23,594 --> 01:00:25,894
Thank you so much. Sure.

906
01:00:30,634 --> 01:00:31,674
And now, the news.

907
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:34,274
Director Seo Gil Yong of Silla Brewery,

908
01:00:34,274 --> 01:00:35,444
who circulated a fake video...

909
01:00:35,444 --> 01:00:38,074
alleging that a rival company produced liquor...

910
01:00:38,074 --> 01:00:40,214
using insect-infested rice,

911
01:00:40,214 --> 01:00:41,884
was apprehended in the Philippines.

912
01:00:42,414 --> 01:00:44,114
Through a joint operation with local authorities,

913
01:00:44,114 --> 01:00:46,754
the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency...

914
01:00:46,754 --> 01:00:49,454
located Director Seo yesterday,

915
01:00:49,454 --> 01:00:52,424
who was hiding on an island near Cebu.

916
01:00:52,924 --> 01:00:54,264
The incident...

917
01:00:54,264 --> 01:00:56,594
nearly destroyed the rival company's business,

918
01:00:56,594 --> 01:00:58,934
and Silla Brewery issued a public apology...

919
01:00:58,934 --> 01:01:02,064
after the video was proven fake.

920
01:01:02,604 --> 01:01:03,734
Silla Brewery claimed...

921
01:01:03,734 --> 01:01:06,204
that Director Seo engineered this on his own...

922
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,644
to improve his chances of promotion.

923
01:01:08,644 --> 01:01:10,714
- What's going on? - Who got caught?

924
01:01:11,114 --> 01:01:12,914
They caught Director Seo of Silla Brewery,

925
01:01:12,914 --> 01:01:14,744
who was responsible for the fake video.

926
01:01:14,814 --> 01:01:16,144
He was arrested?

927
01:01:16,144 --> 01:01:17,154
Yes!

928
01:01:17,154 --> 01:01:18,984
His arrest is likely to move the investigation along.

929
01:01:18,984 --> 01:01:20,254
Moving on.

930
01:01:23,124 --> 01:01:24,694
We have already purchased the land...

931
01:01:24,694 --> 01:01:26,354
and secured the rights to the natural spring water.

932
01:01:26,454 --> 01:01:28,424
The factory layout and building placements...

933
01:01:28,424 --> 01:01:30,464
have been discussed with the architectural firm,

934
01:01:30,464 --> 01:01:31,834
and the design request has been submitted.

935
01:01:32,994 --> 01:01:34,064
Have you ordered the equipment?

936
01:01:34,234 --> 01:01:35,334
It's been taken care of.

937
01:01:38,104 --> 01:01:39,504
When can we release the new product, then?

938
01:01:40,144 --> 01:01:41,204
After the design is finalized,

939
01:01:41,204 --> 01:01:43,144
the factory needs to be built with all the equipment.

940
01:01:43,144 --> 01:01:44,344
Even if we push it,

941
01:01:44,844 --> 01:01:46,514
it won't be until early next year.

942
01:01:46,514 --> 01:01:48,884
How am I supposed to wait until next year?

943
01:01:48,884 --> 01:01:50,114
Get it done by this year.

944
01:01:50,684 --> 01:01:52,654
- Sir. Realistically, that's... - Mr. Jung.

945
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:55,324
If you pull this off,

946
01:01:55,324 --> 01:01:58,094
you'll have a seat on the board at the next shareholders' meeting.

947
01:01:58,854 --> 01:01:59,854
Do you hear me?

948
01:02:00,024 --> 01:02:01,424
Is Mr. Dokgo Tak inside?

949
01:02:01,694 --> 01:02:03,064
Yes. What is this about?

950
01:02:03,064 --> 01:02:04,134
What's going on?

951
01:02:04,634 --> 01:02:06,634
Hold on. You can't barge in there.

952
01:02:09,134 --> 01:02:10,374
What's the meaning of this?

953
01:02:10,374 --> 01:02:11,434
Mr. Dokgo Tak.

954
01:02:12,904 --> 01:02:14,804
We're with Gijeong Police's Investigation Division.

955
01:02:18,344 --> 01:02:20,914
You must cooperate with the investigation...

956
01:02:20,914 --> 01:02:23,314
regarding Director Seo Gil Yong's fake video.

957
01:02:24,254 --> 01:02:25,314
Please come with us.

958
01:02:25,314 --> 01:02:28,754
Wait, who? Me?

959
01:02:28,754 --> 01:02:29,924
During the investigation,

960
01:02:29,924 --> 01:02:31,794
Seo Gil Yong stated...

961
01:02:31,794 --> 01:02:33,564
that he was following your orders.

962
01:02:33,764 --> 01:02:35,024
We ask for your cooperation.

963
01:02:36,264 --> 01:02:39,294
Sir, what's going on?

964
01:02:43,834 --> 01:02:47,004
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

965
01:03:29,544 --> 01:03:32,014
(For Eagle Brothers)

966
01:03:32,284 --> 01:03:33,924
I'm Dokgo Tak for crying out loud.

967
01:03:33,924 --> 01:03:35,954
I won't go down without a fight.

968
01:03:36,124 --> 01:03:37,524
I'll protect everything I have.

969
01:03:37,894 --> 01:03:39,594
He won't get away with it this time.

970
01:03:39,924 --> 01:03:41,124
He must pay for what he did.

971
01:03:41,264 --> 01:03:44,034
When I think about Beom Soo and Se Ri,

972
01:03:44,034 --> 01:03:45,394
I can't just be happy about this.

973
01:03:45,534 --> 01:03:47,434
I'm so weighed down by guilt...

974
01:03:47,434 --> 01:03:49,304
that I can't be with you for a while.

975
01:03:49,964 --> 01:03:51,374
Then, promise me this one thing.

976
01:03:51,634 --> 01:03:53,474
I'll be waiting right here,

977
01:03:53,474 --> 01:03:54,844
so don't go too far.

978
01:03:55,244 --> 01:03:57,014
Is there something you wanted to say?

979
01:03:57,514 --> 01:03:59,574
Find him for me.

980
01:03:59,974 --> 01:04:01,644
If he's still alive,

981
01:04:01,914 --> 01:04:04,514
I'd like to meet him just once before my memory fades.
