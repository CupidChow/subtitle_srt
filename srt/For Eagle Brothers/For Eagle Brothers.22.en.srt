00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:03,010
(Episode 22)

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,040
Volume Ten.

3
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,160
My gosh, I'm so sorry.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,890
You didn't answer when I knocked,

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,160
so I thought you fell asleep.

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,560
I was...

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,970
I was only going to leave
with the next book when...

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,100
I'm sorry. I really am.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
Sorry.

10
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,140
Are you kidding me?

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:48,890
I can't believe I messed up
and embarrassed myself like that.

12
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,530
Darn.

13
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,030
Yes?

14
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,570
My gosh.

15
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,630
Here you go.

16
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,500
Right.

17
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,580
Don't stay up too late reading that
and tuck in early.

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,610
Sure.

19
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,120
CEO Ma.

20
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:26,890
Good night.

21
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,200
Good night to you too.

22
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,360
Hey, Beom Soo.

23
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,070
Kwang Sook.

24
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,240
I only just got around
to checking my phone.

25
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,940
How are you doing?

26
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,810
The headache's gone,
and I'm no longer dizzy.

27
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,840
I'm feeling much better.

28
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,540
I'm glad to hear that.

29
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,480
I'll stop by the hospital
after class tomorrow.

30
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,650
You're already busy enough as it is.

31
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,750
Don't worry about me.

32
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,190
Hold on.

33
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,990
Is something wrong?

34
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,590
You don't sound
like your usual self.

35
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:35,830
You see,

36
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,500
I met Ha Ni's mom today.

37
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,670
She wanted to see Ha Ni
before she got married.

38
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,900
Ha Ni's mom is getting married?

39
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,210
Yes, this Saturday.

40
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,440
My gosh.

41
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,950
Beom Soo, are you doing okay?

42
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,150
Not really,

43
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,680
but it didn't rattle me as much.

44
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,690
Ha Ni's mom wanted
a flashy life in the spotlight,

45
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,390
but I wasn't someone
who could possibly give her that.

46
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,030
Going our separate ways
was for the best.

47
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,060
I see.

48
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:16,530
I laid out my problems on you...

49
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,700
when you should be resting.

50
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,170
Sorry about that.

51
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,540
Don't apologize.

52
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,940
I love how you opened up...

53
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:24,780
about what's been bothering you.

54
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,450
It feels like you finally see me
as someone you can rely on.

55
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
That makes me proud.

56
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,890
Don't be ridiculous.

57
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,290
You're the person I trust most
after Jang Soo.

58
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,660
Of course, I mean that.

59
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,490
Sure. Sleep tight as well.

60
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,480
Professor.

61
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,750
Here you go.

62
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,920
Having this at times like that...

63
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,590
always puts me in a better mood.

64
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,590
If you let it dissolve slowly
in your mouth,

65
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,630
you'll forget about your troubles
by the time you're almost done.

66
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,980
He's not my boyfriend.

67
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,320
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,550
I assumed he was.

69
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,860
He must've thought
I was really strange.

70
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,080
(Hankuk University Hospital)

71
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,000
I should stop reading
and go to sleep.

72
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,270
Oh, dear.

73
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,620
It was quite an interesting day.

74
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,730
By the way, I wonder
if Kwang Sook had breakfast.

75
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,600
I bet she did.

76
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,910
It's the VIP room,
so the food must be good too.

77
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,540
I'll go visit her at the hospital
after breakfast.

78
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:48,980
Good. You should do that.

79
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,050
I'm busy with work here,

80
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,050
so you should go to the hospital
and keep her company.

81
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,290
No. Don't bother.

82
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,760
You should let her rest quietly
for her sake.

83
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,990
Until she's discharged,

84
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,960
don't go near the hospital.

85
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,760
- Why not?
- Why not?

86
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,000
What?

87
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,440
Well... The thing is...

88
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,610
She must be tired
from all the tests.

89
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,980
Having her family members around
will make things worse.

90
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,410
You should never go there.

91
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,880
But she's alone at the hospital.

92
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,010
End of conversation.

93
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,620
Let's just eat.

94
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,990
(Park Sang Nam)

95
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,630
This is driving me nuts.

96
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:40,600
Well...

97
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,200
Sang Nam.

98
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:44,070
Why are you calling in the morning?

99
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,610
What time should I go
to get the purse back today?

100
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,610
Well... The thing is,

101
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,540
my friend borrowed it from me.

102
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,810
And she's out of town now.

103
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,720
It'll take me some time
to get it back.

104
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,820
Then...

105
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,850
give me the cash.

106
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,160
You want to get it back in cash?

107
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,790
I can't give you
that much money right away.

108
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,100
Sang Nam, I didn't know...

109
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,700
you were so unreasonable.

110
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,300
No, don't be like that.

111
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,940
If Kwang Sook finds out,
she'll get furious.

112
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,640
Okay. I get your point.

113
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,940
I'll call you back soon.

114
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,780
This is driving me crazy.

115
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,750
You like abalone rice porridge,
so our housekeeper made it for you.

116
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,120
Have some.

117
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:40,360
If she was going to make it,
she could've made a bigger portion.

118
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,630
You just brought one serving?

119
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,860
But you don't eat much.

120
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,260
What?

121
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,000
Well... That's true.

122
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,180
What's wrong?

123
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,250
I'll eat it later.

124
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,320
It's not as tasty when it's cold.

125
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,980
I have no appetite now.

126
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,050
You can leave it here.
I'll eat it later.

127
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,450
Do you want me to leave already?

128
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,590
I was going to take a walk
around the hospital...

129
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:13,990
and have some tea with you.

130
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,430
Don't treat me like a patient.

131
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,930
I'm leaving the hospital tomorrow.

132
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,630
Just leave it and go.

133
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,230
(Hankuk University Hospital)

134
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,840
Yes?

135
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,380
Good morning.

136
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,410
Did you sleep well, Chairman Han?

137
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,350
It wasn't so bad.

138
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,850
Did you have breakfast?

139
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,450
I just ate.

140
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,420
Already?

141
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,990
Why did you eat so early?

142
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,190
What?

143
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,530
I mean...

144
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,300
My housekeeper made
some abalone rice porridge,

145
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,070
so my daughter brought it.

146
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,500
I brought it for you.

147
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,970
Why don't you eat it?

148
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,670
I...

149
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,480
don't like abalone rice porridge.

150
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,410
I didn't want to throw it away,
but you already had breakfast.

151
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,880
I guess I'll have to throw it away.

152
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,550
Wait.

153
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,290
Give it to me.

154
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,690
You already ate.

155
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,920
I'll eat it.

156
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,560
Actually,
I love abalone rice porridge.

157
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,030
Will you?

158
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,870
My goodness.

159
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,770
It looks so good.

160
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,910
Oh, right.

161
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,010
No. I'm okay.

162
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,150
It's so good.

163
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,750
The abalone is really fresh.

164
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,520
It's perfectly seasoned
with salt and sesame oil,

165
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,330
so I don't need any soy sauce.

166
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,260
Oh, right.

167
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,370
I finished "The Celestial Drops"
last night.

168
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,270
You can take them
and finish reading them.

169
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,570
Is Volume 15 the end?

170
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,370
No. There are 44 volumes.

171
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:44,680
But I bought
only 15 of them for now.

172
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,270
Why are you staring at me like that?

173
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,570
Do I have rice on my face?

174
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,870
No.

175
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,040
It's nothing. Enjoy your food.

176
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,980
Wait.

177
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,880
You finished Volume 12, right?

178
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,950
Thank you.

179
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,660
Yes?

180
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,060
Ms. Ma Kwang Sook.

181
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,630
Please get ready for a test
after you finish your meal.

182
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,970
Okay.

183
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,470
And you should go to
the rehab center, Mr. Han.

184
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,140
You will start
the exercise therapy program there.

185
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,970
Okay. I will.

186
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,710
By the way,
do you two know each other?

187
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,550
We're friends.

188
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,350
I see.

189
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,850
I'll see you downstairs then.

190
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,030
Well... We're sharing comic books.

191
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,370
Doesn't that make us friends?

192
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,440
You're right.

193
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,110
I'm just honored to be your friend.

194
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:30,450
- This isn't right.
- I know.

195
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,980
- How is this happening?
- It's just wrong.

196
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,880
- This isn't the first time.
- It isn't.

197
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,390
- This is the second time.
- Who should we talk to?

198
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,920
- I can't believe this.
- This is unacceptable.

199
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,260
- Hey, you're here.
- Hi.

200
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,530
What's wrong?

201
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
Did something happen?

202
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,460
Today's class has been canceled.

203
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,370
- Why?
- Mr. Oh is absent again.

204
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,600
He skipped class twice
without any prior notice.

205
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,200
- This is too much.
- I know.

206
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,410
Tell me about it.

207
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:56,910
I know he's having a hard time
because of Ms. Kim.

208
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,680
But he should draw a line
between public and private matters.

209
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,280
By the way, did you guys watch...

210
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,450
- Mr. Oh's stream yesterday? No?
- No.

211
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,480
You wouldn't believe it.

212
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,450
He was completely out of his mind.

213
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,450
He was being so pathetic.

214
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,020
- Gosh, it was so upsetting.
- Oh, no.

215
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,290
Darn it.

216
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,630
I was busy,
so I barely made time to come.

217
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,990
But it was a waste of time.

218
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,700
- You can't waste your time.
- Surely not.

219
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,700
We should at least eat something
before going home.

220
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,700
Are you in there, Mr. Oh Heung Soo?

221
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,100
Mr. Oh Heung Soo?

222
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,880
Who are you?

223
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,990
You know Kim Seon Ah, right?

224
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,690
Seon Ah?

225
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,460
Of course, I know her.

226
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,930
Where is she now?

227
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,030
You punk.

228
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,900
How dare you?

229
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,270
Are you out of your mind?

230
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:00,670
How dare you address
our boss's wife like that?

231
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,710
Your what?

232
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,070
Why is Seon Ah your boss's wife?

233
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,740
Who are you?

234
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,410
We're here to kill you.

235
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,480
Stand up!

236
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,280
What are you on about?

237
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,880
Where's Seon Ah?

238
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,020
Don't you dare say her name.

239
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,120
Hey. Wake him right up.

240
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,150
Yes, sir.

241
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:27,360
Step aside.

242
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,470
You fool.

243
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,980
Hello?

244
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:45,520
A group of thugs are here...

245
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,850
beating someone up.

246
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,690
Get over here quick.
The guy's dying.

247
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,020
Where's Seon Ah now?

248
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,900
Our boss is still alive and well.

249
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,400
How dare someone like you
try to date her?

250
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,230
Don't just stand there. Crush him.

251
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,270
Yes, sir.

252
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,680
Stop!

253
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:20,850
Hey.

254
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,990
If you so much as touch my darling,

255
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,560
I'll kill you myself!

256
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,760
My gosh.

257
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,500
Who's she?

258
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,840
Ms. Ji.

259
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,140
I know who you are.

260
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,840
Kim Seon Ah's husband...

261
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,810
who's in Uijeongbu Prison
sent you, didn't he?

262
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,250
What?

263
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,850
Do you know our boss?

264
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,290
Just you wait.

265
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,630
Police cars are on the way
to pick you up.

266
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,000
- Darn you.
- Hey.

267
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,100
They're here.

268
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,170
You're all dead meat.

269
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:18,180
- Darn you.
- What?

270
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,210
Where do you think you're going?
We need you to be arrested.

271
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:30,850
Mr. Oh.

272
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,490
Are you all right?

273
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,390
Were you badly hurt?

274
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,630
What was all that about?

275
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,300
Let's go inside where we can talk.

276
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44,170
You mean...

277
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:47,400
Seon Ah had a husband
and a daughter?

278
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,540
Yes. She did.

279
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,710
It must be a misunderstanding.

280
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,420
Seon Ah's not like that.

281
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,620
You're saying that
when you just got beaten up?

282
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,790
Let me see.

283
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,890
Be gentle.

284
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,760
Her husband's pretty hardcore.

285
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,830
He's an enforcer...

286
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,770
for a nationwide gang
called Oseong Gang.

287
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,240
He's doing time
in Uijeongbu Prison now.

288
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,840
How come...

289
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,180
you know all that?

290
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,680
I told you...

291
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:32,620
Ms. Kim was wearing a mask.

292
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,620
Something felt off,

293
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:37,650
so I hired a private investigator.

294
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,930
Why didn't you tell me about it?

295
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,700
I didn't want you to get hurt.

296
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,270
You'd feel so betrayed
if you heard the truth.

297
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,210
It would be better
not to know at all.

298
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,480
I'd rather have you misunderstand
and curse me out...

299
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:09,120
than see you suffer
from a broken heart.

300
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,860
I boiled you some barley tea.

301
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,790
Drink some and see a doctor.

302
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,430
You look dreadfully ill.

303
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,470
I'll do that.

304
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,840
Ha Ni. Have fun with Granny.

305
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,340
Dad will get better soon.

306
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,210
Let's go so Dad can see a doctor.

307
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,680
Hello, Professor.

308
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,950
Hi. I'm down with a bad cold...

309
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,450
and can't come in.

310
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,020
Are you badly ill?

311
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:17,750
Yes. I can't teach at all.

312
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,660
Apologize to the students for me...

313
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,390
and say I'll schedule
an extra lecture.

314
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,230
Okay.

315
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,700
Don't worry
and focus on getting better.

316
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,830
Bye.

317
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,070
Oh, no.

318
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,140
He sounded really weak.

319
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,000
I knew it.

320
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,400
What is she thinking?

321
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,440
I should nip it in the bud...

322
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,770
before things go wrong.

323
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,680
I brought what you asked for.

324
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,150
Good job.

325
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,720
("The Celestial Drops")

326
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,690
Well,

327
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,820
I'm stuck in my room all day,
and I'm bored.

328
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,060
I get it.

329
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,290
Reading comics when you're bored...

330
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,200
is great fun.

331
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,370
This isn't...

332
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,870
just an ordinary comic series.

333
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,970
It's more like a guide
that teaches you the history...

334
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,610
of wine and gives you knowledge
that will last a lifetime.

335
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,910
I decided to use the time to study.

336
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:48,850
Of course.

337
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,880
What? Is there something on my face?

338
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,420
It's not that, sir.

339
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:01,190
You've been more cheerful
and energetic since you came here.

340
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,690
Oh, really?

341
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,700
Yes. You look more at ease
than ever before.

342
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,670
Well...

343
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,740
CEO Ma.

344
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,040
I'm coming in.

345
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,820
CEO...

346
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,790
CEO Ma.

347
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,220
Oh, dear. Is she away to get tested?

348
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,870
Chairman Han.

349
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:52,470
What were you doing out here?

350
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,640
Right.

351
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,470
I was on my way back from a test...

352
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,240
when I saw these beautiful flowers.

353
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,210
I was looking at them
while listening to some music.

354
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:15,590
I didn't know people still
listened to music on those things.

355
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,060
They're easy to use,

356
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,560
and you don't have to worry
about the battery.

357
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,370
Would you like to join me?

358
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,010
Goodness.

359
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:38,980
It's my brother-in-law.

360
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,280
Will you excuse me?

361
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,750
Hey, Chun Soo.

362
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:51,020
I called to brief you
on where we are today.

363
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,360
Deliveries were made
to the supermarkets and restaurants.

364
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,690
In the afternoon,

365
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:57,790
I'm going to
the convenience store head office...

366
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,330
to discuss what we talked about
last time.

367
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,170
Sure. I hope it goes well.

368
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,530
Go, Chun Soo.

369
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,570
My brother-in-law's been
covering my work.

370
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,610
If the company had any losses
because of your accident,

371
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:16,680
just send the invoice to the hotel
with the paperwork.

372
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:19,480
Everything's good
thanks to my brother-in-law.

373
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,960
By the way,
when will you be discharged?

374
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,490
Isn't it boring and stuffy
being in the hospital?

375
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,830
Not at all.

376
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,700
Why? Are you uncomfortable here?

377
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,930
I have work at the brewery,

378
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,000
and my mom and my brothers-in-law
are back home.

379
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,710
I'm eager to hurry back.

380
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,310
Still, having you around
made it less boring,

381
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,150
and I actually had fun.

382
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,620
The rest of "The Celestial Drops"
from Volume 16 to the final book...

383
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,030
is in your hospital room.

384
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,100
Really?

385
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,860
I asked Mr. Park...

386
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,300
to get them from a bookstore.

387
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,240
No way!

388
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,340
Let's head inside
and finish them off together.

389
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,510
Together?

390
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,680
What was that?

391
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,510
It was nothing.

392
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,700
Come on.

393
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,710
Chairman Han.

394
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,480
Hello, Ms. Jang.
What brings you here?

395
00:27:58,050 --> 00:28:00,350
I heard you were in the hospital...

396
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,650
and rushed over
because I was worried.

397
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:08,560
I'll leave you
with your guest, then.

398
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,560
Right.

399
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,700
Who may she be?

400
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,570
She's one of our suppliers.

401
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,540
I just happened to run into her
at the hospital.

402
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,310
I see.

403
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,510
Let's head inside.

404
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,750
Sure.

405
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,620
I didn't come
just to see how you were.

406
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,760
I'm actually here...

407
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,460
to discuss a certain matter
with you.

408
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,030
I see. What is it about?

409
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,760
I wanted to speed things up
with our kids' wedding plans.

410
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,600
How does that sound?

411
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:52,370
If that's what they both want,

412
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,970
I have no reason to object.

413
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,340
How about the first week
of September?

414
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,240
Do we have enough time?
It's only a few months away.

415
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,850
With enough money,
we could even pull it off next week.

416
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,180
Sorry?

417
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,150
What I meant was
that there wouldn't be a problem.

418
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,390
I see.

419
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:15,020
Gyeol and Se Ri...

420
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,630
have been apart for too long.

421
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,760
They seem to want to be together.

422
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,670
We should let them love each other
with all their hearts.

423
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,510
One, two, three.

424
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,840
What do you think?

425
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,780
No way.

426
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,650
It could use a makeover.

427
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,380
Come on.

428
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,820
Welcome back to civilian life,
my friend.

429
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,620
Thanks, my friend.

430
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,490
How does it feel
to be a civilian again?

431
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,060
It's good, I guess.

432
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,700
That reminds me.
You should look around...

433
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,500
and greet the staff.

434
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,800
Can you introduce me to them?

435
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,870
- Why don't we get going?
- Sure.

436
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,620
(Traditional Rice Porridge)

437
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,000
Who's there?

438
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,460
Hello.

439
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,570
Right.

440
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,700
You were with Professor Oh
when he picked Ha Ni up.

441
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:34,400
That's right.

442
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,410
Hi, Ha Ni.

443
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,740
Did you have fun with Granny?

444
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,480
I think he's home.

445
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,560
He's fast asleep,
so he didn't hear the doorbell.

446
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,160
I see.

447
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,160
But I have dinner plans.

448
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,370
What do I do?

449
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,240
Let me take Ha Ni, then.

450
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,670
I'll watch her
until Professor Oh wakes up.

451
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,740
Would you do that?

452
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,510
I feel like
I'm always troubling you.

453
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,880
Not at all.

454
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,850
(Traditional Rice Porridge)

455
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,420
I'll take Ha Ni.

456
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,050
You can come to me.

457
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,250
There you go.

458
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,760
She just had her bottle.

459
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,790
Sure.

460
00:31:30,490 --> 00:31:31,490
Ha Ni.

461
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,100
Say bye to Granny.

462
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,470
I'll leave you to it, then.

463
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,200
Take care.

464
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,700
Bye.

465
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,280
Goodness.

466
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,350
Ha Ni, while I clean up,

467
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,920
play with this toy. Okay?

468
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,370
Hi.

469
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,940
Aren't you sweet?

470
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,380
Se Ri's gone.

471
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,320
Peekaboo. Here I am.

472
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,640
I'm right here.

473
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:54,840
Glide.

474
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,810
And slide.

475
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,360
Hello.

476
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,690
I thought she was
officially starting next week.

477
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,390
Since it's her first time
working at a company,

478
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,100
she wanted to get familiar
with the place...

479
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,260
and meet you before her first day.

480
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,070
That's why we came together.

481
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,940
The chairman said I should treat you
just like the other employees,

482
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,840
so they'd feel more comfortable.

483
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,810
I'll drop the honorifics.

484
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:27,040
Of course.
I'd feel more at ease that way.

485
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,780
This is where the TF team
will be working.

486
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,780
One will work
in planning and marketing.

487
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,350
One in fabric design.

488
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,120
Two more interns...

489
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:39,690
including you will make up the team.

490
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,960
- Got it.
- Okay.

491
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:52,200
Shouldn't we visit her
in the hospital?

492
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:55,370
Working hard is
what makes our boss happy.

493
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,540
You don't need to worry
about visiting her.

494
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:00,540
How uncaring you are.

495
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,350
Her test results came back fine,

496
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,750
so she'll be discharged tomorrow.
You don't have to worry.

497
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:15,660
Hello?

498
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,800
I got the job?

499
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:23,630
Yes.

500
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,970
Okay. Thank you.

501
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,840
Did you get a job?

502
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,070
- Yes.
- Congratulations.

503
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,280
What's the name of the company?

504
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,840
Gwangseong Defense.

505
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,450
That's a defense company
that's doing really well these days.

506
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,210
It's been on the news a lot.

507
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,650
I didn't expect to get the job,

508
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:40,780
but I guess I was lucky.

509
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,450
It's not luck.
That's because you're competent.

510
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,620
You should take us out for a treat.

511
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,360
Of course.

512
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,990
Can we have beef?

513
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,260
Sure.

514
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,600
(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

515
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,610
I'm not saying
I won't give you the money.

516
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:07,180
I just need a few more days,
but why are you forcing me?

517
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,850
I'm Macho Man Park Sang Nam.

518
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:12,150
I don't want to care about
trivial things like this anymore.

519
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,220
I will settle things
with you today...

520
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,990
and let go of what happened
in the past.

521
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,420
I understand what you mean,

522
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,390
but I don't have any cash
with me now.

523
00:35:21,490 --> 00:35:24,260
So I'm asking you
to give me some time.

524
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,560
You have to return
the purse right away...

525
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,770
or give me 5,000 dollars in cash.

526
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,440
Or I'll report you
to the police for extortion...

527
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,000
under the pretense of marriage.

528
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,740
Extortion
under the pretense of marriage?

529
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,510
How could you say
such a harsh thing?

530
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,040
Let me be honest with you.

531
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,680
If I hadn't had the intention
of marrying Kwang Sook,

532
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,620
would I have given you
a designer bag worth 5,000 dollars?

533
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,050
This is ridiculous.

534
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,760
How can you be so cheap
just because of 5,000 dollars?

535
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,320
If you think I'm cheap,
just give me 5,000 dollars.

536
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,290
The money you want!

537
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,590
I'll give you.

538
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,630
Mr. Go.

539
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:03,900
I'll give you the money.

540
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,600
So get out of my sight immediately.

541
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,580
Your account number!

542
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,780

545
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:26,620
Slow down.

546
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,690
- Four, eight, two.
- Four, eight, two.

547
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,390
- Four, three, nine.
- All right.

548
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,400
- Zero, two,
- Yes.

549
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,230
- one, nine, seven, two.
- Seven, two.

550
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,870
Hansu Bank, Park Sang Nam.

551
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,070
Sang Nam.

552
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,900
Done.

553
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,270
Check it.

554
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,340
It's in my car.

555
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,610
Go.

556
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,980
Get lost.

557
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,250
Yes, sir.

558
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,260
- I just met Chairman Han.
- Okay.

559
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:09,130
We agreed to hold a wedding
in September.

560
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,900
Did Chairman Han agree to do that?

561
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,300
He said he'd do that
if our children were okay with it.

562
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,210
My goodness.

563
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:21,940
The chairman of LX Hotel
is going to be my in-law.

564
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,720
Dokgo Tak! How successful you are!

565
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:30,650
And who made it happen?

566
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,990
It's all thanks to you.

567
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,330
I'm glad that you know that.

568
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,260
Thank you.

569
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,600
My gosh.

570
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,200
I, who suffered...

571
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,140
all kinds of humiliation
at Eagle Brewery,

572
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:54,940
am now marrying my daughter off
to the son of LX Hotel.

573
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,150
How unbelievable.

574
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,420
That petty old man
of Eagle Brewery would want...

575
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,220
to open the lid of his coffin
and come out.

576
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,720
He only treated you harshly...

577
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,820
because you played cheap tricks
and ruined the makgeolli.

578
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,390
He was actually
a kind and generous man.

579
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,560
You're fine
until Eagle Brewery comes up,

580
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,070
and then you always end up
saying something mean.

581
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:23,110
But then again,
you went through a lot too...

582
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:26,240
working at the brewery
and raising their youngest child...

583
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,080
instead of the boss's wife.

584
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,920
Come to think of it,

585
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,320
you weren't even married,

586
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,850
but they let you
take care of the newborn baby.

587
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:39,620
That's horrible.

588
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,690
They were being too harsh on you.

589
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,130
Professor.

590
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,440
What are you doing here, Se Ri?

591
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:59,480
Well... I need to get your signature
on the budget application form...

592
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,980
for the industry-academic
cooperation project.

593
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,680
I mean, how did you get in here?

594
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:05,850
Well...

595
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,850
I ran into the babysitter
at the front door,

596
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,750
so she let me in.

597
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,290
Then you should've
woken me up first.

598
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:19,060
I thought
you were fast asleep, so...

599
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,360
Still, you should've woken me up.

600
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,270
I'm sorry.

601
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,140
This is my private space.

602
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,670
And you and I are
working together at school.

603
00:39:28,670 --> 00:39:29,710
That means...

604
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,880
you can't just come into my place
like this.

605
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,180
I don't want this to happen again.

606
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,680
Where's the document?

607
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,320
Okay. Please wait.

608
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,430
Here.

609
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,470
Did you...

610
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,030
Yes?

611
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,700
Did you clean this place?

612
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,640
Well... Yes.

613
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:05,780
I thought the vacuum would wake you,

614
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:07,580
so I just tidied up a bit.

615
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,110
What is the matter with you?

616
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,710
- Pardon?
- You just barged into my place...

617
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:13,380
and touched my stuff
without my permission.

618
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,650
Were you really this rude?

619
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,590
It's not like that. I just...

620
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,620
I want you to leave.

621
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,410
I'm sorry. I'll get going then.

622
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,990
I came
because I was worried about you.

623
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,060
What?

624
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,130
Actually, getting your signature
was just an excuse.

625
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,970
You seemed very sick,

626
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,770
so I was worried about you.

627
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,070
I appreciate your concern,

628
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:11,270
- but it's still...
- You know what?

629
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:14,640
I can't help but worry about you.

630
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,350
I'm worried
that you're having a hard time...

631
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:21,280
working and raising your child
at the same time.

632
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:24,790
And I'm worried
about how hard it will be for you...

633
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,920
to raise Ha Ni without her mom.

634
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:31,030
I'm also worried...

635
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,660
about how hard it will be for you...

636
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:37,100
when Ha Ni's mom gets married
this Saturday.

637
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,500
How do you know about that?

638
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,640
I heard.

639
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,410
Heard what?

640
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,440
When she came...

641
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,780
to your office the other day,

642
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,450
I spilled coffee on the floor,

643
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,620
so I was under the desk
wiping it up.

644
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:03,090
Why would you bring up something
I've never even told you about?

645
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,630
What does it have to do with you?

646
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,840
I don't know
why I'm being like this.

647
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,670
I'm sorry.

648
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,720
Hey, Ha Ni. You're up.

649
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,960
All right. It's okay.

650
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:35,960
It's all right.

651
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:44,330
Mr. Rooftop House.

652
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,800
Mr. Rooftop House.

653
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,200
Yes?

654
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:57,250
I forgot that I had received this.

655
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,250
Thank you.

656
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,420
Bye.

657
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,180
Bye.

658
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,560
(Kim Seon Ah, Angel Piano, 273-2,
Hwageum-ro, Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul)

659
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,290
Seon Ah?

660
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:18,630
What is this?

661
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,110
Thank you.

662
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,650
I'm sorry about everything.

663
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,550
(I'm sorry about everything.)

664
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:41,260
"I'm sorry about everything?"

665
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:53,340
Come in.

666
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,280
You're done already?

667
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,280
You're not done yet?

668
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,550
My eyes hurt.

669
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,720
Why are you laughing?

670
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,590
You read comic books
like you're studying for an exam.

671
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,560
Well, I tend to concentrate...

672
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,630
when I'm doing something.

673
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,430
Hand me the books when you're done.

674
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,210
I don't play.

675
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,450
My mom brought them
to read fortunes with...

676
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,650
if she got bored
while looking after me.

677
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,090
I watched
my maternal grandmother play...

678
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,950
when I was a child.

679
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,460
You play Go-Stop too?

680
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:51,330
I know the basic rules. That's all.

681
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,400
Shall we play a game?

682
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,070
No, thanks.

683
00:44:57,130 --> 00:44:59,230
Come on. My eyes are sore.

684
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,900
Let's stop reading comics
and play cards instead.

685
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,670
I'll play nice and coach you.

686
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:07,910
I'm not good at it.

687
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:10,180
I won't play too hard.

688
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:11,310
Let's play...

689
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,680
just three games.

690
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,590
Okay, then.

691
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:20,260
Deal. I'll set it out.

692
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,590
One Joker equals a Double Pi.

693
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,360
You'll know that official rule.

694
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,470
There's Ddadak and Jjok,

695
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:31,270
and the first Bbeok gets you one Pi.

696
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,630
Pibak and Gwangbak are in play too.

697
00:45:32,630 --> 00:45:33,670
You get both and if I win,
my points quadruple.

698
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:35,300
You can shake just once per game,

699
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,570
but bombs are an exception.

700
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,640
Wait. In my neighborhood,

701
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,310
if you collect all three Jokers,

702
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:42,340
you get five points
just like Godori.

703
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,180
So, are you in?

704
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:47,350
CEO Ma.

705
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,650
Are you a card shark?

706
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,250
I'm not that good at it.

707
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:53,690
I played with my mom
when we were bored.

708
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:56,460
How much per point?

709
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:57,890
I don't gamble.

710
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:00,530
We must wager something
to keep us competitive.

711
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:02,530
Shall we smack our wrists?

712
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:04,670
Or flick our forehead?

713
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,900
A wrist smack.

714
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,840
Deal.

715
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:26,860
Hey.

716
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,900
(Joker!)

717
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:39,570
(Joker times 2)

718
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,700
Gosh.

719
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,670
Hey.

720
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,280
What's this?

721
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,710
What's going on?

722
00:46:49,910 --> 00:46:51,150
I'll put them like this.

723
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:53,180
It's Godori.

724
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,620
(Bbeok)

725
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,420
Shoot. I lost them all.

726
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,990
You had that card too?

727
00:47:09,970 --> 00:47:12,170
If I put this here,
it's Pibak for you,

728
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:14,640
and it's my third Go.

729
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,420
Smack my wrist already.

730
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,720
We must play again.

731
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,460
I won't let you off lightly.

732
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,170
I'm known for my painful smacks.

733
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:44,570
Shuffle the deck.

734
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:45,900
Okay.

735
00:47:50,510 --> 00:47:51,510
Oh, dear.

736
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,080
Godori.

737
00:48:09,890 --> 00:48:13,700
I feel bad that I keep winning.

738
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,860
There's no time to waste. Be quick.

739
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:26,380
Shuffle the deck.

740
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,120
Shoot.

741
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:41,790
Do you play online every day?

742
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,430
I do not.

743
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:49,360
Hi, Mom.

744
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,800
What are you doing?

745
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,030
I'm busy right now.

746
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,570
Why are you busy?

747
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,540
I'm busy. Talk to you later.

748
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:05,110
Darn it.

749
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,090
Hello?

750
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,850
How do you feel?

751
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:14,520
I'm fine.
I'm handling something urgent...

752
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,590
and can't talk now.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

753
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:18,090
What?

754
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:19,230
Let's talk tomorrow.

755
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:26,870
Pibak.

756
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:29,170
Gwangbak.

757
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,170
Are you a card shark?

758
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:36,750
My gosh.

759
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,770
Welcome.

760
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,310
Hi.

761
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:09,240
Is something wrong?

762
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,210
Of course not.

763
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,010
Everything's fine.

764
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:16,490
You were crying.

765
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,090
Today...

766
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,530
I settled my divorce.

767
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:29,430
The lawsuit's over.

768
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,200
Good for you.

769
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:39,570
Considering what the fool did,

770
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,810
I'm wondering
if I gave in too easily.

771
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,880
But I was becoming too miserable.

772
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,820
I felt a bit dispirited...

773
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,450
and couldn't help but cry...

774
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,590
when you came in.

775
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,660
When will the part-timer come?

776
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,460
Let's go for a walk
when you get off work.

777
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:03,470
The cherry blossoms are pretty.

778
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,240
I used to wash, bleach, and iron...

779
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,670
my husband's shirts...

780
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:14,580
so he could go to work.

781
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,410
And I bought seasonal vegetables...

782
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:19,350
to cook for him daily.

783
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,920
I had plans to invest...

784
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,620
the money he brought home...

785
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,720
and gradually expand our home.

786
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,430
That's how I thought I'd live.

787
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,560
I dreamed of building
a red clay house...

788
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,100
in the countryside,
growing vegetables in the garden...

789
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,370
for us to eat,

790
00:51:41,870 --> 00:51:43,310
and growing old there together.

791
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:48,480
Mi Sun.

792
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,590
Let's not give up too soon.

793
00:51:58,850 --> 00:51:59,860
What?

794
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:01,790
We're still young.

795
00:52:02,890 --> 00:52:04,730
Divorce doesn't mean
our lives are over.

796
00:52:06,530 --> 00:52:09,260
You're right. Divorce isn't the end.

797
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,300
Let's cheer up.

798
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:13,970
Yes.

799
00:52:15,370 --> 00:52:16,370
Congratulations...

800
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,570
on your new beginning.

801
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,350
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

802
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,690
Goodness.

803
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:33,690
My word.

804
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:18,970
I came
because I was worried about you.

805
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:26,310
I'll be there with a bottle.

806
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:27,580
Just a second.

807
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,290
You know what?

808
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,920
I can't help but worry about you.

809
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,620
(Hankuk University Hospital)

810
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,030
Have you really not done this
since you last played...

811
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:19,490
with your grandmother as a kid?

812
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,060
I got lucky, that's all.

813
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,670
I highly doubt that.

814
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:28,240
All right, then.
Thank you for the game.

815
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,370
No, wait!

816
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:32,370
One more round.

817
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:35,040
Forget it.
I feel too bad to play anymore.

818
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,250
Says the man
who's been smacking me nonstop.

819
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:39,950
Just one more round.

820
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,550
Are you sure about this?

821
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:44,420
Go even if you don't win any points.

822
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,490
Ma Kwang Sook does not look back.

823
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,260
One round. That's it.

824
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:53,160
Instead of smacking each other
on the wrist,

825
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:56,770
the loser will grant
the winner a wish.

826
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:58,770
A wish?

827
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,300
What kind of wish?

828
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:04,670
I'm not sure. But whoever wins...

829
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:07,340
can think about that later on.

830
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,710
Deal. Now, shuffle and deal.

831
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,350
Go on.

832
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:38,510
All right.

833
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:48,620
Did my opponent wander off?

834
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,090
Wait.

835
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:01,430
That's not what I meant to play.
Let me take it back.

836
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:02,500
Stop.

837
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:12,910
No take-backs. Don't you know that?

838
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:17,080
I got confused
and played the wrong card.

839
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:18,250
Let it slide this once.

840
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,480
No way.

841
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:23,590
This is what you get.

842
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:28,920
Darn.

843
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:32,260
There.

844
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,460
(Bbeok)

845
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:34,860
It's a triple stack!

846
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:46,240
Game over.

847
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:51,750
No way.

848
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,220
Are you kidding me?

849
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,520
Put down your promise in writing.

850
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,660
In writing?

851
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:02,720
We agreed that the loser
would grant the winner's wish.

852
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,630
Have you been fooled all your life?

853
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:08,130
My word is my brand.

854
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,160
I wouldn't go back on my promise.

855
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,270
I don't trust what people say.
I only trust what's in writing.

856
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:17,110
You'll write it yourself
and hand it to me.

857
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:18,110
Here.

858
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,340
Have you been fooled all your life?

859
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:22,510
Fine.

860
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,210
I don't see a piece of paper.

861
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:28,220
Wait.

862
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,980
You can write it on your wristband.

863
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,020
It even has your name on it already.

864
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,220
Is this really necessary?

865
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:37,890
I prefer certainty.

866
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:43,030
What should I write?

867
00:57:44,530 --> 00:57:46,570
Write
"Wish Fulfillment Agreement"...

868
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:47,840
and sign it.

869
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:53,780
Wish Fulfillment...

870
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,940
Agreement.

871
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:57,850
Ma Kwang Sook.

872
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:58,980
Happy now?

873
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:01,380
Okay.

874
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:03,480
Get that to me
once you're discharged tomorrow.

875
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,590
I'll get going.

876
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,000
He's so persistent.

877
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,700
I don't get it.

878
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,300
How could I have been so unlucky
with my draws?

879
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:25,340
Seriously. Like this. There you go.

880
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:26,570
Why was that so hard?

881
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:36,680
(Eagle Brewery)

882
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:47,800
You might still feel dizzy
after discharge,

883
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,060
so avoid strenuous activities
for the time being...

884
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,570
and get as much rest as you can.

885
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,070
Be sure to take the painkillers
I'll prescribe...

886
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,510
and don't forget to use a compress
on the injured area.

887
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,170
I'll keep that in mind.

888
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,410
Sure. Bye, then.

889
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:06,850
Kwang Sook.

890
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,520
Guys.

891
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,090
I could've taken a cab home.

892
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,060
You didn't have to come
when you were busy.

893
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,590
What are you saying?
Of course, we should pick you up.

894
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:19,060
I'll pack your things.

895
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,360
Thanks.

896
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:25,000
What's with all the books?

897
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:33,880
Come in.

898
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,380
Right.

899
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,620
Were you also leaving, CEO Ma?

900
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:45,020
Yes, my brothers-in-law
are here to pick me up.

901
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,320
It was a tough couple of days.

902
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,220
Here you go.

903
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,400
Goodness.

904
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:56,830
I almost forgot.

905
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:01,140
I'll get going, then.

906
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,100
Sure.

909
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:35,670
Shall we, sir?

910
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:37,970
Yes, let's go.

911
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,590
Since my wife passed away,

912
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,890
those were the happiest two days
I've had.

913
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,430
It felt as though...

914
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:02,700
a once-shut window had opened
to let sunlight pour in.

915
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:07,670
It was an absolutely perfect,
happy vacation.

916
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:19,410
(Eagle Brewery)

917
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,760
Welcome home, CEO Ma.
You've had a rough couple of days.

918
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,990
Hardly.

919
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:33,130
I was able to rest up.

920
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:34,230
I see.

921
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:38,270
Mr. Go, I bet things were tough
for you without me here.

922
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,170
Chun Soo and Kang Soo
helped out a lot.

923
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,980
Hello. Have you been well?

924
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,350
What are you talking about?

925
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:02,290
Why is our brewery on the news?

926
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:08,330
It's bad!

927
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:11,330
- What is it?
- You need to watch the news.

928
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:12,800
- The news?
- The news?

929
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,800
Yes.

930
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:18,840
What's going on?

931
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,510
(Eagle Brewery)

932
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:21,780
A tradition of 90 years.

933
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,740
A brewery kept in the family
for three generations...

934
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:26,110
that has been maintaining
its reputation...

935
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:28,650
and supplying
one of the country's top hotels.

936
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:31,850
It's renowned
for brewing its liquor...

937
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:33,190
exclusively with organic rice...

938
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:35,920
from the partnered farms...

939
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,730
and using nothing else
but nuruk and water.

940
01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:40,900
However, we've received
a shocking tip...

941
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,160
about this brewery.

942
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:46,070
It looks like they use
the best ingredients,

943
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:48,400
but the rice they use
is actually stale.

944
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:52,110
Not just that,
it's riddled with insects too.

945
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:54,210
My gosh. That's not our brewery.

946
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:56,440
It is our brewery.

947
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:58,550
What does that mean?

948
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,480
Who would tell such a lie?

949
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,020
This can't be.

950
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,090
(For Eagle Brothers)

951
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:47,400
Yes, sir.

952
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,860
You're mistaken. That's not true.

953
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:51,330
I love my professor.

954
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:52,700
Shut your mouth!

955
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,470
Will you marry a divorced man
with a kid?

956
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:57,870
Can you spend the rest of your life
raising someone else's kid?

957
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:00,640
Why are you such a scaredy-cat?

958
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:01,740
Why are you here?

959
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:03,310
I came to stand guard.

960
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:04,450
To stand guard?

961
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:08,020
I just came back from submitting
a letter of complaint.

962
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:11,020
I stake the honor
and future of our brewery...

963
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:14,920
and promise to fight to the end
to reveal the truth.
