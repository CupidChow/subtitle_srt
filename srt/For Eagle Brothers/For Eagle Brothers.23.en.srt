00:00:01,281 --> 00:00:03,481
Hello. Have you been well?

2
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:11,821
What are you talking about?

3
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:15,591
Why is our brewery on the news?

4
00:00:17,121 --> 00:00:18,231
It's bad!

5
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:21,191
- What is it? - You need to watch the news.

6
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:22,701
- The news? - The news?

7
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:23,701
Yes.

8
00:00:25,331 --> 00:00:26,901
What's going on?

9
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:28,171
(Eagle Brewery)

10
00:00:33,141 --> 00:00:34,571
A tradition of 90 years.

11
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:36,041
A brewery kept in the family for three generations...

12
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:39,011
that has been maintaining its reputation...

13
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:41,581
and supplying one of the country's top hotels.

14
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:45,321
It's renowned for brewing its liquor...

15
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:46,751
exclusively with organic rice...

16
00:00:46,751 --> 00:00:49,491
from the partnered farms...

17
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:50,991
and using nothing else but nuruk and water.

18
00:00:50,991 --> 00:00:53,361
My gosh. That's not our brewery.

19
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:54,801
It is our brewery.

20
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:57,661
However, we've received a shocking tip...

21
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:59,831
about this brewery.

22
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:02,841
It looks like they use the best ingredients,

23
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:05,171
but the rice they use is actually stale.

24
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:09,081
Not just that, it's riddled with insects too.

25
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,511
Oh, gosh. This is gross. There are moths too.

26
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:13,711
My goodness.

27
00:01:13,711 --> 00:01:16,581
They can't make makgeolli with rice that should be thrown out.

28
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:18,491
What on earth is this?

29
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:19,521
Goodness me.

30
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,321
Who would spread such lies?

31
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:24,491
This is insane!

32
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:28,001
We met with A who came to us with this shocking video.

33
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:29,601
They were selling makgeolli...

34
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:31,501
while deceiving the entire country...

35
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:34,871
about the rice being organic and sourced from partnered farms.

36
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:36,901
I couldn't let them get away with it.

37
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:38,511
(A, whistleblower)

38
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:41,311
No one should drink liquor made with such rice.

39
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:43,441
Wouldn't that be harmful to our health?

40
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:50,921
This is Eagle Brewery.

41
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:54,021
That is far from the truth.

42
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:55,921
We get freshly polished rice...

43
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:57,991
on a regular basis from our partnered farms.

44
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:00,561
Can you please hold?

45
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:04,831
Yes, sir.

46
00:02:05,831 --> 00:02:08,371
That is false news. It's far from the truth.

47
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:09,801
Of course not.

48
00:02:13,241 --> 00:02:15,781
Yes, hello. You must've watched the news.

49
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:17,711
That has nothing to do with us.

50
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:20,151
Of course not.

51
00:02:21,481 --> 00:02:23,451
You'll see once you visit our brewery,

52
00:02:23,581 --> 00:02:25,651
but that's not how we operate.

53
00:02:32,631 --> 00:02:33,631
Hello?

54
00:02:34,091 --> 00:02:35,501
What on earth is happening?

55
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:38,731
Someone's deliberately trying to tarnish our reputation.

56
00:02:42,441 --> 00:02:43,841
They referred to her as a whistleblower.

57
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:45,911
Who among us would do such a thing?

58
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:49,511
Wait. Isn't she the newcomer...

59
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:51,811
who came with the older ladies to help us make nuruk?

60
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:55,451
I saw rice riddled with insects with my very own eyes.

61
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:57,521
It all felt like a scam.

62
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,791
I figured others also had a right to know the truth.

63
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,261
She does seem like that lady.

64
00:03:03,061 --> 00:03:05,461
Won't the security video give us a better picture?

65
00:03:07,791 --> 00:03:11,201
Goodness. Thank you for all your hard work today.

66
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:12,231
- Good job. - Good work.

67
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:14,101
You should get changed and eat before you go.

68
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:16,671
- Oh, okay. - Yes, let's do that. Let's go.

69
00:03:16,671 --> 00:03:17,801
I'll treat you to something delicious.

70
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:19,811
- Sounds good. - Great work today.

71
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:21,271
Let's go.

72
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:45,201
Pause!

73
00:03:46,431 --> 00:03:49,201
There. In that container.

74
00:03:51,101 --> 00:03:52,241
What's that?

75
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:53,541
I'm not sure.

76
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:56,441
You can't tell for sure from the video.

77
00:03:57,211 --> 00:04:00,411
I don't think this is something we can resolve on our own.

78
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:02,281
Let's go to the police first.

79
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:04,751
Yes, I think Chun Soo's right.

80
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:08,291
Sure. Let's take this to the police. Sounds good?

81
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,291
My gosh.

82
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:13,831
- What on earth is going on? - Oh, no!

83
00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:16,431
Mrs. Gong, please keep it together.

84
00:04:17,931 --> 00:04:20,871
It was all over the news, and things blew up online as well.

85
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:24,271
Eagle Brewery won't be able to come back from this.

86
00:04:24,871 --> 00:04:28,741
Until Eagle Brewery's CEO admits absolute defeat.

87
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:31,551
Until that happens,

88
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:33,611
we must be ruthless and keep pushing hard.

89
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:35,081
Of course.

90
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:36,151
And the whistleblower?

91
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:39,791
She'll stay abroad until this situation blows over.

92
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,961
That's what you get for running wild...

93
00:04:44,961 --> 00:04:47,161
without fearing your competitors.

94
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:49,901
I'll make sure she learns...

95
00:04:50,701 --> 00:04:52,601
the full magnitude of her mistake.

96
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:56,671
Based on the tip we received from A,

97
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:00,241
we decided to dig deeper into the controversial brewery.

98
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:02,341
The brewery that seemed to take pride...

99
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:04,081
in only using the best ingredients.

100
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:05,081
Come in.

102
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:11,121
Did you look into it?

103
00:05:11,481 --> 00:05:13,321
The Legal Team began its investigation,

104
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:15,821
but there's a whistleblower along with a video.

105
00:05:16,491 --> 00:05:17,891
This will cause quite the stir.

106
00:05:19,131 --> 00:05:20,131
Unbelievable.

107
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:21,701
Also, the PR Team is being hounded...

108
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:24,431
by questions regarding the sales of Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

109
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:26,301
How should we handle this?

110
00:05:29,771 --> 00:05:32,611
"We're aware of the situation and are looking into it ourselves."

111
00:05:32,611 --> 00:05:35,641
"We fully understand the concern of our customers."

112
00:05:36,381 --> 00:05:39,681
"For now, Jang-Kwang Makgeolli has been pulled from service."

113
00:05:39,681 --> 00:05:41,251
"Once we have all the facts,"

114
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:43,481
"LX Hotel will release an official statement."

115
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:45,021
Run with that for now.

116
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:46,051
Yes, sir.

117
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:48,121
But about our supply contract for Jang-Kwang Makgeolli...

118
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:51,291
Without verifying the facts,

119
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,791
we can't terminate our contract unilaterally.

120
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,501
Our hasty decision...

121
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:57,061
could make matters worse,

122
00:05:57,561 --> 00:05:59,671
and that would ruin the brewery.

123
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:03,941
Then we'll see how things go before we decide what to do.

124
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:13,511

Did you also watch the news?

128
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:26,361
I swear,

129
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:28,831
our brewery has never even seen rice in such a state.

130
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:30,861
Someone's trying to frame us.

131
00:06:31,801 --> 00:06:32,901
Do you have proof?

132

This is the security video from inside the brewery.

Are all the men in the world dead and gone?

184
00:09:24,971 --> 00:09:26,841
Why do you think a single dad is amazing?

185
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:32,881
How badly did he gaslight you...

186
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:34,981
that you'd say such nonsense?

187
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:38,381
- I'll make sure this jerk... - Don't badmouth my professor!

188
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,751
It's one-sided on my part.

189
00:09:41,451 --> 00:09:42,461
What?

190
00:09:43,421 --> 00:09:46,531
He doesn't know that I have a crush on him.

191
00:09:47,061 --> 00:09:49,101
I like him, but he doesn't see me like that.

192
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:51,761
It's unrequited love?

193
00:10:06,081 --> 00:10:07,381
Look into my eyes.

194
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:10,281
He's a divorced single dad,

195
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:12,451
and you felt bad that he was suffering.

196
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:14,451
My darling sweetheart,

197
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:17,091
that's probably why you just fell for him briefly.

198
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:21,791
There are so many pitiful, sad people out there.

199
00:10:22,401 --> 00:10:24,331
Whenever you see one,

200
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:27,001
will you let your pity control you enough to act like this?

201
00:10:28,201 --> 00:10:29,271
No.

202
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:32,511
It's not pity, Mom.

203
00:10:34,311 --> 00:10:35,511
That's enough.

204
00:10:36,881 --> 00:10:39,581
Get up, fix your makeup, and get changed. Right now.

205
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:41,711
- Mom! - Get yourself ready.

206
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:44,451
We'll leave in 30 minutes.

207
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:05,871
What got into her?

208
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:20,151
Mr. Oh. Are you in?

209
00:11:21,851 --> 00:11:22,921
Yes.

210
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,961
I'm coming in, then.

211
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:41,071
My gosh. You look dreadful.

212
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:42,641
Are you unwell?

213
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,541
I couldn't sleep last night.

214
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:46,551
I stayed up all night.

215
00:11:47,351 --> 00:11:49,681
Does your body still ache from the beating?

216
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:54,051
I should've taken you to the hospital.

217
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,491
It's not that.

218
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:59,031
I'm scared those thugs might come back.

219
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:01,931
My heart beats out of my chest,

220
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:03,831
and my stomach lurches.

221
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:08,231
Why are you such a scaredy-cat?

222
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:10,241
You saw them yesterday too.

223
00:12:10,241 --> 00:12:11,871
I could've died.

224
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:20,281
It all happened because of Ms. Kim.

225
00:12:20,451 --> 00:12:23,681
Forget all about her and pull yourself together.

226
00:12:24,381 --> 00:12:25,391
Okay?

227
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:29,991
Why won't you answer?

228
00:12:33,061 --> 00:12:34,331
Okay.

229
00:12:35,931 --> 00:12:37,561
I bought you some porridge.

230
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:39,071
Eat that and put on some pain relief patches.

231
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:46,471
I'm glad your face isn't bruised, at least.

232
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:55,481
Come here and have some porridge.

233
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:57,081
I have no appetite.

234
00:12:58,621 --> 00:13:01,651
Even if you have no appetite, you should still eat something.

235
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:04,391
Or you could fall seriously ill.

236
00:13:05,991 --> 00:13:07,161
What kind of porridge is it?

237
00:13:11,201 --> 00:13:12,431
It's pine nut porridge.

238
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:16,841
I got it from the most famous store at the market.

239
00:13:17,401 --> 00:13:18,641
Hurry up and have some.

240
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:40,631
Get me beef porridge next time.

241
00:13:40,631 --> 00:13:42,331
That's the only porridge I eat.

242
00:13:44,231 --> 00:13:45,431
Okay.

243
00:13:49,001 --> 00:13:50,141
Is anyone home?

244
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,511
It must be them.

245
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:56,741
Calm down, Mr. Oh.

246
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:04,451
No, don't do that.

247
00:14:04,451 --> 00:14:05,451
That's dangerous.

248
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:08,391
Stay calm. Relax.

249
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:13,631
Who is it?

250
00:14:16,001 --> 00:14:18,301
I'm here from the gas company to do a routine safety check.

251
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:23,371
No.

252
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,541
Don't open the door.

253
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,711
The thugs could be lying.

254
00:14:27,371 --> 00:14:28,471
Hold on.

255
00:14:39,351 --> 00:14:40,591
Can I check the gas line?

256
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:44,091
- Yes. Come on in. - Okay.

257
00:14:46,431 --> 00:14:49,001
I'll check if there's a leak.

258
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:50,161
It won't take long.

259
00:14:58,371 --> 00:14:59,371
Yes.

260
00:14:59,811 --> 00:15:00,811
Oh, really?

261
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,741
Okay, thanks.

262
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:05,111
Do what you can. All right.

263
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:07,811
That was the brewery manager.

264
00:15:08,111 --> 00:15:10,081
He managed to reach the old ladies...

265
00:15:10,151 --> 00:15:11,751
who helped make the nuruk and will meet them.

266
00:15:11,921 --> 00:15:13,521
He'll leave now with Kim.

267
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:17,491
Once we identify the woman in the video,

268
00:15:17,491 --> 00:15:19,091
it could end the case fast.

269
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:22,261
I hope the case gets assigned to a lead detective soon.

270
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,731
We can't even afford to waste a single minute.

271
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:29,901
There's nothing we can do right now.

272
00:15:30,371 --> 00:15:32,541
We should let the police identify the culprit...

273
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:34,371
and do what we can.

274
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:41,411
Hello, sir.

275
00:15:41,411 --> 00:15:43,681
Customers won't stop complaining,

276
00:15:43,681 --> 00:15:46,151
so I took your makgeolli out of the fridge.

277
00:15:46,151 --> 00:15:48,091
- Come now and pick them up. - Goodness.

278
00:15:48,091 --> 00:15:50,061
I explained the situation already.

279
00:15:50,061 --> 00:15:52,361
We didn't use that kind of rice.

280
00:15:53,131 --> 00:15:57,001
I submitted a letter of complaint with the police.

281
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:58,831
When the truth comes out...

282
00:16:00,531 --> 00:16:01,571
Hello?

283
00:16:02,971 --> 00:16:04,041
Sir.

284
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,691
Don't take any calls for now.

285
00:16:36,571 --> 00:16:38,341
(Eagle Brewery)

286
00:16:38,341 --> 00:16:39,441
Is anyone in?

287
00:16:47,581 --> 00:16:49,221
- They're here. - It's them.

288
00:16:50,381 --> 00:16:51,421
- Ms. Ma. - Hey, Kang Soo.

289
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:54,221
Was that video taken here, at Eagle Brewery?

290
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:56,991
Why did you use stale, insect-ridden rice?

291
00:16:57,091 --> 00:16:59,991
You positioned yourself as a premium makgeolli seller.

292
00:17:00,091 --> 00:17:01,561
Don't you think you deceived your customers?

293
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:04,231
We'll release an official statement soon.

294
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,361
Please leave.

295
00:17:06,601 --> 00:17:07,871
- Any comments? - Please leave.

296
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:10,071
- How do you feel? - What do you say about this?

297
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,001
- Ms. Ma! - What's the plan?

298
00:17:12,001 --> 00:17:13,071
- Wait! - Say something!

299
00:17:13,711 --> 00:17:14,971
Wait, guys.

300
00:17:22,951 --> 00:17:25,791
I'm Ma Kwang Sook, the CEO of Eagle Brewery.

301
00:17:28,021 --> 00:17:30,421
I'm aware that the news startled you...

302
00:17:31,161 --> 00:17:33,831
and that you must have many questions.

303
00:17:34,861 --> 00:17:36,161
We also...

304
00:17:36,301 --> 00:17:39,571
want to know the truth behind that video.

305
00:17:39,831 --> 00:17:43,241
I just came back from submitting a letter of complaint.

306
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:45,571
Do you deny that video is the truth?

307
00:17:45,571 --> 00:17:47,011
Let me make this clear.

308
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:49,241
We never once...

309
00:17:49,811 --> 00:17:51,981
made makgeolli with rice like that.

310
00:17:52,311 --> 00:17:54,181
We heard someone on the inside blew the whistle.

311
00:17:54,381 --> 00:17:56,351
We don't have that kind of staff.

312
00:17:56,681 --> 00:17:59,451
Are you saying the video was faked?

313
00:17:59,821 --> 00:18:00,891
Yes.

314
00:18:01,551 --> 00:18:03,861
If the video turns out to be true,

315
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:05,621
I will...

316
00:18:06,161 --> 00:18:08,161
shut down the brewery right away.

317
00:18:10,831 --> 00:18:12,231
Eagle Brewery has come this far...

318
00:18:13,101 --> 00:18:14,871
by making the best liquors on the market...

319
00:18:15,571 --> 00:18:17,771
with the best ingredients and the utmost care and effort.

320
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:19,641
That pride is what has led us this far.

321
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:24,881
I stake the honor and future of our brewery...

322
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:28,111
and promise to fight to the end to reveal the truth.

323
00:18:28,851 --> 00:18:31,681
I promise you that right here.

324
00:18:35,691 --> 00:18:37,121
- Let's go. - Can we get an interview with you?

325
00:18:37,121 --> 00:18:38,691
- Is there anything you want to add? - Please say some more.

326
00:18:38,691 --> 00:18:39,691
- Thank you. - Hang on.

327
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:40,931
- Is there anything you want to add? - Wait!

328
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:43,061
- Anything you want to say? - Please leave now.

329
00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:56,809
What's with the long face?

330
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:58,349
Are you sick or something?

331
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,619
Dad.

332
00:19:02,619 --> 00:19:03,919
Shut it.

333
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:07,989
She's not feeling well.

334
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:09,459
I guess she's coming down with something.

335
00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:11,799
Then take some medicine.

336
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:16,769
Will you stop pouting?

337
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:19,939
Oh, gosh.

338
00:19:22,439 --> 00:19:23,909
Hello.

339
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:25,739
I wanted to visit you at the hospital,

340
00:19:25,739 --> 00:19:27,779
but I held back so you could get some good rest.

341
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:29,509
How are you feeling?

342
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:32,479
I just stayed in the hospital for a health checkup.

343
00:19:32,619 --> 00:19:33,619
I'm fine.

344
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:34,949
I'm glad to hear that.

345
00:19:36,449 --> 00:19:37,889
Did you come straight here from school?

346
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,659
I didn't go to school today.

347
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:44,529
- All right. Please have a seat. - Sure.

348
00:19:49,769 --> 00:19:51,839
We should've done this sooner.

349
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:53,769
I feel like this is a little late.

350
00:19:56,539 --> 00:19:58,839
Did your mom tell you that your wedding would be...

351
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,609
in the first week of September?

352
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:05,649
Right, yes.

353
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,819
As your mom mentioned,

354
00:20:09,189 --> 00:20:11,289
I thought it would be good for the two of you...

355
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:14,159
to have some alone time together...

356
00:20:14,259 --> 00:20:16,189
to make up for the time you had to spend apart,

357
00:20:16,189 --> 00:20:17,799
so I rushed it a little.

358
00:20:19,129 --> 00:20:20,559
I can't agree with you more.

359
00:20:21,569 --> 00:20:25,439
You got married when you were much younger than Gyeol, right?

360
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,139
I got married before I graduated from college.

361
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,879
Chairman Han's love story is legendary.

362
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:40,319
I can't wait to see my grandchild...

363
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,249
call me Grandpa.

364
00:20:43,649 --> 00:20:45,159
Don't you feel the same way, Chairman Han?

365
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:49,559
Actually, I'm not ready for that yet.

366
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:01,669
Have you proposed to her yet?

367
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:05,079
Well...

368
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:06,579
The thing is...

369
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:09,779
There were a lot of people I had to visit after my discharge,

370
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:11,349
so I haven't done it yet.

371
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:14,589
I'll make it happen soon.

372
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:16,349
Wait just a little longer.

373
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,769
My goodness. You don't need to be so shy.

374
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,899
She may seem old enough, but she's still like a little kid.

375
00:21:44,949 --> 00:21:45,979
Kwang Sook.

376
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:47,349
Hey.

377
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:49,089
You watched the news?

378
00:21:49,489 --> 00:21:50,789
What is happening?

379
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:52,989
There's no way it happened at our brewery.

380
00:21:53,489 --> 00:21:55,759
I think someone did it to cause us trouble.

381
00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:57,389
But who would do such a thing?

382
00:21:57,589 --> 00:21:58,759
My question, exactly.

383
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:00,759
I have no idea who did it.

384
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:03,129
- Ms. Ma. - Wait, Ms. Ma!

385
00:22:03,899 --> 00:22:04,969
It's Mr. Go.

386
00:22:07,199 --> 00:22:08,239
Hello, Mr. Go.

387
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:10,269
Did you talk to the ladies?

388
00:22:11,439 --> 00:22:12,579
Is that so?

389
00:22:13,339 --> 00:22:14,549
Okay, got it.

390
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:18,079
Yes, please drive safely. Bye.

391
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:19,979
Did he find out anything?

392
00:22:20,479 --> 00:22:22,989
The ladies have no idea who the woman is.

393
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:24,289
What?

394
00:22:24,589 --> 00:22:27,829
Does that mean they brought a total stranger?

395
00:22:28,189 --> 00:22:30,029
The day before they came to make nuruk,

396
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:31,089
she came to the village hall...

397
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:33,559
and asked them to teach her how to make nuruk.

398
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,399
That's why they came here with her.

399
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:39,769
Maybe she approached the ladies with an ulterior motive.

400
00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:41,839
That could be the case.

401
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:44,139
Did you hear anything from the police?

402
00:22:44,609 --> 00:22:45,739
Once the detective in charge is assigned,

403
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:46,739
they'll let us know.

404
00:22:48,049 --> 00:22:49,609
We have no time to waste.

405
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:52,079
When on earth will it be assigned?

406
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,849
This case is making headlines,

407
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:56,389
so they'll have to move quickly.

408
00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:00,689
And Heung Soo seemed to have a lot on his mind,

409
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:01,859
so I didn't call him.

410
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:03,529
That's good.

411
00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:06,629
Heung Soo just broke up with his girlfriend,

412
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:08,329
so he must be out of his mind.

413
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:11,799
Well, let's not stand around here.

414
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:12,999
Let's go home and eat.

415
00:23:13,469 --> 00:23:15,469
I don't feel like eating now.

416
00:23:15,469 --> 00:23:18,939
Hey, you have to eat even if the sky is falling down.

417
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,009
Come on. Let's go.

418
00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:23,449
I'll make something delicious. Let's go.

419
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:35,329
Let's have dinner, Mom.

420
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,929
You go ahead and eat.

421
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,399
I just can't swallow anything.

422
00:23:47,069 --> 00:23:48,739
Once the culprit is caught...

423
00:23:48,739 --> 00:23:50,369
and we are found to be innocent,

424
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:52,379
we will get the brewery back on track.

425
00:23:52,379 --> 00:23:53,879
You don't have to worry.

426
00:23:53,879 --> 00:23:54,949
Hey!

427
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:57,549
Let's just sell the brewery...

428
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:00,649
and live in peace, okay?

429
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:04,719
After I saw your face all over the news,

430
00:24:05,089 --> 00:24:06,919
the Internet went crazy.

431
00:24:07,089 --> 00:24:10,059
The whole country is criticizing my daughter now.

432
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:13,699
But when the truth comes out...

433
00:24:13,699 --> 00:24:16,129
When will the truth come out?

434
00:24:16,469 --> 00:24:17,799
After the brewery goes bankrupt...

435
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,369
and we end up on the streets?

436
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:24,269
Why are you imagining the worst-case scenario?

437
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:26,609
If you don't want to go broke, you should sell the brewery...

438
00:24:26,609 --> 00:24:28,049
and get out of here right away.

439
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:29,349
Let me...

440
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:34,119
go back to Golden Castle.

441
00:24:37,189 --> 00:24:39,519
I understand how you're feeling, Mom.

442
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:41,859
But please wait just a little longer, okay?

443
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:43,759
I promise I'll take care of this...

444
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:45,829
and let you move back into Golden Castle in three years.

445
00:24:46,529 --> 00:24:48,699
Hey! Stop with that nonsense!

446
00:24:49,569 --> 00:24:52,299
At this age, I don't even have 5,000 dollars on hand.

447
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:54,339
Do you know how embarrassing it was?

448
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:55,869
How will you make me go back...

449
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,909
to Golden Castle by selling makgeolli?

450
00:24:59,779 --> 00:25:01,279
Did you say 5,000 dollars?

451
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:02,609
You don't have to know!

452
00:25:05,949 --> 00:25:08,019
Mom doesn't feel like eating.

453
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:10,619
Let's just eat without her.

454
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,119
Ms. Gong must be shocked.

455
00:25:15,189 --> 00:25:16,889
Do you want me to go and buy some medicine for her?

456
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:20,359
Don't bother. Let's just eat.

457
00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:26,199
You should finish your meal and go to pick up Ha Ni.

458
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:29,039
I'm sorry there's nothing I can do to help.

459
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:31,579
Come on. Please don't say that.

460
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:34,479
Just having you guys here by my side...

461
00:25:34,979 --> 00:25:36,079
helps me feel recharged.

462
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:43,649
Come on. Let's just enjoy our meal. All right?

463
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:45,819
Let's enjoy all this food and stay strong...

464
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:48,289
so we can protect Eagle Brewery...

465
00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:49,959
against the evil ones.

466
00:25:51,729 --> 00:25:53,999
All right. Thank you for the food.

467
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,269
Give me that.

468
00:26:09,809 --> 00:26:10,809
Wait.

469
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:12,649
What about the soldier?

470
00:26:12,849 --> 00:26:14,349
Is he joining the company?

471
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:18,419
He said he'd finish the scheduled interviews.

472
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:21,489
Will you just sit back and do nothing?

473
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:24,289
If he's someone you need,

474
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:26,259
you should be proactive and make the effort to get him.

475
00:26:28,999 --> 00:26:30,369
There it is.

476
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:35,739
I had a great time with you today.

477
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:38,379
Likewise. We should do this often, Mr. In-law.

478
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:41,649
Stop it, honey.

479
00:26:41,649 --> 00:26:43,549
They're not married yet.

480
00:26:43,709 --> 00:26:46,049
Then do you want me to call him my future in-law?

481
00:26:48,689 --> 00:26:49,689
Does that make you uncomfortable?

482
00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:51,959
Of course not. Not at all.

483
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:55,189
We will get going, then.

484
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:56,689
Get home safely.

485
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:00,759
Goodbye.

486
00:27:01,969 --> 00:27:03,299
Bye. I'll see you soon.

487
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:04,969
I'll call you.

488
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:06,599
Okay.

489
00:27:07,199 --> 00:27:08,209
Bye.

490
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:09,239
Bye.

491
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:22,919
You guys should go home.

492
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:24,619
I have to stop by somewhere.

493
00:27:24,749 --> 00:27:26,159
Where are you going this late at night?

494
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,629
There's someone I must urgently meet.

495
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,099
I know everyone's stressed out,

496
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:38,539
so I feel guilty heading home alone like this.

497
00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:41,769
Don't worry too much. I'm sure it'll be fine.

498
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:45,679
Of course. After all we did to keep the brewery in the family?

499
00:27:46,109 --> 00:27:47,679
Nothing bad will happen to it.

500
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:51,719
Call me at any time if anything happens.

501
00:27:53,979 --> 00:27:55,319
Drive safely, Beom Soo.

502
00:27:55,349 --> 00:27:58,159
Will do. Take good care of Kwang Sook for me.

503
00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:00,959
I'll get going, then.

504
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:02,059
- Take care. - Bye.

505
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:04,659
- Drive home safely. - Sure thing, Chun Soo.

506
00:28:11,769 --> 00:28:12,769
Take care.

507
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:20,439
I'm off to the convenience store.

508
00:28:20,879 --> 00:28:22,209
Mi Sun has been texting me worried sick...

509
00:28:22,209 --> 00:28:23,649
since seeing the coverage on the news,

510
00:28:23,649 --> 00:28:24,779
but I haven't been able to call her back.

511
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:25,949
Sure thing.

512
00:28:26,479 --> 00:28:28,749
I'll get some calming pills from the pharmacy.

513
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,089
They're for your mother.

514
00:28:30,649 --> 00:28:31,719
Got it.

515
00:28:32,019 --> 00:28:34,459
I'll check on the brewery.

516
00:28:34,719 --> 00:28:35,729
Sure.

517
00:28:37,229 --> 00:28:38,229
Let's go.

518
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:54,979
CEO Ma. Get out here, will you?

519
00:28:55,149 --> 00:28:56,709
Get out here.

520
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:58,749
Let us see your face.

521
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,019
- CEO Ma. - CEO Ma!

522
00:29:01,949 --> 00:29:03,689
- CEO Ma! - Sir and ma'am.

523
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:05,489
You're here.

524
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:08,159
I would've come to you if you had called.

525
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,929
It's been hours since this whole thing blew up.

526
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:11,829
You need to get this sorted out quickly.

527
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:13,629
Makgeolli can't be stored for very long,

528
00:29:13,629 --> 00:29:15,669
and it can't be sold after a few days.

529
00:29:15,899 --> 00:29:17,499
We're returning all those units,

530
00:29:17,499 --> 00:29:18,899
so give back our money.

531
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:20,869
(Unrefined Makgeolli, Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

532
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,139
We don't want to do this to you,

533
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:26,709
but what can we do when the customers won't drink it?

534
00:29:26,979 --> 00:29:28,649
We're out of options.

535
00:29:28,709 --> 00:29:31,479
Of course. I should do all that you ask.

536
00:29:31,749 --> 00:29:33,219
I'll take the products back...

537
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:35,819
and give back the money you paid in advance.

538
00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:38,519
It's nice to know...

539
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:40,159
- that you still have a conscience. - Yes.

540
00:29:40,219 --> 00:29:42,359
All right. Let's head inside and get this sorted out.

541
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,959
- Yes, let's go inside. - However,

542
00:29:45,729 --> 00:29:47,499
I can't do so at the moment.

543
00:29:47,499 --> 00:29:48,729
- What? - What?

544
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,969
Due to recent events,

545
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:55,669
our payments have been put on hold as well.

546
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:59,079
Are you telling us to shove it?

547
00:29:59,709 --> 00:30:01,139
Of course not, sir.

548
00:30:01,139 --> 00:30:02,679
I promise I will give you a full refund,

549
00:30:02,709 --> 00:30:04,749
but please give me...

550
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:06,519
a little more time.

551
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:11,889
Wait. Can you pull over here?

552
00:30:14,989 --> 00:30:16,789
How much more time can we give you?

553
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:18,459
No way.

554
00:30:18,899 --> 00:30:20,499
We couldn't possibly wait any longer.

555
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:25,269
Small-scale wholesalers like us...

556
00:30:25,339 --> 00:30:27,239
rely on daily earnings.

557
00:30:27,439 --> 00:30:29,769
This kind of scandal can ruin our lives.

558
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:31,439
Whatever.

559
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,409
I want a refund this instant.

560
00:30:33,409 --> 00:30:35,249
I only paid for the makgeolli in advance...

561
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:37,349
because it was being supplied to a top hotel.

562
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:39,749
Now, it's all just a scam.

563
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:41,419
How can it be a scam?

564
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:44,719
You know better than anyone what kind of makgeolli we brew here.

565
00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:47,219
You can't do this to us.

566
00:30:47,219 --> 00:30:48,889
Don't think about talking your way out of this.

567
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:51,259
Let's return these whether she accepts them or not.

568
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:52,959
- We'll talk inside. - I want a refund.

569
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:55,429
- Take them inside. - I'll take them off your hands.

570
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:15,489
Chairman Han.

571
00:31:15,689 --> 00:31:16,689
I'm...

572
00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:21,419
Chairman Han Dong Seok of LX Hotel,

573
00:31:21,789 --> 00:31:24,789
which sells Eagle Brewery's makgeolli.

574
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,069
- LX Hotel? - He is the chairman of LX Hotel?

575
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:31,129
Let me make this clear.

576
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:33,099
The supply contract we have with Eagle Brewery...

577
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,939
will not be terminated.

578
00:31:34,999 --> 00:31:36,969
We also won't demand any refunds.

579
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:39,839
I say this because...

580
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,249
with the stale rice featured on the news,

581
00:31:42,249 --> 00:31:45,679
it'd be impossible to brew makgeolli of this quality.

582
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:49,749
What is the total amount that should be refunded?

583
00:31:50,219 --> 00:31:52,219
LX Hotel will take care of it for now.

584
00:31:55,089 --> 00:31:57,759
Since LX Hotel will continue...

585
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:00,099
to order makgeolli from Eagle Brewery,

586
00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:02,929
we'll consider it as an advance payment.

587
00:32:04,599 --> 00:32:05,639
Chairman Han...

588
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:10,909
I'll leave instructions with my secretaries.

589
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:13,679
You can call the number on this business card...

590
00:32:13,879 --> 00:32:15,509
and send the necessary papers.

591
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:34,999
This is burdock root tea. Please try some.

592
00:32:35,869 --> 00:32:36,899
Thank you.

593
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:40,999
You know, Chairman Han,

594
00:32:42,339 --> 00:32:44,339
I felt dizzy...

595
00:32:44,969 --> 00:32:46,309
when I first saw you earlier.

596
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:48,479
Why's that?

597
00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:50,279
I thought...

598
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,119
you were here to chew me out because the brewery...

599
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,279
tarnished your hotel's reputation.

600
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:56,949
My goodness.

601
00:32:57,719 --> 00:33:00,489
Do you see me as a heartless jerk?

602
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,559
Isn't that a fair description of you?

603
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:04,729
What?

604
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,999
I'm only joking.

605
00:33:11,469 --> 00:33:14,539
I can't believe you'll refund the wholesalers.

606
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:17,169
I never expected that.

607
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:19,439
There's no need to be touched.

608
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:22,509
I can consider it as an advance payment on our end.

609
00:33:23,749 --> 00:33:24,979
I'm truly...

610
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:27,079
grateful.

611
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:30,419
Everyone has already made up their minds about us,

612
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:33,219
but you placed your trust in us...

613
00:33:33,589 --> 00:33:35,529
without hesitation.

614
00:33:36,089 --> 00:33:37,089
I trust...

615
00:33:38,259 --> 00:33:40,599
the taste and quality of Jang-Kwang Makgeolli...

616
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:43,129
as well as my personal standards.

617
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:44,669
There's no need...

618
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:46,739
to get emotional about it.

619
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:50,039
Chairman Han, you couldn't be more impressive.

620
00:33:58,149 --> 00:33:59,249
Are you all right?

621
00:33:59,879 --> 00:34:00,879
I'm fine.

622
00:34:02,589 --> 00:34:03,849
Are you leaving already?

623
00:34:04,589 --> 00:34:07,759
Yes, it's already late. I'll get going.

624
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:13,659
(Eagle Brewery)

625
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:19,339
What do I do with all that makgeolli?

626
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:22,739
It'd be a waste to throw them away.

627
00:34:28,979 --> 00:34:30,009
I'll get going.

628
00:34:30,979 --> 00:34:33,379
Sure. I hope you get home safely.

629
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:37,219
Chairman Han.

630
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,229
Thank you...

631
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:44,789
for everything today.

632
00:34:47,229 --> 00:34:48,229
I won't...

633
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:50,429
forget this.

634
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,509
The truth is bound to come out eventually.

635
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:58,739
So until then,

636
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,879
stay strong and hold out with all your might.

637
00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:03,879
Sure.

638
00:35:05,009 --> 00:35:06,079
I'll do that.

639
00:35:08,349 --> 00:35:12,359
(Eagle Brewery)

640
00:35:26,939 --> 00:35:30,139
(Eagle Brewery)

641
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:40,979
You have no idea how shocked I was to see that on the news.

642
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:42,649
It must've been a rough day.

643
00:35:43,549 --> 00:35:44,689
It was for me,

644
00:35:44,689 --> 00:35:46,619
but what made it worse was the look on Kwang Sook's face.

645
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:49,089
She has finally been turning a profit at a brewery...

646
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:50,489
that was once at risk of shutting down.

647
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:53,859
But now, she's caught up in a ridiculous scandal.

648
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:56,429
Did you report this to the police?

649
00:35:56,799 --> 00:35:58,369
Yes, we filed a complaint...

650
00:35:58,569 --> 00:36:00,739
and submitted the security footage as evidence.

651
00:36:01,269 --> 00:36:03,709
The case hasn't been assigned to a detective yet, though.

652
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:05,639
Security footage?

653
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:06,809
Yes.

654
00:36:06,909 --> 00:36:09,279
We checked the security video...

655
00:36:09,609 --> 00:36:10,879
from the day we made nuruk.

656
00:36:11,249 --> 00:36:13,919
There was this younger woman who came with the older ladies.

657
00:36:14,379 --> 00:36:16,049
It looks as though she did all this.

658
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:20,719
Can I watch that video?

659
00:36:20,919 --> 00:36:23,329
Sure. I have it on my phone.

660
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:30,999
Goodness. Thank you for all your hard work today.

661
00:36:31,069 --> 00:36:32,369
- Good work. - Hold on.

662
00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:35,339
That woman.

663
00:36:39,939 --> 00:36:41,539
She was at my convenience store.

664
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:44,449
Welcome.

665
00:36:45,779 --> 00:36:47,549
You all worked hard today.

666
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:49,489
Let me get you a cold beverage.

667
00:36:49,649 --> 00:36:51,349
Why would you get us anything...

668
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:52,659
when we had enough at the brewery?

669
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:54,989
I was able to earn some money thanks to you,

670
00:36:55,189 --> 00:36:57,189
so please let me at least get you a beverage.

671
00:36:57,759 --> 00:36:58,829
Have a seat.

672
00:36:58,829 --> 00:37:02,099
You sure are well-mannered for someone your age.

673
00:37:02,399 --> 00:37:03,699
- Let's stay for a beverage. - All right.

674
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,229
- Sure. - Good.

675
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:12,639
Let me scan these.

676
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,279
Yes, sir.

677
00:37:18,919 --> 00:37:20,449
I wrapped things up just now...

678
00:37:20,779 --> 00:37:22,289
and left Eagle Brewery.

679
00:37:26,889 --> 00:37:28,059
Thank you.

680
00:37:30,729 --> 00:37:32,159
Would you like your receipt?

681
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:35,399
Of course. I got it done perfectly.

682
00:37:35,999 --> 00:37:36,999
Anyway,

683
00:37:37,499 --> 00:37:39,969
I'll send what you requested shortly.

684
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:41,669
Sure.

685
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,439
Right. Thank you.

686
00:37:47,709 --> 00:37:48,709
That's right.

687
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:50,709
- These are for you. - I heard her mention your brewery,

688
00:37:50,709 --> 00:37:52,249
so I paid attention to her.

689
00:37:57,719 --> 00:38:00,959
Did she pay by card or with cash?

690
00:38:02,289 --> 00:38:04,629
It wasn't cash. She paid by card.

691
00:38:04,629 --> 00:38:06,929
Really? Can I check your security footage?

692
00:38:06,929 --> 00:38:08,699
- Sure. - Great. Let's check right now.

693
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:17,469
(Order canceled)

694
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,379
I'm back.

695
00:38:20,379 --> 00:38:21,479
Right.

696
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,949
The ladies are worried...

697
00:38:22,949 --> 00:38:25,079
that they might have caused Eagle Brewery...

698
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:26,219
to shut down.

699
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:28,849
It took me a while to calm them down.

700
00:38:29,989 --> 00:38:31,249
I know it was a rough day.

701
00:38:31,789 --> 00:38:34,559
What's with all the makgeolli outside our gate?

702
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:38,899
The wholesalers left them there, demanding a refund.

703
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:41,529
My, people can be so cruel.

704
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:45,129
Until yesterday, they were saying our makgeolli was the best.

705
00:38:45,569 --> 00:38:47,369
How could they change like that overnight?

706
00:38:49,069 --> 00:38:50,609
It's not their fault.

707
00:38:51,209 --> 00:38:52,439
Even I would change my mind...

708
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:54,679
after seeing that on the news.

709
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:57,649
Gosh, what a day. I'm exhausted.

710
00:38:57,649 --> 00:38:59,149
- Kwang Sook. - Hey.

711
00:38:59,149 --> 00:39:00,149
Chun Soo.

712
00:39:00,819 --> 00:39:02,019
Hey, Mi Sun.

713
00:39:03,619 --> 00:39:06,059
I think we can find the woman who secretly filmed that video.

714
00:39:06,619 --> 00:39:07,759
How?

715
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:09,259
On her way back from working on the nuruk,

716
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:10,459
she dropped by the convenience store.

717
00:39:11,189 --> 00:39:13,799
I checked the security video and saved it on this.

718
00:39:17,769 --> 00:39:18,799
And?

719
00:39:18,999 --> 00:39:23,039
Oh, she bought beverages and paid by card.

720
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,439
The detective can find out who it belongs to...

721
00:39:26,439 --> 00:39:28,109
by requesting information from the card company.

722
00:39:30,179 --> 00:39:31,609
Thank you, Mi Sun.

723
00:39:32,449 --> 00:39:34,219
It felt like being in a dark tunnel,

724
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:35,689
so thanks a lot for this.

725
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:39,559
I'm really glad this could help.

726
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:43,359
Mi Sun, you're a lifesaver. I'm proud of you!

727
00:39:45,442 --> 00:39:47,212
Those at Eagle Brewery...

728
00:39:47,212 --> 00:39:50,582
are denying the rumors about using stale rice.

729
00:39:50,582 --> 00:39:52,582
- Ms. Ma! - They're also claiming...

730
00:39:52,582 --> 00:39:54,192
that the whistleblower's footage was fabricated.

731
00:39:54,192 --> 00:39:55,352
- Ms. Ma! - Any words?

732
00:39:55,952 --> 00:39:58,562
- You thought you could run wild. - The truth behind the rumors...

733
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,762
I bet she finally learned her place.

734
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:10,432
What are you watching?

735
00:40:10,802 --> 00:40:14,642
There's a good chance Eagle Brewery might shut down soon.

736
00:40:16,472 --> 00:40:17,712
What do you mean by that?

737
00:40:18,142 --> 00:40:19,312
Haven't you seen the news?

738
00:40:19,412 --> 00:40:20,612
News about what?

739
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:24,352
They lied about only using organic rice...

740
00:40:24,352 --> 00:40:27,622
and got caught using stale rice riddled...

741
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:29,192
with insects.

742
00:40:29,522 --> 00:40:31,222
That's impossible. Let me see.

743
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:32,992
Right there. Watch it.

744
00:40:35,292 --> 00:40:38,232
As if selling a bottle of makgeolli can earn you much.

745
00:40:38,632 --> 00:40:40,432
Organic this, and quality that.

746
00:40:40,872 --> 00:40:42,802
I knew she was a fraud. My goodness.

747
00:40:43,432 --> 00:40:46,042
As if secrets can exist in this day and age.

748
00:40:46,042 --> 00:40:47,102
So pathetic.

749
00:40:47,102 --> 00:40:49,542
Whether the rumors are true will be the main issue.

750
00:40:49,972 --> 00:40:52,512
That family wouldn't lie about the ingredients they use.

751
00:40:54,212 --> 00:40:58,182
Why is it that you always take their side?

752
00:40:58,752 --> 00:41:02,192
Do you have any idea how greedy and malicious...

753
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:03,822
Jang Soo's widow truly is?

754
00:41:08,262 --> 00:41:09,792
Why are you looking at me like that?

755
00:41:11,162 --> 00:41:13,902
This wasn't your doing, was it?

756
00:41:16,702 --> 00:41:18,842
What the... Unbelievable.

757
00:41:18,842 --> 00:41:21,172
Why would I mess with their operation?

758
00:41:21,172 --> 00:41:22,442
Come on.

759
00:41:22,442 --> 00:41:24,982
I'm asking if you had someone do this for you.

760
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,182
What kind of person do you think I am...

761
00:41:27,182 --> 00:41:29,612
to say something like that?

762
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:33,422
Do you think I'm capable of running games like that?

763
00:41:33,422 --> 00:41:34,722
That's not what I meant.

764
00:41:34,722 --> 00:41:36,252
As if!

765
00:41:36,252 --> 00:41:39,522
How can my own wife accuse me of such a thing?

766
00:41:40,862 --> 00:41:43,432
I'm sorry. I was wrong to even ask.

767
00:41:43,432 --> 00:41:45,862
Whatever. Turn the lights off and leave. I'm going to bed.

768
00:41:48,732 --> 00:41:49,802
Good night, then.

769
00:42:04,952 --> 00:42:06,152
Unbelievable.

770
00:42:06,822 --> 00:42:10,492
Nothing gets past that woman.

771
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:13,562
Gosh, she's like a giant serpent.

772
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:26,002
Why aren't you in bed?

773
00:42:26,872 --> 00:42:28,672
I have something to say to you and Dad.

774
00:42:29,472 --> 00:42:30,542
What is it?

775
00:42:31,182 --> 00:42:32,782
No matter how I think about it,

776
00:42:33,442 --> 00:42:34,652
I can't go through with this wedding.

777
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:37,212
Your dad will have a fit. Don't you say anything!

778
00:42:37,782 --> 00:42:39,482
No matter how much I think about it,

779
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:41,922
I can't marry Gyeol.

780
00:42:41,922 --> 00:42:44,922
Have you lost your mind? No, you can't.

781
00:42:44,922 --> 00:42:45,962
- Don't! - Are you insane?

782
00:42:45,962 --> 00:42:47,932
Shut it and get inside.

783
00:42:52,802 --> 00:42:54,502
So what if you don't want to marry him?

784
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,502
I may have always obeyed you,

785
00:42:57,902 --> 00:43:00,202
but I can't let you tell me whom to marry.

786
00:43:01,542 --> 00:43:02,772
Who do you choose, then?

787
00:43:03,712 --> 00:43:04,712
I...

788
00:43:06,112 --> 00:43:07,442
I love my professor.

789
00:43:09,912 --> 00:43:10,982
You, what?

790
00:43:11,282 --> 00:43:12,622
I love him.

791
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,522
Shut your mouth!

792
00:43:19,462 --> 00:43:20,522
Mom.

793
00:43:24,532 --> 00:43:27,632
Haven't I told you in a way that made it very clear to you?

794
00:43:28,332 --> 00:43:30,132
When will you stop acting like a fool?

795
00:43:30,672 --> 00:43:31,802
Because you love him,

796
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:34,772
you'll marry a divorced man with a kid?

797
00:43:35,772 --> 00:43:38,512
Can you spend the rest of your life, raising someone else's kid?

798
00:43:40,442 --> 00:43:42,182
Bring up this nonsense again,

799
00:43:43,812 --> 00:43:45,522
and I'll be done with you forever.

800
00:43:46,652 --> 00:43:47,752
Mom...

801
00:43:47,752 --> 00:43:49,792
I gave up everything for you.

802
00:43:51,892 --> 00:43:53,092
My dreams.

803
00:43:53,862 --> 00:43:55,062
My desires.

804
00:43:55,732 --> 00:43:57,192
All that I wanted.

805
00:43:57,462 --> 00:44:00,002
I wanted you to have and enjoy everything you ever wanted.

806
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:02,872
That's why...

807
00:44:04,002 --> 00:44:06,472
I only pushed forward to give you the best life.

808
00:44:06,472 --> 00:44:09,672
But this is how you repay me? By betraying me?

809
00:44:09,972 --> 00:44:10,982
Of course not.

810
00:44:11,542 --> 00:44:13,612
I'm not betraying you, Mom.

811
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,952
You said so yourself.

812
00:44:15,952 --> 00:44:19,082
That I should be happy for you to be happy.

813
00:44:21,122 --> 00:44:22,792
If you want to see me lose it,

814
00:44:25,992 --> 00:44:27,862
do whatever you want!

815
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,992
Mom.

816
00:44:50,782 --> 00:44:54,022
I had a lot of classes and work to do today.

817
00:44:54,122 --> 00:44:56,392
I'm sorry I couldn't play with you more.

818
00:45:04,232 --> 00:45:06,002
(Na Young Eun)

819
00:45:11,642 --> 00:45:13,802
Ha Ni, I'll go take this call.

820
00:45:20,942 --> 00:45:22,112
What now?

821
00:45:22,512 --> 00:45:23,512
You know,

822
00:45:24,452 --> 00:45:27,082
I made myself clear to you.

823
00:45:27,822 --> 00:45:30,052
Actually, I begged.

824
00:45:32,992 --> 00:45:34,692
I asked you to take me back.

825
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:38,362
But...

826
00:45:40,002 --> 00:45:41,172
you didn't.

827
00:45:42,302 --> 00:45:44,742
You didn't take me back.

828
00:45:45,372 --> 00:45:47,472
As if that matters now.

829
00:45:48,972 --> 00:45:49,972
Well...

830
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:52,482
It matters to me.

831
00:45:55,182 --> 00:45:57,252
If Ha Ni ever asks about me,

832
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:00,482
tell her the truth.

833
00:46:03,522 --> 00:46:05,292
That I didn't give up on her...

834
00:46:06,762 --> 00:46:08,032
or abandon her...

835
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:11,962
without putting up a fight.

836
00:46:16,802 --> 00:46:17,942
Promise me that.

837
00:46:19,642 --> 00:46:21,542
At least promise me that.

838
00:46:23,142 --> 00:46:25,882
Even now, all you think about is what you can do...

839
00:46:26,212 --> 00:46:27,582
to relieve your guilt.

840
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:31,682
No. It's not like that.

841
00:46:33,422 --> 00:46:34,492
Fine.

842
00:46:34,852 --> 00:46:36,422
I promise. Are you happy now?

843
00:46:37,222 --> 00:46:39,562
Yes. Thank you.

844
00:46:40,862 --> 00:46:43,162
Thank you, Beom Soo.

845
00:46:44,562 --> 00:46:45,602
Bye.

846
00:47:06,022 --> 00:47:07,082
My gosh.

847
00:47:13,522 --> 00:47:14,592
What was that?

848
00:47:46,422 --> 00:47:47,462
Why...

849
00:47:50,662 --> 00:47:52,202
Why did this fall and break?

850
00:47:58,002 --> 00:47:59,042
My goodness.

851
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:06,742
(Ms. Ji)

852
00:48:06,742 --> 00:48:08,052
My heart almost dropped.

853
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:15,692
Hello?

854
00:48:17,092 --> 00:48:18,662
You sound weird.

855
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:19,962
Is something wrong?

856
00:48:20,422 --> 00:48:21,732
A cat ran by,

857
00:48:22,462 --> 00:48:23,992
and I thought it was the thugs.

858
00:48:24,632 --> 00:48:25,702
I got scared.

859
00:48:27,662 --> 00:48:29,402
If they come back,

860
00:48:29,472 --> 00:48:31,132
call the police and fight them.

861
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,372
Why are you such a scaredy-cat?

862
00:48:43,152 --> 00:48:44,412
Are you asleep, Mr. Oh?

863
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:47,482
No.

864
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:00,362
Why are you here?

865
00:49:01,032 --> 00:49:02,472
I came to stand guard.

866
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:05,272
To stand guard?

867
00:49:11,072 --> 00:49:12,942
Chun Soo, can I come in?

868
00:49:13,412 --> 00:49:14,752
Yes, of course. Come in.

869
00:49:22,392 --> 00:49:23,422
What is it?

870
00:49:24,322 --> 00:49:25,322
You want to talk?

871
00:49:29,432 --> 00:49:31,702
The company I interviewed at...

872
00:49:31,702 --> 00:49:33,262
called and offered me the job.

873
00:49:33,962 --> 00:49:35,872
Oh, really? What company is it?

874
00:49:36,232 --> 00:49:37,572
Gwangseong Defense.

875
00:49:37,972 --> 00:49:40,102
They're a famous defense contractor.

876
00:49:42,142 --> 00:49:43,412
Congratulations, little brother.

877
00:49:45,142 --> 00:49:47,042
I will work at the headquarters,

878
00:49:47,112 --> 00:49:48,452
and that's in Ulsan.

879
00:49:49,512 --> 00:49:50,652
When do you start?

880
00:49:50,882 --> 00:49:53,382
The new recruits sign up for training in a week.

881
00:49:53,752 --> 00:49:55,152
The training facility is in Gyeongju.

882
00:49:56,552 --> 00:49:57,822
That's pretty soon.

883
00:50:00,062 --> 00:50:01,892
I'm a bit reluctant to go away...

884
00:50:01,892 --> 00:50:03,392
for training and work...

885
00:50:04,492 --> 00:50:06,032
when the brewery's struggling.

886
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:10,502
That's not right.

887
00:50:11,172 --> 00:50:14,642
You worked hard to find a new job. Of course, you must go.

888
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:16,642
It's okay.

889
00:50:29,252 --> 00:50:32,062
What grudge does she have against us...

890
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:33,922
that she'd do this?

891
00:50:42,172 --> 00:50:45,002
You placed your trust in us without hesitation.

892
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:51,512
Chairman Han, you couldn't be more impressive.

893
00:51:00,082 --> 00:51:01,122
My gosh.

894
00:51:01,722 --> 00:51:04,522
How could she say that to my face?

895
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:07,922
She's so unruly.

896
00:51:17,872 --> 00:51:20,842
I'm aware you donate regularly to support children...

897
00:51:21,102 --> 00:51:22,672
of officers who died on duty.

898
00:51:23,272 --> 00:51:24,572
I've always wanted to meet you.

899
00:51:24,572 --> 00:51:26,612
I'm honored to finally meet you like this, sir.

900
00:51:26,712 --> 00:51:29,152
I only did what I should as a citizen.

901
00:51:29,612 --> 00:51:31,552
This is my company lawyer.

902
00:51:32,482 --> 00:51:33,552
I'm Jeong Jin Seok.

903
00:51:33,752 --> 00:51:34,922
Nice to meet you.

904
00:51:35,552 --> 00:51:37,152
- Shall we sit down? - Sure.

905
00:51:43,132 --> 00:51:45,032
To avoid getting in your way,

906
00:51:45,032 --> 00:51:47,032
I'll keep it short and then leave.

907
00:51:47,602 --> 00:51:48,732
You can speak freely.

908
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:53,742
Well, are you aware of the petition Eagle Brewery launched?

909
00:51:54,172 --> 00:51:55,372
Yes, I am.

910
00:51:55,872 --> 00:51:58,012
It's all over the news,

911
00:51:58,312 --> 00:51:59,542
so I'm watching closely.

912
00:52:00,782 --> 00:52:03,852
Eagle Brewery is one of my suppliers.

913
00:52:04,352 --> 00:52:06,952
Because of the rumor that they used stale rice,

914
00:52:08,052 --> 00:52:11,822
my hotel's caught in the middle, and we're struggling a bit as well.

915
00:52:13,062 --> 00:52:14,162
I see.

916
00:52:14,292 --> 00:52:16,062
That brings me to my point. Of course,

917
00:52:16,062 --> 00:52:18,032
I'm sure you're doing the best you can already,

918
00:52:18,962 --> 00:52:20,502
but I came to ask you...

919
00:52:20,502 --> 00:52:22,532
to speed things up...

920
00:52:22,902 --> 00:52:24,972
and reach a conclusion on that case.

921
00:52:26,372 --> 00:52:27,572
Yes, we should.

922
00:52:27,772 --> 00:52:30,812
We'll take extra care so you don't have to worry.

923
00:52:31,912 --> 00:52:34,912
Our legal team is looking into the issue too.

924
00:52:35,082 --> 00:52:38,552
If we find anything that could aid your investigation, we'll cooperate.

925
00:52:38,782 --> 00:52:39,822
Okay.

926
00:53:03,612 --> 00:53:04,642
Let's hurry.

927
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:07,212
(We promise our country and our people.)

928
00:53:11,822 --> 00:53:13,822
- Let's go. - Yes, sir.

929
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,552
Please wrap it up soon.

930
00:53:16,622 --> 00:53:19,162
Our chief is watching as well.

931
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:20,992
- Right. - Don't worry too much.

932
00:53:21,192 --> 00:53:24,492
Excuse us. We're here to see Detective Kim Jong Hoon.

933
00:53:26,632 --> 00:53:29,172
Are you from Eagle Brewery?

934
00:53:29,472 --> 00:53:30,472
- Yes. - Yes.

935
00:53:30,702 --> 00:53:31,742
Come over here.

936
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:35,542
Do your best work, then.

937
00:53:35,542 --> 00:53:36,672
Sure. Don't worry.

938
00:53:40,242 --> 00:53:41,312
Hello.

939
00:53:41,442 --> 00:53:42,612
Take a seat.

940
00:53:48,922 --> 00:53:51,022
I'm Kim Jong Hoon, the lead detective on the case.

941
00:53:51,352 --> 00:53:52,662
Nice to meet you.

942
00:53:52,692 --> 00:53:55,192
I'm Ma Kwang Sook, the CEO of Eagle Brewery.

943
00:53:57,132 --> 00:53:59,502
I'm Vice-CEO Oh Chun Soo.

944
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:00,562
I see.

945
00:54:02,802 --> 00:54:04,132
Our chief...

946
00:54:04,132 --> 00:54:06,142
told me to speed things up...

947
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:09,342
since it's about food, which is a sensitive topic for the public.

948
00:54:10,542 --> 00:54:13,782
Thank you. Each moment is a loss for us.

949
00:54:13,942 --> 00:54:15,682
- Do your best, please. - Sure.

950
00:54:16,612 --> 00:54:19,052
I read your complaint and saw the security footage...

951
00:54:19,052 --> 00:54:20,622
you handed in.

952
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:24,352
The woman you think is the culprit. Were you able to...

953
00:54:24,352 --> 00:54:25,492
identify her?

954
00:54:26,262 --> 00:54:29,192
A friend of mine owns a convenience store,

955
00:54:29,192 --> 00:54:30,532
and we got a video...

956
00:54:31,092 --> 00:54:32,602
of her buying something there.

957
00:54:33,402 --> 00:54:35,332
I got a copy on a flash drive.

958
00:54:41,342 --> 00:54:42,372
(Receipt)

959
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,042
What's this?

960
00:54:44,112 --> 00:54:47,042
A receipt showing that she made a credit card purchase.

961
00:54:47,412 --> 00:54:49,082
Detective, do you think...

962
00:54:49,712 --> 00:54:51,722
you can use that to identify her?

963
00:54:52,252 --> 00:54:54,022
We can get the details from the store's POS system,

964
00:54:54,022 --> 00:54:55,552
get a warrant,

965
00:54:55,752 --> 00:54:57,492
and ask the card company for her details.

966
00:54:57,892 --> 00:54:59,022
That should do the job.

967
00:55:05,762 --> 00:55:08,062
Shall we check the video first?

968
00:55:18,312 --> 00:55:19,312
Right there.

969
00:55:20,142 --> 00:55:22,582
I'm positive that's the culprit.

970
00:55:24,452 --> 00:55:25,582
She came to the brewery...

971
00:55:25,582 --> 00:55:27,122
for the first time the day we made nuruk.

972
00:55:27,622 --> 00:55:29,522
So many things don't look right.

973
00:55:29,822 --> 00:55:30,822
Really?

974
00:55:49,912 --> 00:55:51,112
Hello?

975
00:55:51,982 --> 00:55:53,242
You don't open today?

976
00:55:54,712 --> 00:55:57,252
Why wouldn't I open today? I will open.

977
00:56:17,572 --> 00:56:18,672
No!

978
00:56:23,542 --> 00:56:25,012
What are you doing here?

979
00:56:26,442 --> 00:56:27,582
I don't know.

980
00:56:28,242 --> 00:56:29,882
Why am I lying here?

981
00:56:40,322 --> 00:56:41,362
Listen.

982
00:56:41,662 --> 00:56:43,492
You said you were here to stand guard,

983
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:45,662
but all you did was sleep all night.

984
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:49,102
You offered me a beer first.

985
00:56:51,202 --> 00:56:53,542
Thank you anyway. You should go now.

986
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:57,112
Okay. I'll get going.

987
00:57:11,252 --> 00:57:12,492
I don't remember anything.

988
00:57:25,502 --> 00:57:28,512
The morning sunlight is really nice.

989
00:57:35,182 --> 00:57:36,782
The air is sweet too.

990
00:57:44,522 --> 00:57:46,022
Once they identify the woman,

991
00:57:47,092 --> 00:57:48,322
things will be settled soon.

992
00:57:48,322 --> 00:57:50,192
So you don't have to worry too much.

993
00:57:50,792 --> 00:57:52,932
Okay. I won't.

994
00:57:54,432 --> 00:57:55,732
Are you going to the brewery?

995
00:57:56,202 --> 00:57:59,002
I will stop by to see Mi Sun on the way.

996
00:57:59,672 --> 00:58:01,402
It seems like she's more worried than I am.

997
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:04,412
Take all the time you want.

998
00:58:04,812 --> 00:58:06,912
We have no delivery to make anyway.

999
00:58:06,912 --> 00:58:09,552
We can't make makgeolli, and everything is on hold.

1000
00:58:10,412 --> 00:58:12,152
They say you should rest when you fall down.

1001
00:58:12,152 --> 00:58:14,022
Let's take this chance and get some good rest.

1002
00:58:30,072 --> 00:58:32,202
(Eagle Brewery)

1003
00:58:40,682 --> 00:58:43,282
(Unrefined Makgeolli, Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

1004
00:58:52,392 --> 00:58:55,362
As someone in the same industry, I was worried, so I came to see you.

1005
00:58:56,862 --> 00:59:00,332
You came to visit every time something big happened.

1006
00:59:00,732 --> 00:59:02,802
As if you were waiting for it to happen.

1007
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:08,642
Let me get straight to the point.

1008
00:59:09,812 --> 00:59:13,512
My offer to buy your brewery is still valid.

1009
00:59:15,412 --> 00:59:17,552
It's not like you're a broken vinyl record,

1010
00:59:17,552 --> 00:59:20,252
but you keep saying the same thing.

1011
00:59:21,552 --> 00:59:24,152
Then I'll have to give you the same answer,

1012
00:59:24,752 --> 00:59:27,492
like a broken vinyl record.

1013
00:59:28,592 --> 00:59:31,492
I'm not interested...

1014
00:59:32,502 --> 00:59:34,702
in that offer at all.

1015
00:59:41,402 --> 00:59:44,342
You can at least negotiate now,

1016
00:59:45,342 --> 00:59:48,652
but if this situation continues,

1017
00:59:48,652 --> 00:59:51,182
you'll end up on the streets.

1018
00:59:54,252 --> 00:59:56,522
When the company is about to go bankrupt,

1019
00:59:57,192 --> 01:00:00,362
why are you so interested in it?

1020
01:00:02,492 --> 01:00:04,892
It's not that I'm interested. I'm just worried...

1021
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:06,462
because of our history.

1022
01:00:09,802 --> 01:00:11,702
You're a true humanist.

1023
01:00:12,372 --> 01:00:14,702
In this fiercely competitive brewing industry,

1024
01:00:15,172 --> 01:00:17,042
a large company like Silla Brewery...

1025
01:00:17,442 --> 01:00:21,312
is worried about Eagle Brewery, which is like a mom-and-pop store.

1026
01:00:27,022 --> 01:00:28,752
For the sake of your employees,

1027
01:00:28,752 --> 01:00:31,422
you will have to think wisely about it.

1028
01:00:31,422 --> 01:00:35,222
Even if I end up on the streets,

1029
01:00:36,192 --> 01:00:37,492
I will have to...

1030
01:00:38,292 --> 01:00:40,332
find the culprit...

1031
01:00:40,932 --> 01:00:42,672
who played petty tricks...

1032
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:44,372
and caused all this mess...

1033
01:00:44,972 --> 01:00:45,972
and...

1034
01:00:47,872 --> 01:00:51,772
do something to teach the person a good lesson.

1035
01:00:59,752 --> 01:01:01,992
Once you lose people's faith in you,

1036
01:01:02,422 --> 01:01:05,292
it will take you several times longer to restore it.

1037
01:01:06,092 --> 01:01:07,862
You will have to keep that in mind.

1038
01:01:09,362 --> 01:01:11,832
I appreciate your continued concern,

1039
01:01:12,932 --> 01:01:15,932
but I'll have to play the broken vinyl record once again.

1040
01:01:17,202 --> 01:01:19,072
I have no intention...

1041
01:01:20,602 --> 01:01:23,242
of selling the brewery at all.

1042
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:27,212
Darn it!

1043
01:01:36,992 --> 01:01:39,722
The brewery is about to go under, but she's still talking big.

1044
01:01:41,022 --> 01:01:42,232
Darn it!

1045
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:44,232
I thought...

1046
01:01:44,232 --> 01:01:46,202
she would hold her hands up and surrender by now.

1047
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,162
She's really something, I must say.

1048
01:01:49,232 --> 01:01:50,372
Just wait and see.

1049
01:01:50,732 --> 01:01:53,242
I'll make her beg me to buy the brewery.

1050
01:01:55,672 --> 01:01:56,672
Darn it.

1051
01:02:17,032 --> 01:02:18,332
What are you doing here?

1052
01:02:19,432 --> 01:02:20,432
Who are you?

1053
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:24,402
Are you Beom Soo?

1054
01:02:26,842 --> 01:02:29,872
I wouldn't recognize you if we met on the street.

1055
01:02:31,072 --> 01:02:32,782
It's been a long time. It's so good to see you.

1056
01:02:33,712 --> 01:02:36,082
I don't think we're close enough to greet each other shaking hands.

1057
01:03:27,532 --> 01:03:30,032
(For Eagle Brothers)

1058
01:03:30,302 --> 01:03:31,502
What does that mean?

1059
01:03:31,502 --> 01:03:33,502
You want me to stop teaching the Zumba dance here?

1060
01:03:33,502 --> 01:03:35,512
No matter what people say, I think you are...

1061
01:03:35,512 --> 01:03:37,712
Wait. Leave the mullet as it is.

1062
01:03:37,712 --> 01:03:39,742
You are the best artist in the world.

1063
01:03:40,712 --> 01:03:42,882
I'm in love with you.

1064
01:03:42,882 --> 01:03:45,722
I can go to your school and humiliate the professor...

1065
01:03:45,722 --> 01:03:47,222
so he can't work there anymore.

1066
01:03:47,222 --> 01:03:49,392
What do I do with all this makgeolli?

1067
01:03:49,922 --> 01:03:50,992
Hello, Mr. Han.

1068
01:03:50,992 --> 01:03:52,822
Bring the makgeolli to the hotel right now.

1069
01:03:52,892 --> 01:03:56,192
I feel bad that I owe you a big favor like this every time.

1070
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:59,462
I'll give you a chance to make it up to me later,

1071
01:03:59,562 --> 01:04:01,732
so you don't have to feel bad.
