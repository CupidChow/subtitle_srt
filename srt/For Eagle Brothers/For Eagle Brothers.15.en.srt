1
00:00:01,310 --> 00:00:03,270
- That was entertaining.
- The pleasure was mine.

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,540
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,540
Thank you for today, Chairman Han.

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,510
What happened today
stays between us, Chairman Kim.

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,420
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,950
Are you all right, sir?

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:16,890
I'm fine.

8
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,160
You took quite the tumble earlier.

9
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,330
I'm worried your back might hurt
since you tweaked it before.

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,000
It sounds like
you want it to hurt again.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,970
Why would you say that...

12
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,410
when I was only voicing my concern?

13
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,010
There's no need for you to worry.

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:36,710
It's nothing.

15
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,150
Don't think of it lightly
just because it doesn't hurt now.

16
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:43,080
You should stop by a clinic
or a pharmacy on your way back.

17
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,050
I literally had a front-row view...

18
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,690
of the fall,

19
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,490
and it was...

20
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,660
bad.

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,760
I'll handle it myself.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,070
Sir, your car is out front.

23
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,240
Let's go.

24
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,440
Don't forget to stop by a clinic.

25
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,490
That ought to teach...

26
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,790
his pompous self a lesson.

27
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,960
(182B 4548)

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,030
- What...
- Oh, no.

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Goodness.

30
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,450
Out of all the people...

31
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,720
Why, out of all the people...

32
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Goodness.

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,800
I had no idea
you'd be this good at golf.

34
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,700
Let's play out on the field
sometime soon.

35
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:10,030
I already told you this.

36
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,670
I don't have the time to play golf.

37
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
Also,

38
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,440
I'm not interested in remarrying.

39
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,080
My late husband is still on my mind,

40
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,010
and I'm busy at the brewery.

41
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,220
I'm not suggesting
we marry right away.

42
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,350
We'll stay friends for now...

43
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,990
and will only marry...

44
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,620
once we become accustomed
to one another...

45
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,460
and trust is built.

46
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:35,760
I'm not interested
in being friends with you.

47
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,430
Sorry?

48
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,500
I have enough on my plate,

49
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,000
having to care
about the people in my life.

50
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,940
The last thing I want
is to add you to that list.

51
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,710
It'll be my job
to care for you instead.

52
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,680
Kwang Sook, all I ask is that
you be by my side.

53
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,880
This isn't something to boast about,

54
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,250
but my late wife suffered
from prolonged cancer,

55
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,090
so nursing has become
my area of expertise.

56
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,420
Once you have your surgery,

57
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,790
I'll look after you
and help at the brewery when I can.

58
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,030
So don't carry
the heavy burden on your own.

59
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,700
Share it with me.

60
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:26,210
I said I needed surgery. I bluffed.

61
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,010
What?

62
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,350
I'm incredibly healthy.

63
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,180
I'm not ill at all.

64
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,560
You mean you lied to me?

65
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,860
My mom forced me
to go on the blind date.

66
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,800
I wasn't interested
in making it work.

67
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:46,930
My gosh.

68
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:50,200
You disliked me to the extent...

69
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,870
that you lied about being ill?

70
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,370
It's not that I didn't like you,
Mr. Park.

71
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:57,940
I don't want to remarry.

72
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,680
If you're offended or hurt,

73
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,450
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,190
You shouldn't toy with people
like that.

75
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,620
How could you?

76
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,530
I apologize.

77
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,030
Gosh, it's stifling.

78
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,690
Thank you for the ride.

79
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,060
(Eagle Brewery)

80
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,060
That's it?

81
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,830
He calls himself macho,
but he's narrow-minded.

82
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,650
Why are you back already?

83
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,780
It's not "already."
I was away for three hours.

84
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,150
When is your next date?

85
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,250
There is no next date.

86
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,490
I left with him
just to grant your wish.

87
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,620
I've met my end of the deal.

88
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:20,930
Don't change your mind now.

89
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:24,460
I talked to Dr. Lee not long ago.

90
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,630
Number Three's a great catch.

91
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,970
He owns his own golf supply store...

92
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,600
and a nice apartment.
He has all a man needs.

93
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,500
Who cares if he's a catch or not?

94
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,010
He has nothing to do with me.

95
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:38,040
I told him clearly that
I wasn't interested in marriage.

96
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,780
Don't get ahead of yourself.

97
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,310
You could've gone
on a few more dates,

98
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,420
but you blabbered and ruined it?

99
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,290
It would've been the same
even after a few more dates.

100
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,890
You rejected him
after just one date.

101
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:52,220
Did you consider
how much that would've hurt...

102
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,490
his heart and ego, you cruel brat?

103
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,130
It's even worse to string him along
when I'm not interested.

104
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,470
You won't find
a guy like him anywhere else.

105
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:04,400
He's rich and handsome
and has a great personality.

106
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,640
He doesn't lack anything.

107
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,370
If you like him that much,
you date him.

108
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,340
Why, you...

109
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,250
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

110
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,820
I'm tired and will rest.
Don't disturb me.

111
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:23,150
He seems to be in a foul mood.

112
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,820
Did something happen today?

113
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,520
Nothing noteworthy happened.

114
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,890
He has been a bit down in general.

115
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,570
They say it's a matter of time
before you humiliate yourself.

116
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,410
Why did we have to meet there?

117
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,080
Darn it.

118
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,850
Oh, darn it.

119
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:51,880
Oh, gosh.

120
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,490
Did I hurt the area
I hurt last time?

121
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,560
My gosh.

122
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,000
Your eyes have sunk.

123
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,860
You didn't sleep?

124
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,130
I can't sleep.

125
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,770
Even if I fall asleep,
I keep waking up.

126
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,410
Oh, boy. This isn't good.

127
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,040
Did you talk to your wife?

128
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,080
I think we need to split up.

129
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,180
I pleaded with her one last time.

130
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,850
She won't even listen.

131
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,190
Her heart's not in it.

132
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,250
It won't be easy on you,

133
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,020
but you must accept reality.

134
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,590
I guess she's right.

135
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,800
We had different views on everything
including life and values.

136
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,770
If she hadn't gone to the US
with Yeoung Ju,

137
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,100
we might have divorced long ago.

138
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,210
(My daughter)

139
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,420
Take it in private.
I'll make us some tea.

140
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,420
Hey, darling.

141
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,020
It's been a while.

142
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,790
I was too busy to call
for a few days.

143
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,760
Do as Mom asks, Dad.

144
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,200
What do you mean?

145
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,640
Mom went to Korea to divorce you.

146
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:22,040
How do you know that, Yeoung Ju?

147
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,110
Mom...

148
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,180
has a boyfriend.

149
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,080
What?

150
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,050
Mom will be furious
to hear I told you,

151
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,090
but I'm telling you for your sake.

152
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,820
Mom's dating the boss
of the diner she works at.

153
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,820
It's been three years.

154
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:42,630
Three years?

155
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,270
It's been three years,
and you're telling me now?

156
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,270
Shouldn't you have told me sooner?

157
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,240
I'm on your side,

158
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,310
but I understand Mom too.

159
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,340
What can you do
if you fall out of love?

160
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,780
How can you be so coolheaded?

161
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,080
I spent all this time
thinking of you and your mom.

162
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,650
How could you do this
to your own dad?

163
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,790
She fell out of love?

164
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,360
Do you think
that explanation solves everything?

165
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,630
Oh, is that the American style
your mom mentioned?

166
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,070
I get it.

167
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,940
I wasn't getting angry.

168
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,370
Thanks for telling me.

169
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,840
Let's talk again.

170
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,710
What's going on?
What did Yeoung Ju say?

171
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,190
My wife...

172
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,690
is seeing someone.

173
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:58,140
If Yeoung Ju told you that,

174
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,540
then it's over.

175
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,240
She won't get away with it.

176
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,450
No.

177
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,650
I'll make her pay.

178
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,650
Chun Soo, calm down.

179
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,860
- Take a deep breath, Chun Soo!
- Let go, Beom Soo.

180
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,660
- Chun Soo! Calm down!
- Don't stop me!

181
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,190
Let go of me, you punk!

182
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,330
Calm down!

183
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,230
Beom Soo.

184
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,030
Beom Soo. I...

185
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,440
I sent her to the US
to look after our kid,

186
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,670
and she's having an affair.

187
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,710
She duped me
and cheated on me for three years!

188
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,710
Chun Soo.

189
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,040
You can't handle this
when high on emotions.

190
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,650
Get a hold of yourself. Please?

191
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,060
What should I do now?

192
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,970
Hey, look at me.

193
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,240
You must stay cool.

194
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,170
Getting worked up won't help at all.

195
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,740
Sit for a while.

196
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,290
Actually,
this made things clearer for you.

197
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,690
It explains her actions.

198
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,920
Do as she asks...

199
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,690
and give up on her.

200
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,360
Otherwise,
you'll only hurt yourself.

201
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,760
No.

202
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,500
I'll keep her by my side
until the day she dies...

203
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,310
and watch her grow old.

204
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,780
Why should I divorce her
so she can be free?

205
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,280
Beom Soo...

206
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,920
Why should I give her
what she wants?

207
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,190
Why...

208
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,910
How do you feel?

209
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,350
A bit better than before.

210
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,080
Let's see.

211
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,990
You don't have a fever.

212
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,190
Oh, dear.

213
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,760
It would've been nice...

214
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:38,700
if you could've gone on a date
and eaten something nice...

215
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,830
while he had come to Seoul for once.

216
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,030
Gyeol was quite upset.

217
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:47,340
Are you more worried about him
than me who's ill?

218
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,270
My goodness.

219
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,080
Are you jealous?

220
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,910
Worrying about Gyeol
is the same as worrying about you.

221
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,510
Se Ri.

222
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,980
Your dad's going to
set a wedding date...

223
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,750
for around the time
Gyeol is discharged.

224
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,190
He'll meet Chairman Han soon.

225
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,590
Mom.

226
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:11,500
I'm too young to get married.

227
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,600
You're not young.

228
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,400
It's a perfect age to get married.

229
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:18,370
Do you want to marry off
your only daughter like that?

230
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,410
It's not like sending you off.

231
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,440
I'm getting a reliable son
like Gyeol.

232
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,850
Gosh, whatever.

233
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,690
Why is she being like this
these days?

234
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,020
(Gold bars, silver bars)

235
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,140
- Are you looking for a ring?
- My goodness.

236
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,610
You startled me.

237
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,440
Is it for Ms. Kim?

238
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,410
Yes.

239
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,680
I'm going to propose to her.

240
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,120
What's the rush?

241
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,990
You need to pace yourself.

242
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,090
Ms. Ji.

243
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,660
Don't mind my business.

244
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:18,100
Just go on your way.

245
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,070
Oh, right.

246
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,900
Seon Ah told me...

247
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,270
that you extended the lease.

248
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,040
Thank you.

249
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,480
You have no reason to thank me.

250
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,150
It's between Ms. Kim and me.

251
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,650
Anyway, let's forget
about the old grudges.

252
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,950
I hope we will have fun together...

253
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,520
as a Zumba dance instructor
and a student.

254
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,690
Okay?

255
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,800
I'll see you at the class.

256
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,640
- Welcome.
- Hello.

257
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,870
I'm looking for a ring for a woman.

258
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,710
Can I take a look at this?

259
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:08,950
And this one.

260
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,380
No. The one next to it.

261
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,420
Sure.

262
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,350
Here. Please take a look.

263
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,460
Oh, my.

264
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,630
It's pure gold.

265
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,400
Gosh, it's a bit pricey.

266
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,940
Hello?

267
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,510
It's me, Detective.

268
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,780
Did you find out anything?

269
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,620
No. I haven't found out
anything big.

270
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,560
I'm interviewing
other business owners...

271
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,890
in the building where Ms. Kim
used to run a piano academy.

272
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,530
We have no time to lose.

273
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,830
Please hurry.

274
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,570
(Eagle Brewery)

275
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,900
Is CEO Ma in there?

276
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,470
She's in the office.

277
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,470
Wait.

278
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,540
When I got drunk the other day,

279
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,080
you carried me on your back.

280
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,980
I know it's a little late,
but thank you.

281
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,990
Well... Now that you mention it.

282
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,090
You're not young anymore.

283
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:30,930
You shouldn't drink yourself
into oblivion like that.

284
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:35,030
I don't usually drink until I drop.

285
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,470
But I was...

286
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,970
- really upset that day.
- Come on.

287
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,670
Even if you are upset,

288
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:43,310
you can't drown your troubles
in your drinks.

289
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,680
What if you sprain your ankle
or something?

290
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,210
You will suffer a great deal
because of your age,

291
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,810
Mother.

292
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,080
You call me "Mother" all the time.

293
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,190
Why am I your mother?

294
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,550
Did I give birth to you?

295
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,420
How much younger than me are you
to act like you're so young?

296
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,560
Do you want to see my ID?

297
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,830
Well, I'm just
calling you like that...

298
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,530
because you're a mother.

299
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,000
Put yourself in my shoes.

300
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,700
If I kept calling you "Father,"

301
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,200
would you like that?

302
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,440
I'm not a father, though.

303
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,410
Hey, Chun Soo.

304
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,080
- We meet again.
- Oh, yes.

305
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,950
Hello.

306
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,780
I'm here, Ms. Gong.

307
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:30,890
What are you trying
to bother my daughter with today?

308
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,430
She's seeing someone?

309
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,060
Where? In the US?

310
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,130
Yes.

311
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,300
I thought that could be the case.

312
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,500
Yeoung Ju told me about it.

313
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,440
Apparently, it's been three years.

314
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,870
My goodness.

315
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,840
Goodness gracious!

316
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,180
This is crazy.

317
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,880
What kind of nonsense is this?

318
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,420
How could she cheat on you
for three years?

319
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,750
She was seeing someone else...

320
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,350
but acted like you were the reason
you two should get a divorce?

321
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,690
My goodness.

322
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,960
How is this even possible? My gosh!

323
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,700
I'm sorry, Chun Soo.
But I have to swear.

324
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,830
That darn...

325
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,370
She deserves a good beating...

326
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:24,880
Darn it!

327
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,110
Chun Soo, just tell me.

328
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,980
I'll do anything you want.

329
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,950
If you want me to slap her
in the face, I'll do that.

330
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:37,150
If you want me to pull out her hair,

331
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,260
I'll make her completely bald.

332
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,360
Just tell me what to do.

333
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,860
I actually feel relieved.

334
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,500
When I didn't know the reason,
I couldn't understand her.

335
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,470
I was flustered and confused.

336
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,400
Now that I know the reason,

337
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,810
everything is clear.

338
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,610
I know.

339
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,980
I thought she was being reckless.

340
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,510
Now it all makes sense.

341
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,250
I'm so sorry.

342
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,650
You heard ridiculous things...

343
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,190
and got insulted.

344
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,690
You don't have to apologize to me.

345
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,690
I said what I wanted to say
without holding back.

346
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:18,100
You know what I'm like.

347
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,130
Your wife...

348
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:25,240
doesn't deserve your love.

349
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,910
Your feelings...

350
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,310
are too good for her.

351
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,580
I'm not saying this
because I'm your sister-in-law.

352
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,180
I'm saying this objectively,
forgetting about our relationship.

353
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,620
Thank you
for always being on my side.

354
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,860
Having you by my side
means a lot to me.

355
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,860
You know what?

356
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,900
No matter the reason,

357
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,700
with no questions asked,

358
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,940
I'll always be on your side.

359
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,540
So...

360
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,470
please hang in there.

361
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,840
Don't be weak.

362
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,650
Okay.

363
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,450
I get it.

364
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,670
Chun Soo.

365
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,240
Hey.

366
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,570
Are you all right?

367
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,470
You should walk while looking ahead.

368
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,470
All right.

369
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:38,740
I should. I will.

370
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,310
Is something wrong?

371
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:43,910
No.

372
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,520
What would be wrong?

373
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,990
I was just thinking.

374
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:51,590
Did you eat? Did you have dinner?

375
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,390
If you didn't,
have some gimbap and ramyeon.

376
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,430
No.

377
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:59,900
Thank you for the offer,
but I don't feel like eating.

378
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,270
I should get going.

379
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,110
Watch out. It's dangerous.

380
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,480
I will. Thank you.

381
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,620
Chun Soo.

382
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,660
Come by whenever you feel like it.

383
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:30,760
You know, this place is open
24 hours a day.

384
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,500
Hang in there.

385
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,480
Are you off to the office?

386
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,010
Yes.

387
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,080
But about that golf bag.

388
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:24,610
Yes?

389
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,420
Take it to storage, please.

390
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,550
You said you'd be golfing often
during the warmer seasons.

391
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,120
That won't happen
for the time being.

392
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,460
- Take it to storage.
- Of course, Chairman Han.

393
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,960
- Have a good day.
- Have a good day.

394
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,870
He's been in a sour mood
since yesterday.

395
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,000
Tell me about it.

396
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,750
(Jang-Kwang Yakju)

397
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,010
It's the newest product
by Eagle Brewery.

398
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,080
A 17-percent yakju was developed...

399
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,950
with Jang-Kwang Makgeolli
as its base.

400
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,430
What's your take on it?

401
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,130
Its sliver of acidity...

402
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:19,800
and a bitter touch at the end...

403
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,840
cleanse the palate.

404
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,180
It's not bad.

405
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,820
The hall and kitchen staff
agree, sir.

406
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,590
We'll place it
as a front-runner for now...

407
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,160
and test products
from other breweries as well.

408
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,510
Should you be doing this
when you just removed your cast?

409
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:59,780
I'm good. My arm's fine.

410
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,610
I thought your good looks
were all you had,

411
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,710
but you know
how to put in the elbow grease.

412
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:07,820
I endured harsher training
while in the navy.

413
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,860
Everyone, how about pizza
for a snack?

414
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,330
That'd be great.

415
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,860
Okay. I'll order, then.

416
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,630
Yes, ma'am.

417
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:29,310
Halt production of the yakju
for the festival?

418
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,710
Is there an issue with our product?

419
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,150
No, I'll head over there
this instant.

420
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,250
Could you please wait? Sure.

421
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,090
Got it.

422
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:48,020
I'm afraid
I have to go by the hotel.

423
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,860
Kim, can you order the pizza?

424
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,360
I won't be gone long.

425
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,100
The hotel must've told her
to hold off on the order.

426
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,240
What's going on?

427
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,640
In here.

428
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:07,340
It's not that your product
won't be served at the festival,

429
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,780
but he suggested
that we make the decision...

430
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:12,680
after we test products
from other breweries.

431
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,280
Who suggested that?

432
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,450
The chairman.

433
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,820
Why is he doing this
out of the blue?

434
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:23,630
The festival will be getting
a lot of media coverage,

435
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,800
so he's doing his due diligence
to prevent any bad rumors.

436
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,230
That's right. It's only a formality,

437
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,930
so don't be too worried.
Just give us some time.

438
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,070
I doubt
there will be any curveballs.

439
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,540
Sure.

440
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:46,520
Ms. Ma.

441
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,850
My gosh! Postmaster.

442
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,190
What brings you here?

443
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:53,460
Am I not allowed in hotels?

444
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,990
That's not what I meant.

445
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,860
I was only kidding.

446
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,870
Soo Hyeon gave birth to a boy
last month.

447
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:05,940
Really? Is she a mom already?

448
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,840
My gosh. Time sure does fly.

449
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,810
I haven't seen her in a while
since the wedding.

450
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,840
She stayed at our place
for her postnatal care...

451
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,680
and then brought
the whole family here yesterday...

452
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,950
to thank her mom.

453
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,320
Is your wife at the hotel, then?

454
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,350
That's right.

455
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:24,290
With our daughter, her husband,
and our grandson.

456
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,460
It'd be nice
to greet her in person...

457
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:29,230
and see Soo Hyeon and her son
while I'm at it.

458
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:31,960
By the way, what brings you here?

459
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:36,300
Our makgeolli
is supplied to this hotel.

460
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,970
Yes, of course.

461
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,440
I saw it on the news,
but it still slipped my mind.

462
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,810
They're on the 15th floor.
Would you like to see them?

463
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,410
I'd love that.

464
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,640
My wife would be elated to see you.

465
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:49,510
She worried about you a lot.

466
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,230
Just a second!

467
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:06,800
Sorry.

468
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,670
Excuse us.

469
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,440
It's been so long.

470
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,710
I missed you dearly.

471
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,440
Same here.

472
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,110
Look at how rough
your skin has become.

473
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:26,780
It breaks my heart.

474
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,120
I'm fine.

475
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,890
As if.

476
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,060
I can tell you're exhausted
by how gaunt you seem.

477
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,160
I said I was fine.

478
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,130
Let me know if you need more money.
I'll try to make it happen again.

479
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:48,300
I'm grateful enough
for your assistance before.

480
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,640
It's not like we're strangers.

481
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,110
Let's be honest.

482
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,180
How else can I help you
if not with your financial problems?

483
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:57,410
I have that kind of juice, you know.

484
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,080
Of course.

485
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,550
You're the best.

486
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:05,690
I'm a man
who only has money to offer.

487
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,790
We'll get talking...

488
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,390
and catch up.

489
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:13,060
Sounds good.

490
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,650
I get that she's a mess,

491
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,780
but how could she do that
with a man...

492
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,050
at a hotel she supplies?

493
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:40,320
No wonder
she's known as a gold digger.

494
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,460
Unbelievable.

495
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,630
Yes?

496
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:47,200
Mr. Chairman.

497
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,130
Is it urgent?

498
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,900
No, sir. Not really.

499
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:54,670
Then, I'll deal with it later.

500
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,610
Yes, sir.

501
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,050
Are you not feeling well?

502
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,010
You seem pale.

503
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,180
No, I'm fine. You can go.

504
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,910
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

505
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,050
Yes, Chairman Han.

506
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,750
I was actually
just about to call you.

507
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,720
I called to say...

508
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:46,520
that the drinks for the festival
must be finalized next week.

509
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,130
You should submit your product
to be tested while we have time.

510
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:53,660
We'll be contacting
your project manager today.

511
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,770
Goodness, you didn't have to
call me in person.

512
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,370
Thank you.

513
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,280
Nice!

514
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,880
What's good about being
one big family, you ask?

515
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:10,980
We push and pull each other along
so that we can grow together.

516
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,950
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

517
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,090
Gather the new product
development team!

518
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,890
Professor, you're here.

519
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,860
Hi, I see you're here early.

520
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,870
Right. The admin office
requested a revision...

521
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,070
on your project report.

522
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,940
Oh, no. You should be diving
into your own studies.

523
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,200
I apologize for all the grunt work.

524
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,840
Don't be.

525
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,570
I'm learning as much as I can,
considering this...

526
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,940
as a way to gather experience.

527
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,480
By the way, shouldn't Ha Ni
see her doctor again?

528
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:42,980
No. She's doing fine.

529
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,520
Babies can suddenly fall ill
and get better instantly.

530
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,720
I'm glad to hear that.

531
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,120
I was worried sick about her.

532
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,520
Would you like to see
what I filmed this morning?

533
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,030
Yes.

534
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,470
Isn't she back to her normal self?

535
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,000
She is.

536
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,840
I'm relieved now that I've seen her.

537
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,740
- By the way, Professor.
- Yes?

538
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,840
Can you send me this video?

539
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,710
This one?

540
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,510
I want to watch it
whenever I miss her.

541
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,120
Having many siblings shows.
You must really like babies.

542
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,860
Yes. Can you send it right away?

543
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,160
Sure thing.

544
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,660
Just a second.

545
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,230
I have it.

546
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,170
She's adorable.

547
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,810
I should get to my class.

548
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,580
- Have a good one, Professor.
- Sure.

549
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,210
You cutie-pie.

550
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,080
I'm going to watch this every day.

551
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,590
Hello?

552
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,120
Hey, did you get some sleep?

553
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,330
I'm fine, so don't worry about me.

554
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,030
I said this yesterday,

555
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,730
but this relationship
is beyond repair...

556
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,170
now that Yeoung Ju
has told you the truth.

557
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,000
Give So Yeon what she wants.

558
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,270
You can start over.

559
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,940
Whatever that may be,
we'll find the answer together.

560
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,380
Got it.

561
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,710
I'll handle this, so don't worry.

562
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,220
We'll talk later.

563
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,160
Yeoung Ju told me.

564
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,270
I don't know
exactly what she told you,

565
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:47,640
but the restaurant owner
is only a good friend.

566
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:52,180
It really wasn't easy for me
during the first few years...

567
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,240
in the US.

568
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:56,350
I had to be everywhere
to care for Yeoung Ju...

569
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,580
but couldn't speak the language.

570
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,580
On top of that,
we weren't living in abundance.

571
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:04,920
He helped and cared for me
whenever things got rough...

572
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,590
I don't want to hear
about your love life.

573
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,660
Don't put it like that.

574
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,200
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

575
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:15,530
Rather than making excuses,

576
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,500
you should ask for my forgiveness.

577
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,800
Your forgiveness?

578
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,510
Why should I
when I did nothing wrong?

579
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,270
As if you need to ask.

580
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,480
You may not believe me,
but it's nothing serious.

581
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,080
It's only a friendship.

582
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,420
Yeoung Ju must've been mistaken
about us, being young and naive.

583
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,450
"Us?"

584
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,150
That's what you chose to hear?

585
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,220
Forget it.

586
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,960
Had you apologized from the heart,

587
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,290
I might've agreed to the divorce.

588
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,260
But no.

589
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,200
I changed my mind.

590
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,670
I won't divorce you.

591
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,070
What?

592
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,840
Date other men and have affairs
in the US for all I care.

593
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,170
I'm not going to set you free.

594
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,780
Are you saying
you'll get your revenge?

595
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,080
I wouldn't be dramatic
and call it that,

596
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,050
but I won't let you be free
from the guilt.

597
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,990
Don't you think you're being petty?

598
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,250
Isn't it better to be petty...

599
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,490
than a cheating spouse?

600
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,390
Chun Soo!

601
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,190
Cheating on me wasn't enough,

602
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,230
but you also had the audacity...

603
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,160
to rob me of alimony
using our daughter as an excuse.

604
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,400
And you call yourself a mother?

605
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,300
Don't talk about me like that!

606
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,570
I'll say this loud and clear.

607
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,600
Why would I divorce you
when it only benefits you?

608
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,270
I won't agree to it.

609
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:31,570
You'll forever be my wife on paper,
so don't you dare...

610
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,010
bring up the possibility
of a divorce as of this moment.

611
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,040
Do you understand?

612
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,820

I missed you too, darling.

616
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,340
Goodness.

617
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,590

(Eagle Brewery)

625
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:04,630
Are you kidding me?

626
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,300
Unbelievable.

627
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,300
Chairman Han.

628
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,470
Hello.

629
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,740
How's your back?

630
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:16,780
Why are you deeply concerned
about my back?

631
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,880
You fell flat on your nose
right in front of me.

632
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,750
And I know
you hurt your back before that.

633
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,790
I only asked out of concern.

634
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,720
Who are you to worry about me?

635
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,460
I'm perfectly fine.

636
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,370
Just a second, sir.

637
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,440
I heard you ordered drinks...

638
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,640
from other breweries
to be tested for the festival.

639
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:45,840
And?

640
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,310
Is it because
you found fault with ours?

641
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,050
Have you always lacked judgment?

642
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,320
Sorry?

643
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:02,660
We, at LX, have a specialized system
when it comes...

644
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,890
to evaluating
and purchasing products.

645
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,060
Why would you ask me
about something that was decided...

646
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,730
according to that system?

647
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:13,600
Asking questions
without respecting boundaries.

648
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,040
Don't you think it's rude?

649
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,940
I asked out of urgency...

650
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,210
and apologize for offending you.

651
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,940
You didn't know better at first.

652
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,350
And now, things are urgent for you.

653
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,880
Making excuses all the time...

654
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,050
and going about your work
in an abnormal way...

655
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,250
is not ideal.

656
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,090
Of course. I'll correct that.

657
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,020
Be careful from now on.

658
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,830
I must ask, sir.

659
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,900
You could've said that
with a smile...

660
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,870
and not with a frown.

661
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,340
When was I frowning?

662
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,370
See?

663
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,380
You're obviously angry,
judging by the tone.

664
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,510
I wasn't taking it up with you
or anything.

665
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:03,020
I only said that out of concern,
so please don't get the wrong idea.

666
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,520
That being said, I recommend...

667
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:10,160
meditation or yoga.

668
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,600
Meditation or yoga?

669
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,940
That's right.
They do wonders when it comes...

670
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,440
to soothing the soul.

671
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:27,340
Don't be concerned
with another's soul.

672
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,310
Take better care of your own.

673
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,350
Navigate your life
with better judgment.

674
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:40,920
Why is he angry all the time?

675
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,740
Unbelievable. Always so prickly.

with Chun Soo's ordeal...

683
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,740

By the way,
if it's a brewery you run,

697
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,800
you must make makgeolli.

for three generations.

That's so cool!

701
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,300
I'm a huge fan of makgeolli.

I see.

703
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,410

about what you told me...

704
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,180
the last time we met.

705
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,380

I'm not sure,
but she seemed sweet and ladylike.

711
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,700
No! That's all a mask.

712
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,010
- A mask?
- Yes.

713
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:15,340
She wears the mask of an angel...

714
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,710

she's a naive gentlewoman.

can see through another woman.

718

She's lying and scheming...

719
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,830
so she can seduce

721
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:39,870
You mean to say
that's how you feel about her,

but you don't have an exact reason?

723
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,840
She ran a piano academy here
for over ten years,

724
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:49,950
but no one knows where she lives...

725
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,180
or what her parents look like.

726
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,850
And I've never seen her
with a friend.

727
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:57,020
Her personal life is veiled.

728
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,360
Wouldn't she keep it that way
because something's fishy?

729
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,130
But why do you care so much...

730
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:09,060
about my brother-in-law's life?

731
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,370
I have a crush on Mr. Oh.

732
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,510
I see...

733
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,310
Okay.

734
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,550
Don't get me wrong.

735
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:28,120
I'm not saying this out of jealousy.

736
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,850
Even if he doesn't get together
with me,

737
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:34,890
we must never let Ms. Kim
date him either.

738
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,630
Kwang Sook.
Can you help me from the sideline?

739
00:42:43,870 --> 00:42:44,930
So...

740
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,040
you don't have a reason.

741
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:53,910
You just don't like her. Is that it?

742
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:00,920
No. Well, it's not just that, but...

743
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:08,290
You're leaving already?

744
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:11,330
We're busy at the brewery,
so I should get back to work.

745
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:17,830
You can't just leave
when you came all this way.

746
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:19,940
What?

747
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:21,600
You must see Ms. Kim...

748
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,870
and teach her a good lesson.

749
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:27,440
What right do I have
to teach her a lesson?

750
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,240
You're Mr. Oh's sister-in-law.

751
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,050
That gives you the right.

752
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:34,750
Forget it. I really have to dash.

753
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:35,880
No.

754
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,920
You can't turn a blind eye...

755
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,160
when Mr. Oh's in danger.

756
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,430
- Okay, I get it.
- Wait.

757
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:46,300
- Darn it. I'm busy. I have to go!
- Wait.

758
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,130
- Bye!
- Oh, no.

759
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,370
Darn it.

760
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:54,500
No way!

761
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,470
Kwang Sook!

762
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,510
(Eagle Brewery)

763
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,870
Kwang Sook!

764
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,480
I have undeniable proof!

765
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,380
"Undeniable proof?"

766
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:06,850
Yes.

767
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,880
(Choi Il Piano)

768
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,950
This woman...

769
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:15,290
It's Ms. Kim.

770
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,460
It is.

771
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:20,430
Hello.

772
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,300
What brought you here?

773
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:26,270
I'd have cleaned the place
if you had called ahead.

774
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:29,710
I was in the neighborhood
to make a delivery.

775
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,110
Oh, my.

776
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:35,210
I had just run out. Thanks.

777
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,280
Take a seat.

778
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,540
Just one photo isn't enough.

779
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:08,980
Until we find proof
that she can't explain away,

780
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,350
keep it a secret for now.

781
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:14,920
Kwang Sook, have some probiotics.

782
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:18,920
Thanks for this.

783
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:25,160
So...

784
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,830
What's this ring for?

785
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,130
Back when I proposed,

786
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,940
I didn't have the money I needed
to get a ring.

787
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,610
Don't move too fast too soon.

788
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,540
Take your time, Heung Soo.

789
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:42,710
Why?

790
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,980
Do you not like Seon Ah, Kwang Sook?

791
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,720
No, it's not that.

792
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,490
I think you feel a bit rushed.

793
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:53,860
Come on.

794
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:57,260
Jang Soo pursued you
as soon as he noticed you.

795
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,990
I'm like him since I'm his brother.

796
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,110
I'm back.

797
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:19,110
What's going on with the festival?

798
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,820
They're not saying
they won't sell our product.

799
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:23,250
It looks like...

800
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:25,950
someone said it wouldn't be fair
unless they gave...

801
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,760
other companies a chance too.

802
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,390
Itinerant vendors...

803
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,730
hang out at fifth-day markets.

804
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,830
Don't worry too much.

805
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:37,630
No one can beat
the taste of our makgeolli.

806
00:46:39,370 --> 00:46:41,640
Who cares? Let's take them on.

807
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,970
Who cares? Let's take them on.

808
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:45,870
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

809
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,850
Kang Soo, you too. Let's do it!

810
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,050
Let's do it.

811
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:57,850
Kwang Sook.

812
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:01,060
Is something wrong?

813
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:05,090
No, nothing's wrong.

814
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,730
It's Chun Soo, isn't it?

815
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,700
I'm worried about him...

816
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,310
and about everyone else.

817
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:22,340
Do you have a girlfriend?

818
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:24,410
No.

819
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:26,880
If you meet someone,

820
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,750
be sure
to introduce her to me first.

821
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:33,320
Once I meet her
and give my seal of approval,

822
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:35,020
you can date her.

823
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,830
Okay. I'll do that.

824
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,630
At least you should find
a good person.

825
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:46,300
Don't worry.

826
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:48,870
I'll find someone just like you.

827
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:52,040
That won't be easy.

828
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,210
Aren't your standards
a bit too high?

829
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:57,080
I'm just like Jang Soo.

830
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,060
You pushed me aside
to focus on your degree.

831
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:11,260
It's great to come out
to shop with you, honey.

832
00:48:11,390 --> 00:48:14,030
Come on. When did I push you aside?

833
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:15,530
You did.

834
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,230
You ignored me and went to class
as soon as you got up.

835
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:22,270
Early on in the semester,
you cried that you'd gotten on...

836
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,270
the professor's bad side
and wanted to quit your studies.

837
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:26,440
What a change.

838
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:31,110
Hey, does your professor
still bully you?

839
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,250
Why would he bully me?

840
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,080
He's a nice person.

841
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:37,790
He's really competent and handsome.

842
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:40,060
Is he?

843
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:43,230
He's not an old pot-bellied man?

844
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,430
He's not pot-bellied. He's slim.

845
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,430
Why did I assume he wasn't?

846
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:57,970
That's adorable.

847
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:00,880
Why would you go in there?
My goodness.

848
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,550
These are so pretty.

849
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,080
Mom, isn't this so cute?

850
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:09,550
Goodness.

851
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:12,890
You're ready to get married...

852
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:14,720
if you're looking at baby stuff.

853
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,060
What size should I get?

854
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,400
You're going to buy that?

855
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:21,730
Yes.

856
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,630
What does a single girl
need that for?

857
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,440
But then, I heard that
if you keep baby clothes at home,

858
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,810
the deity of motherhood
blesses you with a child.

859
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:33,340
It's the best kind of dowry.

860
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:34,980
It's not like that.

861
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,050
She's so sly.

862
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:43,420
- I'll take these two.
- Sure.

863
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:55,160
Honey, I'm home!

864
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,910
My goodness.

865
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,980
You're home early, Mr. Chairman.

866
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,280
- Where's Se Ri?
- I guess she's washing up.

867
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:20,320
I went to a fish market
after meeting with a client.

868
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:22,420
- I bought webfoot octopuses.
- Webfoot octopuses?

869
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:24,550
They're in season now.

870
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:26,760
Let's make something good
and enjoy it.

871
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:31,590
You seem to be in a good mood.
You even bought some food.

872
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,330
We will soon be...

873
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:36,870
supplying our makgeolli to LX Hotel!

874
00:51:39,070 --> 00:51:40,270
What about Eagle Brewery?

875
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,870
That darn Eagle Brewery.

876
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:46,540
I'm Dokgo Tak,
Chairman Han's in-law!

877
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,510
How dare Eagle Brewery
do business with them?

878
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:54,280
Let's grill the webfoot octopuses...

879
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,450
and have a party tonight.
Let's party.

880
00:51:58,350 --> 00:51:59,750
All right.

881
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,320
Let me see.

882
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,090
They look fresh.

883
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,230
This reminds me of the old days.

884
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:12,070
Every spring,
the CEO of the brewery...

885
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:14,870
bought a bucket of webfoot octopuses
at the market and...

886
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:16,840
You and the stories
about the old days again!

887
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,740
How many times
do I have to tell you?

888
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,840
Forget everything
about Eagle Brewery!

889
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,450
Okay.

890
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:27,320
I'll forget all about it. I will.

891
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:32,050
I just wanted to enjoy
some webfoot octopus with my family,

892
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:33,260
but you ruined it.

893
00:52:34,090 --> 00:52:36,090
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

894
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:39,960
Well, I'll make a great sauce...

895
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:41,830
and grill them with it
on the cast iron grill.

896
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:43,060
It'll be delicious.

897
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:44,930
Wait a little, okay?

898
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,270
Let me think.

899
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,410
Should it be gochujang-based...

900
00:52:50,410 --> 00:52:53,140
or soy sauce-based?

901
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:56,610
Gochujang.

902
00:52:56,610 --> 00:52:58,580
Okay. Gochujang, it is.

903
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,550
I got it. Let me take care of it.

904
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:02,250
It will be delicious. Oh, my!

905
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:11,830
(Angel Piano)

906
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,290
Bravo!

907
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:44,390
When did you come?

908
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,530
I just got here.

909
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:57,810
What is this?

910
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,620
My goodness.

911
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,120
I wanted to buy a real diamond,

912
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:14,320
but I couldn't afford it.
It's a cubic zirconia.

913
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,060
Thank you.

914
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,070
When my choreography work
makes a hit,

915
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:26,570
I'll buy you a real diamond
as big as a bean.

916
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:28,840
Give me that.

917
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:43,220
Thank you.

918
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:04,570
(Kwang Sook)

919
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,480
Hello, Kwang Sook.

920
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,780
Did you have dinner?

921
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:12,410
How are you feeling?

922
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,820
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

923
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,420
Come on.

924
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:18,790
You don't have to act tough
around me.

925
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:20,990
I'm not acting tough.

926
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,260
I'm...

927
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:26,630
not getting a divorce.

928
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,830
Did your wife apologize to you
on her knees?

929
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,400
It's not like that.

930
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:35,000
If I get divorced,
it will only do her good.

931
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:36,570
What?

932
00:55:36,870 --> 00:55:38,740
I gave it a second thought.

933
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:42,480
If I divorce her,
I'll look like such a fool.

934
00:55:44,350 --> 00:55:45,980
That may be true,

935
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:49,580
but she doesn't have
feelings for you anymore.

936
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,750
I won't let her have her way
with everything.

937
00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:55,990
I'll make sure she gets criticized
for adultery...

938
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,790
for the rest of her life.

939
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,500
I understand
how you are feeling, but...

940
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,770
Fine.

941
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:13,640
Let's meet up and talk later.

942
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:16,810
Good Night, Chun Soo.

943
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:35,400
(Heung Soo)

944
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,940
He gave her the ring.

945
00:56:50,350 --> 00:56:51,510
Gosh, my head is killing me.

946
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,850
Oh, dear my father.

947
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:03,360
(Eagle Brewery)

948
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,810
This is the new liquor I made.

949
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,150
If you were with me,

950
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,750
you'd be so happy.

951
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:35,390
(Jang-Kwang Yakju)

952
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,890
There's an emergency,

953
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:42,630
so I'm here to talk to you.

954
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:44,600
(The late Oh Jang Soo)

955
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:51,770
Chun Soo is on the verge of divorce,

956
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:56,110
and Heung Soo is in love
with a woman...

957
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:57,610
who's hiding her past.

958
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:02,150
My head is throbbing,
and I have no appetite.

959
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,690
I can't even focus on work
at the brewery.

960
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:10,330
I've been worried only for days,
and it's killing me already.

961
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,060
Jang Soo.

962
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:20,130
You must've been really anxious,

963
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,240
taking care of your brothers
over the years.

964
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,460
(Somang Hall)

965
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:52,630
Hello.

966
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:57,170
Are you here to see your wife?

967
00:59:00,740 --> 00:59:04,510
I just saw my husband
for the first time in a while.

968
00:59:07,450 --> 00:59:10,590
Don't you think
you're being too greedy?

969
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:15,290
Being too greedy?

970
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:17,790
Who?

971
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:19,560
Me?

972
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:22,800
Yes, Ms. Ma Kwang Sook.

973
00:59:25,370 --> 00:59:29,070
Why on earth are you saying
such a thing?

974
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:34,640
While enjoying your life
all you can,

975
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,150
you still want the title
of a loyal wife...

976
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:39,680
who still takes care
of her dead husband.

977
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:43,180
I'm aware...

978
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:46,250
that I've made many mistakes...

979
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:48,320
and caused you a lot of trouble.

980
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,020
I understand that
I'm not in your good books.

981
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:52,830
But don't you think
you're being too rude?

982
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,860
I'm doing my best as a supplier...

983
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,430
for your hotel.

984
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:01,500
I don't know why I have to put up
with this insult.

985
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,710
That's exactly why I'm saying this.

986
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:07,640
Please maintain your dignity
as our supplier.

987
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:10,650
What did I do
not to maintain my dignity?

988
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:13,010
You care about being dignified,

989
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:14,880
and you're being called
a gold digger?

990
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,620
Did you say a gold digger?

991
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:19,120
You mean the kind of gold digger...

992
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,390
who extracts money from men?

993
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:23,760
Yes. That kind of gold digger.

994
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:31,200
I know I'm just one
of your numerous suppliers,

995
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,500
but don't you think
you're being too rude?

996
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:35,040
That's not what I said.

997
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,340
I'm just telling you
what's going around...

998
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:38,870
in the liquor industry.

999
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:41,440
Who on earth said
something like that?

1000
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:45,210
Who is the darn person
that said such filthy nonsense?

1001
01:00:45,210 --> 01:00:47,720
I'll sterilize that vicious tongue
with chlorine bleach!

1002
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:50,650
Why are you asking me?

1003
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:52,620
You just said you heard it.

1004
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,660
Tell me where you heard it from!

1005
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,390
You don't have to get so worked up.

1006
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:59,930
I saw it with my own eyes yesterday.

1007
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,070
What exactly did you see?

1008
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:10,340
Forget it.

1009
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:14,140
It's too foul to even put in words.

1010
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:17,910
Don't leave
until you're done talking!

1011
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:19,450
What on earth did you see?

1012
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,680
What did you see?

1013
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:28,460
You...

1014
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,990
followed a man into a hotel room.

1015
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:36,130
I saw you two in the elevator,

1016
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:37,630
so don't think about lying.

1017
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:41,600
How could you show
such a lack of judgment...

1018
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:44,240
at the hotel
where you supply your makgeolli?

1019
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:48,080
It's been so long.

1020
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:50,380
I missed you dearly.

1021
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:52,410
We'll get talking...

1022
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,920
and catch up.

1023
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:58,250
Unbelievable.

1024
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:00,050
That man...

1025
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,330
Chairman Han, he...

1026
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:19,370
What on earth is this?

1027
01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:21,010
He is...

1028
01:02:25,010 --> 01:02:26,250
Look here, Ms. Ma.

1029
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:28,320
He is...

1030
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:26,440
(For Eagle Brothers)

1031
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:27,880
You seem to be in a good mood.

1032
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:30,510
There was a person
I was annoyed with,

1033
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:32,650
but I taught her
a small lesson today.

1034
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:33,710
Yes, Detective.

1035
01:03:33,710 --> 01:03:35,050
Did you find something?

1036
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:37,190
In a nutshell, Ms. Kim...

1037
01:03:37,490 --> 01:03:39,550
is living a double life.

1038
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,760
If Chun Soo had married Mi Sun,

1039
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:44,260
he wouldn't have turned out
this way.

1040
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:46,990
Chun Soo wouldn't act
on dark thoughts, would he?

1041
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:50,160
Did your sister-in-law
say anything about me?

1042
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,530
No, sir. She only said...

1043
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:53,600
she was supplying makgeolli
to the hotel.

1044
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:55,340
I have good news.

1045
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,640
Good.

1046
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:58,770
"Good." Is that all you have to say?
