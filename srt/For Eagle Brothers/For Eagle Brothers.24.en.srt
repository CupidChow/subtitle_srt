1
00:00:01,531 --> 00:00:03,231
It's been a long time. It's so good to see you.

2
00:00:04,161 --> 00:00:06,501
I don't think we're close enough to greet each other shaking hands.

3
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:22,981
That arrogant jerk.

4
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:25,251
I'm much older than him. How dare he reject a handshake?

5
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:27,351
Who is he, Mr. Dokgo?

6
00:00:27,591 --> 00:00:28,861
The fourth brother of Eagle Brewery.

7
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:31,760
They must've spoiled him rotten for being the smart one.

8
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:33,991
That would explain why he's such a brat.

9
00:00:35,831 --> 00:00:37,400
How is it that...

10
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:39,300
there isn't a single decent person in this family?

11
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:40,301
Kwang Sook.

12
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:41,901
Goodness.

13
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:43,601
Beom Soo.

14
00:00:43,602 --> 00:00:45,241
Why is that punk, Dokgo Tak, here?

15
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:47,570
Did you run into him?

16
00:00:47,571 --> 00:00:49,381
Yes. Just now, outside the front gate.

17
00:00:50,481 --> 00:00:52,850
Whenever there's an issue with the brewery,

18
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:54,781
he shows up offering to buy it.

19
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:56,751
He offered to buy the brewery?

20
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:59,251
I'm so sick of him that I want nothing to do with him,

21
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:01,651
but he's ridiculously persistent.

22
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,091
Being brazen is one thing,

23
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:07,061
but how can he even mention buying this brewery?

24
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:08,761
After what he did to us?

25
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:10,131
Beom Soo, you're here.

26
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:11,561
Hey, Chun Soo.

27
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:15,771
Why are you worked up? Is something wrong?

28
00:01:16,341 --> 00:01:19,771
Well, Dokgo Tak offered to buy the brewery from Kwang Sook.

29
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:24,011
That vile pig.

30
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:25,780
Don't let it get to you.

31
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:27,980
He's right. Don't let him bother you.

32
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:29,081
Darn.

33
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:30,221
Don't you have classes today?

34
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:32,750
I was worried, so I stopped by on the way to the university.

35
00:01:32,751 --> 00:01:33,791
Have a seat.

36
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:41,731
Yes, this is Ma Kwang Sook.

37
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:44,131
Right.

38
00:01:46,031 --> 00:01:47,031
Sorry?

39
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,371
What do you mean by that?

40
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:52,041
You're unable to extend my loan?

41
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,671
How so?

42
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:58,311
But I haven't missed a single payment so far.

43
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:02,581
I don't care whether the main office ordered it.

44
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:05,821
I'll head to the bank right now.

45
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,321
- What was that? - Kwang Sook?

46
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:10,121
I think I should head to the bank now.

47
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:11,621
What did they say?

48
00:02:12,491 --> 00:02:14,461
That they're unable to extend the maturity on my loan.

49
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:16,931
I have to pay it all back by the end of the month.

50
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:19,571
I'll get going, then.

51
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:25,740
We cross mountains and survive crashing waves...

52
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:26,971
only to face them once again.

53
00:02:31,611 --> 00:02:34,380
A detective has been assigned to the stale rice case...

54
00:02:34,381 --> 00:02:35,620
of Eagle Brewery.

55
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:36,981
The investigation is now underway.

56
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:38,651
I'm glad to hear that.

57
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:42,161
How are cases like these typically handled?

58
00:02:42,221 --> 00:02:43,360
From what I hear,

59
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:45,061
the brewery has substantial evidence.

60
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:47,761
It won't be too hard to catch who framed them.

61
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:51,000
However, it will take some time...

62
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:52,970
to determine the motive...

63
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:54,601
and identify others who were involved.

64
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:55,841
I see.

65
00:02:56,001 --> 00:02:57,170
The main concern...

66
00:02:57,171 --> 00:02:59,241
is whether the victims can endure this storm.

67
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:01,010
In many cases,

68
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:02,310
the victims end up bankrupt...

69
00:03:02,311 --> 00:03:03,511
even if the police arrest the culprit.

70
00:03:03,811 --> 00:03:05,011
Time is of the essence.

71
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:06,751
I see.

72
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:09,920
Attorney Jeong, can you continue to handle this case?

73
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:13,021
Of course. I'll keep you updated, sir.

74
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:25,231
What do I do with all that makgeolli?

75
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,701
It'd be a waste to throw them away.

76
00:03:39,051 --> 00:03:41,380
Right. It's been a while.

77
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:43,121
I hope everything has been going well.

78
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:46,320
Can't you put in a good word for me?

79
00:03:46,321 --> 00:03:47,521
Fine.

80
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,220
But he clearly doesn't want the job.

81
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:50,961
Gyeol, please.

82
00:03:52,461 --> 00:03:53,461
Lieutenant Oh.

83
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:02,970
Congratulations on completing your service, Mr. Han.

84
00:04:02,971 --> 00:04:04,071
Thanks.

85
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:05,271
It seems...

86
00:04:05,272 --> 00:04:07,311
that you've completely adjusted to civilian life now.

87
00:04:08,911 --> 00:04:09,911
Is that so?

88
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:12,041
You turned me down last time,

89
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:14,611
so I came with reinforcements.

90
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:17,981
I heard you turned down her job offer.

91
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:21,150
Bom was devastated.

92
00:04:21,151 --> 00:04:22,691
That's not it.

93
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,190
When Bom offered me the job,

94
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:27,631
I hadn't gotten anywhere with my other interviews.

95
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,360
I couldn't accept the job offer,

96
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:32,401
knowing that I wasn't a valuable member of society.

97
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:35,031
It didn't feel right.

98
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:38,041
That's why I couldn't give her an answer.

99
00:04:38,741 --> 00:04:39,771
I see.

100
00:04:40,711 --> 00:04:42,711
Do you still feel the same way?

101
00:04:46,381 --> 00:04:49,251
Since then, I've been offered a job at Gwangseong Defense.

102
00:04:49,921 --> 00:04:50,950
Hang on.

103
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:53,291
Isn't that a well-known defense contractor?

104
00:04:53,891 --> 00:04:56,091
It's a dream job for anyone who served in the military.

105
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:58,520
I probably got lucky.

106
00:04:58,521 --> 00:04:59,831
Hardly.

107
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:03,061
You're worthy of the job and qualified.

108
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:06,431
Wait, does that mean...

109
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:16,310
I feel like getting that job offer...

110
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:19,110
confirmed that I'm a valuable member of society...

111
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,351
with something to contribute.

112
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:25,451
Does your initial offer still stand?

113
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:28,351
Of course.

114
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:32,091
I hope we get along, then.

115
00:05:33,591 --> 00:05:34,631
Really?

116
00:05:35,091 --> 00:05:36,861
I hope we get along as well.

117
00:05:38,461 --> 00:05:39,631
Nice!

118
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,071
It's me, Mr. Park.

119
00:05:48,311 --> 00:05:49,341
I saw the news.

120
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:51,511
You must be extremely stressed out.

121
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:54,311
Yes, emotionally and physically.

122
00:05:54,911 --> 00:05:56,551
It's been driving me crazy.

123
00:05:57,981 --> 00:06:00,391
That's actually why I called.

124
00:06:01,851 --> 00:06:04,191
Could you help me just once more?

125
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:05,591
How much do you need?

126
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,691
Kwang Sook's here.

127
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:10,531
How...

128
00:06:11,131 --> 00:06:12,231
How did it go?

129
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:13,571
What did they say?

130
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:15,600
It was decided during the board meeting...

131
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:17,001
at the head office.

132
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:20,641
I'm afraid there's nothing the branch can do about it.

133
00:06:21,611 --> 00:06:24,611
My guess is that the news spooked them.

134
00:06:26,381 --> 00:06:27,981
This isn't chump change, though.

135
00:06:28,411 --> 00:06:29,451
What do we do?

136
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:32,350
I reached out to my former postmaster...

137
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:34,491
to ask for an additional loan,

138
00:06:34,991 --> 00:06:38,061
but the post office has been strict about loans lately,

139
00:06:38,661 --> 00:06:40,231
so it won't be easy.

140
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:43,700
I'm a first-year professor, so it won't be much,

141
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:45,030
but I'll see if I can take out a loan...

142
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:46,371
from places like the Teachers' Credit Union.

143
00:06:46,771 --> 00:06:48,130
Thank you, Beom Soo.

144
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:49,341
It'll all work out, Kwang Sook.

145
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:53,740
I have to be in classes soon, so I should get going.

146
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:54,741
Hurry on out.

147
00:06:55,841 --> 00:06:57,311
Hello.

148
00:06:58,681 --> 00:06:59,681
What brings you here?

149
00:07:00,311 --> 00:07:01,981
- Detective? - Right.

150
00:07:02,651 --> 00:07:04,021
We're here to examine the scene.

151
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:06,150
The chief took an interest in the case...

152
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:08,791
and assigned additional officers, so we'll do our best.

153
00:07:08,851 --> 00:07:10,021
Thank you so much.

154
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:11,860
Why don't we start...

155
00:07:11,861 --> 00:07:13,130
- where the rice is stored? - Sure.

156
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:14,531
- I'll lead the way. - Okay.

157
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:23,241
My gosh!

158
00:07:32,611 --> 00:07:35,081
Something huge could've happened!

159
00:07:41,691 --> 00:07:42,721
Hello.

160
00:07:46,961 --> 00:07:47,961
Mr. Oh.

161
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:49,531
I see you don't have any customers.

162
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:54,571
I came to be clear about something.

163
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:58,971
Nothing happened between us last night, right?

164
00:08:03,311 --> 00:08:04,411
Right.

165
00:08:05,211 --> 00:08:06,780
Nothing happened.

166
00:08:06,781 --> 00:08:07,781
Good.

167
00:08:07,951 --> 00:08:09,220
It could be confusing,

168
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:10,721
so I came to make that clear.

169
00:08:12,151 --> 00:08:13,691
As it has been so far,

170
00:08:14,051 --> 00:08:17,021
I'm your Zumba instructor, and you're my student.

171
00:08:17,621 --> 00:08:18,661
Okay?

172
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:22,961
Okay.

173
00:08:23,631 --> 00:08:24,631
Right.

174
00:08:29,641 --> 00:08:30,641
(Culture Center Officer)

175
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,071
It's the culture center.

176
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,911
Hello, Officer. How have you been?

177
00:08:39,711 --> 00:08:42,111
Pardon? What does that mean?

178
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:44,521
You want me to stop teaching the Zumba dance here?

179
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:46,391
How can you say that?

180
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:48,951
You missed two classes without calling ahead.

181
00:08:49,191 --> 00:08:51,561
A few days ago, you missed one because you were hurt.

182
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:54,830
The disgruntled members are complaining nonstop.

183
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:57,431
I make no excuse for going AWOL.

184
00:08:58,361 --> 00:09:00,201
I'll meet with the members to apologize...

185
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:04,701
There are a few members who support you,

186
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:08,241
but most of them want to learn from a new instructor.

187
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:11,711
We found someone to take over starting next week.

188
00:09:12,141 --> 00:09:13,911
- Already? - Yes.

189
00:09:14,411 --> 00:09:15,981
I'm sure you'll find another opportunity.

190
00:09:17,581 --> 00:09:19,221
Wait, Officer!

191
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:50,081
Get up, Mr. Oh.

192
00:09:52,521 --> 00:09:54,491
What happened has happened.

193
00:09:55,121 --> 00:09:56,921
Let's be strong and accept it.

194
00:09:58,721 --> 00:10:00,891
Take my hand and get up.

195
00:10:09,941 --> 00:10:12,541
(Cultural Center)

196
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:20,051
Come on.

197
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:22,211
There's no need to cry.

198
00:10:23,651 --> 00:10:24,851
Don't cry.

199
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,651
Ms. Kim left,

200
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:30,761
and I lost my job.

201
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:35,831
Why does nothing work for me?

202
00:10:41,471 --> 00:10:44,700
We all experience breakups...

203
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:46,741
and lose jobs as we make our way in life.

204
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:51,911
It's nothing at all.

205
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:55,611
Don't you cry. Stop now.

206
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,700
The brewery manager and I...

207
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:20,171
check the rice storage together every morning,

208
00:11:20,271 --> 00:11:22,641
so no one could take a video like that.

209
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,641
Detectives, please catch the culprit as soon as you can.

210
00:11:25,811 --> 00:11:28,150
Now that I've seen the rice and nuruk storage rooms,

211
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:30,181
it looks more likely that the video was faked.

212
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:32,950
While we're here, we'll drop by the convenience store...

213
00:11:32,951 --> 00:11:34,690
and check a few more things.

214
00:11:34,691 --> 00:11:36,461
Please help us out, detectives.

215
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:56,011
Don't be too nervous. Everything will work out.

216
00:11:56,141 --> 00:11:58,981
Right. Thanks for everything.

217
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:02,951
They'll catch the culprit for sure. Let's not worry too much.

218

(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli, Eagle Brewery)

219
00:12:11,661 --> 00:12:12,961
What do I do...

220
00:12:13,831 --> 00:12:15,091
with all this makgeolli?

221
00:12:36,011 --> 00:12:38,351
How am I to cover the loan?

222
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:41,821
My gosh.

(LX Hotel Chairman Han Dong Seok)

224
00:12:53,701 --> 00:12:56,201
Hello, Mr. Han. Why did you call?

225
00:12:56,941 --> 00:12:58,001
Where are you?

226
00:12:58,801 --> 00:13:00,011
I'm at the brewery.

227
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:03,541
I found a place that will take the makgeolli that was returned.

228
00:13:04,111 --> 00:13:05,981
Bring the makgeolli to the hotel right now.

229
00:13:07,011 --> 00:13:08,151
Right now?

230
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:16,591
Your car's not here yet. I'll call your driver, Mr. Kim.

231
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:19,021
Don't. Someone else is picking me up.

232
00:13:20,531 --> 00:13:21,561
Hey.

233
00:13:22,591 --> 00:13:23,701
Take care.

234
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:27,030
Mr. Han.

235
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:29,171
(Eagle Brewery)

236
00:13:29,331 --> 00:13:30,341
Here we go.

237
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:37,141
Drive on.

238
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:38,781
Okay.

239
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:52,491
Where are we going, Mr. Han?

240
00:13:53,961 --> 00:13:57,601
This man worked as a driver for my family for almost 40 years.

241
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:00,470
After retiring, he moved to the countryside...

242
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:01,801
to grow fruit.

243
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:03,841
I see.

244
00:14:04,271 --> 00:14:05,901
I remembered him saying...

245
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:07,340
he used makgeolli...

246
00:14:07,341 --> 00:14:10,981
instead of chemical fertilizers in his orchard.

247
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:14,081
He uses makgeolli instead of chemical fertilizers?

248
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:17,081
I looked it up online.

249
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:19,620
Makgeolli is full of amino acids,

250
00:14:19,621 --> 00:14:21,650
organic acids, and vitamins,

251
00:14:21,651 --> 00:14:23,821
which help the trees grow healthier.

252
00:14:23,991 --> 00:14:27,330
Trees that are given makgeolli bear fruit...

253
00:14:27,331 --> 00:14:28,931
that are 0.5 to 1 Brix sweeter.

254
00:14:29,461 --> 00:14:32,561
What's good for people must be good for trees too.

255
00:14:34,101 --> 00:14:36,940
I called, and he said he was too short-staffed...

256
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:39,270
to collect the makgeolli himself.

257
00:14:39,271 --> 00:14:42,041
- I offered to bring it to him. - My goodness.

258
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:45,011
I could make the trip on my own, then.

259
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:47,881
Why?

260
00:14:48,481 --> 00:14:50,251
You don't want to travel with me?

261
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:53,921
It's not that.

262
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:56,620
You're used to nice cars.

263
00:14:56,621 --> 00:15:00,431
You're probably uncomfortable in a truck like this.

264
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:03,930
It's not my first time,

265
00:15:03,931 --> 00:15:05,731
so it's not too uncomfortable.

266
00:15:07,931 --> 00:15:11,301
Thank you for looking out for me, Mr. Han.

267
00:15:12,941 --> 00:15:14,271
To be honest,

268
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:17,411
what you did yesterday and today touched me.

269
00:15:20,651 --> 00:15:22,451
I'd been meaning...

270
00:15:22,611 --> 00:15:25,521
to pay the guy a visit as I hadn't seen him in a while.

271
00:15:25,751 --> 00:15:27,251
Don't get too emotional.

272
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:29,320
Even so, I'm touched.

273
00:15:29,321 --> 00:15:32,191
You're a busy man with lots to do,

274
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:35,191
and you're doing all this to help just one supplier.

275
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:36,531
That can't be easy.

276
00:15:39,501 --> 00:15:42,371
You're like a tsundere.

277
00:15:44,271 --> 00:15:45,840
Don't be silly.

278
00:15:45,841 --> 00:15:47,671
(Tsundere: Someone who is gruff but reveals a warmer side)

279
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:04,160
- Go back inside. - What?

280
00:16:04,161 --> 00:16:05,460
Don't go to school.

281
00:16:05,461 --> 00:16:06,530
Mom.

282
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:08,390
You don't need an MBA.

283
00:16:08,391 --> 00:16:09,530
Quit the program.

284
00:16:09,531 --> 00:16:11,500
Why are you being like this?

285
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:13,431
You don't go there to study.

286
00:16:13,531 --> 00:16:14,930
You're going there to date someone.

287
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:16,640
Why would you put it like that?

288
00:16:16,641 --> 00:16:18,071
Am I wrong?

289
00:16:18,441 --> 00:16:21,071
Answer me. Did I make that up?

290
00:16:27,781 --> 00:16:29,721
Yelling at you out of anger...

291
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:32,181
upsets me too.

292
00:16:32,651 --> 00:16:33,691
But...

293
00:16:34,321 --> 00:16:36,051
you're my only daughter,

294
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:38,591
and you've fallen for a loser. You're so lost now.

295
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:42,030
Shouldn't I stay strong and alert to stop you as your mother?

296
00:16:42,031 --> 00:16:43,861
My professor isn't as weird...

297
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:45,801
or bad as you think.

298
00:16:45,831 --> 00:16:48,300
If you keep this up, I can go to your school...

299
00:16:48,301 --> 00:16:51,200
and humiliate the professor so he can't work there anymore.

300
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:53,340
- Mom! - Do you think I can't?

301
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:54,840
Don't you dare!

302
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:57,481
Get a grip if you don't want things to get that far!

303
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,901
Sit down.

304
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:18,561
Forget it.

305
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:20,731
I don't have time for a new hairdo.

306
00:17:21,071 --> 00:17:22,870
When you need a change,

307
00:17:22,871 --> 00:17:25,441
nothing beats getting your hair done.

308
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:31,481
Just give me a trim, then.

309
00:17:32,381 --> 00:17:33,711
Let me see.

310
00:17:38,121 --> 00:17:39,621
Leave the mullet as it is.

311
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,791
- Why? - That mullet is...

312
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:44,891
Oh Heung Soo's trademark.

313
00:17:45,121 --> 00:17:47,831
That's why people say you're old-fashioned.

314
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:49,761
This went out of fashion long ago.

315
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:51,861
No, wait.

316
00:17:52,431 --> 00:17:54,531
- What is it now? - The mullet is...

317
00:17:54,831 --> 00:17:56,671
the symbol of my youth.

318
00:17:57,901 --> 00:18:00,871
Youth? You'd pass for a middle-aged guy.

319
00:18:01,271 --> 00:18:03,311
No, stop.

320
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:04,581
Stop, please.

321
00:18:06,011 --> 00:18:07,051
What is it now?

322
00:18:07,451 --> 00:18:09,851
Then don't cut off the whole thing.

323
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:11,521
Leave half of it.

324
00:18:15,891 --> 00:18:18,321
No! My mullet!

325
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:20,731
Stop!

No!

What did you do?

328
00:18:32,171 --> 00:18:33,241
Did you cut it all off?

329
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:36,341
It won't look good if you leave half behind.

330
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:44,021
Are you crying?

331
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:48,321
My youth...

332
00:18:48,891 --> 00:18:49,991
and my love.

333
00:18:51,591 --> 00:18:53,061
They are all gone...

334
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,361
with my hair?

335
00:18:58,031 --> 00:18:59,561
How pathetic.

You'll be refreshed.

340
00:19:11,141 --> 00:19:12,910
Just give it a lick and a promise.

341

I never give things a lick and a promise.

Even without a hair treatment,

344

your hair will look voluminous...

345

What do you think? Do you like it?

348
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:45,411
Yes.

349
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:48,511
You just shampooed my hair, but my hair got softer.

350
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:50,651
And I feel refreshed too.

your dark past has been cut off too.

353
00:19:57,921 --> 00:20:00,490
So, you should pull yourself together...

354
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:03,161
and start anew from this moment.

355
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:04,831
Okay?

Okay, I'll call a taxi now. I'll be right there.

Why did the agency call you?

362

I choreographed for an idol group a few days ago,

363
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:35,930

Oh, right. Ms. Ji.

370
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:55,051
Can I borrow some money for the taxi?

371
00:20:56,751 --> 00:20:58,051
Of course.

372
00:21:00,651 --> 00:21:01,721
Here.

373
00:21:02,391 --> 00:21:04,091
Thank you. I'll pay you back later.

374
00:21:05,791 --> 00:21:06,791
Wait.

375
00:21:08,661 --> 00:21:09,691
Mr. Oh!

376
00:21:12,101 --> 00:21:13,161
Good luck!

377
00:21:14,871 --> 00:21:16,870

Oh, there he is.

385
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:11,878
Hello.

386
00:22:14,178 --> 00:22:17,178
Thank you for taking the trouble of coming such a long way.

387
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:18,918
Have you been doing well?

388
00:22:19,018 --> 00:22:21,618
My wife has a bad knee,

389
00:22:22,388 --> 00:22:24,187
so she went to our daughter's house...

390
00:22:24,188 --> 00:22:25,287
to get artificial joint surgery.

391
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:27,488
Oh, no. Is that so?

This is the CEO of the brewery.

393
00:22:31,458 --> 00:22:34,368
Hello. I'm Ma Kwang Sook from Eagle Brewery.

394
00:22:35,298 --> 00:22:36,338
Hello.

395
00:22:37,068 --> 00:22:40,838
My gosh. Thank you so much for the precious makgeolli.

396
00:22:41,438 --> 00:22:43,978
I should've picked them up myself from your brewery,

397
00:22:44,478 --> 00:22:46,107
but I've been so busy...

398
00:22:46,108 --> 00:22:47,608
with the pollination work lately.

399
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:49,817
Pollination work?

400
00:22:49,818 --> 00:22:51,517
Yes. These days,

401
00:22:51,518 --> 00:22:53,788
the number of bees and butterflies has decreased,

402
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:55,917
so we have to hand-pollinate the flowers...

403
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:57,957
by applying pollen manually.

404
00:22:57,958 --> 00:22:59,458
It's called hand-pollination.

405
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:02,098
I see.

406
00:23:02,358 --> 00:23:05,297
Some volunteers came here earlier...

407
00:23:05,298 --> 00:23:06,768
and helped us out a little,

408
00:23:07,328 --> 00:23:10,498
but there's still a long way to go before the work is done.

409
00:23:12,768 --> 00:23:14,307
Now that we're here,

410
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:16,108
why don't we help them out a little?

411
00:23:19,178 --> 00:23:21,048
- What? - Yes.

412
00:23:41,828 --> 00:23:44,538
You can apply it gently like this.

413
00:23:45,168 --> 00:23:46,708
Can you do that?

414
00:23:46,808 --> 00:23:48,038
Of course.

415
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:51,678
All right, then. Please try it slowly and have fun.

416
00:23:52,408 --> 00:23:55,877
I'll go and water down the makgeolli.

417
00:23:55,878 --> 00:23:57,077
- All right. - Okay.

418
00:23:57,078 --> 00:23:58,518
Please go ahead.

419
00:24:02,218 --> 00:24:04,518
All right. Shall we begin?

420
00:24:04,718 --> 00:24:05,828
Wait.

421
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:11,628
Put this on. The sunlight is really strong.

422
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:13,097
Gosh, I don't need it.

423
00:24:13,098 --> 00:24:14,528
Just put this on.

424
00:24:14,628 --> 00:24:16,298
We're alone, so it's okay.

425
00:24:16,568 --> 00:24:18,438
Wait, no.

426
00:24:19,168 --> 00:24:20,408
Hang on. I'm really fine.

427
00:24:20,808 --> 00:24:21,868
Come on.

428
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:27,308
Why are you laughing?

429
00:24:28,548 --> 00:24:30,248
You look too good in that hat.

430
00:24:32,048 --> 00:24:34,148
Let's stop talking and get to work.

431
00:24:37,118 --> 00:24:38,118
Okay.

432
00:24:46,628 --> 00:24:50,498
My gosh. You're really good at this.

433
00:24:50,838 --> 00:24:52,408
This is no big deal.

434
00:24:54,238 --> 00:24:56,508
You should give it a try. I'll help you.

435
00:24:57,008 --> 00:24:58,008
Okay.

436
00:24:59,378 --> 00:25:00,378
All right.

437
00:25:02,678 --> 00:25:05,218

438
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,547

439
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:08,788
You're good.

440
00:25:09,658 --> 00:25:12,288
Make sure it doesn't stick together. Sprinkle it gently.

The pear boy and the pear girl are getting married today.

442

What? You have one on your cheek. Right here.

445

No, not that side.

Here.

448
00:26:42,008 --> 00:26:45,718
Well, I didn't want it to get into your eye.

449
00:26:46,748 --> 00:26:50,118
Then shall we start working again?

00:27:37,598 --> 00:27:38,938
It's me, Ok Ja.

454
00:27:39,238 --> 00:27:40,638
Hey, it's been a while.

455
00:27:41,338 --> 00:27:42,407
What's this call about?

456
00:27:42,408 --> 00:27:44,308
Would you be interested in a part-time job?

457
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,048
A part-time job?

458
00:27:47,548 --> 00:27:48,578
Doing what?

- Goodness. - My gosh.

461
00:27:55,388 --> 00:27:56,388
Come on in.

462
00:27:56,389 --> 00:27:58,188
- Is this your store? - Yes.

463
00:27:58,588 --> 00:28:01,228
It sure is nice to have money.

464
00:28:02,088 --> 00:28:04,027
How is it that you never age?

465
00:28:04,028 --> 00:28:05,668
Have you been secretly taking preservatives?

466
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:07,498
My gosh. As if.

467
00:28:08,368 --> 00:28:09,597
- Great. - Please have some tea.

468
00:28:09,598 --> 00:28:10,868
Thanks.

469
00:28:11,468 --> 00:28:12,838
- Thank you. - No problem.

470
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:14,568
- Have some. - Sure.

471
00:28:22,008 --> 00:28:24,918
Something urgent came up, and I need to leave the country.

472
00:28:25,318 --> 00:28:28,048
Could you look after my store for me for about a year?

473
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:30,888
- Me? - Yes.

474
00:28:31,588 --> 00:28:34,658
There's another part-timer, so you won't have to do much.

475
00:28:34,728 --> 00:28:37,328
Just make sure the store is run smoothly.

476
00:28:37,358 --> 00:28:39,498
And there won't be fixed office hours.

477
00:28:40,628 --> 00:28:42,098
- How sweet. - I know.

478
00:28:42,398 --> 00:28:44,698
I can't offer you a generous salary, though.

479
00:28:44,898 --> 00:28:46,368
It'll be more like extra pocket money.

480
00:28:47,568 --> 00:28:48,638
Then...

481
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:51,608
pay me a year's worth up front, and I'll think about it.

482
00:28:52,948 --> 00:28:53,978
LX Fashion?

483
00:28:54,808 --> 00:28:58,448
Didn't you say you got a job at Gwangseong Defense?

484
00:28:59,848 --> 00:29:01,988
It didn't feel right to leave home and move to Ulsan.

485
00:29:02,518 --> 00:29:04,117
I thought about my options,

486
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:05,688
and I think LX Fashion is the best fit for me.

487
00:29:07,028 --> 00:29:10,028
Planning and marketing is something I've been wanting to learn about.

488
00:29:10,658 --> 00:29:13,128
Planning and marketing at a fashion company?

489
00:29:13,298 --> 00:29:15,738
It'll be competitive and challenging with a lot of work.

490
00:29:17,868 --> 00:29:19,938
I doubt it'll be as challenging as the training out at sea.

491
00:29:23,478 --> 00:29:24,538
Of course.

492
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,848
Hearing that multiple companies want to work with my brother...

493
00:29:28,008 --> 00:29:29,578
makes me very happy.

494
00:29:39,588 --> 00:29:41,228
She's not at the office today either.

495
00:29:47,498 --> 00:29:49,137
- Hello, Professor. - Hello, Professor.

496
00:29:49,138 --> 00:29:50,138
Come on in.

00:29:51,568 --> 00:29:53,038

It seems as though something important came up.

499
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:59,478
It may not be ideal, but let's get it done without her.

500
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:00,578
- Sure. - Sure.

501
00:30:04,878 --> 00:30:07,487
You must be upset since it looks like I'm throwing away...

502
00:30:07,488 --> 00:30:08,688
your precious makgeolli.

503
00:30:10,218 --> 00:30:12,958
You're not throwing anything away. It's being received.

504
00:30:13,488 --> 00:30:14,488
Sorry?

505
00:30:15,428 --> 00:30:18,158
The trees will enjoy my makgeolli...

506
00:30:18,698 --> 00:30:20,568
and bear delicious fruit.

507
00:30:21,968 --> 00:30:23,497
I don't see that as throwing anything away.

508
00:30:23,498 --> 00:30:24,898
The trees are receiving it.

509
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,548
The makgeolli...

510
00:30:34,908 --> 00:30:37,078
was carefully made with good ingredients.

511
00:30:37,648 --> 00:30:41,088
So, enjoy the makgeolli and bear delicious fruit.

512
00:30:52,698 --> 00:30:54,267
I'll go and get some more makgeolli.

513
00:30:54,268 --> 00:30:55,368
Sure.

514
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:56,838
Let me help you.

515
00:30:58,498 --> 00:31:00,708
It's fine. I do this all the time.

516
00:31:01,238 --> 00:31:02,678
I won't be gone long!

517
00:31:11,618 --> 00:31:13,718
She has the heart of an angel.

518
00:31:15,148 --> 00:31:16,658
Is that how you see her?

519
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:19,288
Yes. I know it's not my place to say this,

520
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,558
but she reminds me...

521
00:31:22,228 --> 00:31:24,728
of the late Mrs. Han...

522
00:31:25,528 --> 00:31:27,068
whom I used to serve.

523
00:31:29,298 --> 00:31:30,438
Do you really mean that?

524
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:34,208
As if I'd lie at this age.

525
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:41,108
You need someone like her by your side.

526
00:31:41,908 --> 00:31:44,178
Someone who lights up everyone around her...

527
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:45,618
and also makes them feel at ease.

All right.

532
00:32:04,698 --> 00:32:07,908
I also like how you light up whenever she's around.

533
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:10,378
- Me? - That's right.

534
00:32:10,938 --> 00:32:12,778
I've known you for a long time...

535
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:16,348
ever since your father was alive.

536
00:32:16,948 --> 00:32:21,018
But I've rarely seen you this relaxed and comfortable.

537
00:32:31,898 --> 00:32:33,398
Wait. Watch out!

538
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:34,767
Careful.

539
00:32:34,768 --> 00:32:35,897
- My gosh. - Watch out.

540
00:32:35,898 --> 00:32:37,867

541

- A photo? - Yes.

547
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:58,058
You should take a photo...

548
00:32:58,288 --> 00:33:00,328

Okay.

551
00:33:15,738 --> 00:33:16,808
All right.

552
00:33:18,278 --> 00:33:19,478
Here we go.

553
00:33:20,178 --> 00:33:22,278
Cheese.

554
00:33:23,148 --> 00:33:25,477
Chairman Han, your expression is too stiff.

555
00:33:25,478 --> 00:33:27,048
You should smile.

556
00:33:27,518 --> 00:33:30,018
I'll take it again. Please smile.

557
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:32,218
Here we go.

558
00:33:32,488 --> 00:33:34,758
Cheese.

559
00:33:45,738 --> 00:33:47,737
I appreciate the hard work you did today.

560
00:33:47,738 --> 00:33:49,207
Oh, please. It was nothing.

561
00:33:49,208 --> 00:33:51,308
Thank you for letting us enjoy the flowers.

562
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:53,448
Please take care.

563
00:33:55,678 --> 00:33:56,717
Once again, thank you...

564
00:33:56,718 --> 00:33:58,778
for bringing me your precious makgeolli.

565
00:33:59,188 --> 00:34:00,818
When I harvest in the fall,

566
00:34:01,348 --> 00:34:02,518
I'll send you a batch.

567
00:34:04,218 --> 00:34:05,587
- We should get going. - Sure.

568
00:34:05,588 --> 00:34:07,588
- Take care, then. - Please get home safely.

569
00:34:09,228 --> 00:34:10,298
Just a second.

570
00:34:11,158 --> 00:34:12,298
I'll drive us back.

571
00:34:12,698 --> 00:34:13,728
You?

572
00:34:14,728 --> 00:34:15,728
But...

573
00:34:19,868 --> 00:34:21,008
All right.

574
00:34:26,508 --> 00:34:27,508
My gosh.

575
00:34:29,748 --> 00:34:32,888
(Eagle Brewery)

576
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:42,528
It's not too late to swap seats.

577
00:34:42,598 --> 00:34:44,028
You should pull over.

578
00:34:44,758 --> 00:34:47,397
I only offered to drive because I thought this seat...

579
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:48,828
would be more comfortable.

580
00:34:48,898 --> 00:34:50,298
There's no reason to feel guilty.

581
00:34:51,098 --> 00:34:54,168
It feels wrong to be in your debt all the time.

582
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:57,738
I'll give you a chance someday to pay back what you owe,

583
00:34:57,978 --> 00:35:00,048
so don't feel too guilty.

584
00:35:01,648 --> 00:35:04,878
As if someone like you would need anything from me...

585
00:35:05,678 --> 00:35:07,848
that might lead to asking for favors.

586
00:35:11,758 --> 00:35:12,828
Do I seem...

587
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:16,858
like I have everything the world can offer?

588
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:20,898
Yes.

589
00:35:21,298 --> 00:35:22,998
You have it all.

590
00:35:26,068 --> 00:35:29,208
I guess you can say I have almost everything.

591
00:35:31,008 --> 00:35:32,908
But there's one thing I don't have.

592
00:35:33,848 --> 00:35:35,278
What's that?

593
00:35:37,618 --> 00:35:38,648
Maybe later.

594
00:35:39,148 --> 00:35:41,348
I'll tell you when it feels like the right time.

595
00:35:54,628 --> 00:35:55,628
Wait.

596
00:35:56,638 --> 00:35:57,668
This song.

597
00:36:00,638 --> 00:36:01,708
That's right.

598
00:36:02,268 --> 00:36:03,978
We listened to it together last time.

599
00:36:08,108 --> 00:36:10,048
You should get some sleep while listening to this song.

600
00:36:10,118 --> 00:36:11,618
I'm sure today was exhausting.

601
00:36:13,418 --> 00:36:14,548
Then...

602
00:36:14,788 --> 00:36:18,018
I'll just take a ten-minute nap.

603
00:36:41,948 --> 00:36:43,948
(ENT specialist, Han Gyeol)

604
00:36:48,718 --> 00:36:50,057
It'd be nice to relax and enjoy your days...

605
00:36:50,058 --> 00:36:51,217
as newlyweds.

606
00:36:51,218 --> 00:36:52,828
What do you mean as newlyweds?

607
00:36:56,428 --> 00:36:57,998
Have you proposed to her yet?

608
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:00,868
I'll make it happen soon. Wait just a little longer.

609
00:37:06,868 --> 00:37:08,738
A penny for your thoughts?

610
00:37:10,708 --> 00:37:11,708
Thanks.

611
00:37:15,408 --> 00:37:17,618
How's the wedding proposal coming along?

612
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:19,018
What?

613
00:37:19,518 --> 00:37:21,518
Weren't you going to pop the question this weekend?

614
00:37:23,418 --> 00:37:25,418
Right. And I will.

615
00:37:38,668 --> 00:37:40,108
Yes, Professor.

616
00:37:40,268 --> 00:37:42,607
You skipped the class and didn't come to work,

617
00:37:42,608 --> 00:37:44,478
so I was worried if you were sick.

618
00:37:47,778 --> 00:37:49,008
Professor.

619
00:37:49,478 --> 00:37:51,278
Could you please meet me?

620
00:37:51,818 --> 00:37:52,818
Now?

621
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:54,318
Yes, now.

622
00:37:54,748 --> 00:37:56,217
Sure. I'm in my office, so...

623
00:37:56,218 --> 00:37:58,418
No, not in your office.

624
00:37:58,718 --> 00:38:00,258
I'd like to see you outside the office.

625
00:38:12,238 --> 00:38:13,568
You didn't come to the class...

626
00:38:14,168 --> 00:38:15,938
and even missed the meeting, so I was worried.

627
00:38:17,038 --> 00:38:18,378
I wondered if something was wrong.

628
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:25,018
After I ran out of your place like that,

629
00:38:26,818 --> 00:38:29,488
I couldn't bring myself to see your face.

630
00:38:31,888 --> 00:38:33,188
I was on edge that day.

631
00:38:34,128 --> 00:38:35,787
When your professor is sick,

632
00:38:35,788 --> 00:38:37,628
you can pay him a visit to see if he's okay.

633
00:38:38,058 --> 00:38:40,568
I am extremely sensitive when it comes to issues like that,

634
00:38:41,098 --> 00:38:42,328
so I overreacted.

635
00:38:49,238 --> 00:38:51,208
You were not overreacting.

636
00:38:54,348 --> 00:38:55,408
I...

637
00:38:56,008 --> 00:38:57,378
I'm in love with you.

638
00:38:59,218 --> 00:39:00,218
What?

639
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:06,828
I wasn't sure about my feelings at first,

640
00:39:07,788 --> 00:39:09,088
but everything is clear now.

641
00:39:10,198 --> 00:39:11,698
It's true that I have...

642
00:39:12,828 --> 00:39:13,828
feelings for you.

643
00:39:16,028 --> 00:39:18,838
You're crossing the line here.

644
00:39:19,868 --> 00:39:21,007
I'll cross the line.

645
00:39:21,008 --> 00:39:23,638
No. I'm a professor, and you are my student.

646
00:39:24,508 --> 00:39:26,948
How could a student have feelings for her professor?

647
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:28,847
I'm not a teenager.

648
00:39:28,848 --> 00:39:30,578
I'm a graduate student.

649
00:39:30,818 --> 00:39:31,917
I'm an adult.

650
00:39:31,918 --> 00:39:33,248
And I'm a father.

651
00:39:33,848 --> 00:39:35,547
A divorced one at that.

652
00:39:35,548 --> 00:39:37,418
That doesn't matter to me at all.

653
00:39:40,828 --> 00:39:41,828
Forget it.

654
00:39:42,998 --> 00:39:44,927
It's nonsense that we're having this conversation.

655
00:39:44,928 --> 00:39:45,958
Let's drop this.

656
00:39:48,728 --> 00:39:50,568
It took me a lot of courage to say this.

657
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:52,667
Before saying no,

658
00:39:52,668 --> 00:39:54,238
please think about it again.

659
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:58,408
As you know,

660
00:39:59,808 --> 00:40:02,808
I've just regained my stability after going through a stormy time.

661
00:40:03,548 --> 00:40:05,078
I don't want to experience...

662
00:40:05,878 --> 00:40:07,348
another whirlwind of emotions.

663
00:40:08,188 --> 00:40:11,017
So are you being emotionally stirred because of me?

664
00:40:11,018 --> 00:40:12,088
That's enough.

665
00:40:13,258 --> 00:40:15,057
I've never thought of you as a woman.

666
00:40:15,058 --> 00:40:16,457
You should think about it now.

667
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:17,498
No.

668
00:40:17,598 --> 00:40:19,568
I have no intention of considering it at all.

669
00:40:20,028 --> 00:40:21,068
Professor.

670
00:40:21,398 --> 00:40:22,797
If you say something like this one more time,

671
00:40:22,798 --> 00:40:24,137
I won't see you again.

672
00:40:24,138 --> 00:40:25,598
And I'll fire you as my teaching assistant.

673
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:28,608
I'll get going first.

674
00:40:59,868 --> 00:41:00,868
Where's Se Ri?

675
00:41:01,068 --> 00:41:02,938
She went out to meet Gyeol.

676
00:41:03,538 --> 00:41:04,538
Oh, right.

677
00:41:05,078 --> 00:41:07,748
What's happening to Eagle Brewery?

678
00:41:07,978 --> 00:41:09,777
Isn't it obvious?

679
00:41:09,778 --> 00:41:11,248
It will be shut down.

680
00:41:12,218 --> 00:41:14,088
Is it that bad?

681
00:41:14,588 --> 00:41:16,417
They won't be able to make...

682
00:41:16,418 --> 00:41:19,258
even a penny with that very name in this country.

683
00:41:21,788 --> 00:41:22,828
Oh, right.

684
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,398
Do you know who I saw today?

685
00:41:26,498 --> 00:41:29,128
The fourth son of Eagle Brewery, Beom Soo.

686
00:41:29,798 --> 00:41:33,168
What? How did you see Beom Soo?

687
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:34,967
I went to Eagle Brewery earlier today...

688
00:41:34,968 --> 00:41:36,038
and ran into him there.

689
00:41:36,608 --> 00:41:39,007
Just because he was smart,

690
00:41:39,008 --> 00:41:41,707
Mr. Oh spoiled him when he was little,

691
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:45,678
so that brat is really arrogant and impudent.

692
00:41:46,718 --> 00:41:49,448
That shameless punk with no sense of manners.

693
00:41:50,388 --> 00:41:52,258
Why did you go to Eagle Brewery?

694
00:41:52,558 --> 00:41:54,027
It is going under soon,

695
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:55,327
so I'm trying to take it over.

696
00:41:55,328 --> 00:41:57,897
You promised me you wouldn't mess with them.

697
00:41:57,898 --> 00:42:00,398
I'm not messing with them!

698
00:42:00,568 --> 00:42:01,897
The brewery is going down,

699
00:42:01,898 --> 00:42:03,937
so I'm offering a good deal to take it over.

700
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:04,938
I'm doing something nice here.

701
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,668
Why do you say I'm messing with them?

702
00:42:09,008 --> 00:42:10,508
My goodness.

703
00:42:16,047 --> 00:42:18,407
(Eagle Brewery)

704
00:42:21,406 --> 00:42:24,036
Thank you for driving all the way here.

705
00:42:24,576 --> 00:42:25,746
It's no big deal.

706
00:42:26,276 --> 00:42:28,176
You also went through a lot today.

707
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,015
Thanks to you,

708
00:42:30,016 --> 00:42:32,115
I could get rid of the returned makgeolli...

709
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,546
and got to see the flowers too.

710
00:42:35,156 --> 00:42:37,986
I could forget about all the trouble and refresh myself.

711
00:42:40,326 --> 00:42:41,696
I'm glad you did.

712
00:42:43,096 --> 00:42:45,296
I'll get going, then.

713
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:50,436
Ms. Ma.

714
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:56,106
Good night.

715
00:43:21,426 --> 00:43:25,306
(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

716
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,546
- You're home, Dad. - Hey.

717
00:43:38,176 --> 00:43:41,046
Oh, my. I smell something delicious.

718
00:43:41,716 --> 00:43:42,815
I'm making doenjang soup...

719
00:43:42,816 --> 00:43:44,716
with shepherd's purse and wild chives.

720
00:43:45,056 --> 00:43:46,926
A soup with shepherd's purse and wild chives? Sounds nice.

721
00:43:49,826 --> 00:43:52,466
He seems to be in a really good mood.

722
00:43:52,566 --> 00:43:53,566
I know.

723
00:43:53,567 --> 00:43:55,466
I guess something good happened to him today.

724
00:43:58,866 --> 00:43:59,866
What?

725
00:44:19,586 --> 00:44:20,926
I'm home.

726
00:44:22,396 --> 00:44:24,395
I haven't seen you all day.

727
00:44:24,396 --> 00:44:26,066
Where have you been?

728
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:28,396
Well, I went to an orchard.

729
00:44:28,636 --> 00:44:30,436
An orchard? Why?

730
00:44:30,936 --> 00:44:33,535
I went to get rid of the returned makgeolli.

731
00:44:33,536 --> 00:44:35,406
Did you go with your brothers-in-law?

732
00:44:35,576 --> 00:44:37,276
No, with Chairman Han.

733
00:44:38,136 --> 00:44:39,246
Chairman Han?

734
00:44:40,306 --> 00:44:41,445
The chairman of the hotel?

735
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:42,476
Yes.

736
00:44:42,916 --> 00:44:46,485
The thing is, a man who used to be his driver...

737
00:44:46,486 --> 00:44:50,015
started a fruit farm in the countryside after he retired,

738
00:44:50,016 --> 00:44:51,186
so he took me there.

739
00:44:51,716 --> 00:44:52,756
Thank goodness!

740
00:44:53,226 --> 00:44:54,986
My dear Almighty Lord.

741
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:57,155
Thank you so much!

742
00:44:57,156 --> 00:44:58,326
Thank you!

743
00:45:00,896 --> 00:45:04,236
All the hardships are finally over, Kwang Sook.

744
00:45:05,166 --> 00:45:06,266
What are you talking about?

745
00:45:07,366 --> 00:45:09,836
I've been having this feeling for a while,

746
00:45:09,876 --> 00:45:11,206
but now I'm certain.

747
00:45:11,406 --> 00:45:12,446
What?

748
00:45:12,646 --> 00:45:14,146
I'm sure...

749
00:45:14,676 --> 00:45:16,616
Chairman Han has feelings for you.

750
00:45:17,476 --> 00:45:19,316
Here you go again. Seriously!

751
00:45:19,886 --> 00:45:21,516
Will you come to your senses?

752
00:45:21,616 --> 00:45:22,915
Why would he have feelings for me...

753
00:45:22,916 --> 00:45:24,355
when he has nothing left to wish for?

754
00:45:24,356 --> 00:45:26,155
A man who's got everything like him...

755
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,455
would blindly fall in love without weighing things.

756
00:45:29,456 --> 00:45:31,965
That's such an overinflated ego.

757
00:45:31,966 --> 00:45:33,365
There's no cure for that!

758
00:45:33,366 --> 00:45:34,766
Think about it.

759
00:45:34,826 --> 00:45:37,935
If he isn't interested in you at all,

760
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:39,465
why would he take time out of his busy schedule...

761
00:45:39,466 --> 00:45:40,635
to go out of town with you?

762
00:45:40,636 --> 00:45:42,876
- We're his supplier... - Come on.

763
00:45:43,406 --> 00:45:44,875
Stop that nonsense.

764
00:45:44,876 --> 00:45:47,475
This has nothing to do with you being one of his suppliers.

765
00:45:47,476 --> 00:45:49,045
If he didn't care about you,

766
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:51,046
he wouldn't do you a favor like that.

767
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:54,216
Just a few days ago, he let you stay...

768
00:45:54,546 --> 00:45:56,785
in the room right next to his in the hospital.

769
00:45:56,786 --> 00:45:58,016
It was the VIP room, at that.

770
00:45:58,386 --> 00:46:00,255
That's because...

771
00:46:00,256 --> 00:46:02,155
the accident happened while I was working at the hotel.

772
00:46:02,156 --> 00:46:03,395
Forget the hotel.

773
00:46:03,396 --> 00:46:05,696
Even if it happened somewhere way more important,

774
00:46:05,866 --> 00:46:07,896
who'd arrange for you to stay in the VIP room?

775
00:46:08,296 --> 00:46:09,296
Does it make sense to you?

776
00:46:10,696 --> 00:46:13,405
Whatever. Stop the nonsense.

777
00:46:13,406 --> 00:46:16,106
You silly thing. How foolish you are.

778
00:46:16,536 --> 00:46:19,845
Chairman Han keeps sending signals,

779
00:46:19,846 --> 00:46:22,675
but you are not taking the hint.

780
00:46:22,676 --> 00:46:23,716
Mom.

781
00:46:23,846 --> 00:46:26,346
Don't say anything like that to others, okay?

782
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,146
They will think you have dementia.

783
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:30,285
Don't wait for me. Just go to bed!

784
00:46:30,286 --> 00:46:31,756
I'm going to the brewery.

785
00:46:34,226 --> 00:46:37,656
Why is she going to the brewery when there's nothing she can get?

786
00:46:38,256 --> 00:46:41,326
She might become the wife of a hotel chairman.

787
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,295
Oh, that would be lovely!

788
00:46:44,296 --> 00:46:45,436
Wouldn't it?

789
00:46:47,336 --> 00:46:48,536
What's this about?

790
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:54,576
We're close enough to have a coffee together.

791
00:46:55,076 --> 00:46:57,116
Get straight to the point.

792
00:46:57,446 --> 00:47:00,485
The brewery's like a hornet's nest that got poked hard,

793
00:47:00,486 --> 00:47:01,886
and I have to get back.

794
00:47:02,216 --> 00:47:04,186
That's why I asked to see you.

795
00:47:04,416 --> 00:47:05,925
I heard you used insect-ridden rice.

796
00:47:05,926 --> 00:47:07,486
What on earth happened?

797
00:47:08,026 --> 00:47:09,725
You'd never do such a thing.

798
00:47:09,726 --> 00:47:11,026
We wouldn't.

799
00:47:11,526 --> 00:47:13,896
Why would we, when our conscience is what kept us going?

800
00:47:14,366 --> 00:47:15,666
The day we made our nuruk,

801
00:47:16,296 --> 00:47:17,996
the sweet old ladies...

802
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:20,065
brought along a young woman who said...

803
00:47:20,066 --> 00:47:22,106
she wanted to learn how to make nuruk.

804
00:47:23,976 --> 00:47:25,406
Did that woman...

805
00:47:25,706 --> 00:47:27,846
make a fake video about you?

806
00:47:27,906 --> 00:47:29,076
Yes.

807
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:31,946
The old ladies don't know her name...

808
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:33,516
or where she lives.

809
00:47:35,756 --> 00:47:36,786
Wait.

810
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:40,386
Why are you so interested?

811
00:47:44,796 --> 00:47:46,566
How could I not care?

812
00:47:48,996 --> 00:47:50,596
Kang Soo's there.

813
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,936
I thought you had zero conscience left...

814
00:47:56,506 --> 00:47:58,876
when you took our money and left with the former manager.

815
00:48:00,206 --> 00:48:01,706
I had put aside my conscience,

816
00:48:02,216 --> 00:48:03,646
but I'm still a mother.

817
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,756
Hearing you say that gives me a weird feeling.

818
00:48:10,386 --> 00:48:12,286
I had no choice back then.

819
00:48:14,156 --> 00:48:16,596
His dad died in an accident at a construction site,

820
00:48:17,596 --> 00:48:19,626
and I gave birth three days later.

821
00:48:20,866 --> 00:48:23,066
I could never have managed as a single mom.

822
00:48:30,076 --> 00:48:31,876
(Eagle Brewery)

823
00:48:48,626 --> 00:48:50,156
You like Mi Sun.

824
00:48:50,656 --> 00:48:52,865
- Don't be silly. - You do.

825
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:54,126
- I do not. - What?

826
00:48:58,066 --> 00:48:59,105
There's a baby.

827
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:00,936
(Eagle Brewery)

828
00:49:01,136 --> 00:49:03,875
The old owner of Eagle Brewery was a good man,

829
00:49:03,876 --> 00:49:05,546
and his sons were all close.

830
00:49:06,006 --> 00:49:08,606
The whole neighborhood knew that.

831
00:49:09,316 --> 00:49:11,046
Rather than living with me,

832
00:49:12,486 --> 00:49:15,286
I thought he'd grow up in a much better environment...

833
00:49:15,486 --> 00:49:16,856
if he were with them.

834
00:49:23,756 --> 00:49:26,096
I missed Kang Soo so much...

835
00:49:27,626 --> 00:49:29,866
that I went to the brewery every day.

836
00:49:30,236 --> 00:49:32,536
(Office)

837
00:49:33,666 --> 00:49:36,476
I haven't had that many jobs,

838
00:49:36,906 --> 00:49:38,476
but if you give me any task...

839
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:40,646
Please help me.

840
00:49:40,976 --> 00:49:42,846
That's how I got the job.

841
00:49:44,046 --> 00:49:46,515
Go to sleep

842
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:49,715
I looked after Kang Soo in my free time.

843
00:49:49,716 --> 00:49:51,485
My dear baby

844
00:49:51,486 --> 00:49:53,886
When the owner and the staff weren't looking,

845
00:49:54,986 --> 00:49:56,726
I even suckled him.

846
00:50:03,896 --> 00:50:06,966
Never a day goes by that I don't think about him.

847
00:50:07,906 --> 00:50:09,976
You know that. You were there.

848
00:50:10,336 --> 00:50:12,746
And you returned that favor with betrayal?

849
00:50:13,306 --> 00:50:15,715
How could you think of disappearing with our funds?

850
00:50:15,716 --> 00:50:18,576
I live with the guilt and shame.

851
00:50:19,186 --> 00:50:20,745
I mean it, Ja Dong.

852
00:50:20,746 --> 00:50:22,485
I have no time to listen to this.

853
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:23,586
Wait.

854
00:50:28,156 --> 00:50:29,756
You must need some funds.

855
00:50:30,656 --> 00:50:31,826
Take this.

856
00:50:33,726 --> 00:50:36,135
- Are you taunting me now? - Ja Dong.

857
00:50:36,136 --> 00:50:37,536
Our CEO...

858
00:50:37,866 --> 00:50:40,406
would rather become homeless than take your money.

859
00:50:42,936 --> 00:50:44,136
You came to the wrong person.

860
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:07,726
Yes, Mr. Park.

861
00:51:09,336 --> 00:51:13,206
How much can I borrow, then?

862
00:51:16,036 --> 00:51:17,036
I see.

863
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:20,246
Don't worry.

864
00:51:20,376 --> 00:51:21,906
I'll ask someone else.

865
00:51:22,576 --> 00:51:24,746
Okay. I'll be in touch.

866
00:51:31,186 --> 00:51:32,356
He can't get the loan?

867
00:51:35,326 --> 00:51:37,756
It looks almost impossible.

868
00:51:50,206 --> 00:51:52,946
It's not much, but spend it where it's needed.

869
00:51:53,776 --> 00:51:54,976
(Daehan Bank)

870
00:51:57,646 --> 00:51:59,346
No, Kang Soo.

871
00:52:08,896 --> 00:52:09,956
Take it.

872
00:52:13,996 --> 00:52:16,096
I gave most of it to So Yeon as alimony,

873
00:52:16,496 --> 00:52:17,666
so there's not much left.

874
00:52:20,506 --> 00:52:23,236
(Daehan Bank)

875
00:52:25,606 --> 00:52:26,906
I'm not sure...

876
00:52:27,646 --> 00:52:30,216
if I want to owe you money.

877
00:52:30,676 --> 00:52:31,716
You won't owe us.

878
00:52:32,416 --> 00:52:33,946
That's almost hurtful to hear.

879
00:52:36,416 --> 00:52:37,556
Thank you.

880
00:52:40,226 --> 00:52:42,556
It's hardly enough. What do we do now?

881
00:52:45,126 --> 00:52:46,796
We still have a few days.

882
00:52:47,226 --> 00:52:50,166
If I keep asking around, we'll find a solution.

883
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:07,846
I wonder if things went well at the agency.

884
00:53:17,256 --> 00:53:18,296
Hello?

885
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:20,866
Are you drunk?

886
00:53:24,136 --> 00:53:26,306
Mr. Oh, I'll come in.

887
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:34,546
You can't drink soju without a snack.

888
00:53:34,976 --> 00:53:36,716
What on earth happened?

889
00:53:44,886 --> 00:53:47,556
Did it not work out at the agency?

890
00:53:49,656 --> 00:53:50,856
They said...

891
00:53:51,756 --> 00:53:53,496
my moves were just too old.

892
00:53:55,496 --> 00:53:57,196
In front of kids half my age,

893
00:53:57,436 --> 00:53:59,235
I was treated like a has-been.

894
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,536
I was humiliated.

895
00:54:01,306 --> 00:54:02,336
What?

896
00:54:03,536 --> 00:54:06,706
I had put my everything into this choreography.

897
00:54:09,176 --> 00:54:10,876
But it was for nothing.

898
00:54:11,846 --> 00:54:13,316
It's not like...

899
00:54:13,386 --> 00:54:15,756
it's the only agency in the country.

900
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:18,056
They're all the same.

901
00:54:18,486 --> 00:54:19,886
I don't stand a chance.

902
00:54:20,456 --> 00:54:21,726
I'm done for.

903
00:54:25,496 --> 00:54:26,496
Darn it.

904
00:54:31,066 --> 00:54:34,136
Do they all have an eye ailment or something?

905
00:54:34,666 --> 00:54:37,435
How could they not recognize...

906
00:54:37,436 --> 00:54:39,406
Winners' backup dancer, Oh Heung Soo?

907
00:54:42,346 --> 00:54:44,376
How do you know I was Winners' backup dancer?

908
00:54:44,616 --> 00:54:46,316
I never told anyone in class.

909
00:54:48,946 --> 00:54:52,116
I'm a Jang Mi.

910
00:54:53,826 --> 00:54:54,826
"Jang Mi?"

911
00:54:55,726 --> 00:54:58,996
Jang Mi. That was the name of your fan club.

912
00:55:00,266 --> 00:55:01,996
I had a fan club?

913
00:55:02,466 --> 00:55:03,765
You did.

914
00:55:03,766 --> 00:55:06,506
There were as many as seven members.

915
00:55:09,476 --> 00:55:11,536
We met when I went to...

916
00:55:11,806 --> 00:55:14,346
a taping of a music show. You don't remember?

917
00:55:17,516 --> 00:55:19,316
(Winners' treasure, I love you, Heung Soo. You're mine!)

918
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:21,646
You put the hat you were wearing...

919
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:23,986
on my very head.

920
00:55:27,856 --> 00:55:29,126
Are you Jang Mi?

921
00:55:29,456 --> 00:55:30,456
Yes.

922
00:55:32,096 --> 00:55:34,126
I vaguely remember something like that.

923
00:55:35,026 --> 00:55:36,966
Why didn't the fan club do anything?

924
00:55:39,366 --> 00:55:41,306
Less than a month after I took over...

925
00:55:41,406 --> 00:55:42,706
as president,

926
00:55:43,106 --> 00:55:44,835
my dad's business went bankrupt,

927
00:55:44,836 --> 00:55:46,606
so we moved to the US.

928
00:55:47,176 --> 00:55:48,206
I see.

929
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:50,846
Whenever I got discriminated...

930
00:55:51,546 --> 00:55:53,486
and the kids bullied me,

931
00:55:54,546 --> 00:55:57,015
I watched videos of you dancing...

932
00:55:57,016 --> 00:55:58,686
to get through it all.

933
00:55:59,326 --> 00:56:01,656
My dance comforted you?

934
00:56:02,496 --> 00:56:03,626
That's touching.

935
00:56:08,226 --> 00:56:09,236
Are you...

936
00:56:09,636 --> 00:56:11,966
the Rose Scissors who donated...

937
00:56:12,666 --> 00:56:14,005
whenever I streamed live?

938
00:56:14,006 --> 00:56:16,075
Rose Scissors said, "I'm always watching you,"

939
00:56:16,076 --> 00:56:18,836
and donated another 100 dollars!

940
00:56:19,006 --> 00:56:20,846
Yes, that was me!

941
00:56:23,446 --> 00:56:25,176
Ms. Ji... No.

942
00:56:26,746 --> 00:56:27,846
Ok Bun.

943
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:32,186
You were always there, helping me out.

944
00:56:33,526 --> 00:56:34,656
I was.

945
00:56:35,256 --> 00:56:39,026
To me, you are the best artist.

946
00:56:40,266 --> 00:56:41,566
The best artist?

947
00:56:43,766 --> 00:56:45,095
Of course.

948
00:56:45,096 --> 00:56:48,066
No matter what others say,

949
00:56:48,466 --> 00:56:50,506
you are the best artist in the world.

950
00:57:01,916 --> 00:57:03,816
Thank you, Ms. Ji. I mean,

951
00:57:06,286 --> 00:57:07,326
Ok Bun.

952
00:57:08,756 --> 00:57:10,156
Heung Soo!

953
00:57:51,736 --> 00:57:52,736
Darn it!

954
00:57:53,366 --> 00:57:56,406
Wait. No, don't.

955
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:04,916
It's bad, sir.

956
00:58:05,146 --> 00:58:06,916
Why? What's going on?

957
00:58:07,646 --> 00:58:08,786
That woman...

958
00:58:09,756 --> 00:58:10,886
was arrested.

959
00:58:12,586 --> 00:58:14,886
What woman? Who are you talking about?

960
00:58:22,696 --> 00:58:24,136
I thought she had gone to the Philippines!

961
00:58:24,566 --> 00:58:26,465
She was going to leave...

962
00:58:26,466 --> 00:58:28,405
after taking her sick mother to a facility.

963
00:58:28,406 --> 00:58:29,636
We were settling on a date when...

964
00:58:30,476 --> 00:58:31,675
Her flight's tomorrow,

965
00:58:31,676 --> 00:58:33,606
but she was arrested today.

966
00:58:34,146 --> 00:58:36,376
Is that the best you could do?

967
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:38,576
Darn it!

968
00:58:39,746 --> 00:58:42,016
Why was this so difficult to handle?

969
00:58:44,386 --> 00:58:45,856
How incompetent can you be?

970
00:58:46,456 --> 00:58:49,295
She told me she'd fly out the day the coverage aired.

971
00:58:49,296 --> 00:58:51,156
She promised!

972
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:54,095
I'm sorry, sir.

973
00:58:54,096 --> 00:58:57,136
(Silla Brewery)

974
00:59:03,476 --> 00:59:04,576
I'll make myself clear.

975
00:59:05,706 --> 00:59:09,046
I knew nothing about this.

976
00:59:10,076 --> 00:59:14,016
You orchestrated this all by yourself. Got it?

977
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:18,456
Sir, I don't think I follow.

978
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:20,755
One of us will have to...

979
00:59:20,756 --> 00:59:23,596
clean up this mess, right?

980
00:59:26,366 --> 00:59:28,896
You understand what I'm saying, don't you?

981
00:59:30,196 --> 00:59:31,196
Yes.

982
00:59:33,666 --> 00:59:35,536
I think I do.

983
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:39,676
Good.

984
00:59:46,786 --> 00:59:50,056
Not saying anything won't make what you did disappear.

985
00:59:51,086 --> 00:59:53,355
We already have enough evidence...

986
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:54,986
to prove your crime.

987
00:59:56,796 --> 00:59:57,796
I have to ask.

988
00:59:58,426 --> 01:00:01,595
Why did you film a fake video and report it as a whistleblower...

989
01:00:01,596 --> 01:00:02,896
when you don't even work at Eagle Brewery?

990
01:00:04,236 --> 01:00:05,865
We looked into your life...

991
01:00:05,866 --> 01:00:07,506
and found nothing that suggests a motive.

992
01:00:09,876 --> 01:00:11,436
This wasn't recreational.

993
01:00:12,676 --> 01:00:14,176
Didn't someone put you up to this?

994
01:00:15,846 --> 01:00:18,515
A flight to the Philippines was booked under your name.

995
01:00:18,516 --> 01:00:21,346
Attempting to flee overseas is grounds for being detained.

996
01:00:21,886 --> 01:00:22,986
Do you understand me?

997
01:00:29,226 --> 01:00:30,795
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

998
01:00:30,796 --> 01:00:31,796
Come in.

999
01:00:37,496 --> 01:00:39,706
They have the female suspect in custody, sir.

1000
01:00:39,866 --> 01:00:42,266
The police are currently interrogating her.

1001
01:00:42,836 --> 01:00:45,605
Really? That's great news.

1002
01:00:45,606 --> 01:00:47,775
Unfortunately, the suspect...

1003
01:00:47,776 --> 01:00:50,146
doesn't seem to be talking.

1004
01:00:51,216 --> 01:00:52,785
The longer this drags on,

1005
01:00:52,786 --> 01:00:55,416
the more the innocent party will suffer.

1006
01:00:56,086 --> 01:00:57,515
Can you find a way to contact the suspect...

1007
01:00:57,516 --> 01:00:58,986
and get her to confess?

1008
01:00:59,016 --> 01:01:02,126
Please figure out a plan to resolve this matter quickly.

1009
01:01:02,386 --> 01:01:04,955
Yes, sir. The Legal Team will do everything in its power...

1010
01:01:04,956 --> 01:01:06,926
to swiftly resolve this matter.

1011
01:01:08,296 --> 01:01:09,326
Good.

1012
01:01:13,666 --> 01:01:17,506
(Eagle Brewery)

1013
01:01:37,896 --> 01:01:39,226
(Eagle Brewery)

1014
01:01:49,876 --> 01:01:51,136
Chairman Han?

1015
01:01:57,846 --> 01:01:59,516
What brings you by unannounced?

1016
01:02:00,046 --> 01:02:02,856
I wanted to deliver the good news in person.

1017
01:02:03,556 --> 01:02:04,856
Good news?

1018
01:02:05,416 --> 01:02:07,086
I take it that they haven't contacted you yet.

1019
01:02:09,086 --> 01:02:10,926
They have the suspect in custody.

1020
01:02:11,626 --> 01:02:14,226
What? Really?

1021
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:17,936
No way!

1022
01:02:19,706 --> 01:02:23,206
I had no idea they'd make an arrest so soon.

1023
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:28,606
Thank you, Chairman Han.

1024
01:02:30,816 --> 01:02:32,746
I'm happy to see you're thrilled.

1025
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:38,356
Kwang Sook.

1026
01:02:41,156 --> 01:02:42,156
Goodness.

1027
01:02:45,696 --> 01:02:47,666
Chairman Han, is that you?

1028
01:02:50,496 --> 01:02:51,566
Chairman Han?

1029
01:02:52,196 --> 01:02:53,336
Hello, sir.

1030
01:02:54,766 --> 01:02:55,936
Yes, hello.

1031
01:02:57,776 --> 01:02:58,806
Hello, ma'am.

1032
01:02:59,506 --> 01:03:00,506
Hello.

1033
01:03:49,526 --> 01:03:52,056
(For Eagle Brothers)

1034
01:03:52,296 --> 01:03:54,325
Who on earth would do such a thing?

1035
01:03:54,326 --> 01:03:56,796
What beef could they possibly have with us?

1036
01:03:56,936 --> 01:03:59,535
Maybe I should just marry my fan who owns multiple buildings.

1037
01:03:59,536 --> 01:04:01,865
Then I could take care of the brewery's debt.

1038
01:04:01,866 --> 01:04:03,775
I won't try to tie you down...

1039
01:04:03,776 --> 01:04:05,576
just because we spent a night together.

1040
01:04:05,776 --> 01:04:07,206
What on earth are you saying?

1041
01:04:07,276 --> 01:04:08,475
I dare you to say one more word.

1042
01:04:08,476 --> 01:04:10,616
If you do, I'll take my life right here.

1043
01:04:10,846 --> 01:04:12,776
Do you recognize me?

1044
01:04:12,946 --> 01:04:14,386
I'm Se Ri's mom.

1045
01:04:14,516 --> 01:04:15,516
What?

1046
01:04:15,586 --> 01:04:17,986
So? Who orchestrated it?

1047
01:04:18,356 --> 01:04:19,356
What?

1048
01:04:19,357 --> 01:04:20,856
Silla Brewery?
