1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:02,510
What did you just say?

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,840
It's not normal...

3
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:08,280
to live under the same roof
as your brothers-in-law.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,880
Hold on. Are you calling me weird
or something?

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,550
Like I mentioned before,

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,850
it's tough to date someone new...

7
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,290
when you're living
with your in-laws.

8
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,790
Is this your way of saying
I should move out of the house?

9
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:26,560
I have no intention
of finding my own happiness...

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,800
at the expense
of hurting my brothers-in-law.

11
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,670
The way I see it is...

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:35,610
Before you realized
what was happening,

13
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,480
you let yourself be crushed
under the weight...

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,940
of all these responsibilities.

15
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:41,450
That's also an illness, you know.

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,010
Are you now saying...

17
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,420
there's something wrong with me?

18
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,520
That's not it.

19
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,450
Forget it.

20
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,790
I don't want to talk anymore.

21
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,630
She can't walk off like that
during a conversation.

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,440
It's not like
I'm one of his employees.

23
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,510
Who does he think he is,
bossing me around?

24
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,060
Hey.

25
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,530
Did you get an energy boost?

26
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,230
What energy boost?

27
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,360
Didn't Dong Seok ask to see you
to treat you because you were ill?

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,830
Who are you calling "Dong Seok?"

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,470
Don't you dare
mention him around me.

30
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,170
"Dong Seok?"
As if we're married already.

31
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,680
Why is she acting like
a raging bull?

32
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,690
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

33
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,090
What?

34
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:07,830
Hello, Mother.

35
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,200
Yes, hello.
Did you and Kwang Sook...

36
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:12,300
argue about something?

37
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,910
Did she tattle on me already?

38
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:18,640
No. It's not like that.

39
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,610
She came home huffing and puffing
like a raging bull...

40
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,780
and stormed off into her room.

41
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,820
So I thought that was what happened.

42
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,250
It's not that we fought.

43
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,360
We just had
a slight difference of opinion.

44
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,860
Between us, Kwang Sook's
a bit stubborn, isn't she?

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,330
That's an understatement.
She's extremely stubborn.

46
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,540
That's because
she takes after her late father.

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,210
So I'd like you to understand her.

48
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,570
Okay?

49
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,720
Kwang Sook.

50
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,020
How are you feeling?

51
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,920
I'm totally fine now.

52
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,060
Don't worry.

53
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,430
(Eagle Brewery)

54
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,530
It's just because it's so sudden.

55
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,770
But once my brothers are ready
to accept it,

56
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,540
they will sincerely congratulate you
on your new beginning.

57
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,570
Please don't be upset.

58
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,110
I'm not upset at all.

59
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,640
I feel the same way you all do.

60
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,880
And I believe you guys
also understand how I feel.

61
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:33,690
I understand everything,
so you don't have to worry.

62
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,720
You have entered our lives...

63
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,520
so deeply...

64
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:41,030
that it's not easy for us
to let you go.

65
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,930
Please be understanding.

66
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,360
Why would you let me go?

67
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,030
Even if things work out well
for me and Chairman Han,

68
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,440
the time we've spent together
and our friendship...

69
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,870
How would I forget the whole thing?

70
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,280
It is something
that lasts a lifetime.

71
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,180
Nothing will change between us.

72
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,220
Kwang Sook.

73
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,950
If that's how you guys feel,

74
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,260
maybe I should rethink
dating Chairman Han.

75
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,960
I'll just spend the rest of my life
stirring liquor at the brewery.

76
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,440
It's Yeoung Ju.

77
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,710
Excuse me.

78
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:33,850
Hey, Yeoung Ju.

79
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,750
Don't be surprised.
Just listen, okay?

80
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:39,720
About the restaurant owner
Mom was seeing.

81
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:42,620
It turns out he was
a real estate investment scammer.

82
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,120
What?

83
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,490
I think there are a lot of people
who invested besides Mom.

84
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,560
The Korean community
is in an uproar now.

85
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,110
You told me
not to come near your house.

86
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,580
What is this about?

87
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,350
I heard you got scammed in the US.

88
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,920
Did you lose all the money...

89
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,160
you got from me as alimony?

90
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,990
What about the house?

91
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,000
The house is still there.

92
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,630
They said the investment returns...

93
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,870
would be over ten percent
in a few months,

94
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,040
so I wanted to invest the money
to live well with Yeoung Ju.

95
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,740
You always act like you know it all,
but you just got scammed.

96
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:37,040
How pathetic you are.

97
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,510
I wondered why you came back
and begged me to have you back...

98
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:42,450
after you left me
making all the fuss like that.

99
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,750
It was all about money.

100
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:44,850
No.

101
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:46,880
After going through
all that trouble,

102
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,350
I realized you meant a lot to me,
so I came back.

103
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,660
Let's start over, Chun Soo.

104
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,660
I'll pay for all the mistakes I made
for the rest of my life.

105
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,630
It will never happen.

106
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:05,140
Pull yourself together and get real.

107
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,610
If you want me to get on my knees
and beg, I will.

108
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,240
Please forgive me just this once.

109
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,280
Stop talking nonsense.

110
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,010
I'll see you at court next week.

111

(I want to be with you
every day, every moment.)

112
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,250
Is he seeing someone else?

113
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,560
I was here just once before.

114
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,120
How did you remember me?

115
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:02,960
I'll take my share and go.

116
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:04,560
You left a strong impression.

117
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,370

to have a hard time.

she hasn't even called me...

121
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,480

- Is that tomorrow?
- Yes.

125
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:41,930

our new outside director,

126
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,100
to come too.

127
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:44,870
Good.

128
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,010
I have a lot on my mind,
so I have no energy to exercise.

129
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,580
Why? Is something wrong?

130
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:03,960
Come in.

131
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,660
- Is the result out?
- Yes, sir.

Why would you ask me that
after all this time?

I just got curious all of a sudden.

You were diligent and faithful,

your family go hungry.

that you think so highly of me.

182
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:17,430
I'm actually...

183
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,440
a mom.

184
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,870
What?

185
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,170
Darling.

186
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,110
What?

187
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,510
Oh, yes.

188
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,450
You're married?

189
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,790
Yes.

190
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:37,090
Ha Ni, will you come to Mommy?

191
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,220
Will you go to Mommy?

192
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,720
- Here.
- Good girl.

193
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,330
This is my daughter, Oh Ha Ni.

194
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:49,400
Isn't she adorable?

195
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,540
I apologize. Sorry.

196
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,640
Are there still people
who throw themselves at strangers?

197
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,880
That's number three.

198
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,380
What is?

199
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,120
Since I started working here,

200
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,190
he's the third guy who's hit on me.

201
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,320
There were two others before him.

202
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,460
Do they come to these stores
to meet girls?

203
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,860
Something's really wrong.

204
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,270
But...

205
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,700
I really want to be Ha Ni's mom.

206
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,470
What?

207
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:32,240
I want to be her mom,
not her sister or auntie.

208
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,810
Well...

209
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,380
Excuse me.

210
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,160
Emergency meeting.

211
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,460
Come to the brewery office by 9 p.m.

212
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,170
I don't stand a chance.

213
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,180
A washed-up dancer...

214
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,440
and Sangjin Group's heir?

215
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,780
I can't compete.

216
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,410
What were the flowers for?

217
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,710
I'm pretty sure he meant to propose.

218
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,650
Why did he run off?

219
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,560
I went to LX Hotel...

220
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,460
because Chairman Han called.

221
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,560
He called you too?
He asked to see me as well.

222
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,970
He called every one of us.

223
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,040
I was there too.

224
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,140
What?

225
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,210
You too?

226
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,310
I met him outside our house.

227
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,340
That means
he talked to every one of us.

228
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,380
He asked me
if I had any intention...

229
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:19,180
of taking over the brewery
from Kwang Sook.

230
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,850
He's openly saying
he wants to take her away.

231
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,890
Don't be so negative about it.

232
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,630
What did he ask you, Beom Soo?

233
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,960
He asked if I had any issues
with him dating Kwang Sook.

234
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,530
He asked for my help so he could...

235
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,000
make progress with Kwang Sook.

236
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,340
I rejected his sandwich order,

237
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,540
and he asked why.

238
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,440
You rejected his order?

239
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,380
My pride is the only thing
that has kept me going so far.

240
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,310
I can't go against my rule...

241
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,150
for one big order.

242
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,650
I think you're going
a bit too far on that one.

243
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,320
To be honest,

244
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,290
earning the chairman's help
because he's dating Kwang Sook...

245
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,490
doesn't sit well with me.

246
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,790
It's not right.

247
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:06,560
Good for you, Heung Soo.

248
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,770
Let's see if we can...

249
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,770
figure out what to do
about this issue.

250
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,540
This was bound to happen one day.

251
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,370
It just happened
sooner than expected.

252
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,110
Kwang Sook's still young,

253
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,780
and I think
she should get remarried.

254
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,380
She should,

255
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,280
but she was
our stand-in for Jang Soo.

256
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,660
It feels like we're losing Jang Soo
all over again.

257
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,890
Oh, boy.

258
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,770
Let's ignore everything else...

259
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,300
and focus only on Kwang Sook.

260
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,220
What do you think
Jang Soo would say?

261
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,520
"Don't be small-minded."

262
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,460
"Do what Kwang Sook wants."

263
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,960
"If Kwang Sook's happy,"

264
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,370
"I'm happy."

265
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:19,000
He'd definitely say that.

266
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:36,250
(LX Hotel Chairman Han Dong Seok)

267
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,430
What?

268
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,130
Meet me outside the brewery.

269
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,620
You left in a huff
without saying goodbye...

270
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,920
and didn't even call.

271
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,220
How could you?

272
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,260
You were in the wrong.

273
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,460
Shouldn't you apologize first?

274
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,900
I said what I did out of concern.
Was it that wrong?

275
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,260
Is this the attitude of someone
who's concerned?

276
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,930
What is this if it's not concern?

277
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,980
I'm not one of your employees.

278
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,750
Don't be mistaken.

279
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,980
Would I show
such care and concern...

280
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,920
for one of my employees?

281
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:43,790
Do you think that makes sense?

282
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,890
Isn't that Chairman Han
and Kwang Sook?

283
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,560
Are they arguing?

284
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,130
You pretend to be concerned,

285
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:59,000
but you try to manipulate things
to your advantage.

286
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,610
To my advantage?

287
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,610
Yes.

288
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,840
I am Ma Kwang Sook,

289
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,880
and I have a life I dreamed of.

290
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,350
I wasn't born to do as you say.

291
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,750
I want to live my own life.

292
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,150
Because I was worried
about your health,

293
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,720
I suggested you take a break...

294
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,650
while letting others run things.

295
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,120
How was I wrong to say that?

296
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:21,360
I already made myself clear.

297
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,960
I won't stop working at the brewery!

298
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:28,000
You really are so hard to control.

299
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,970
Kwang Sook.
Do you run the whole world?

300
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,670
You never listen to others.

301
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,970
Are you always right?

302
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,010
That's what I want to ask you.

303
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:39,580
I have ideas and plans of my own.

304
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,380
You keep telling me what to do,

305
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,210
and that's bullying.

306
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,180
You, King of Bullies!

307
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,490
"King of Bullies?"

308
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,820
Am I that much of a loser...

309
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,920
that you think
I'm bullying the woman I love?

310
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,960
Do you think that little of me?

311
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,830
Why are you shouting at me?

312
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,930
- This looks bad.
- Let's go.

313
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,960
Let's stop them.

314
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,630
- My gosh.
- Watch out.

315
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,430
- That's enough.
- Hurry.

316
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,070
Chairman. Kwang Sook. Hi.

317
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,770
Goodness.

318
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,240
The chairman's concerned for you.

319
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,480
I think you overreacted
a bit too much.

320
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,380
Yes. You took it too harshly.

321
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,690
I totally understand
how Kwang Sook feels.

322
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,730
We all have our own lives,

323
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,030
and the chairman intervenes
at every turn.

324
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,570
A woman could find that exhausting.

325
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,320
It was painful...

326
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,820
to see her receiving fluids
at the hospital.

327
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,790
So I suggested
she let the experts...

328
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,630
take over the brewery
and take a break.

329
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,760
Was I wrong to say that?

330
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,900
You had every reason
to suggest that.

331
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,370
Yet, she says
I was bossing her around.

332
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:12,800
You can imagine how upset I was.

333
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,140
Kwang Sook tends to speak harshly,

334
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,740
especially when she loses
her temper.

335
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,480
She's short-tempered.

336
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,720
Still, how could she call me
"King of Bullies?"

337
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,590
I can't believe she'd paint me
with that kind of image.

338
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,090
She obviously crossed the line.

339
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,930
Kwang Sook has strong opinions.

340
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,460
That's why she was known as TN.

341
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,500
TN?

342
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,330
Total nutcase.

343
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,370
Having strong opinions
is nothing like...

344
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,070
being a nutcase.

345
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,480
Chun Soo,
it's a shame to hear you...

346
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,980
call her that.

347
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,820
Sorry?

348
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,830
It's not like I'm dreaming
of hitting the jackpot at this age.

349
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,890
Why should I hold back
on what I want...

350
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,230
just to have a new man in my life?

351
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,100
Absolutely. How dare he...

352
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,400
try to tie you down
just because he's wealthy?

353
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,930
You can't put a price on freedom.

354
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,600
I don't care that he's a chairman.

355
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,370
Who is he bossing around?

356
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,380
This is definitely
an abuse of power.

357
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,910
Exactly.

358
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,820
That's a bit far-fetched,
don't you think?

359
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,490
He's the chairman of a group...

360
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,760
who gives orders
and makes decisions.

361
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,430
That's just second nature to him.

362
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:48,100
I'm not sure if it's fair to say...

363
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,400
he was bossing me around.

364
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,940
Besides, he's a reasonable
and rational man.

365
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,780
He wouldn't try to dominate others.

366
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,250
I'm tired all of a sudden.

367
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,690
I'll turn in first, then.

368
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,720
Sure.

369
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,990
Good night.

370
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,830
Right. Good night.

371
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,160
Why am I so tired today?

372
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,800
So much for taking her side.
Unbelievable.

373
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,600
Tell me about it.

374
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,470
Darn.

375
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,850
Why aren't you in bed, honey?

376
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,450
I couldn't sleep. That's all.

377
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,730
You're out cold as soon as
your head hits the pillow,

378
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,830
so what's going on?

379
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:58,470
Se Ri will come home soon.

380
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,240
Don't worry too much about it.

381
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,180
If I had known,

382
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,080
I would've wanted another child.

383
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,580
Could you have a child
hidden somewhere else?

384
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,050
What?

385
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,620
It all feels like a waste...

386
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,290
now that I've been betrayed
by the daughter...

387
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:23,530
I raised like a princess.

388
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,760
I even went as far as to think...

389
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,900
that I should've cheated on you...

390
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,300
and had a child out of wedlock.

391
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,610
Cut the nonsense...

392
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,840
and get back to bed.

393
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,010
I haven't golfed in so long,
and I'm worried...

394
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,950
I'll make a fool of myself
in front of the chairman.

395
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,320
You being the outside director
is just an excuse.

396
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,220
He probably invited you
just to get to know you better,

397
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,490
so don't feel pressured.

398
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,460
Yes, Bom.

399
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:33,600
Yes, we're about to head out.

400
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,270
Is everything going smoothly?

401
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,730
We have an issue.

402
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,300
What kind of issue?

403
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,800
Mr. Kim, who was supposed
to golf with the chairman,

404
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,140
was rushed to the ER
earlier in the morning...

405
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,580
due to sudden back pain.
What should we do?

406
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,290
I think I can find someone
to fill in.

407
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,720
Don't worry too much.

408
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:03,230
Thank you so much
for helping me out...

409
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,390
at every one of these events.

410
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:06,860
- It's my pleasure.
- All right.

411
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,630
- You should get ready, then.
- Okay.

412
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,600
Hello, Chairman Han.

413
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,880
Wait. Why is Kwang Sook here?

414
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,520
I brought her here
to fill in for Mr. Kim.

415
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:31,320
Kang Soo begged,
saying he could get fired...

416
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,690
if he didn't find a replacement.

417
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,130
I was practically forced
to participate.

418
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,140
Hello and welcome...

419
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,280
to the golfing event hosted
by LX Fashion.

420
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,680
Before we kick off,

421
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,450
Chairman Han Dong Seok
will share his official greeting.

422
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,420
Chairman Han, please join me here.

423
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,260
(VIP Invitational With Lynx Golf)

424
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,070
- Is she your sister-in-law?
- Thank you...

425
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,430
- once again...
- Yes.

426
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,870
- for joining this event.
- I'll formally introduce you later.

427
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,070
The event's profits...

428
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:23,010
will be donated to orphanages...

429
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:24,540
and socially neglected groups.

430
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,710
Please have a great time today...

431
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,250
and land your best shots. Thank you.

432
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,690
Hey, Mi Sun.

433
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,430
How are you feeling?

434
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:50,070
I took something for indigestion,
so I feel better now.

435
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,300
You worked late last night,

436
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,910
and I'm sorry for keeping you
from resting.

437
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:58,240
It's fine.

438
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,310
Don't worry about me.
Get some good rest.

439
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,350
Sure.

440
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,220
Welcome.

441
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,360
That'll be 3.30 dollars.

442
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,540
You remember me, don't you?

443
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,940
Yes, I do.

444
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,740
Last time,

445
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:38,050
your dad came by Beom Soo's office
and threw a fit.

446
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:42,250
You two must be involved
in a romance of the century.

447
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,960
Will you be paying by card or cash?

448
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,730
I doubt Beom Soo
asked you out first.

449
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,900
Did you make the first move?

450
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,640
There's nothing I can do
about two people dating.

451
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,410
But I came by to warn you.

452
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,720
You can want Beom Soo,

453
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,620
but not Ha Ni.

454
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,860
I'll hire the best legal team
in the country...

455
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,460
and get Ha Ni back soon.

456
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,760
So don't bother showing her love...

457
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,000
or acting like her mother.

458
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,770
You don't have the right...

459
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,170
to take her back.

460
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,910
- What?
- You have no right,

461
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,980
not after abandoning
Professor Oh and Ha Ni.

462
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:42,210
Being her mom gives me the right.

463
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:45,420
Besides, I'm the one
who gave birth to her.

464
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,480
You abandoned your responsibilities
and didn't devote yourself to her.

465
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,820
Giving birth and being a mom
are two different things.

466
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,420
What?

467
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,460
Please.

468
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:01,000
Stop making Professor Oh's life
so hard.

469
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,640
That's for your darling professor.

470
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,300
Who on earth took these pictures?

471
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,820
- Good shot.
- Good shot.

472
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,190
- Nice.
- Good shot.

473
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,320
Good shot.

474
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:15,070
- Nice one.
- Good shot.

475
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,470
- Good shot.
- Chairman Han!

476
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:18,640
- Nice shot.
- That was awesome.

477
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,840
- He's so good.
- My goodness.

478
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,250
- That was a good one.
- My gosh, Chairman Han.

479
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:41,900
Oh, well...

480
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:44,470
- That was a practice swing.
- That's okay.

481
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:45,940
- It's all right.
- Okay.

482
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,600
- Try it again.
- All right.

483
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,670
Here I go.

484
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,480
What? Again?

485
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,200
Will you ask your sister-in-law
how long...

486
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,130
she plans to stay sulky like that?

487
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,500
Pardon?

488
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,070
Oh, okay.

489
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,510
Mr. Han wants to know
how long you plan to keep sulking.

490
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,050
Tell him that I won't let it go...

491
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,280
until he sincerely apologizes...

492
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,580
to me.

493
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,820
You should sincerely apologize
to her first.

494
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,320
I said I was sorry.

495
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,290
Please ask her
how many more times...

496
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,460
I have to apologize.

497
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,060
You heard him, right?

498
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:48,000
I don't remember hearing an apology.

499
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,600
Please tell him that.

500
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,340
You two should talk
to each other, then.

501
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,320
We made a reservation.

502
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,120
- May I have your name?
- It is Park Seong Hyun.

503
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,490
I'll show you to a table
next to the window.

504
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:16,730
- Sure.
- This way, please.

505
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:23,770
He wants to see me
at a nice place like this?

506
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,710
Is he really going
to propose to me today?

507
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,330
Have a seat.

508
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,700
If you have something to say,
you can say it at the shop.

509
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,410
I think this place is expensive.

510
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:09,980
Even though I'm broke,

511
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,850
I don't want to skimp on things
on a day like today.

512
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:20,160
I was so lucky to have met you.

513
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:25,660
You have always tried
your best for me,

514
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,200
and you were always there...

515
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,430
waiting for me.

516
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,270
Excuse me.
May I serve you some wine first?

517
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,340
Yes, please.

518
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,750
Please have a good time.

519
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,760
Why did you order wine?
It must be expensive.

520
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,300
We should have some wine today.

521
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
Let's drink.

522
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,150
Why is the wine so bitter and sour?

523
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,180
Is it bitter and sour?

524
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,660
I think it's fine.

525
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:30,990
Actually,

526
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,630
it would be strange
if the wine tasted sweet...

527
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,760
on a day like this.

528
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,540
You keep saying...

529
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,940
"A day like today."

530
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,180
Then, what kind of day...

531
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,250
is a day like today?

532
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:54,650
Is it...

533
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,050
a special day?

534
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,190
It is a special day.

535
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:09,170
What kind of special day?

536
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,370
Ok Bun.

537
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,250
I'm letting you go.

538
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,650
Letting me...

539
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,290
Letting me go?

540
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,460
I've been thinking about it
for the past few days.

541
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,330
And I've come...

542
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,160
to the conclusion
that I'm lacking in many ways.

543
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,470
What are you talking about?

544
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,140
You have someone
more capable and nicer than me.

545
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,440
I think...

546
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,750
I'd be asking too much
if I expected you to stay with me.

547
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,380
What's that supposed to mean?

548
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,020
I'm talking about the vet.

549
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,150
Even as a man, I think he's cool.

550
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,090
He's a capable man.

551
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:06,590
Heung Soo!

552
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,590
Breaking up with someone
because of love.

553
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,960
I always thought
it was a cowardly thing to say.

554
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,130
But now that I'm in that situation,

555
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,400
I think I can understand
what it's like.

556
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,610
You are too good...

557
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,350
for a guy like me, Ok Bun.

558
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:36,090
I will let you go
quietly and nicely.

559
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,620
Leave me, Ok Bun!

560
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,460
My goodness.

561
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,500
Darn it.

562
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,300
You!

563
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,840
You cowardly jerk.

564
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,650
Hey, Oh Heung Soo!

565
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:07,250
Make sure to stay out of my sight!

566
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,790
If I see you again,
you're dead meat!

567
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,690
Darn it.

568
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:27,600
Be happy, Ok Bun.

569
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,580
(Eagle Brewery)

570
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,580
Hey.

571
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,750
What's the problem?

572
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,210
Did you take your medicine?

573
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:41,020
I'll stop by a pharmacy on my way.
Tell me how you're feeling.

574
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,170
Is it you, Chun Soo?

575
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,270
Yes.

576
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,740
- You're here.
- Hey.

577
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,410
I already took
some digestive medicine.

578
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,080
Take a seat.

579
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,730
This is a Chinese herbal recipe.

580
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:28,330
The pharmacist said
it would be effective.

581
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,530
Drink it.

582
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,530
Thanks.

583
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,470
Are you ill
because I stressed you out?

584
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,780
Gosh, no.

585
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,610
I'm sorry to bother you
with everything.

586
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,720
It's not your fault.

587
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,020
Yeoung Ju told me that...

588
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,260
her mom lost the alimony
I gave her to a conman.

589
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,830
She was conned?

590
00:40:57,090 --> 00:40:58,130
Yes.

591
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:02,000
She's out of money and doesn't know
how to support herself,

592
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,770
so she wants us
to get back together.

593
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,540
That's terrible.

594
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,270
Who could that be?

595
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,180
It must be the dry cleaner.

596
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,350
- I see.
- Sorry.

597
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,910
Just a moment.

598
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,520
- My gosh.
- Hey.

599
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:24,790
What are you doing here?

600
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:27,460
Who's this woman?

601
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,630
It's the convenience store lady.

602
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,500
What's this?

603
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,370
Are you two living together?

604
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:41,540
Let's talk outside.

605
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,210
Let go of me.

606
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,870
My gosh.

607
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,010
You pretended to be
the pure, noble, doting husband.

608
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,580
You were having an affair?

609
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,450
Enough with your nonsense. Get out.

610
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,820
We'll talk outside.

611
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,420
No wonder.

612
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:02,560
You begged and pleaded with me
not to divorce you,

613
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,630
and I wondered
why you'd suddenly changed.

614
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,560
There was a reason.

615
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,300
Do you know...

616
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,500
he's still legally a married man?

617
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,140
What you're doing right now
is called cheating!

618
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,140
You have no right...

619
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,910
to complain even if
we were to do much worse.

620
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,810
- What?
- You cheated on me first,

621
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:27,550
and you asked me to divorce you.

622
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:30,090
I did nothing to deserve
to be condemned by you.

623
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,750
What?

624
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:35,690
Let go.

625
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,330
Let go of my wrist!

626
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:41,900
Don't you dare touch this man.

627
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,200
What?

628
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,370
I met him first.

629
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,740
I met him...

630
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,170
twenty years before you did.

631
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,750
It's time...

632
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,280
you let him go.

633
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,940
You saw Mr. Oh's sister-in-law,
didn't you?

634
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:23,870
What did you think of her?

635
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:27,280
I was a bit surprised.

636
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,010
Why?

637
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:33,120
She's so different from Mom.

638
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,720
I'd never thought
you'd fall for someone like her.

639
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:41,820
She's different from your mom,

640
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:44,730
but in some ways,
they're similar too.

641
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,400
You'll see what I mean later on.

642
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:50,530
Okay.

643
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,880
Thanks a lot for helping out today.

644
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:05,310
It was a long day for you too.

645
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,650
- Get some rest.
- You too.

646
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,890
I don't even remember how I played.

647
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,430
I was busy being their go-between.

648
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,900
They're both so stubborn.

649
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:23,530
I feel bad.
It's like they fought because of us.

650
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,830
Come on.

651
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:34,640
Se Ri.

652
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,980
Professor.

653
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:43,520
What is it? Is something wrong?

654
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:46,660
Here.

655
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,360
What are these?

656
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:59,400
Ha Ni's mom came by today.

657
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,140
What?

658
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:07,210
She said she'd take Ha Ni.

659
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:09,040
What now?

660
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,980
That won't happen. Don't worry.

661
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,920
What if...

662
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,660
my being around you...

663
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,090
ends up splitting you and Ha Ni up?

664
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:25,490
What, then?

665
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:36,470
I told you not to worry.

666
00:45:37,810 --> 00:45:39,270
That won't happen.

667
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:42,540
What if there's a trial?

668
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,450
Then, we'll go to court.

669
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,420
Why worry?

670
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:53,420
I regretted meeting you...

671
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,390
for the first time ever.

672
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,360
If you could lose Ha Ni
because of me,

673
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:04,930
I'll give up dating you.

674
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,210
No.

675
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,980
I won't give up on you.

676
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:18,280
I won't lose you...

677
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:20,880
or Ha Ni.

678
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:23,990
So don't worry.

679
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:56,750
I called to ask how Se Ri's doing.

680
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,320
I see.

681
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,020
Did I call when you're busy?

682
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:03,890
No.

683
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:06,530
Se Ri's fine. Don't worry.

684
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,160
Beom Soo spends time with her...

685
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,370
at the convenience store after work.

686
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:16,840
If you have the time,
could you drop by...

687
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:19,170
and check on her too?

688
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,710
And tell me how she's doing.

689
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:26,720
Thank you, Kang Soo.

690
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:40,330
Why are you home already?

691
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,200
You said you had a funeral to go to.

692
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,250
(DNA Parentage Test Report)

693
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,650
(Between Client A and Client B,)

694
00:48:01,650 --> 00:48:03,020
(the probability of maternity
is 99.9 percent.)

695
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:09,190
I should've caught on...

696
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,490
when you kept defending
Eagle Brewery.

697
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,200
I never imagined this...

698
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,270
even in my wildest dreams.

699
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,270
Kang Soo. Who's the father?

700
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:29,010
Don't think of lying.
Tell the truth.

701
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:32,310
Who's the dad?

702
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,900
Kang Soo's dad...

703
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,900
died in an accident
at a construction site...

704
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,140
three days before Kang Soo was born.

705
00:48:58,910 --> 00:48:59,940
What?

706
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,610
I didn't think
I could be a single mom.

707
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:06,380
That's why I left Kang Soo
outside the brewery.

708
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,350
And you dared...

709
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:11,820
to pretend to be a single woman?

710
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:15,090
Were you going to...

711
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,590
take the secret to your grave
if I never found out?

712
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:21,030
- Yes.
- "Yes?"

713
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:26,200
Knowing the truth
wouldn't do you or Se Ri any good.

714
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,310
Shouldn't you be ashamed?

715
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,180
I did...

716
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,350
my very best for you and Se Ri,

717
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,150
because I was guilty from the start.

718
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,820
I did the best I could...

719
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:42,680
to be a good wife to you...

720
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:44,390
and a good mom to Se Ri!

721
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:45,620
Shut your mouth!

722
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,730
You can make any excuse,

723
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,430
but you can't be forgiven.

724
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,500
- Honey.
- Don't even call me that!

725
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,030
It gives me the chills.

726
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,000
How could you...

727
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:05,440
deceive me for 30 years?

728
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,150
You.

729
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:17,320
You know how vicious
and cruel I can be.

730
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:22,990
You and your son.

731
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,200
I won't sit by
and let you have a good life.

732
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:29,730
You'll both...

733
00:50:30,470 --> 00:50:31,700
get what's coming.

734
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:02,330
Heung Soo told me that...

735
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,570
when I was a baby,

736
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:07,440
you carried me, dressed me,

737
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,640
and put me to bed.

738
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,770
You adored me
like you were my nanny.

739
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,850
Go on living...

740
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,290
as happily as you did so far.

741
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,290
Nothing will change.

742
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:30,960
No way.

743
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:32,690
There's no way.

744
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,190
Hello?

745
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:03,530
This is your last warning.

746
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:06,530
I'll take action
if you do something like this again.

747
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:09,160
I couldn't care less
about who you're dating.

748
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,900
I just want Ha Ni back.

749
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:13,340
That will never happen,
so don't waste your time.

750
00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:15,870
Also, you'll have
another thing coming...

751
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:17,040
if you go see Se Ri again.

752
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:18,510
Remember that.

753
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:32,050
(Pot Number 16)

754
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:34,520
Because I was worried
about your health,

755
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,060
I suggested you take a break...

756
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,990
while letting others run things.

757
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:39,560
How was I wrong to say that?

758
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,570
Of course, he wasn't wrong.

759
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,070
I took it...

760
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:52,510
too personally.

761
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:10,330
(Eagle Brewery)

762
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:24,510
(Eagle Brewery)

763
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:50,200
I already made myself clear.

764
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,700
I won't stop working at the brewery!

765
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:55,000
I have ideas and plans of my own.

766
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,810
You keep telling me what to do,

767
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:58,710
and that's bullying.

768
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:17,060
Hello?

769
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,390
It's me.

770
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:20,900
I'm outside the brewery,

771
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,200
so meet me out here.

772
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,100
Outside the brewery?

773
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,500
But I'm on my way to your house.

774
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:29,500
You're on your way to my house?

775
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:32,210
But I'm outside the brewery.

776
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,040
What do we do?

777
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:36,910
Then...

778
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:39,350
I'll head home right now.

779
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:40,380
Actually, no.

780
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:43,280
You have to come back
to the brewery anyway,

781
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,790
so I'll wait for you here.

782
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:47,920
Got it. I'll get there
as fast as I can,

783
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,060
so sit tight.

784
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,860
I'm happy to wait,
so take your time.

785
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:53,800
Just drive safely, okay?

786
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,530
(Eagle Brewery)

787
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,180
I bet I made you wait long.

788
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:15,680
There was more traffic
than usual today.

789
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,690
I should've called in advance.

790
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:19,750
I made you drive for no reason.

791
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:23,990
Likewise, I guess.

792
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,300
For a long time,

793
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:40,080
I believed I was mature.

794
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:43,780
Only after meeting you,

795
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,880
did I realize
that I was inexperienced...

796
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:49,620
and that I could be childish
at times.

797
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:53,990
For that, I thank you.

798
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,530
If it weren't for you,
I might have never realized it.

799
00:55:58,990 --> 00:55:59,990
Same here.

800
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,970
For someone else's happiness,

801
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,700
I have to change my ways
and learn to compromise.

802
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,870
That's what I've realized.

803
00:56:12,610 --> 00:56:15,040
Thank you for being understanding.

804
00:56:16,410 --> 00:56:17,910
I'm the one who's more grateful.

805
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:22,520
Let's not argue anymore.

806
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,690
I really don't have the energy...

807
00:56:26,190 --> 00:56:27,420
for a lover's quarrel at this age.

808
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:32,760
I agree.

809
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,570
Up until a year ago,

810
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,170
we were complete strangers.

811
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:45,810
Just being together is a huge gift
all on its own.

812
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,750
I won't get greedy
and want more than that.

813
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:53,150
I'll leave it to you...

814
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:56,950
to handle all matters
at the brewery.

815
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:00,620
I won't...

816
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,320
be stubborn about just what I want.

817
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:05,390
I'll also think about...

818
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:08,260
what is best...

819
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,530
for everyone else too.

820
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,470
(Eagle Brewery)

821
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,210
Why are you all gathered like this?

822
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,550
Oh, right.

823
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,320
Kwang Sook.

824
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:03,280
We have something to tell you,

825
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,490
so have a seat.

826
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,740
I'm sorry for how I behaved.

827
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:25,140
Heung Soo.

828
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:29,410
The thought of losing you upset me,

829
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:33,550
so I foolishly acted out like that.

830
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:36,480
That was childish of me.

831
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:39,390
Please forgive me, Kwang Sook.

832
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:45,490
To be honest,

833
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:47,730
I was...

834
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,200
upset at first.

835
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:53,330
But then, I realized...

836
00:58:53,740 --> 00:58:57,310
you only reacted that way
because you loved...

837
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,210
and cared for me so much.

838
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:04,410
There aren't any brothers...

839
00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:05,710
who'd be this worked up...

840
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,250
just because
their widowed sister-in-law...

841
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:10,890
was seeing someone new.

842
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:13,720
They wouldn't even care.

843
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:20,860
You only responded this way...

844
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,070
because you care about me...

845
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:26,270
and are deeply fond of me.

846
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:31,270
Am I wrong?

847
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:33,210
You're right, Kwang Sook.

848
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:48,420
Kwang Sook.

849
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:52,930
You've stayed loyal to Jang Soo...

850
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,530
and have done enough for us.

851
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:00,640
The brewery...

852
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,940
and us.

853
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:05,610
Set your worries aside...

854
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,510
and put yourself first.

855
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,080
He's right.

856
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:14,380
Do that, Kwang Sook.

857
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:22,560
Thank you.

858
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,490
I'm so relieved...

859
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,160
to hear you...

860
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,400
say that.

861
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:53,960
But...

862
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:56,890
it's not over yet.

863
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,690
There's one more hurdle left.

864
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:31,130
Let's go.

865
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,300
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

866
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:43,170
Come in.

867
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:49,910
Eagle Brewery's
Vice-CEO Oh Chun Soo...

868
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:51,510
is here with his brothers.

869
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:54,150
They're all here? Let them in.

870
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:55,350
Yes, sir.

871
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,020
Why are they all here?

872
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,190
Hello.

873
01:02:07,730 --> 01:02:09,560
Welcome. Take a seat.

874
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,070
Go on.

875
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:21,180
What brought you all here
without an appointment?

876
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:26,010
Well, we have decided...

877
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:30,550
to root for our sister-in-law's
new relationship.

878
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:34,860
Did you? I'm really grateful.

879
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,790
But we can't hand over...

880
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:41,030
our precious sister-in-law
just like that.

881
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:52,840
We need to know if you're
a good and deserving match for her.

882
01:02:53,370 --> 01:02:55,610
And to find out,
we must put you through a test.

883
01:02:58,210 --> 01:02:59,210
A test?

884
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:51,200
(For Eagle Brothers)

885
01:03:51,500 --> 01:03:53,530
Not long ago, at last,

886
01:03:53,870 --> 01:03:56,870
I happened to find out
who your mother is.

887
01:03:57,140 --> 01:03:58,270
Aren't you interested?

888
01:03:58,270 --> 01:03:59,570
You must know.

889
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,910
That's the stupidest thing
I've heard.

890
01:04:02,410 --> 01:04:04,780
- What?
- You know that so well,

891
01:04:04,950 --> 01:04:06,510
and you upset me this much?

892
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:10,050
I'm a pretty competitive person.

893
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,750
I decided to gladly take the test.

894
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:15,060
I want to train
with an experienced instructor.

895
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:16,890
Book me a special training session.

896
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:20,090
You can do it.

897
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,600
Keep going!
