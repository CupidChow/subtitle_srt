00:00:01,625 --> 00:00:02,795
(Episode 7)

2
00:00:02,795 --> 00:00:05,565
What... What are you doing?

3
00:00:06,196 --> 00:00:09,196
Of course. I knew it couldn't be true.

4
00:00:10,035 --> 00:00:12,665
You wouldn't have died leaving me all alone.

5
00:00:14,465 --> 00:00:17,435
Do you know what kind of horrible nightmare I had?

6
00:00:17,906 --> 00:00:21,476
In this nightmare, you died in a car accident.

7
00:00:21,476 --> 00:00:23,746
Hey, look here.

8
00:00:24,046 --> 00:00:25,386
You have the wrong person.

9
00:00:26,816 --> 00:00:28,885
Do you have any idea how sad I was?

10
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:33,826
It was as if my heart was melting away.

11
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,156
Thank you.

12
00:00:39,025 --> 00:00:41,095
Thank you for being alive.

13
00:00:42,635 --> 00:00:44,396
What on earth are you doing?

14
00:00:44,396 --> 00:00:46,006
Stop that.

15
00:00:46,006 --> 00:00:47,266
What's your deal?

16
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:49,305
Unbelievable.

17
00:01:02,456 --> 00:01:03,586
Go away.

18
00:01:05,055 --> 00:01:06,185
Go away.

19
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:08,896
What... Hey!

20
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:41,486
Do you need me to pat your back?

21
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:44,956
No, I'm good.

22
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:47,926
It's all out.

23
00:01:52,566 --> 00:01:53,836
Here. Take it.

24
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:56,036
Thank you.

25
00:02:00,876 --> 00:02:01,976
My gosh.

26
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:11,156
Hold on.

27
00:02:12,186 --> 00:02:13,885
Where did...

28
00:02:14,686 --> 00:02:15,895
my Jang Soo go?

29
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:20,726
Jang Soo.

30
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:24,466
Jang Soo?

31
00:02:25,135 --> 00:02:26,135
Well,

32
00:02:28,476 --> 00:02:30,406
you seem to be looking for your husband,

33
00:02:31,075 --> 00:02:32,346
but he isn't here.

34
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:34,406
Where did he go?

35
00:02:35,746 --> 00:02:37,346
You might be feeling foggy from the alcohol,

36
00:02:38,276 --> 00:02:40,045
but I suggest you think carefully.

37
00:02:40,045 --> 00:02:42,686
It's impossible for your husband to be here.

38
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:45,925
Your husband...

39
00:02:55,265 --> 00:02:56,835
I'm all alone again.

40
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:00,265
Again, it's just me.

41
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:03,705
Everyone's gone,

42
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:06,376
and I'm the only one left.

43
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:14,145
I'm scared, Jang Soo.

44
00:03:17,316 --> 00:03:18,925
I may be putting on...

45
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:21,325
a brave face in front of others,

46
00:03:23,395 --> 00:03:25,696
but I'm scared to be honest.

47
00:03:27,795 --> 00:03:30,795
It's tough to run a brewery...

48
00:03:31,265 --> 00:03:32,536
without you,

49
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:37,135
and I'm scared about how my life...

50
00:03:37,376 --> 00:03:38,906
will turn out to be.

51
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:45,346
Where did you go leaving me all alone?

52
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:51,286
You jerk.

53
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:53,425
You coward!

54
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:55,855
Oh Jang Soo!

55
00:03:56,526 --> 00:03:58,156
Where are you?

56
00:03:59,026 --> 00:04:00,925
Get out here!

57
00:04:01,496 --> 00:04:03,665
Show yourself until I count to ten,

58
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:06,406
or I'll kill you myself.

59
00:04:07,365 --> 00:04:08,466
One!

60
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:10,406
Two!

61
00:04:11,306 --> 00:04:12,606
Three!

62
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:14,946
What a piece of work.

63
00:04:16,616 --> 00:04:19,285
Hey, get a grip on yourself.

64
00:04:19,285 --> 00:04:20,345
Seven.

65
00:04:21,585 --> 00:04:22,955
Eight!

66
00:04:23,186 --> 00:04:24,385
Lower your voice.

67
00:04:24,385 --> 00:04:26,385
- Others will see you. - Nine!

68
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:28,356
Nine and a half.

69
00:04:28,996 --> 00:04:31,556
Nine and three-quarters.

70
00:04:32,296 --> 00:04:34,566
Nine and seven-eighths.

71
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:40,736
Ten?

72
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:44,506
That I'll count in the morning.

73
00:04:45,006 --> 00:04:46,145
So...

74
00:04:47,446 --> 00:04:49,015
show yourself...

75
00:04:49,345 --> 00:04:51,816
before I count to ten!

76
00:04:52,015 --> 00:04:55,246
Do you hear me, Oh Jang Soo?

77
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:01,856
What the...

78
00:05:06,465 --> 00:05:08,635
After causing all the commotion,

79
00:05:09,736 --> 00:05:10,936
she fell asleep?

80
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:13,306
Hey.

81
00:05:14,835 --> 00:05:16,176
It's dangerous to sleep out here.

82
00:05:16,176 --> 00:05:17,506
Get up already.

83
00:05:24,546 --> 00:05:26,916
Hey. Someone's calling you.

84
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:29,116
Answer your phone.

85
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:34,725
Where are you?

86
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:36,025
What's taking you so long...

87
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:37,926
when you only went out for some fresh air?

88
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:39,196
Hello?

89
00:05:40,926 --> 00:05:43,765
Isn't this Ma Kwang Sook's phone?

90
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:44,796
It is.

91
00:05:44,965 --> 00:05:47,535
But your daughter was so drunk...

92
00:05:48,436 --> 00:05:49,736
that she fell asleep.

93
00:05:50,535 --> 00:05:51,975
Unbelievable.

94
00:05:52,475 --> 00:05:53,475
Right.

95
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:55,446
May I ask where she is?

96
00:05:57,475 --> 00:05:59,186
Hold on. Watch it.

97
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,385
Here you go.

98
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:04,455
My gosh.

99
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:12,666
Darn it.

100
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:15,196
Hey, Kwang Sook!

101
00:06:15,765 --> 00:06:17,035
Where are you?

102
00:06:17,996 --> 00:06:19,236
Ma Kwang Sook.

103
00:06:20,106 --> 00:06:21,465
Ma Kwang Sook?

104
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:23,436
Oh, there she is.

105
00:06:23,436 --> 00:06:26,205
Kwang Sook, hey. What are you doing out here?

106
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:30,816
I can't believe she dropped out cold.

107
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,515
This is no place to fall asleep.

108
00:06:32,585 --> 00:06:34,616
Kwang Sook, hey.

109
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:36,856
Wake up, will you?

110
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,785
That hurts.

111
00:06:38,785 --> 00:06:39,785
Wake up!

112
00:06:39,785 --> 00:06:42,225
That hurts.

113
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:44,395
Get up. We're going home.

114
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:45,525
Get up.

115
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:48,666
Gosh, how can you be this heavy?

116
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,166
Goodness me.

117
00:06:55,635 --> 00:06:56,876
I just can't.

118
00:06:58,905 --> 00:07:01,876
Goodness. Over here!

119
00:07:02,746 --> 00:07:04,746
Over here.

120
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:06,585
Can you come out here...

121
00:07:06,585 --> 00:07:08,246
and help me?

122
00:07:11,316 --> 00:07:12,356
I'm sorry to ask this,

123
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:14,225
but can you help me get her in a cab?

124
00:07:14,926 --> 00:07:16,155
Yes, of course.

125
00:07:16,155 --> 00:07:17,256
In 1, 2, 3.

126
00:07:17,455 --> 00:07:19,166
Lift!

127
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:43,986
But this...

128
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:48,385
Darn.

129
00:07:48,455 --> 00:07:52,265
(Vacant)

130
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:57,595
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

131
00:07:58,335 --> 00:08:00,135
- Please get home safely. - Right.

132
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:12,075
Evening, Chairman Han.

133
00:08:13,616 --> 00:08:14,916
Keep up the good work.

134
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:23,825
Darn it.

135
00:08:25,395 --> 00:08:27,325
You're home.

136
00:08:28,495 --> 00:08:31,365
That smile makes you look like my daughter again.

137
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:33,766
Are you feeling yourself now?

138
00:08:33,766 --> 00:08:34,806
Yes.

139
00:08:34,906 --> 00:08:36,636
She finished a whole bowl of rice.

140
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:38,705
Good going.

141
00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:40,306
By the way,

142
00:08:40,306 --> 00:08:42,776
I heard you'd be cutting the ribbon at the gallery tomorrow.

143
00:08:43,245 --> 00:08:44,345
How did you know?

144
00:08:44,516 --> 00:08:47,046
Professor Kim Ja Young told me.

145
00:08:47,115 --> 00:08:48,546
You must've been invited.

146
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,755
Professor Kim Ja Young?

147
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:53,056
Dad, come on.

148
00:08:53,355 --> 00:08:55,825
Remember the professor I introduced to you?

149
00:08:56,495 --> 00:08:57,656
Oh, her.

150
00:08:58,396 --> 00:09:00,896
If you meet her tomorrow, acknowledge her first.

151
00:09:00,896 --> 00:09:03,296
You have to greet her, okay?

152
00:09:03,595 --> 00:09:06,436
You nagging me again...

153
00:09:06,436 --> 00:09:08,705
proves that you're back to your normal self.

154
00:09:27,325 --> 00:09:28,825
Here you go.

155
00:09:48,345 --> 00:09:49,575
Hi, Gyeol.

156
00:09:49,776 --> 00:09:50,975
Your first lecture was today.

157
00:09:51,345 --> 00:09:52,615
Did it go well?

158
00:09:52,946 --> 00:09:54,046
Yes.

159
00:09:54,715 --> 00:09:56,156
I went to the lecture...

160
00:09:56,316 --> 00:09:58,416
and got some work done in the art room.

161
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:02,056
Hey. Do you know who I met on campus today?

162
00:10:03,255 --> 00:10:04,355
Who did you meet?

163
00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:06,426
Lieutenant Oh.

164
00:10:06,495 --> 00:10:08,595
- Oh Kang Soo? - Yes.

165
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:10,266
His brother must go to my university.

166
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:11,936
He was on his way back from a visit.

167
00:10:13,105 --> 00:10:14,235
I see.

168
00:10:14,605 --> 00:10:15,906
You know what's strange?

169
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:20,446
Lieutenant Oh always shows up when I'm in danger.

170
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,046
Why? Did something happen today?

171
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,186
It wasn't a big deal.

172
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:28,916
I almost bumped into a bicycle.

173
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:31,615
Lieutenant Oh saved me.

174
00:10:48,766 --> 00:10:50,605
I heard you had middle ear inflammation as a child.

175
00:10:51,075 --> 00:10:52,845
Yes, a few times.

176
00:10:52,845 --> 00:10:55,745
Your hearing issue is worsening due to repeated diver training.

177
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:57,776
If you're not careful about this,

178
00:10:58,146 --> 00:10:59,845
you might lose your hearing down the road.

179
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,255
Are my ears ringing now too?

180
00:11:10,995 --> 00:11:12,566
Okay.

181
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,335
What's wrong?

182
00:11:24,436 --> 00:11:26,406
Why won't it light up? I'm starving.

183
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,386
Darn it. It's so annoying.

184
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:37,855
I should escape this darn rooftop.

185
00:11:41,686 --> 00:11:44,725
Nothing in that darn room works.

186
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:48,495
Ma'am!

187
00:11:50,235 --> 00:11:51,235
Hi.

188
00:11:51,896 --> 00:11:54,365
The gas stove won't light. It must be jammed.

189
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,906
Why would it be jammed? It's fine.

190
00:11:57,205 --> 00:11:59,176
I left the notice that your payment was behind.

191
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,176
You didn't pay it?

192
00:12:00,205 --> 00:12:02,916
- A payment notice? - They cut the gas if you don't pay.

193
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:05,546
Did I or did I not tell you?

194
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:07,916
Shoot. I forgot.

195
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,816
How could you forget that of all things?

196
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:13,026
Call the gas company and pay what you owe!

197
00:12:13,485 --> 00:12:14,656
Okay.

198
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:16,926
Don't just say you will!

199
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:21,026
It's too late now. There's no point in calling.

200
00:12:21,026 --> 00:12:24,066
I'll pay everything I owe at 9am sharp tomorrow.

201
00:12:24,066 --> 00:12:25,266
Don't worry.

202
00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:27,536
Goodness. That fool...

203
00:12:35,745 --> 00:12:38,146
I can't believe I'm stuck without gas.

204
00:12:42,585 --> 00:12:44,516
I need a more fundamental solution.

205
00:12:47,255 --> 00:12:51,196
(Closed for the day)

206
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:55,325
I'm keeping you open way too late.

207
00:12:55,325 --> 00:12:56,335
You must be tired.

208
00:12:57,995 --> 00:12:59,705
It's not like I commute.

209
00:12:59,806 --> 00:13:03,475
I can lock the door and rest as soon as I'm done.

210
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:06,406
You're the richest person in this market,

211
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:08,306
and you eat and sleep here?

212
00:13:08,646 --> 00:13:10,345
You're too frugal.

213
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:13,115
I'm not rich.

214
00:13:13,115 --> 00:13:15,745
My gosh. You can't dupe me.

215
00:13:15,855 --> 00:13:18,855
You bought a lot of land and retail spaces through my agency.

216
00:13:19,255 --> 00:13:20,386
Hey.

217
00:13:21,526 --> 00:13:22,955
You can't go around...

218
00:13:22,955 --> 00:13:26,526
telling people your clients' personal information.

219
00:13:26,526 --> 00:13:29,136
Don't you worry.

220
00:13:29,136 --> 00:13:30,196
My lips...

221
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:33,235
have three zippers sewn into them.

222
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:39,975
By the way,

223
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:43,316
the piano academy by the crossroads...

224
00:13:43,676 --> 00:13:45,615
- Angel Piano? - Yes.

225
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:49,386
That building it's in. Does it belong to Ms. Kim?

226
00:13:50,556 --> 00:13:52,215
No. It's a monthly rental.

227
00:13:52,355 --> 00:13:53,355
What?

228
00:13:53,526 --> 00:13:55,955
It's not even an annual lease?

229
00:13:57,026 --> 00:14:00,225
I think she leased the place through me ten years ago.

230
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:04,235
I was told her parents were rich.

231
00:14:04,936 --> 00:14:06,136
Why a monthly rental?

232
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:09,066
Why? Are you interested?

233
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:11,875
The building owner asked me...

234
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,505
a few days ago to sell it urgently.

235
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:17,146
An urgent sale?

236
00:14:24,455 --> 00:14:25,656
My gosh.

237
00:14:29,056 --> 00:14:30,855
She's doing her best to keep going,

238
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:33,666
but she's only human.

239
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:38,735
Oh, dear.

240
00:14:39,536 --> 00:14:42,235
It must be hard to get through it sober.

241
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,046
Dad's right here, Ha Ni.

242
00:14:54,245 --> 00:14:56,816
I'll bring the bath water very soon.

243
00:15:09,566 --> 00:15:10,766
Darn it.

244
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,136
What the heck?

245
00:15:19,136 --> 00:15:22,046
Ha Ni. Dad's sorry. I'll be right there.

246
00:15:22,146 --> 00:15:23,215
Don't cry.

247
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:29,886
Hey.

248
00:15:30,186 --> 00:15:33,755
I was getting some water to bathe you.

249
00:15:34,585 --> 00:15:37,696
I won't go anywhere and leave you alone, so don't cry.

250
00:15:37,825 --> 00:15:40,696
Come on. It's okay.

251
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:42,835
I know.

252
00:15:45,296 --> 00:15:47,066
Why is it so hard to reach you?

253
00:15:47,566 --> 00:15:48,835
Are you not answering on purpose?

254
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,406
I serve tables at diners,

255
00:15:55,306 --> 00:15:57,245
and it's not easy to take calls.

256
00:15:57,475 --> 00:15:58,845
Why do you have to work?

257
00:16:01,016 --> 00:16:02,245
Can't you tell?

258
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:04,886
It's because you don't send enough money.

259
00:16:05,485 --> 00:16:07,825
I don't send as much as before, but it's not a small sum.

260
00:16:08,026 --> 00:16:09,625
- If you spend less... - Don't you know...

261
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,125
prices here have skyrocketed?

262
00:16:12,995 --> 00:16:14,896
We've been short on money for a while.

263
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:17,436
I told you to come home.

264
00:16:17,566 --> 00:16:20,205
We agreed you would come back when Yeoung Ju started high school.

265
00:16:20,205 --> 00:16:21,266
I'm no longer sure.

266
00:16:22,505 --> 00:16:23,505
What?

267
00:16:26,406 --> 00:16:28,306
I'm not sure I can live there anymore.

268
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:31,375
Why are you not sure? What are you worried about?

269
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,715
With Jang Soo gone, now you're the eldest.

270
00:16:35,585 --> 00:16:37,686
I don't think I can take on the role of the eldest daughter-in-law...

271
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:39,585
and care for your brothers.

272
00:16:39,656 --> 00:16:41,855
No one expects that of you.

273
00:16:42,286 --> 00:16:43,296
Anyway,

274
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,825
I prefer to live like this.

275
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:47,426
You want to live like this forever?

276
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,725
What about me, then?

277
00:16:49,026 --> 00:16:50,735
Am I a machine that makes and sends money?

278
00:16:51,936 --> 00:16:54,205
Do you think you're all that because you send us some?

279
00:16:54,235 --> 00:16:56,335
What? Is that all you can say?

280
00:16:57,406 --> 00:16:58,406
I'm tired.

281
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,775
- Let's talk another time. - Don't hang up.

282
00:17:00,906 --> 00:17:02,846
Honey. Hello?

283
00:17:03,515 --> 00:17:05,076
Hello?

284
00:17:49,285 --> 00:17:50,995
Ta-da. Cheers.

285
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:53,666
This wine tastes really good.

286
00:18:06,606 --> 00:18:07,606
Mom.

287
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:09,975
Mom!

288
00:18:12,815 --> 00:18:15,116
Mom. Wake up.

289
00:18:15,116 --> 00:18:16,116
Darn it.

290
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:21,926
What's the fuss about?

291
00:18:22,225 --> 00:18:25,096
My phone. Do you have it?

292
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:28,626
Why would I have your phone?

293
00:18:28,626 --> 00:18:29,735
Where is it, then?

294
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,166
Did I leave it in the taxi yesterday?

295
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:34,205
Or at the restaurant?

296
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:35,465
It wasn't the restaurant.

297
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:38,035
When I called you from the restaurant last night...

298
00:18:39,545 --> 00:18:41,805
Some guy answered.

299
00:18:42,916 --> 00:18:45,515
Some guy answered my phone?

300
00:18:45,745 --> 00:18:48,285
Yes. I called to ask where you were.

301
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:52,285
He said you were drunk and fell asleep.

302
00:18:54,586 --> 00:18:55,586
Who was that?

303
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:57,055
Oh, dear.

304
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,295
Hello?

305
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:06,205
Hello?

306
00:19:06,805 --> 00:19:09,035
I'm sorry to call this early.

307
00:19:09,305 --> 00:19:11,836
I own the phone you just answered.

308
00:19:13,576 --> 00:19:14,606
So what?

309
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:17,275
Did you find that phone...

310
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,686
at LX Hotel yesterday?

311
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:21,646
Yes.

312
00:19:23,616 --> 00:19:24,656
I see.

313
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:29,025
If you tell me where you are,

314
00:19:29,156 --> 00:19:30,995
I'll come and get the phone.

315
00:19:31,225 --> 00:19:33,096
I have plans, so not right now.

316
00:19:33,795 --> 00:19:36,235
I'll leave it at the front desk of LX Hotel in the afternoon.

317
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:37,235
Come and get it.

318
00:19:37,436 --> 00:19:38,735
Sorry.

319
00:19:38,896 --> 00:19:40,436
Not having my phone...

320
00:19:40,436 --> 00:19:43,005
really disrupts my work, you see.

321
00:19:43,505 --> 00:19:44,535
If you don't mind,

322
00:19:44,535 --> 00:19:46,205
can I get it back now?

323
00:19:48,406 --> 00:19:49,446
Fine.

324
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:51,846
Come to the coffee shop on the first floor...

325
00:19:51,846 --> 00:19:54,416
of Museum Jino by 11am.

326
00:19:54,515 --> 00:19:56,416
That's the fastest time.

327
00:19:57,686 --> 00:19:59,356
Okay. I'll be there.

328
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:01,386
I'll see you soon.

329
00:20:06,396 --> 00:20:07,396
What?

330
00:20:07,926 --> 00:20:10,436
His voice sounds familiar.

331
00:20:10,936 --> 00:20:12,065
Gosh, it hurts!

332
00:20:12,396 --> 00:20:13,606
Why did you hit me?

333
00:20:13,606 --> 00:20:14,836
How could you drink...

334
00:20:14,836 --> 00:20:17,076
until you passed out at a place like that, you fool?

335
00:20:17,076 --> 00:20:19,205
You even lost your phone.

336
00:20:19,205 --> 00:20:20,205
- You brat! - Gosh.

337
00:20:20,205 --> 00:20:22,005
It's not like my back is a volleyball!

338
00:20:22,005 --> 00:20:23,946
Stop smashing it!

339
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:32,218
Why are you picking at your food?

340
00:20:32,949 --> 00:20:34,318
Is something bothering you?

341
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,089
How about I quit the graduate school?

342
00:20:40,788 --> 00:20:42,399
Why would you quit?

343
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:46,228
To be honest, I don't know...

344
00:20:46,228 --> 00:20:47,998
why I have to take the MBA course.

345
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:51,169
How many times do I have to tell you?

346
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:53,169
You have to study management...

347
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,109
to become the CEO of LX Hotel.

348
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:57,808
It's not like I can become the CEO just because I want to.

349
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:59,208
- You... - Hang on.

350
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,518
Is there something going on between you and Gyeol?

351
00:21:04,048 --> 00:21:05,488
Don't be silly.

352
00:21:05,619 --> 00:21:07,818
Why would she have a problem with Gyeol?

353
00:21:08,189 --> 00:21:10,089
Just like his name,

354
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:12,288
Gyeol is always nice and kind to Se Ri.

355
00:21:12,288 --> 00:21:13,389
Stop it, seriously.

356
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:15,058
I told you...

357
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:16,929
there's nothing going on between Gyeol and me.

358
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:20,169
When there's nothing going on,

359
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:21,599
why would he call you every night...

360
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:22,899
and say goodnight?

361
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:24,298
That's just...

362
00:21:24,939 --> 00:21:26,808
See? You have nothing to say.

363
00:21:27,008 --> 00:21:29,278
But we don't say anything special.

364
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:31,679
Tell him to be a man!

365
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,308
He should move things forward.

366
00:21:33,308 --> 00:21:36,079
It's not that he's not a man.

367
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:38,488
Let's say he's discreet.

368
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:39,919
He hasn't finished his military service yet.

369
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:42,018
When will he finish it?

370
00:21:42,018 --> 00:21:44,458
I guess he has a couple of months to go.

371
00:21:45,758 --> 00:21:47,228
I'm telling you.

372
00:21:47,788 --> 00:21:49,028
He will propose to you...

373
00:21:49,028 --> 00:21:50,998
the day he finishes his military service.

374
00:21:52,268 --> 00:21:54,869
You'll see if what I say is right or not.

375
00:22:09,718 --> 00:22:10,718
Well...

376
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:13,919
Are you sure you're not getting ahead of yourself?

377
00:22:14,389 --> 00:22:16,659
- What do you mean? - I'm talking about Gyeol.

378
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:18,889
Are you sure he's into Se Ri?

379
00:22:18,889 --> 00:22:20,958
I'm sure about that.

380
00:22:21,528 --> 00:22:23,028
If Gyeol's mom was alive,

381
00:22:23,028 --> 00:22:26,068
we would've taken care of it already for our children.

382
00:22:27,568 --> 00:22:30,339
I can't discuss things with Chairman Han.

383
00:22:31,369 --> 00:22:35,008
Maybe you should meet with Chairman Han.

384
00:22:36,778 --> 00:22:39,949
It's somewhat uncomfortable.

385
00:22:40,748 --> 00:22:44,278
I don't feel like calling him and asking him to meet me.

386
00:22:45,288 --> 00:22:47,149
I'll meet with Gyeol...

387
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:49,218
and ask him about it soon.

388
00:22:49,218 --> 00:22:50,919
You don't have to worry.

389
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:53,429
Just focus on your new product.

390
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:57,599
Of all the makgeolli you've ever made,

391
00:22:57,599 --> 00:22:59,498
the one I had yesterday was the best.

392
00:22:59,768 --> 00:23:02,339
There's no way it won't hit the jackpot.

393
00:23:02,568 --> 00:23:04,639
So you should let me take care of Se Ri...

394
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:07,808
and just focus on your work for the new product.

395
00:23:07,808 --> 00:23:08,939
Okay?

396
00:23:20,488 --> 00:23:23,159
They say three sparrows near a school recite the primer.

397
00:23:23,288 --> 00:23:25,389
He's only made lame liquors,

398
00:23:25,829 --> 00:23:27,058
but it's different this time.

399
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,699
What is it that's bothering you?

400
00:23:36,238 --> 00:23:39,808
Why do you suddenly want to quit the graduate school?

401
00:23:39,968 --> 00:23:42,339
To be honest, I'm not too interested in studying.

402
00:23:43,738 --> 00:23:47,109
You sent me to good academies and got me good tutors,

403
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:49,018
so I was lucky to go to college.

404
00:23:49,649 --> 00:23:52,048
But I don't want to study at graduate school.

405
00:23:52,488 --> 00:23:54,288
Why would you say that after all this time?

406
00:23:54,288 --> 00:23:56,058
You're about to finish graduate school.

407
00:23:56,619 --> 00:23:58,258
- And... - And what?

408
00:23:58,788 --> 00:24:01,998
I'm really worried about the mistake I made to the professor.

409
00:24:02,758 --> 00:24:05,169
When I think about the next semester,

410
00:24:05,169 --> 00:24:06,468
I just feel hopeless.

411
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:08,639
Oh, dear.

412
00:24:09,568 --> 00:24:12,909
My daughter is so innocent and sweet.

413
00:24:13,008 --> 00:24:14,038
It's no big deal.

414
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:16,308
A mistake like that is nothing.

415
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,449
Are you sure it will be all right?

416
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,079
Of course.

417
00:24:20,478 --> 00:24:22,718
He's a professor, not a little kid.

418
00:24:22,718 --> 00:24:25,318
He wouldn't hold a grudge over such a trivial thing.

419
00:24:25,318 --> 00:24:26,318
It doesn't make sense.

420
00:24:26,318 --> 00:24:28,089
I know, right? That can't be right.

421
00:24:28,818 --> 00:24:29,958
Of course not.

422
00:24:30,788 --> 00:24:32,629
And all mistakes aren't the same.

423
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:35,599
It doesn't seem so bad when you make a mistake.

424
00:24:36,199 --> 00:24:38,728
You're a person who can't be hated by others.

425
00:24:40,998 --> 00:24:42,699
I'm telling you.

426
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:57,048
Gosh, she looks so pretty.

427
00:24:57,879 --> 00:24:59,389
Are you here for vaccination?

428
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:00,718
Well... Yes.

429
00:25:01,488 --> 00:25:03,458
You're such a sweet dad.

430
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:06,629
My husband makes such a big deal out of it...

431
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:08,498
only after changing a diaper.

432
00:25:08,498 --> 00:25:10,058
My son is wide awake...

433
00:25:10,058 --> 00:25:12,699
and doesn't want to sleep at night,

434
00:25:12,699 --> 00:25:14,329
but my husband goes to his room...

435
00:25:14,329 --> 00:25:16,339
and falls asleep right away at ten o'clock every night.

436
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:18,669
But you're here to have your daughter vaccinated.

437
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:21,139
Your wife is so lucky.

438
00:25:21,139 --> 00:25:22,909
You're the best.

439
00:25:24,278 --> 00:25:25,379
Oh Ha Ni.

440
00:25:25,808 --> 00:25:26,949
Yes.

441
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:28,449
Please go into the injection room.

442
00:25:28,449 --> 00:25:29,548
Okay.

443
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:30,748
All right.

444
00:25:31,318 --> 00:25:32,449
Let's go.

445
00:25:33,389 --> 00:25:34,619
How sweet.

446
00:25:36,788 --> 00:25:37,988
Wait.

447
00:25:38,389 --> 00:25:41,228
Please be gentle so it won't hurt so much.

448
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:45,329
You seem more nervous than Na Ni.

449
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:46,369
All right.

450
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:51,038
Hang on.

451
00:25:53,139 --> 00:25:54,208
Ha Ni.

452
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:56,579
It will sting a little.

453
00:25:57,238 --> 00:25:58,949
Don't be surprised, okay?

454
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:00,609
All right.

455
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:07,818
Yes, we're ready now.

456
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:10,389
It looks like...

457
00:26:10,389 --> 00:26:12,458
you're getting a shot, not Ha Ni.

458
00:26:14,058 --> 00:26:15,399
It will be over quickly.

459
00:26:15,429 --> 00:26:16,429
Okay.

460
00:26:17,758 --> 00:26:18,768
Oh, no.

00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:23,998
"Folk painting meets modern times."

462
00:26:23,998 --> 00:26:25,708
We will start the grand opening...

463
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:29,038
with the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

464
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:32,778

469
00:26:54,068 --> 00:26:57,768
Thank you again for your support every year.

470
00:26:57,768 --> 00:26:59,139
It's my pleasure.

471
00:26:59,139 --> 00:27:00,909
I'm doing this because I want to.

472
00:27:01,439 --> 00:27:04,679
I hear your daughter is also majoring in art.

473
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:07,179
I hope that we will have the opportunity...

474
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:10,778
to exhibit her work at this place soon.

475
00:27:10,778 --> 00:27:12,389
My daughter recently changed...

476
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:15,589
her major from fine art to design.

477
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:18,159
Mr. Han.

478
00:27:19,689 --> 00:27:20,728
Please excuse me.

(Folk Painting Meets Modern Times, Museum Jino)

480
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:25,369
It's been a while, Ms. Kim.

481
00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:28,738
I heard about you occasionally through Bom.

482
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:30,568
Have you been doing well?

483
00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:33,439
Yes. I'm doing fine.

484
00:27:33,508 --> 00:27:35,308
I had an overseas exhibition scheduled,

485
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:37,609
so I was too busy to come here,

486
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:40,708
but I made time to come because the sponsor is LX Group.

487
00:27:41,349 --> 00:27:43,919
Is there anything you want to say to me?

488
00:27:46,089 --> 00:27:47,748
Are you trying to draw the line again?

489
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:52,589
Please buy me some tea if you have time.

490
00:27:55,228 --> 00:27:57,829
I have an appointment today.

491
00:27:57,899 --> 00:27:59,869
Maybe next time.

492
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:06,738
What was that?

493
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,339
Did he just reject me?

494
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:20,419
What?

495
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,458
What are you doing here?

496
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:38,439
Is it you...

497
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:41,768
who have my phone?

498
00:28:46,508 --> 00:28:48,079
Seriously.

499
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:50,179
Why didn't you say anything on the phone earlier?

500
00:28:50,218 --> 00:28:51,419
Did I have to?

501
00:28:51,988 --> 00:28:54,919
I wouldn't have worried if you had told me it was you.

502
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:58,058
No wonder your voice sounded familiar.

503
00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:01,129
I'll get going now that I've returned your phone.

504
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:03,298
Hold on.

505
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:05,798
Stay for a cup of coffee.

506
00:29:19,649 --> 00:29:20,708
That was refreshing.

507
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,218
Nothing cures a hangover like an iced Americano.

508
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:29,988
By the way, I didn't see you at the hotel yesterday.

509
00:29:30,718 --> 00:29:31,958
Were you working the night shift?

510
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:34,889
I guess...

511
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:37,728
I worked until quite late.

512
00:29:37,998 --> 00:29:39,929
I was invited to the MVG Club dinner party...

513
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:41,829
at LX Hotel yesterday.

514
00:29:42,568 --> 00:29:44,738
I'm not a member of the MVG Club,

515
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:47,508
but I was selected to represent the wedding shop clients.

516
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:51,109
Did the food suit your palate?

517
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:53,179
It was incredible.

518
00:29:53,308 --> 00:29:56,718
On top of that, Dal Perignon was served for free.

519
00:29:56,978 --> 00:29:59,589
Now I know why LX Hotel is one of the finest hotels.

520
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:04,288
If I ever get married again, I'll do so at that hotel.

521
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,129
Who knows? I might get invited to the dinner party again.

522
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:09,329
What?

523
00:30:10,829 --> 00:30:12,699
That was a joke.

524
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:17,568
They say we drink poison if it's served for free,

525
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:19,939
so how could I not drink the expensive Dal Perignon...

526
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,609
when it was free of charge?

527
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:23,139
I drank two bottles on an empty stomach,

528
00:30:23,139 --> 00:30:26,449
but it was the third bottle that had me intoxicated.

529
00:30:26,949 --> 00:30:30,248
I'm not one to get drunk easily,

530
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:32,089
but I totally...

531
00:30:33,788 --> 00:30:34,818
blacked out last night.

532
00:30:39,728 --> 00:30:40,889
Did you perhaps...

533
00:30:41,058 --> 00:30:43,758
see me wasted yesterday?

534
00:30:45,498 --> 00:30:46,728
I did.

535
00:30:49,768 --> 00:30:50,869
So you did.

536
00:30:51,968 --> 00:30:54,508
Was I in a drunken frenzy?

537
00:30:57,879 --> 00:31:00,008
Do you actually not remember anything,

538
00:31:00,048 --> 00:31:01,609
or are you feigning ignorance?

539
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:06,248
I have no recollection of what happened.

540
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:08,919
There's no need for me to tell you...

541
00:31:09,058 --> 00:31:10,589
what you don't remember,

542
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,728
so I won't answer that question.

543
00:31:14,258 --> 00:31:18,429
I've never been one to be in a drunken frenzy,

544
00:31:18,768 --> 00:31:21,869
but I drank that expensive champagne on an empty stomach last night.

545
00:31:22,028 --> 00:31:25,369
That must've caused my brain to malfunction.

546
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:32,248
Have this too. I didn't touch it.

547
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:35,619
Thank you.

548
00:31:44,058 --> 00:31:45,258
Professor Kim?

549
00:31:46,528 --> 00:31:47,558
Hey.

550
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,468
By the way,

551
00:31:58,068 --> 00:31:59,669
I've been thinking about this since we last met.

552
00:32:00,008 --> 00:32:01,409
It must be because you work at a hotel,

553
00:32:01,738 --> 00:32:03,339
but there's something sophisticated about you...

554
00:32:04,008 --> 00:32:05,778
in the way you dress...

555
00:32:05,778 --> 00:32:07,379
and how you speak.

556
00:32:07,748 --> 00:32:11,518
You're enjoying a cultured lifestyle this early in the morning too.

557
00:32:12,449 --> 00:32:14,089
I bet you get that a lot.

558
00:32:16,189 --> 00:32:17,258
Sometimes.

559
00:32:17,619 --> 00:32:20,288
Have you been working at the hotel for a long time?

560
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:22,998
Quite a while, yes.

561
00:32:23,329 --> 00:32:25,699
You must be the head doorman of the security office, then.

562
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:28,468
The head doorman of the security office?

563
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:30,798
You're not exactly young,

564
00:32:30,998 --> 00:32:32,869
and you work afternoon shifts, which are easier.

565
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:35,468
I figured you'd be the head of some department.

566
00:32:36,978 --> 00:32:37,978
The head?

567
00:32:40,978 --> 00:32:42,518
I guess that's true.

568
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,949
Your salary must be quite high too.

569
00:32:45,949 --> 00:32:48,349
You still have a few years left before retirement, don't you?

570
00:32:48,958 --> 00:32:49,958
I'm thinking about...

571
00:32:50,788 --> 00:32:52,659
working for a bit longer.

572
00:32:52,788 --> 00:32:54,329
Considering your age,

573
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:57,399
don't spend too much on cultural activities...

574
00:32:57,528 --> 00:32:58,629
and save up.

575
00:32:59,568 --> 00:33:02,298
I used to work at a post office,

576
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:05,398
and nothing beats cash for the elderly.

577
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:09,639
To be able to live proudly without relying on your children,

578
00:33:09,878 --> 00:33:12,179
you need to save up while you can.

579
00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:15,309
There are many savings accounts that offer good interest rates.

580
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:17,048
Would you like a consultation?

581
00:33:17,048 --> 00:33:19,389
I appreciate your advice.

582
00:33:23,619 --> 00:33:26,188
That wasn't advice but words of concern.

583
00:33:26,929 --> 00:33:28,229
Did I offend you?

584
00:33:28,588 --> 00:33:29,898
I'll keep that in mind.

585
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:33,829
I always seem to be in your debt.

586
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:35,699
Bless you!

587
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:45,849
Hey, Mom.

588
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:51,749
(Folk Painting Meets Modern Times, Museum Jino)

589
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:53,019
Unbelievable.

590
00:33:53,188 --> 00:33:55,718
Whether drunk or sober,

591
00:33:56,358 --> 00:33:57,959
she sure talks a lot.

592
00:33:58,459 --> 00:33:59,459
Pardon?

593
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:02,599
- It's nothing. Let's go. - Yes, sir.

594
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:05,459
The hotel doorman had it.

595
00:34:07,869 --> 00:34:09,938
I asked the merchandiser of the purchasing department,

596
00:34:10,468 --> 00:34:13,909
but the product has to pass the document screening process.

597
00:34:15,778 --> 00:34:17,438
- The document screening process? - Yes.

598
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:19,048
The brand introduction...

599
00:34:19,048 --> 00:34:21,079
and sales proposal must be approved first,

600
00:34:21,148 --> 00:34:23,119
then a product review meeting will follow.

601
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:26,519
Then, the quality control department will visit the brewery...

602
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:29,159
to conduct a sanitary inspection and a product quality test...

603
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,659
before approving the product to be supplied to the stores.

604
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,858
That sounds like a long process.

605
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:38,028
But I bet that's easy as pie for someone as smart as you.

606
00:34:38,898 --> 00:34:41,028
Even eating pie can be a struggle for some.

607
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:44,468
Anyway, I'll try my best.

608
00:34:44,468 --> 00:34:46,909
Okay. Let me know once you have the paperwork.

609
00:34:46,938 --> 00:34:49,809
I'll arrange a meeting with the merchandiser at the main office.

610
00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:51,709
I appreciate you going the extra mile for me.

611
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:55,008
The store owner had me do my due diligence.

612
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:57,619
Give me a call, then.

613
00:34:58,548 --> 00:35:00,218
- Thanks for this. - No problem.

614
00:35:01,148 --> 00:35:03,418
- I'll see you soon. - Right. Thank you.

615
00:35:05,258 --> 00:35:06,829
- Head out safely. - Sure.

616
00:35:11,929 --> 00:35:13,798
I wanted to help my sister-in-law,

617
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:16,398
but I didn't know what I could do.

618
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:18,338
Thanks for this.

619
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:21,508
Let me know if there's anything I can do.

620
00:35:28,278 --> 00:35:29,349
(Greetings, dear friends. A reunion has been arranged...)

621
00:35:29,349 --> 00:35:30,418
(to celebrate our friendship. From Head of Alumni Committee)

622
00:35:30,418 --> 00:35:32,148
There will be an elementary school class reunion.

623
00:35:32,688 --> 00:35:33,718
It seems like it.

624
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:35,119
Will you be there?

625
00:35:36,389 --> 00:35:37,918
I'm not sure.

626
00:35:38,988 --> 00:35:40,429
It's been so long since I met everyone.

627
00:35:41,028 --> 00:35:42,128
Let's go together.

628
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:43,599
I'll think about it.

629
00:35:44,459 --> 00:35:45,499
Anyway, I'll get going.

630
00:35:45,499 --> 00:35:47,028
Do you have to go back to the office?

631
00:35:47,028 --> 00:35:48,028
What?

632
00:35:48,968 --> 00:35:50,039
Yes.

633
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:52,409
So much for having lunch together.

634
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,409
Sorry about that. How about a rain check?

635
00:35:55,438 --> 00:35:57,008
I didn't mean much by it.

636
00:35:57,039 --> 00:35:58,179
Your work should come first.

637
00:35:58,209 --> 00:35:59,309
I won't keep you when you're busy.

638
00:35:59,309 --> 00:36:00,349
I'll be in touch.

639
00:36:08,889 --> 00:36:10,918
Hello, everyone. It's good to see you.

640
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,829
- Is everyone here? - Yes.

641
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:14,188
Raise your hand if you're not here.

642
00:36:16,028 --> 00:36:17,028
Wait.

643
00:36:17,028 --> 00:36:18,459
I don't see Ms. Ji.

644
00:36:20,128 --> 00:36:22,468
She must have a lot of clients at the salon.

645
00:36:23,468 --> 00:36:24,838
It's always great to earn more money.

646
00:36:25,168 --> 00:36:26,838
Let's begin today's class.

647
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:28,738
- Are you all warmed up? - Yes!

648
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:31,008
Mr. Oh, it's Ms. Kim's birthday today.

649
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,039
Really?

650
00:36:33,209 --> 00:36:34,449
Happy birthday!

651
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,048
We agreed to get together for dinner later.

652
00:36:40,048 --> 00:36:41,519
Would you like to join us?

653
00:36:41,889 --> 00:36:43,389
Am I allowed to join you?

654
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:45,318
Yes.

655
00:36:47,128 --> 00:36:48,188
Okay!

656
00:36:48,188 --> 00:36:50,559
We'll have Ms. Kim in the center today.

657
00:36:50,858 --> 00:36:51,999
You can stand over here.

658
00:36:52,999 --> 00:36:54,128
Shall we begin?

659
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:56,398
- Are you ready? - Yes!

660
00:36:56,398 --> 00:36:58,039
- Are you really ready? - Absolutely.

661
00:36:58,168 --> 00:36:59,869
One, two.

662
00:36:59,869 --> 00:37:01,568
One, two, three, V-step.

663
00:37:12,789 --> 00:37:14,648
(Winners)

664
00:37:14,648 --> 00:37:16,019
(Winners are the best!)

665
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:17,988
(Winners, be mine.)

666
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:30,738
Heung Soo!

667
00:37:36,979 --> 00:37:38,309
(The gem of Winners, Heung Soo's mine!)

668
00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:40,108
Heung Soo, I love you!

669
00:37:45,778 --> 00:37:47,418
(The gem of Winners, I love you, Heung Soo!)

670
00:37:57,959 --> 00:37:59,099
Thanks, little lady.

671
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:02,028
You're Jang Mi, aren't you?

672
00:38:02,429 --> 00:38:03,438
I am.

673
00:38:06,008 --> 00:38:07,039
Heung Soo!

674
00:38:09,139 --> 00:38:10,338
Heung Soo!

675
00:38:16,218 --> 00:38:17,278
I see it's not a busy day.

676
00:38:18,048 --> 00:38:19,249
Come on in.

677
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,318
No one made any appointments for today,

678
00:38:23,959 --> 00:38:25,459
and business has been slow.

679
00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:27,389
Why weren't you at the Zumba class, then?

680
00:38:28,429 --> 00:38:30,858
I wasn't feeling that great and wanted to rest.

681
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:33,898
- How about a cup of coffee? - Sounds good.

682
00:38:35,329 --> 00:38:37,599
Here you go.

683
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:39,769
You penny-pincher.

684
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:41,539
I told you to get a coffee maker.

685
00:38:41,539 --> 00:38:45,579
Forget it. This instant coffee satisfies my palate the best.

686
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:52,718
Are you not feeling well?

687
00:38:52,718 --> 00:38:54,119
You seem pale.

688
00:38:55,389 --> 00:38:56,918
I didn't sleep well,

689
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:57,959
but I'm fine.

690
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:04,599
By the way, did you enjoy the class?

691
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:07,068
Of course, I had a great fun.

692
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:08,729
That reminds me. Later this evening,

693
00:39:08,729 --> 00:39:11,438
everyone including Mr. Oh is getting together for dinner.

694
00:39:11,438 --> 00:39:13,468
It's Ms. Kim's birthday today.

695
00:39:14,568 --> 00:39:17,709
We're having grilled pork chops at the intersection,

696
00:39:17,709 --> 00:39:19,139
so be there on time.

697
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:20,209
- Forget it! - My gosh.

698
00:39:20,949 --> 00:39:22,479
Gosh, you startled me.

699
00:39:23,019 --> 00:39:25,278
But Mr. Oh said I should bring you too.

700
00:39:25,278 --> 00:39:26,889
Did Mr. Oh really say that?

701
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:29,258
Yes, as I was leaving after class,

702
00:39:29,258 --> 00:39:30,988
he stopped me and said...

703
00:39:30,988 --> 00:39:33,128
I should contact you and ask you to join us.

704
00:39:33,128 --> 00:39:35,128
He seems to care about you.

705
00:39:35,688 --> 00:39:38,699
You think Mr. Oh cares about me?

706
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:40,699
As soon as he walked into class today,

707
00:39:41,398 --> 00:39:44,499
he went, "I don't see Ms. Ji."

708
00:39:46,108 --> 00:39:49,108
Really? Did he actually say that?

709
00:39:50,008 --> 00:39:51,039
Yes.

710
00:39:55,108 --> 00:39:57,079
When are we gathering at the grilled pork chop place?

711
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:00,540
(Silla Brewery)

712
00:40:01,757 --> 00:40:03,788
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

713
00:40:03,788 --> 00:40:06,828
Of all the makgeolli you've ever made,

714
00:40:06,828 --> 00:40:08,657
the one I had yesterday was the best.

715
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:11,228
There's no way it won't hit the jackpot.

716
00:40:12,527 --> 00:40:15,868
If that's all she had to say, then that's that.

717
00:40:17,598 --> 00:40:19,237
If I don't do something about this,

718
00:40:20,438 --> 00:40:21,808
I'll pay in spades.

719
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:26,648
It's the Jang-Kwang Makgeolli...

720
00:40:26,648 --> 00:40:28,078
- tasting event. - Buy 1, get 1 free.

721
00:40:28,078 --> 00:40:29,118
- What's this? - It's new.

722
00:40:29,217 --> 00:40:30,677
This is Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

723
00:40:30,677 --> 00:40:31,688
It's the Jang-Kwang Makgeolli...

724
00:40:31,688 --> 00:40:33,717
- tasting event. - Please try some.

725
00:40:33,717 --> 00:40:35,587
- Buy one now... - It's delicious.

726
00:40:35,587 --> 00:40:37,357
- and get one free. - No way.

727
00:40:37,357 --> 00:40:38,688
I'll take one.

728
00:40:39,927 --> 00:40:41,757
It's been getting only good reviews.

729
00:40:42,627 --> 00:40:44,728
- Really? - Even the employees...

730
00:40:44,728 --> 00:40:47,268
have been telling me to save some for them...

731
00:40:47,268 --> 00:40:48,567
so that they can buy some on their way out.

732
00:40:49,098 --> 00:40:51,668
See? What did I tell you?

733
00:40:51,668 --> 00:40:53,507
I told you it'd be a hit.

734
00:40:53,507 --> 00:40:56,438
I feel bad to rain on your parade,

735
00:40:57,078 --> 00:40:59,607
but consumers can be quite odd.

736
00:41:00,478 --> 00:41:02,118
They buy purses...

737
00:41:02,118 --> 00:41:04,248
that cost a few thousand dollars with ease,

738
00:41:04,248 --> 00:41:06,987
but bean sprouts costing just a few cents more...

739
00:41:06,987 --> 00:41:08,987
can be a deal-breaker.

740
00:41:10,388 --> 00:41:13,188
Makgeolli falls into that category.

741
00:41:13,587 --> 00:41:16,458
Why is a bottle of makgeolli over ten dollars?

742
00:41:17,797 --> 00:41:20,168
Once they taste Jang-Kwang Makgeolli,

743
00:41:20,168 --> 00:41:22,498
the consumers will change their minds.

744
00:41:22,498 --> 00:41:24,237
You must be smart about this.

745
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:27,978
Quality doesn't always lead to success.

746
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:29,737
Okay.

747
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,547
I heard you loud and clear.

748
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:34,877
I'll discuss this with the brewery manager.

749
00:41:34,877 --> 00:41:35,877
Sure.

750
00:41:37,518 --> 00:41:39,087
(Beom Soo)

751
00:41:40,188 --> 00:41:41,688
Hey, Beom Soo.

752
00:41:43,487 --> 00:41:44,728
Hi, Kwang Sook.

753
00:41:45,257 --> 00:41:47,487
I believe I never called you...

754
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:48,927
after that chaotic day.

755
00:41:49,098 --> 00:41:50,228
I'm sorry about that.

756
00:41:50,927 --> 00:41:52,627
It's not like we're strangers.

757
00:41:52,668 --> 00:41:54,098
Why would you even apologize?

758
00:41:55,337 --> 00:41:56,467
Is Ha Ni doing well?

759
00:41:56,768 --> 00:41:57,797
Of course.

760
00:41:58,107 --> 00:42:00,237
I took her to a hospital for her vaccination today.

761
00:42:00,668 --> 00:42:04,038
Goodness. That little one had a needle stuck in her?

762
00:42:04,808 --> 00:42:06,447
I bet she cried her eyes out.

763
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,118
Ha Ni wasn't the only one having a hard time.

764
00:42:09,118 --> 00:42:10,777
I guess I tensed up even more.

765
00:42:11,348 --> 00:42:12,717
She must've gotten bigger.

766
00:42:13,918 --> 00:42:15,558
If I weren't so busy with the brewery,

767
00:42:15,558 --> 00:42:17,157
I'd take her for her shots...

768
00:42:17,157 --> 00:42:18,328
and play with her.

769
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,357
I'm sorry, Beom Soo.

770
00:42:20,757 --> 00:42:22,297
Gosh, please don't apologize.

771
00:42:22,598 --> 00:42:25,168
Heung Soo ruined it a bit with his nonsense,

772
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:26,927
but I enjoyed the family gathering.

773
00:42:27,098 --> 00:42:29,138
Let's get together often.

774
00:42:30,467 --> 00:42:31,607
Sure thing.

775
00:42:32,737 --> 00:42:33,837
What's Ha Ni up to?

776
00:42:33,967 --> 00:42:35,777
I left her with the babysitter,

777
00:42:35,777 --> 00:42:37,337
and I'm on my way to the university.

778
00:42:37,337 --> 00:42:38,877
I have a lecture today.

779
00:43:00,927 --> 00:43:02,237
(Lecture Room)

780
00:43:02,237 --> 00:43:03,398
Professor.

781
00:43:04,768 --> 00:43:05,868
Hello.

782
00:43:07,708 --> 00:43:09,337
I'm teaching undergraduates today.

783
00:43:12,248 --> 00:43:14,407
Well, I'm not here for a class.

784
00:43:15,717 --> 00:43:18,087
I had business at the department office...

785
00:43:18,087 --> 00:43:19,918
and saw that you were teaching today.

786
00:43:21,248 --> 00:43:23,487
I've just got this so you can have it warm.

787
00:43:30,657 --> 00:43:32,828
I see you already have your coffee.

788
00:43:33,268 --> 00:43:34,868
I'm good, so have it yourself.

789
00:43:35,168 --> 00:43:36,168
Sorry?

790
00:43:36,498 --> 00:43:39,507
Oh, sure. I'll drink this, then.

791
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:45,578
(Lecture Room)

792
00:43:47,777 --> 00:43:48,877
I'm doomed.

793
00:43:53,317 --> 00:43:54,717
Bom.

794
00:43:55,087 --> 00:43:56,087
Hey, Se Ri.

795
00:43:56,087 --> 00:43:58,357
I'm doomed.

796
00:43:59,127 --> 00:44:00,728
Did you meet your professor?

797
00:44:00,728 --> 00:44:01,728
Yes.

798
00:44:01,757 --> 00:44:03,927
Like you said, I waited for him outside the lecture room...

799
00:44:03,927 --> 00:44:05,768
and handed him a cup of coffee.

800
00:44:07,697 --> 00:44:09,438
But he turned it down saying he already had some.

801
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,438
I definitely got on his bad side.

802
00:44:11,837 --> 00:44:14,438
It's understandable since he already had a beverage.

803
00:44:14,438 --> 00:44:15,777
Maybe you're reading too much into it.

804
00:44:16,607 --> 00:44:17,708
I'm not sure.

805
00:44:18,748 --> 00:44:21,777
It somehow seems like he's already forgotten and moved on.

806
00:44:22,777 --> 00:44:25,587
But he could still be holding a grudge against me.

807
00:44:26,587 --> 00:44:28,087
I just can't tell.

808
00:44:28,618 --> 00:44:30,487
How was his expression?

809
00:44:30,817 --> 00:44:31,828
I'm not sure.

810
00:44:35,197 --> 00:44:36,328
He didn't seem to care.

811
00:44:36,427 --> 00:44:38,328
There wasn't much of an expression,

812
00:44:38,328 --> 00:44:40,228
and he seemed uninterested.

813
00:44:41,967 --> 00:44:43,938
He must seem like that...

814
00:44:43,938 --> 00:44:45,938
because he's already gotten over it.

815
00:44:46,638 --> 00:44:48,337
That'd be great but...

816
00:44:48,808 --> 00:44:50,038
I'm sure of it.

817
00:44:50,038 --> 00:44:52,447
He wouldn't let something like that blind him with prejudice.

818
00:44:52,507 --> 00:44:54,547
Right? You also think that.

819
00:44:54,547 --> 00:44:56,578
Of course. Don't worry about it.

820
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:02,188
By the way, there's something different about you.

821
00:45:03,188 --> 00:45:05,058
- What? - Up until a few days ago,

822
00:45:05,058 --> 00:45:07,027
you were jumpy, on edge all the time,

823
00:45:07,027 --> 00:45:08,958
and even depressed.

824
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,228
You see more at ease now...

825
00:45:11,228 --> 00:45:12,527
and are back to your work.

826
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,168
Is that so?

827
00:45:14,768 --> 00:45:17,337
Hold on. That's a cute pendant. What is it?

828
00:45:18,368 --> 00:45:20,538
It's a sea otter. An otter that lives in the sea.

829
00:45:21,407 --> 00:45:22,478
A sea otter?

830
00:45:22,938 --> 00:45:24,708
It may look cute,

831
00:45:25,007 --> 00:45:27,848
but I hear it's brave and smart.

832
00:45:29,348 --> 00:45:32,018
It doesn't look like you just bought it.

833
00:45:32,648 --> 00:45:33,788
Where did you get it?

834
00:45:33,788 --> 00:45:36,058
What? It randomly fell into my lap.

835
00:45:36,618 --> 00:45:37,987
Is that actually possible?

836
00:45:38,257 --> 00:45:39,357
Well...

837
00:45:40,688 --> 00:45:41,797
Yes, randomly.

838
00:46:23,438 --> 00:46:25,407
Lieutenant Oh, are you all right?

839
00:46:25,938 --> 00:46:27,607
There was a sudden discomfort in my ear.

840
00:46:27,607 --> 00:46:28,808
If you're not feeling well,

841
00:46:28,808 --> 00:46:30,737
you should just observe the session today.

842
00:46:31,748 --> 00:46:32,978
That's what I'll do.

843
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,027
Today, we'll discuss...

844
00:46:46,027 --> 00:46:47,587
the selection of the alcoholic beverages...

845
00:46:47,587 --> 00:46:49,157
at the hotel's food and beverage outlet.

846
00:46:49,257 --> 00:46:51,257
K-food has been trending lately,

847
00:46:51,257 --> 00:46:52,927
and that has boosted foreigners' interest...

848
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,067
in our traditional food and drink.

849
00:46:54,697 --> 00:46:56,297
Please talk freely.

850
00:46:56,868 --> 00:47:00,237
This comes from experience as I directly deal with our guests.

851
00:47:00,507 --> 00:47:02,677
We've been getting requests about wanting to try...

852
00:47:02,677 --> 00:47:04,007
traditional alcoholic beverages.

853
00:47:04,138 --> 00:47:05,907
We also get requests from guests at the restaurant,

854
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:07,107
so the kitchen has been trying...

855
00:47:07,107 --> 00:47:10,277
to add some Korean flavors to Western cuisine.

856
00:47:10,277 --> 00:47:12,688
We're now preparing food and beverage pairings.

857
00:47:12,688 --> 00:47:15,118
When it comes to hotel dining,

858
00:47:15,118 --> 00:47:17,188
aroma and color matter just as much as taste.

859
00:47:17,188 --> 00:47:19,458
It might be a good idea to serve a traditional liquor...

860
00:47:19,587 --> 00:47:22,058
that meets those standards.

861
00:47:22,328 --> 00:47:25,197
That's why we've narrowed it down to sparkling wine and makgeolli...

862
00:47:25,197 --> 00:47:26,467
infused with omija.

863
00:47:26,797 --> 00:47:29,098
I doubt makgeolli will be a good fit...

864
00:47:29,098 --> 00:47:31,708
considering the unique smell it has.

865
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:34,868
That's right. I believe there isn't a makgeolli...

866
00:47:34,868 --> 00:47:37,837
that meets the standards of our hotel.

867
00:47:41,407 --> 00:47:42,478
Recently,

868
00:47:43,148 --> 00:47:45,618
I had a pretty special experience.

869
00:47:46,418 --> 00:47:50,087
As you know, other than champagne and wine,

870
00:47:50,257 --> 00:47:51,788
I don't drink much.

871
00:47:52,257 --> 00:47:54,728
But I came across a makgeolli...

872
00:47:55,257 --> 00:47:58,297
as refreshing as champagne and with a clear aftertaste.

873
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:00,927
It tasted quite interesting.

874
00:48:01,197 --> 00:48:05,038
May you introduce us to this makgeolli?

875
00:48:05,467 --> 00:48:06,938
That's not hard,

876
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,478
but forget what I said about it...

877
00:48:10,237 --> 00:48:14,007
and make a coolheaded decision based on your expertise.

878
00:48:14,677 --> 00:48:16,947
(Yuil Bank)

879
00:48:17,817 --> 00:48:20,487
What's the urgent business you have?

880
00:48:22,388 --> 00:48:23,418
It's about...

881
00:48:24,487 --> 00:48:26,127
Eagle Brewery.

882
00:48:27,027 --> 00:48:29,058
They do business with you.

883
00:48:29,398 --> 00:48:30,857
That's right.

884
00:48:31,527 --> 00:48:33,398
You heard that the ex-CEO...

885
00:48:33,498 --> 00:48:35,438
died in a car accident, right?

886
00:48:35,638 --> 00:48:37,797
Yes. My staff told me.

887
00:48:39,138 --> 00:48:40,868
Since his death,

888
00:48:41,007 --> 00:48:43,237
his widow took over the brewery.

889
00:48:43,578 --> 00:48:47,348
The clueless woman put everything into developing a new product,

890
00:48:47,648 --> 00:48:50,018
and the sales aren't making up for it.

891
00:48:50,018 --> 00:48:51,317
They're about to go belly-up.

892
00:48:56,157 --> 00:48:58,657
I'm only telling you this because I thought...

893
00:48:59,157 --> 00:49:00,688
you should know at least.

894
00:49:01,027 --> 00:49:02,098
I see.

895
00:49:02,958 --> 00:49:04,728
I understand what you mean.

896
00:49:04,857 --> 00:49:06,498
I'll look into it.

897
00:49:11,168 --> 00:49:12,938
This is highly inappropriate.

898
00:49:13,168 --> 00:49:15,007
We put up collateral for the loan.

899
00:49:15,107 --> 00:49:17,837
It makes no sense that we can't get an extension.

900
00:49:18,407 --> 00:49:20,107
How could you do this to us?

901
00:49:20,208 --> 00:49:22,047
We did business with you for years.

902
00:49:22,047 --> 00:49:23,947
The new branch manager insists...

903
00:49:23,947 --> 00:49:26,188
it's a new risk management policy.

904
00:49:26,188 --> 00:49:27,788
There's nothing we can do.

905
00:49:27,788 --> 00:49:28,857
Wait.

906
00:49:29,487 --> 00:49:31,657
I'll come over right now.

907
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:36,197
(Eagle Brewery)

908
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:39,868
Oh, dear.

909
00:49:43,297 --> 00:49:44,898
Long time no see.

910
00:49:45,138 --> 00:49:49,138
I smelled rotting cash and came to see what was going on.

911
00:49:49,538 --> 00:49:50,808
It's you.

912
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:53,607
You haven't changed.

913
00:49:53,947 --> 00:49:56,348
What do you want to steal now?

914
00:49:56,348 --> 00:49:59,118
You and your wife should keep your dirty paws to yourself.

915
00:49:59,217 --> 00:50:01,148
What are you doing here?

916
00:50:03,817 --> 00:50:05,257
You just ruined our day.

917
00:50:05,257 --> 00:50:08,398
You can't talk like that to my boss!

918
00:50:09,627 --> 00:50:11,297
You stay right there...

919
00:50:11,357 --> 00:50:13,328
if you want to keep your head!

920
00:50:16,567 --> 00:50:18,438
Will you stop it?

921
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:21,368
Why do you think so little of me?

922
00:50:21,538 --> 00:50:23,607
I'm here to do you good today.

923
00:50:25,648 --> 00:50:27,648
Where's the new CEO?

924
00:50:27,748 --> 00:50:29,217
Why do you want to see her?

925
00:50:29,748 --> 00:50:32,518
If you want to do good, do it at home.

926
00:50:35,857 --> 00:50:36,958
He's here.

927
00:50:36,958 --> 00:50:38,627
What? Who's here?

928
00:50:38,688 --> 00:50:40,188
Silla Brewery's Dokgo Tak.

929
00:50:41,157 --> 00:50:43,257
Silla Brewery's Dokgo Tak?

930
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,797
The old brewery manager who colluded with...

931
00:50:45,868 --> 00:50:48,498
the bookkeeper, stole money, and disappeared?

932
00:50:48,668 --> 00:50:49,797
Yes, him.

933
00:50:51,668 --> 00:50:53,067
Hello.

934
00:50:58,578 --> 00:50:59,777
I'm Dokgo Tak.

935
00:51:14,228 --> 00:51:15,328
Your husband...

936
00:51:16,197 --> 00:51:18,567
left us in an unfortunate accident.

937
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,268
You must be in great pain.

938
00:51:23,067 --> 00:51:25,098
I've been watching you with concern,

939
00:51:26,168 --> 00:51:27,837
and I came to offer consolation...

940
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:31,907
as well as some advice since I have more experience.

941
00:51:33,208 --> 00:51:35,078
You didn't have to come in person.

942
00:51:36,547 --> 00:51:39,688
But since you're here, I'll listen with gratitude.

943
00:51:41,447 --> 00:51:43,788
Your Eagle Brewery is the place...

944
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:48,228
I built up with my youthful blood and sweat.

945
00:51:48,427 --> 00:51:50,657
I have a great love for it.

946
00:51:50,797 --> 00:51:51,868
I see.

947
00:51:52,868 --> 00:51:54,067
I didn't know.

948
00:51:55,668 --> 00:51:57,398
In our industry,

949
00:51:58,138 --> 00:52:01,438
it's pretty hard for a newbie to make a difference.

950
00:52:01,668 --> 00:52:04,737
It's not easy, but we're managing.

951
00:52:05,507 --> 00:52:06,748
It's fun too.

952
00:52:10,018 --> 00:52:13,288
You say that because you're naive, and this is just the beginning.

953
00:52:14,547 --> 00:52:17,717
It's a rough industry, and competition is fierce.

954
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:19,888
You'll have lots of difficulty.

955
00:52:23,657 --> 00:52:24,757
So...

956
00:52:26,027 --> 00:52:27,627
here's an idea.

957
00:52:29,837 --> 00:52:32,938
You're taking way too much time...

958
00:52:33,837 --> 00:52:35,007
to get there.

959
00:52:35,638 --> 00:52:37,938
Say what you want. Speed it up.

960
00:52:40,208 --> 00:52:42,848
Why don't you sell the brewery to us?

961
00:52:47,047 --> 00:52:48,087
I can't answer.

962
00:52:48,657 --> 00:52:51,157
You came in way too fast.

963
00:52:51,157 --> 00:52:55,398
Your business will take a hard hit if your loan isn't extended.

964
00:52:55,427 --> 00:52:57,357
Did you run a background check on my company?

965
00:52:58,328 --> 00:52:59,498
No.

966
00:53:00,027 --> 00:53:03,237
Who does that these days? A few calls are all it takes.

967
00:53:04,837 --> 00:53:07,768
This brewery and I go far back,

968
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,737
and you have financial issues.

969
00:53:10,208 --> 00:53:13,947
I have a strong conviction that my Silla Brewery...

970
00:53:13,978 --> 00:53:16,677
just has to buy your Eagle Brewery.

971
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:20,087
I've been watching the situation,

972
00:53:20,788 --> 00:53:22,288
and I prepared something.

973
00:53:25,857 --> 00:53:28,027
(Eagle Brewery Acquisition Proposal)

974
00:53:31,728 --> 00:53:33,398
(Eagle Brewery Acquisition Proposal)

975
00:53:44,507 --> 00:53:45,648
Hello?

976
00:53:48,947 --> 00:53:50,248
LX Hotel?

977
00:53:51,648 --> 00:53:53,788
You want to taste our samples?

978
00:53:55,248 --> 00:53:57,217
Yes, we can do that.

979
00:53:57,657 --> 00:54:00,688
I'll bring you some right now so you can have a taste.

980
00:54:01,027 --> 00:54:02,527
I'll be there in an hour.

981
00:54:02,757 --> 00:54:04,927
Okay. I'll see you very soon.

982
00:54:06,297 --> 00:54:07,368
Wait.

983
00:54:08,668 --> 00:54:11,398
Did you just say "LX Hotel?"

984
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,208
Yes. LX Hotel.

985
00:54:17,038 --> 00:54:20,777
They must want us to supply our new product.

986
00:54:21,177 --> 00:54:22,978
They'd like to do a tasting.

987
00:54:34,388 --> 00:54:36,257
You want to acquire Eagle Brewery...

988
00:54:36,458 --> 00:54:38,768
that's steeped in tradition and renown,

989
00:54:38,828 --> 00:54:41,027
and you brought just a few printed pages?

990
00:54:46,168 --> 00:54:48,438
Take your time to read it through,

991
00:54:48,938 --> 00:54:50,237
and you'll get it.

992
00:54:50,777 --> 00:54:54,007
I'll say I made the best offer I could...

993
00:54:54,848 --> 00:54:58,447
out of consideration for you and for the sake of the old times.

994
00:55:01,288 --> 00:55:03,058
Let me make this clear.

995
00:55:04,188 --> 00:55:05,828
I have...

996
00:55:06,188 --> 00:55:09,098
zero intention of selling the brewery.

997
00:55:11,157 --> 00:55:13,268
Take your time to read the proposal.

998
00:55:13,998 --> 00:55:16,837
We'll talk about it again at a later date.

999
00:55:17,737 --> 00:55:19,467
I have a tasting to prepare,

1000
00:55:19,467 --> 00:55:21,938
so I'm not sure if I'll have the time to read it.

1001
00:55:22,677 --> 00:55:25,507
You might as well leave it since you brought it over.

1002
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,748
I'll see you around.

1003
00:55:32,087 --> 00:55:33,748
I'm too busy to see you out.

1004
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:35,918
Goodbye.

1005
00:55:49,467 --> 00:55:52,507
See if LX Hotel called us to request a tasting.

1006
00:55:53,907 --> 00:55:54,938
Yes, sir.

1007
00:55:58,607 --> 00:56:01,107
She talked back every single time.

1008
00:56:03,817 --> 00:56:05,078
She's a tough one.

1009
00:56:11,157 --> 00:56:13,058
Mom. Ms. Gong.

1010
00:56:13,558 --> 00:56:14,728
What's the fuss about now?

1011
00:56:14,857 --> 00:56:16,527
I have huge news.

1012
00:56:16,797 --> 00:56:17,857
What news?

1013
00:56:17,998 --> 00:56:21,197
We might be able to supply LX Hotel.

1014
00:56:22,998 --> 00:56:23,998
What?

1015
00:56:24,467 --> 00:56:27,268
They want some samples to do a tasting.

1016
00:56:27,538 --> 00:56:31,038
That massive hotel wants to sell our makgeolli?

1017
00:56:31,607 --> 00:56:32,947
It's not confirmed yet.

1018
00:56:33,547 --> 00:56:36,018
But this is how amazing your daughter is.

1019
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:37,918
So don't look down on me.

1020
00:56:38,148 --> 00:56:39,188
My gosh.

1021
00:56:39,487 --> 00:56:41,947
You must have a thing with that hotel.

1022
00:56:42,157 --> 00:56:45,857
They invited you to a dinner party and now this?

1023
00:56:46,788 --> 00:56:48,458
I have no time to chat with you.

1024
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:49,898
I must change and get over there.

1025
00:56:50,328 --> 00:56:51,398
I'll come with you.

1026
00:56:52,467 --> 00:56:54,598
As the CEO of Eagle Brewery,

1027
00:56:54,828 --> 00:56:56,237
I'm off to do business.

1028
00:56:56,938 --> 00:56:58,538
It's no place for you.

1029
00:57:02,478 --> 00:57:03,507
That brat.

1030
00:57:04,507 --> 00:57:05,547
She's impressive.

1031
00:57:12,648 --> 00:57:15,918
With Jang Soo gone, now you're the eldest.

1032
00:57:16,487 --> 00:57:18,487
I don't think I can take on the role of the eldest daughter-in-law...

1033
00:57:18,487 --> 00:57:20,357
and care for your brothers.

1034
00:57:21,027 --> 00:57:22,027
Anyway,

1035
00:57:23,058 --> 00:57:24,728
I prefer to live like this.

1036
00:57:50,518 --> 00:57:52,958
How about you take an administrative position?

1037
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,357
Maybe I should change my position like he said.

1038
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,808
It would be 32 dollars.

1039
00:58:06,808 --> 00:58:07,808
All right.

1040
00:58:11,677 --> 00:58:13,677
It says the balance is insufficient.

1041
00:58:13,677 --> 00:58:15,308
Do you have another card?

1042
00:58:17,418 --> 00:58:18,618
That can't be right.

1043
00:58:21,388 --> 00:58:23,257
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

1044
00:58:37,237 --> 00:58:38,237
Hello?

1045
00:58:38,237 --> 00:58:40,808
Hello, our famous and renowned Professor Oh.

1046
00:58:41,138 --> 00:58:42,877
How are you doing?

1047
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:44,837
Do you have a favor to ask of me?

1048
00:58:45,177 --> 00:58:46,277
Look at you.

1049
00:58:46,947 --> 00:58:49,578
You're not only smart but also pick up on things quickly.

1050
00:58:51,348 --> 00:58:52,987
I need to borrow some money.

1051
00:58:53,348 --> 00:58:54,388
How much?

1052
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,317
About 300 dollars for now.

1053
00:58:56,388 --> 00:58:57,788
I have something to take care of urgently.

1054
00:58:58,288 --> 00:58:59,288
Come on.

1055
00:58:59,927 --> 00:59:01,828
Then just send me 200 dollars.

1056
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:04,697
Aren't you old enough to have an extra 300 dollars?

1057
00:59:04,697 --> 00:59:06,297
How could you borrow money from your younger brother?

1058
00:59:06,697 --> 00:59:08,728
I had a lot of things to spend money on last month...

1059
00:59:08,728 --> 00:59:10,098
like cash gifts.

1060
00:59:11,138 --> 00:59:13,638
I scraped up all the money I had to pay the gas bills,

1061
00:59:14,107 --> 00:59:15,308
so I'm broke now.

1062
00:59:17,277 --> 00:59:19,578
You're unbelievable. All right.

1063
00:59:20,877 --> 00:59:23,078
Thanks. I'll be sure to pay you back next month.

1064
00:59:23,447 --> 00:59:26,918
Beom Soo, send me the money right away.

1065
00:59:27,717 --> 00:59:28,717
Okay.

1066
00:59:31,357 --> 00:59:33,958
(Octopus Soup and Sujebi)

1067
00:59:42,168 --> 00:59:43,197
Ms. Ji.

1068
00:59:47,107 --> 00:59:49,478
You didn't come to the class, so I was worried.

1069
00:59:49,578 --> 00:59:50,638
I'm glad you're here.

1070
00:59:50,737 --> 00:59:54,177
Did you really worry about me?

1071
00:59:54,177 --> 00:59:55,177
Sure.

1072
00:59:56,877 --> 01:00:00,248
You worrying about me...

1073
01:00:01,018 --> 01:00:02,717
makes me happy.

1074
01:00:04,157 --> 01:00:07,157
Actually, I wasn't going to come to the get-together today.

1075
01:00:08,127 --> 01:00:12,098
But I heard you insisted that I had to be here,

1076
01:00:12,467 --> 01:00:15,027
so I came.

1077
01:00:16,168 --> 01:00:18,898
If you were busy, you didn't have to force yourself to come.

1078
01:00:19,007 --> 01:00:20,107
Gosh, no.

1079
01:00:20,107 --> 01:00:22,007
No matter how busy I am,

1080
01:00:22,007 --> 01:00:24,078
I have to come if you want me to come.

1081
01:00:24,237 --> 01:00:25,277
I see.

1082
01:00:31,447 --> 01:00:33,587
By the way, what's that thing?

1083
01:00:34,188 --> 01:00:36,657
Well... It's Ms. Kim's birthday.

1084
01:00:36,657 --> 01:00:37,918
So I bought a cake.

1085
01:00:37,918 --> 01:00:40,688
Why would you buy a cake for Ms. Kim's birthday?

1086
01:00:41,058 --> 01:00:43,498
- What? - What's the big deal about her?

1087
01:00:43,498 --> 01:00:45,197
Why do you have to buy a cake for her?

1088
01:00:45,197 --> 01:00:47,067
She's one of my students.

1089
01:00:47,067 --> 01:00:48,898
I can celebrate her birthday. Why does it upset you?

1090
01:00:48,898 --> 01:00:51,768
Will you buy a cake for all your students' birthdays?

1091
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,507
My birthday was last month.

1092
01:00:53,507 --> 01:00:54,907
Will you buy one for me now?

1093
01:00:55,168 --> 01:00:57,007
Well...

1094
01:00:57,007 --> 01:00:59,407
There you are.

1095
01:00:59,407 --> 01:01:01,478
- You're here. - Let's go in.

1096
01:01:01,478 --> 01:01:03,348
- You came. - Let's go in then.

1097
01:01:03,348 --> 01:01:06,248
- Hello. - I haven't seen you for ages.

1098
01:01:06,518 --> 01:01:08,947
- Let's go sit over there. - Hello.

1099
01:01:09,657 --> 01:01:12,217
You didn't have to buy a cake for Ms. Kim though.

1100
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,527
Why did you tell me to come?

1101
01:01:16,657 --> 01:01:17,728
Darn it.

1102
01:01:17,998 --> 01:01:21,728
(Eagle Brewery)

1103
01:01:30,308 --> 01:01:31,538
Look who's here.

1104
01:01:35,377 --> 01:01:36,377
Wrap things up well.

1105
01:01:36,377 --> 01:01:37,947
If you need anything, you should talk to Mr. Park.

1106
01:01:37,947 --> 01:01:39,388
- I'll get going then. - Yes, sir.

1107
01:01:43,918 --> 01:01:46,458
Why are these people bowing to him?

1108
01:01:56,638 --> 01:01:58,998
What is he doing there?

1109
01:02:00,138 --> 01:02:03,377
(Eagle Brewery)

1110
01:02:04,507 --> 01:02:07,248
Excuse me. Can I ask you something?

1111
01:02:07,978 --> 01:02:10,877
About the man who just left in the car.

1112
01:02:11,277 --> 01:02:14,188
You and the other people just bowed low to him.

1113
01:02:15,518 --> 01:02:16,558
Who is he?

1114
01:02:16,688 --> 01:02:18,458
Are you talking about the chairman?

1115
01:02:18,888 --> 01:02:19,987
The chairman?

1116
01:02:21,058 --> 01:02:24,357
The man who just left in the car is the chairman?

1117
01:02:24,427 --> 01:02:25,427
Yes.

1118
01:02:25,898 --> 01:02:28,228
You mean the chairman...

1119
01:02:28,627 --> 01:02:31,337
of this hotel?

1120
01:02:31,697 --> 01:02:34,138
Yes, I do. Why do you ask?

1121
01:02:47,217 --> 01:02:50,717
(Eagle Brewery)

1122
01:02:57,297 --> 01:02:58,657
That can't be right.

1123
01:03:43,038 --> 01:03:45,538
(For Eagle Brothers)

1124
01:03:46,078 --> 01:03:47,447
I have a question.

1125
01:03:47,748 --> 01:03:48,907
Do you have a twin brother?

1126
01:03:49,007 --> 01:03:51,047
Why did you even worry about the retirement...

1127
01:03:51,047 --> 01:03:53,717
of the chairman of LX Hotel, Ma Kwang Sook?

1128
01:03:53,717 --> 01:03:54,848
- Let's go to karaoke! - Let's go to karaoke!

1129
01:03:54,848 --> 01:03:56,288
- Let's go to karaoke! - Let's go to karaoke!

1130
01:03:56,357 --> 01:03:59,118
Why would he want to go to karaoke and sing?

1131
01:03:59,118 --> 01:04:01,888
My love who has come to visit me

1132
01:04:01,888 --> 01:04:04,027
Welcome

1133
01:04:04,027 --> 01:04:05,098
I'll do it.

1134
01:04:05,098 --> 01:04:06,197
I have many younger cousins,

1135
01:04:06,197 --> 01:04:07,927
so I'm good with babies.

1136
01:04:08,027 --> 01:04:09,538
Are you sure you're going to be okay?

1137
01:04:09,868 --> 01:04:11,498
Hello, Chairman Han!

1138
01:04:11,498 --> 01:04:12,498
Good job.

1139
01:04:12,498 --> 01:04:15,107
This is the least I can do for my career.
