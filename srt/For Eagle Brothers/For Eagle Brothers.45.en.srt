00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:02,640
(Episode 45)

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:04,110
I know...

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,450
I have many shortcomings,

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,550
but I'll be like a daughter to you.

5
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,820
You'll be my what?

6
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,320
I'll be...

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,690
like a daughter to you.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:24,830
How dare you suggest such a thing?

9
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,400
You dare think
you can take Min Seo's place?

10
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:32,940
I may fall short in many ways
compared to your daughter,

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,570
but I want to be there for you.

12
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:37,280
I mean that.

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,640
Do you think
you can walk all over me?

14
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,010
Not at all.

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,380
Your family doesn't know
about your condition,

16
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:49,890
so if anything were to happen,
I could...

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,260
It's still in the early stages,
so I can handle it.

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,460
Don't treat me like a patient.

19
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:56,630
That's not what I meant.

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,460
No one...

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,330
can replace my daughter.

22
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,640
She was the most perfect daughter
anyone could ever ask for.

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,670
Even now,

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,610
the pain of missing my daughter...

25
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,640
makes it hard to breathe at times.

26
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,610
And yet,

27
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,620
here you are,
offering to take her place.

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,490
Being with Chairman Han...

29
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,990
doesn't make you a substitute
for my daughter in every way.

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,990
That's outrageous.

31
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,700
I'm not saying...

32
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,500
I intend to replace your daughter.

33
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,530
You should leave.

34
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,540
Then,

35
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,310
I'll get going.

36
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,280
But,

37
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,590
after losing someone dear,

38
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,320
don't you think those left behind...

39
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,420
should support each other...

40
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,760
to get through life?

41
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,500
After...

42
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,170
I lost my husband,

43
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,600
I relied on his brothers
as if they were my own,

44
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,600
and that's how I survived.

45
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,410
If I were on my own,

46
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,580
it would've been too much.

47
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,110
I'm speaking from experience,

48
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,620
so please
don't get too upset about it.

49
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,220
I'll see myself out.

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,000
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,100
It's me.

52
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,740
Is Vice-CEO Oh back
from his honeymoon?

53
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,480
Not yet. They must be
on their way back right now.

54
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,880
I have a meeting later.

55
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,380
Are you outside?

56
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,120
Yes.

57
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,620
I'm driving back from a delivery.

58
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,230
Sir, we're all set up
for the meeting.

59
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,560
Okay.

60
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,460
I have to head to the meeting.
Let's talk again later.

61
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,440
Even now,

62
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,240
the pain of missing my daughter...

63
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,240
makes it hard to breathe at times.

64
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,450
She lost her only child.

65
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,890
It's only natural
she feels that way.

66
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,630
- I'm back.
- Hi.

67
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,930
Did you take the food to Dong Seok?

68
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,570
No, not to him. To his mother.

69
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,740
What?

70
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,670
Where's your pride?

71
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,980
Why would you bring her our food?

72
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,080
She must feel so lonely
in that house without her daughter.

73
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,820
You're too nice for your own good.

74
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,190
We're back.

75
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,950
- My gosh.
- Hello.

76
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,390
Welcome back!

77
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,590
Hello.

78
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,860
I'm glad you're back.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Sister-in-law.

80
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,800
We had a great time at the hotel.

81
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,270
Did you have a good time, Mi Sun?

82
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,840
We had a lovely stay
thanks to the chairman.

83
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,780
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

84
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,080
My gosh. You startled me.

85
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,020
- What?
- Are you all right?

86
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,090
- My gosh.
- Yes, I'm fine.

87
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,320
- Did that make you jump?
- It's okay.

88
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,590
"Are you all right?
Did that make you jump?"

89
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,800
Darn you. You fools.

90
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,030
- You too.
- My goodness.

91
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,570
Oh, my.

92
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,400
Don't scare your sister-in-law.

93
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,100
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

94
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,640
- What?
- Oh, my.

95
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,110
My goodness.

96
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:10,480
What is all this?

97
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,390
Heung Soo, Beom Soo, and Kang Soo...

98
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,020
blew up balloons all afternoon
to decorate the room.

99
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,260
They redid the wallpaper
and the flooring too.

100
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,030
You didn't have to do that.

101
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,470
We're bribing you
to take good care...

102
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,130
of our brother, sister.

103
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,100
"Sister?"

104
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:33,970
That's nice to hear.

105
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,340
She likes the new title.

106
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,650
Why don't you say it too?

107
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,420
Welcome to Eagle Brewery,
our second sister-in-law.

108
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,620
I hope we can all get along,
our second sister-in-law.

109
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,460
I hope for the same,
brothers-in-law.

110
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,390
Is anyone home?

111
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,330
What was that?
It sounded like Mr. Go.

112
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,070
Yes. I invited him to join us.

113
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,740
Why would you do that?

114
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,010
Goodness.

115
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,520
I'm still kind of upset...

116
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,280
that you skipped the wedding.

117
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,020
Are you sure you won't mind?

118
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,120
We agreed to have a special ceremony
to renew our vows...

119
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,690
a few years from now.

120
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,630
We have family matters
and brewery stuff to handle,

121
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,630
and we're pretty busy.

122
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,500
We thought that felt right.

123
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,630
Okay.

124
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,610
- What was that about, Mom?
- What do you mean?

125
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,650
Oh, that?

126
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,420
Here you go.

127
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:56,550
Eat up.

128
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,820
Thank you.

129
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:18,680
I only prepared the soup today.

130
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,310
The brewery CEO came by earlier
with all the side dishes.

131
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,420
CEO Ma was here?

132
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,040
It's delicious.

133
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,370
Ms. Ma must be a good cook too.

134
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,810
What?

135
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,560
Hello?

136
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,930
I heard you came by my place
earlier in the day.

137
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,700
We'd prepared a lot of food
to welcome...

138
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,500
Chun Soo and his new wife.

139
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:21,270
I brought some over
because I wanted to share.

140
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,770
Why didn't you tell me anything?

141
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,280
I was only there long enough
to drop off the food,

142
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,920
so there wasn't
anything worth mentioning.

143
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,990
Did my mother-in-law...

144
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,320
say anything...

145
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:38,760
bad or strange to you?

146
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,630
She didn't, so don't worry about it.

147
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,900
Gyeol.

148
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,340
How about quitting your practice
and learning about the business?

149
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,180
I think that would be best.

150
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,610
Why would you say
something like that?

151
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,150
LX Group is what it is now
because it was...

152
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,550
built on your mom's sacrifice.

153
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,090
Neither of you should forget that.

154
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,120
You know...

155
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,290
I'm neither good at
nor interested in business.

156
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:17,760
You can't afford
to have that kind of attitude.

157
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,770
I thought about it,

158
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,040
and you two must step up as heirs
to prevent future problems.

159
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,370
"Future problems?"

160
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,110
When someone new joins the family,

161
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,010
there will be problems.

162
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,180
It's best to prevent that,

163
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,810
if and when you can.

164
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,720
The brewery CEO isn't like that,
Grandma.

165
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,520
You don't know her well enough
to say that.

166
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,890
Take what I said to heart.

167
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:28,670
Come on over. It'll start soon.

(35th Anniversary Special Show)

170
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,010
You're a dancer and a store manager?

171
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,010
Yes. I practice
my dance routines at night,

172
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,480
and I make sandwiches
during the day.

173
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,150
Both are important parts...

174
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,250
- of my life.
- Heung Soo is on TV!

175
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,620
They're showing Heung Soo
even before Jin Young.

176
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:53,490
They're showing a few interviews
before the main performance.

177
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,560
That's nothing.

178
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,560
That's not nothing.

179
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:59,500
You look incredible on TV.

180
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,670
Heung Soo, you're awesome.

181
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,040
I think so too.

182
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,870
- I think you're awesome too.

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:08,440
I'm awesome.

184
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,210
Yes, I was like that back then.
That's right.

185
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,920
Heung Soo, get over here. Come on.

186
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,580
- Right now.
- Aren't you mid-interview?

187
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,520
It's fine. Join me.

188
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,290
Of all the backup dancers
I worked with,

189
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,530
this guy, Oh Heung Soo,

190
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,130
is the only one
who is still dancing.

191
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,930
I wasn't exactly well-off,
so I struggled a great deal.

192
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,200
I worked at gas stations,
delivered parcels,

193
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,510
taught Zumba,
and now I manage a sandwich shop.

194
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,870
I did all sorts of stuff.

195
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,780
But I never stopped dancing.

196
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:50,150
We made a promise, you see.

197
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,820
That we'd both die dancing on stage.

198
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,520
We'll dance like that today.

199
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,920
See you on stage.

200
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,590
My goodness.

201
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:08,630
Oh, right. Hey.

202
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,670
You did this when you were little.

203
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,870
You'd put your head
in the front yard of the brewery...

204
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,210
and spin it.

205
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,640
- Headspin?
- Oh, right. A headspin.

206
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,150
Whenever you did it,
I thought you were really something.

207
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,710
You're unbelievable.

208
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,680
Yes, your whole body held your dream
and made it real.

209
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,590
- You're so cool.
- Thanks.

210
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,820
I know.
I should be proud of him, right?

211
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,290
In that sense, why don't we...

212
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,560
give him a big hand?

213
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,160
Thank you.

214
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,630
Thank you.

215
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,200
As I told you before,

216
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,240
if it weren't for you,

217
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,280
my dream wouldn't have come true.

218
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,010
Thank you.

219
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,920
Like Beom Soo said,

220
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,620
you held on to your dream...

221
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,490
with your whole body
and made it happen.

222
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,990
I have no regrets now.

223
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,430
I think I can finally forget
all my thirst for the stage...

224
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,130
and go back to being
the ordinary guy, Oh Heung Soo.

225
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,000
Are you sure you won't regret this?

226
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:24,240
I've held out for so long.

227
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:26,380
My knees are sore,

228
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:29,180
and there are a lot of young dancers
who are better than me.

229
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,350
I want to leave
when people are applauding.

230
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,420
I told you.

231
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,750
I will start a new life...

232
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:39,620
as an ordinary person, Oh Heung Soo,
not as a backup dancer.

233
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,200
Ok Bun.

234
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,310
I love you.

235
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,490
Why are you hitting me?

236
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,330
Why did it have to be so hard
to hear this from you?

237
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,080
Heung Soo, the bus is here.

238
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,650
You can take the next one.

239
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,580
Let's not ruin the mood.

240
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,590
Okay.

241
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,230
What?

242
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,960
Chun Soo and Mi Sun are back
from their honeymoon.

243
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,730
I got a call from Mi Sun.

244
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,000
It must have been tough handling
the store alone all this time.

245
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,200
It was okay.

246
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,910
Why don't you wrap things up
and go now?

247
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,580
What's wrong? Did something happen?

248
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,320
I don't want to go home.

249
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,160
I don't think I'm ready
to see my mom's face.

250
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,270
Maybe it is because I saw your mom
when she was young,

251
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,070
but I think I can understand her.

252
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:11,410
My memory isn't so clear
because I was little,

253
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,140
but I remember...

254
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,780
how she always seemed
so nervous and tense around people.

255
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,850
I also remember that she was
always about to burst into tears.

256
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,590
If you could go back in time
and see your mom,

257
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:29,930
you would understand her better.

258
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,700
I'm trying to understand her,

259
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,300
but I just can't.

260
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,010
You don't need to rush.

261
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,610
Let's get over it little by little.

262
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,560
I'm home.

263
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,370
Were you with that punk,
Beom Soo, again?

264
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,140
He drove me home after work.

265
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,310
Knowing Kang Soo is
your own mother's son,

266
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:19,440
how can you want
to date his brother?

267
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,640
Are you out of your mind?

268
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,350
Why does it even matter?

269
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,520
Se Ri likes Beom Soo,
and Beom Soo cares for Se Ri.

270
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,690
What a graceful way to say something
that can mess up the family.

271
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,930
This is the bright world
of the 21st century.

272
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,490
Why would you say
something so old-fashioned?

273
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,600
Just keep your mouth shut!

274
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,600
I'll take care of my own business.

275
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,000
So can you two please take care
of your own problems without me?

276
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,340
I can't agree more with Se Ri.

277
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,240
Stop trying to drag Se Ri into this.

278
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,040
If you have something to say,
say it to me directly.

279
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,410
You kept your son hidden
for 30 years,

280
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,050
and now that you're finally caught,
you owe an apology.

281
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,520
What makes you so proud?

282
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,150
Because I felt bad,

283
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,760
I always gave in
and let you have your way.

284
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,630
Even after you found out
about Kang Soo,

285
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,600
I apologized more than enough.

286
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,070
But you tormented me and Kang Soo,
rubbing salt into the wound...

287
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,000
as if you'd found
our fatal weakness.

288
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,840
I'm telling you again.

289
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:26,140
I can't live like this anymore.

290
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,910
What's wrong with you?

291
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,820
And let me make myself clear, Se Ri.

292
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,520
As your mom, I'm sorry
for causing all the trouble...

293
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,350
with the issues about Kang Soo.

294
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,490
I really am.

295
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,790
But while raising you,

296
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:46,130
I've never neglected you
even for a moment as your mom.

297
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,570
I swear, with all my heart.

298
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,600
So you don't have to worry
about me and your dad.

299
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,540
Just find your own happiness.

300
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,750
I'll go to Eagle Brewery and beg...

301
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,280
so you can be with Beom Soo
with no worries.

302
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,760
I can't believe this.

303
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,630
You saw that, right?

304
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:21,370
This is how shameless and brazen...

305
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,200
your mom is.

306
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,600
How could she say such a thing
when she is at fault?

307
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,540
My goodness.

308
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,240
Good night.

309
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,340
As long as I'm alive,

310
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,350
I'll never take in
Beom Soo or Kang Soo.

311
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,950
I will never accept them!

312
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,620
Darn it.

313
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,700
Did you want to see me?

314
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,230
Have a seat.

315
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,750
What is this?

316
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,690
The bankbook for living expenses
and the household account book.

317
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,860
Now that you're officially
my younger sister-in-law,

318
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,490
I think I should give them to you.

319
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,460
No, Kwang Sook.
You can take care of them.

320
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,330
I'm busy with the brewery work.

321
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,340
And I'm not so meticulous.

322
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,970
So I believe...

323
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,310
you will take better care of them,
sister-in-law.

324
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,450
To be honest,
we've been in the red every month.

325
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,150
Kwang Sook.

326
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,290
You know the one in charge
of the family finances holds power.

327
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,220
Now, you're number one
at Eagle Brewery.

328
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:56,930
Okay?

329
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,940
(We're married!)

330
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,940
What's that?

331
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,250
I got the purse strings...

332
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,820
from Kwang Sook.

333
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,550
What?

334
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,820
I said it was okay,

335
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,290
but she insisted on giving me these.

336
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,890
So I had no choice but to take them.

337
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:30,290
This is a lot of pressure.

338
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:32,900
Kwang Sook...

339
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,600
must have strong faith in you.

340
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,840
Chun Soo.

341
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,840
Yes?

342
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,340
No matter how I look at it,

343
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,940
I think I married really well.

344
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,110
Kwang Sook is so nice to me.

345
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,480
And your brothers
are so sweet and kind.

346
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,990
Aren't I lucky?

347
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,520
That's all because
you have a great husband.

348
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,120
You're right.

349
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,590
What?

350
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,760
It's no fun
if you're quick to agree.

351
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,430
What can I do when it's the truth?

352
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,130
That's true.

353
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,370
Look at this.

354
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,970
No way.

355
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:17,770
(We're married!)

356
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:25,320
(Eagle Brewery)

357
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:46,240
(Eagle Brewery)

358
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,240
I thought handing over
the household books...

359
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,580
would feel like a relief.

360
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,490
But why does it feel like
I've lost a part of myself?

361
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,460
Is it because this means...

362
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,030
I'm getting closer...

363
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,700
to leaving Eagle Brewery?

364
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,290
Thanks to you,
we had a wonderful honeymoon.

365
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:38,760
It's only been a few days,
but you look even better.

366
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,160
Really?

367
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,990
- Let's have a seat.
- Sure.

368
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,500
I hope your time
at the hotel was enjoyable.

369
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,900
From the welcome drinks
to the meals,

370
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,070
everything was amazing.

371
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,480
Thanks to you, I scored
some major points with my wife.

372
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:59,840
I appreciate it.

373
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,480
By the way, here you go.

374
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:04,010
What's this?

375
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,750
Wild seaweed and anchovies.

376
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,250
My wife thought...

377
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,720
you likely already owned
many luxurious items,

378
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,860
so she recommended regional products
as a more appropriate gift.

379
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,990
Please thank her for me.
I'll enjoy these.

380
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:18,530
Right.

381
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,300
By the way,

382
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,970
it's about Kwang Sook.

383
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,210
How's her mood?

384
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,770
Kwang Sook?

385
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,510
Well...

386
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,640
She seems fine. Why do you ask?

387
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,750
Did something happen
while I was away?

388
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,420
My mother-in-law is visiting
from the US.

389
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,120
She's staying with us at the moment.

390
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,130
Your mother-in-law?

391
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,330
We had a meal together recently,

392
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,770
but given her own daughter,

393
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,570
my mother-in-law...

394
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,540
probably isn't very fond
of Kwang Sook.

395
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,340
She's been pretty prickly
toward her.

396
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,280
I had no idea.

397
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,550
Kwang Sook's not showing it,

398
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:14,280
but she must find it uncomfortable
and upsetting.

399
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,520
I never got that from her.

400
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,220
That's a relief to hear.

401
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,760
Given how social
and positive she is,

402
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,060
I'm sure she'll be understanding
about most things.

403
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,670
- She would be, right?
- Yes.

404
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,240
That's the Kwang Sook I know.

405
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,710
Right.

406
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,050
I'm back.

407
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,850
You did good work in this heat.

408
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,020
It was nothing.

409
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,120
By the way,

410
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,690
I heard Chairman Han's mother-in-law
was visiting from the US.

411
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,800
Oh, that. Yes, she is.

412
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,770
Chairman Han's worried sick
about how his mother-in-law...

413
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,840
has been acting sour toward you.

414
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,370
I admit she's been a bit prickly,

415
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,270
but it's okay.

416
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,350
Her reaction is understandable,
as this brings back memories...

417
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,080
of her daughter
who passed away young.

418
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,820
Of course.

419
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,220
Are you sure you're okay?

420
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,690
Absolutely.

421
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,660
If it were our own Ms. Gong,

422
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,360
things would've been way worse
for me.

423
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,430
Chairman Han...

424
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,730
wouldn't let his mother-in-law
sway his opinions,

425
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,230
so try not to let it bother you.

426
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,900
Sure. Thanks for saying that.

427
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,110
Hold on.

428
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,650
- It's the CEO of Samhan Mart.
- I see.

429
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:53,550
Yes, Mr. Kim. Have you been well?

430
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:55,850
Congratulations, Ms. Ma.

431
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,050
Sorry?

432
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,690
Do you remember when I said...

433
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,730
Jang-Kwang yakju was off
to a good start?

434
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,760
Yes.

435
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,200
Since being featured
in the LA local newspaper,

436
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,670
it's been attracting
a lot of attention...

437
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,800
from both Koreans in the US
and the local community.

438
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,340
You hit the jackpot.

439
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,340
Goodness. Really?

440
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:23,710
Sure. We were considering
doubling our exports.

441
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,120
Then, we'll make arrangements
to ship extra products.

442
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,890
I appreciate the good news, CEO Kim.

443
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,860
Sure.

444
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:37,830
Jang-Kwang yakju
is getting a great response...

445
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,400
from the local community in the US.

446
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,630
Wait. Even the locals like it?

447
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,170
That's right.

448
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:48,300
I can't tell if I'm dreaming or not.

449
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:51,370
Hold on. This could mean trouble.

450
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,810
Meeting export demand...

451
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:56,950
could lead to challenges
in domestic distribution.

452
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,090
Is this what they mean by the stress
of spending lottery winnings?

453
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,290
It's exactly that, Kwang Sook.

454
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:11,190
I heard the company...

455
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,330
was creating a subsidiary...

456
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,430
to build a new factory
for a premium line.

457
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,640
Yes. I see you were aware of it too.

458
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,440
Why on earth would you do that?

459
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,710
Everyone knows
the company is struggling...

460
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:28,010
due to declining sales
and financial losses.

461
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,280
How will you cope
if the big investment...

462
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,550
doesn't succeed?

463
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,690
Both employees and outsiders
are expressing their concerns.

464
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:39,790
Even the employee stock
ownership association,

465
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:41,190
which understands
the company's situation best,

466
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,230
is opposing it.

467
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,330
Mr. Jung, you must know
why the chairman is pushing this.

468
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:51,400
He seems
to have a personal grudge...

469
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,440
against Eagle Brewery.

470
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,240
My guess is...

471
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,880
he intends to shut down
Eagle Brewery permanently.

472
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,050
I see.

473
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,350
You may get back to work.

474
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,230
Unbelievable.

475
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,030
Look at you.

476
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,670
You're now barging
into my office unannounced.

477
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:26,070
This is your last warning.

478
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,210
Don't mess with Eagle Brewery,
and let it be.

479
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,270
What?

480
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,510
And please stop...

481
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:34,610
this unreasonable investment
you're making.

482
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:38,850
The alarm bells
are already ringing outside...

483
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,950
regarding our Silla Brewery.

484
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,690
This is my company.

485
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,960
Nobody knows it as well as I do.

486
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:49,030
Don't you realize
the company is suffering...

487
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,900
because you won't put aside
that petty ego?

488
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,330
Who do you think you're lecturing?

489
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,100
Who's suffering?

490
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,700
I did the math.

491
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,900
I began the project,
knowing it would deliver.

492
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:03,670
Then we're getting a divorce.

493
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,880
Know that I'll be suing you
for divorce.

494
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,250
Like divorcing is that simple.

495
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,850
Given that you're the one to blame,

496
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,550
how could you possibly win the case?

497
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,420
I gave my all to you and Se Ri.

498
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,760
That's why I have no regrets...

499
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,090
and wouldn't change a thing.

500
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,400
Wait.

501
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,630
What exactly are you hoping to gain
from divorcing me?

502
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,440
You'll be kicked to the curb,
completely broke.

503
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:34,440
I'm not after anything.

504
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:37,510
It's about protecting what matters.

505
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:41,710
What kind of crazy talk is this?

506
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,910
Just wait and see.

507
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:48,180
You'll come to realize
what I'm trying to protect.

508
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,330
I'm dying to find out.

509
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,770
Se Ri.

510
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,440
I stopped by
during your lunch break.

511
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,640
Do you have a moment to talk?

512
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,980
Of course.

513
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,520
I've been avoiding this,

514
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,790
not feeling brave enough
to face you.

515
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,520
But I came by
as I couldn't keep putting this off.

516
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:34,400
Who could have guessed
we'd be connected this way?

517
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,330
How could something
like this happen?

518
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,370
It all feels bizarre.

519
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:45,480
It sure is.

520
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,080
But...

521
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,950
I didn't mind knowing...

522
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,320
you were my little sister.

523
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,890
What about you, Se Ri?

524
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,890
Likewise.

525
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,660
Having a decent man like you
for an older brother?

526
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,970
What's not to like about that?

527
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Not only that,
but you also went out of your way...

528
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,940
to help me be with Professor Oh.

529
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:18,140
From the moment we met,

530
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,980
you didn't feel like
a stranger to me.

531
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,410
I wanted to help you
with everything...

532
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,110
and always be there to listen.

533
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,720
I also felt a connection to you,

534
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,150
which is why I asked you
for many favors.

535
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,560
I gained a kind...

536
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,430
and beautiful little sister,

537
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,130
and you gained an older brother.

538
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,500
It's not a complete loss.

539
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:52,640
Everything will seem serious
if you think of it that way.

540
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:55,010
But if you focus on the positive,

541
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,710
this might turn out
to be an unexpected gift.

542
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,020
So, I'm choosing the latter.

543
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,490
How can it be so simple for you?

544
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:10,490
Don't you resent our mom?

545
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,870
To be honest,
that's what I felt at first.

546
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,500
But she brought me into this world.

547
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:24,440
Thanks to that,
I was raised by the parents...

548
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,280
I admired the most...

549
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,750
and became a brother
to my beloved older brothers.

550
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,390
Nothing was missing from my life.

551
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:41,090
You clearly love your parents
and brothers.

552
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:43,590
I do.

553
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,630
That's why I'm trying
not to resent your mom.

554
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,600
I know it's tough,

555
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,270
but please try
to be understanding of her.

556
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:55,740
That's all I'm asking.

557
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,430
Hello.

558
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,870
Ha Ni.

559
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,070
What is it?

560
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,800
- Say hi to the babysitter.
- Hi.

561
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:31,910
My husband's knee surgery...

562
00:34:31,910 --> 00:34:33,440
has been scheduled for next week,

563
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,710
so I won't be able to babysit
for a month.

564
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,750
Gosh, really?

565
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,780
I'm sorry to spring this on you.

566
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,780
Don't be.
There's nothing you can do about it.

567
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:44,220
Is there someone else
who can look after Ha Ni?

568
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,890
I'll have to start looking today.

569
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,490
I shouldn't have sprung this on you,

570
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:51,430
but life can be unpredictable.

571
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,730
I'll ask around to see...

572
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,430
if someone can cover for me.

573
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,030
Right. Thanks for offering.

579
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,420
Tell me about it.
What's all this about?

Check out all the comments
that people left.

581
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:57,330
They're calling you
"Senior Edition Jimin."

582
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,330
Senior Edition Jimin?

583
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,700
It means you're as good a dancer
as Jimin of BTS,

584
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:10,310
but slightly a bit older.

585
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,280
Something like that.

586
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,750
It's a compliment, right?

587
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,250
Of course.

588
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,090
What if this wasn't
your retirement party,

589
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,620
but the beginning of your comeback?

590
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,360
Life is unpredictable for sure.

591
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,660
No one showed any interest...

592
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,260
when I desperately wanted attention.

593
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:35,130
I saw this as my last performance,

594
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,630
but it went viral instead.

595
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:44,910
Hello?

596
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,110
Yes, this is Oh Heung Soo.

597
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:52,550
Gwangwon Daily?

598
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,820
Yes, of course.

599
00:37:05,290 --> 00:37:06,730
Why did you suddenly
take me shopping?

600
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,600
You're interviewing for a newspaper,

601
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,400
so you can't wear just anything.

602
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,600
Welcome.

603
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,810
Right, hello.

604
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:17,310
Please feel free to look around.

605
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,610
Sure.

606
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,720
How's this?

607
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,450
Hey. It's nice.

608
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,400
Maybe this one's better.

609
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,330
This looks breathable and fresh.

610
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,600
Because you're naturally stylish,

611
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,340
everything looks good on you.

612
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,880
Am I naturally stylish?

613
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,210
Of course.

614
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:56,750
Can I offer my help?

615
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:58,550
Actually, yes.

616
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,390
Which of the two
looks better on him?

617
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,020
That combines a clean look
with practicality,

618
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,660
making it ideal for everyday wear.

619
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,430
What do you think?

620
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:19,400
I'm good
with whatever you choose for me.

621
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,610
We'll take this, then.

622
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,780
Sure.

623
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,320

624
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,590
- Hello.
- Hello.

625
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,590
I'm Reporter Kim Hui Ri
for Gwangwon Daily.

626
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,690
I'm Oh Heung Soo.

627
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:47,160
I'm Ji Ok Bun, Mr. Oh's manager.

628
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,560
It's a pleasure to meet you.

629
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,100
Your performance yesterday...

630
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,940
caused more of a buzz
than Hyun Jin Young's.

631
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,440
How does it feel?

632
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,080
It still feels surreal.

633
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,510
It seems like the effort...

634
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,720
and the sweat I've shed on stage
are finally being acknowledged.

635
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,980
And for that, I'm grateful.

636
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,220
You spent your days
running a sandwich shop...

637
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,920
and your evenings
rehearsing choreography.

638
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,590
It couldn't have been easy
balancing both.

639
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:20,630
"Splitting your focus..."

640
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,700
"doesn't mean halving your dream."

641
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,900
"Instead, it makes it glow
twice as bright."

642
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,340
With that mindset,

643
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:30,970
I did my best to practice the moves.

644
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,950
I'm sure you faced tough moments.

645
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,420
How did you get through them?

646
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,520
You want me to stop teaching
the Zumba dance here?

647
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,220
I was struggling...

648
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:48,060
- both financially and physically,
- Are you the owner of this sauna?

649
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,290
which made me feel like
my dance career was finished.

650
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,530
But when I was
doubting myself the most,

651
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,970
there was someone
who continued to believe in me.

652
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,850
Can we take a break for a photo?

653
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:10,880
Sure.

654
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,550
Just a second. Hold on.

655
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,460
Let me just
touch up his hair real quick.

656
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:20,790
Yes.

657
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:23,860
You must be his manager and stylist.

658
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:27,100
I'm his manager, stylist,

659
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,630
and the president of his fan club.

660
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,100
Right.

661
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,440
I'll take the photo, then.

662
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,440
Sure.

663
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:49,050
Others might not notice,

664
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:50,990
but I'm well aware.

665
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,920
My life is slowly being wiped away,

666
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,090
one particle at a time.

667
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,900
That's why I feel anxious.

668
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,830
She won't let it show,

669
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,140
but she must be
so afraid and anxious.

670
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,690
She's back.

671
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,420
Hello.

672
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,690
- You come by often.
- Yes.

673
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:32,560
I came to see the kids' grandmother.

674
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,660
Where is she?

675
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,400
She's in the study.

676
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
In the study?

677
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,650
Yes?

678
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,620
Why did you come by again?

679
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,060
I had an hour to kill
between deliveries,

680
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:07,530
so I came to see you.

681
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,470
How about we play...

682
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,940
just three rounds of Go-Stop?

683
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,580
We'll play what?

684
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,950
Go-Stop.

685
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:30,020
You get to use your fingers a lot,

686
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,350
and it forces you
to remember details.

687
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:36,030
And you have to think
which combination would be best.

688
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:41,230
I hear playing with cards
helps stimulate the brain.

689
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,600
Are you here to tease me?

690
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,970
I'm not teasing you.

691
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:52,240
Being alone all the time makes you
shrink away in body and spirit,

692
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:55,710
but talking and laughing together
revives the brain.

693
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:59,780
I wanted to become
a companion of sorts.

694
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,580
Do you think
I have the time to play Go-Stop?

695
00:43:03,350 --> 00:43:04,850
I have a lot to do.

696
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:10,030
Please tell me if you need help
running any errands.

697
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,390
I'll help as best I can.

698
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:16,530
Why are you trying so hard
to get on my good side?

699
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,400
Is it so you can marry Dong Seok?

700
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,710
If I dare say so,

701
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,380
we don't need your permission...

702
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,680
to get married.

703
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,510
I get it.

704
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:33,520
The ex-mother-in-law
has no authority?

705
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,220
You're pretty honest.

706
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,250
I'm not doing this...

707
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:41,120
to get on your good side.

708
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,230
I sincerely want to help.

709
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,330
Even if I need help,

710
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,030
I won't be asking you.

711
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,870
Please leave.

712
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,590
It's a photo of her
when she was young.

713
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,130
Who's the man next to her?

714
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:19,560
Why would you touch
what isn't yours?

715
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,000
I apologize.

716
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,900
I noticed it on the desk.

717
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,340
Get out.

718
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:53,560
I wish she'd let me
get a little closer.

00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:06,040
Here you go.

721
00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:13,450
What is it?

722
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,750
Is there more to say?

723
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,090
Well...

724
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:23,630
Speak up.

725
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:25,890
The board members...

726
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,000
keep asking me
if you're planning to remarry.

727
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,170
How did they notice?

728
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,600
They say sneezes and love
can't be hidden.

729
00:45:34,970 --> 00:45:36,840
Everyone's talking about it already.

730
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:40,740
News that you introduced her
to your mother-in-law...

731
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,280
has spread, you see.

732
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,080
Has it?

733
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:45,580
What shall we do?

734
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,580
Shall I call it a groundless rumor
and deny it?

735
00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:49,720
Why would we deny it?

736
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:51,290
Pardon?

737
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:56,190
Tell everyone that there will be
some good news soon.

738
00:45:57,530 --> 00:45:58,530
Yes, sir.

739
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:02,230
I'll tell the staff
to prepare to celebrate.

740
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:18,280
The makgeolli is here.

741
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:19,350
Oh, gosh.

742
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,180
Hello, Ms. Ma.

743
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,890
Hello and welcome.

744
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,820
Call us
from the parking level from now on.

745
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,290
We'll meet you there for the pickup.

746
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:30,490
Why would you do that?

747
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,600
Everyone who works here has heard.

748
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:36,700
Heard what?

749
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,200
That you will marry
our chairman soon.

750
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,240
What?

751
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,410
It's not fake news, is it?

752
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:49,880
It's not fake news, but...

753
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:54,020
But nothing's official yet.

754
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,620
Congratulations.

755
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,250
Do look out for us from now on.

756
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:00,920
If we ever offended you
unintentionally,

757
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,120
forgive us.

758
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:04,130
Don't be like this.

759
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:06,630
Can't you treat me casually
like you used to?

760
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,460
We treated you like that
when we didn't know better,

761
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:11,970
but now we know
you'll marry our chairman.

762
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,370
We can't treat you like our equal.

763
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:17,440
We will remain loyal to you...

764
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:19,410
as we always have.

765
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,040
Congratulations, madam.

766
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,850
Who are you calling "madam?"

767
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:27,420
Please don't do that.

768
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,120
I should ask Chun Soo...

769
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:38,430
to deliver to the hotel from now on.

770
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:40,160
Why?

771
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:43,930
Rumors about us seem to have spread.

772
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:47,200
The staff must feel uncomfortable.

773
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:52,410
Don't mind them too much.
Treat them as you would anyone else.

774
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,080
Consider it practice.

775
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,750
What? You don't like it?

776
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:01,350
It's not that I don't like it.

777
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:04,320
It's a lot of pressure.

778
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,190
I'm worried if I can handle it.

779
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:09,660
Don't try to do too well.

780
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,430
Just show them who you really are.

781
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,100
The person you are...

782
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:18,230
is what makes you charming, okay?

783
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:25,740
(3H Acupressure Bed)

784
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:27,110
How is it?

785
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:28,580
Isn't it relaxing?

786
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,750
I'd been feeling stiff,
but now I'm refreshed.

787
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,220
It's great.

788
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:39,590
Welcome to...

789
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,610
Liar, fraud, conman, dupe.

790
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,280
I'm really sorry...

791
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,080
for lying about going on dates.

792
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:09,350
What were you thinking
when you lied to me?

793
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:12,820
I wanted to make you notice me.

794
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,690
Not even elementary school kids
act that childishly.

795
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:17,260
Were you
this much of a cowardly loser?

796
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:20,330
I know I can make no excuse.

797
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,730
I'm sorry.

798
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:24,030
You're so sly and cunning.

799
00:49:24,370 --> 00:49:27,140
You came up with that ploy
to make me say...

800
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:28,500
I was interested in you.

801
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:31,640
I lied because I was afraid.

802
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,740
- You were afraid?
- Yes.

803
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,280
I was afraid of telling you...

804
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,920
how I felt about you without knowing
how you felt about me.

805
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:42,920
So I couldn't ask you out.

806
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,050
So you get rejected sometimes.

807
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:47,190
What man is so timid?

808
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,330
Your guts aren't half as big
as your build. My goodness...

809
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,260
Then...

810
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,100
when you said you were going
to propose to your date,

811
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,570
what would you have done
if I hadn't stopped you?

812
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,370
Then I would've lied
that I'd get married.

813
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,800
What?

814
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:05,670
My gosh.
Please forgive me this once.

815
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:09,710
I, Go Ja Dong, swear...

816
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:12,150
that I'll tell only the truth
from now on.

817
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,650
Stay right here.

818
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:19,290
I'll be back
after receiving the customers.

819
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:20,420
I'll stay right here.

820
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,690
Welcome.

821
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,330
- We'd like to look around.
- Sure.

822
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,830
Would you like to
take a look at this one first?

823
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:29,330
How much is this?

824
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:30,870
Please take a closer look.

825
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:34,140
(Eagle Brewery)

826
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:30,290
I know I'm uninvited,

827
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:33,700
but I'm here to tell you something.

828
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,400
What is it?

829
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,840
The thing is,

830
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,040
I am...

831
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:45,670
Kang Soo's birth mother.

832
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,840
What?

833
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,780
What do you mean?

834
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,020
Well...

835
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,450
Are you saying...

836
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,620
you are...

837
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,320
my youngest brother-in-law's
birth mother?

838
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:06,130
I was going to take this secret
to my grave,

839
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:08,630
but unfortunately,

840
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,630
Kang Soo recently
found out about it.

841
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:16,400
Kang Soo knows?

842
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,770
Yes. He knows everything.

843
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:25,250
I thought
his family should know that,

844
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,780
so I came here to tell you.

845
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,580
Wait.

846
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:32,020
Hang on a second.

847
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:34,890
How is that possible?

848
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:40,200
Mi Ae, don't you think
you're so shameless?

849
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,330
You are Kang Soo's mom?

850
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:44,600
How could you steal money...

851
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,900
from the family who raised
your own son and run away?

852
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:54,610
Back then,

853
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,310
I watched Kang Soo
grow up every day,

854
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:02,420
but I couldn't say I was his mom,
and it was killing me.

855
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:05,150
I wanted to settle down
and become successful...

856
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:06,150
as soon as possible...

857
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:08,590
so I could return
the money I stole...

858
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,260
and take Kang Soo back if possible.

859
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,560
Do you even hear yourself now?

860
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:20,970
The money
I took from you back then...

861
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:26,410
has always weighed on my mind
my entire life.

862
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,010
I tried to give it back
when things got better,

863
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:36,450
but I couldn't because my husband
was so stubbornly against it.

864
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:39,320
I know it sounds like an excuse,

865
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:42,720
but I tried to take care of it
a couple more times after that.

866
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,190
But my husband
opposed it every time.

867
00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:53,230
I'm really sorry.

868
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:58,670
But...

869
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:01,840
I will get my own way now.

870
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,110
I know it's too late,

871
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:08,220
but please wait
just a little longer.

872
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:10,420
Please.

873
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,150
This isn't about money.

874
00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:20,360
Then...

875
00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:23,800
what about Beom Soo and Se Ri?

876
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:26,840
Professor Oh has known...

877
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:29,070
for quite a while.

878
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:32,410
And now, Se Ri knows it too.

879
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:34,780
What?

880
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:36,240
What did you say?

881
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,950
I know I have no right
to ask you for this,

882
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:47,160
but can you...

883
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:49,820
please let Se Ri and Professor Oh...

884
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:53,760
love each other?

885
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,340
As her mom,

886
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:08,480
I'm begging you.

887
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:28,100
Hey, Chun Soo.

888
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:30,400
Come home right away.

889
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,200
Why? Is something wrong?

890
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:52,820
When on earth did you find out?

891
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,160
Maybe when I was eight.

892
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:59,830
I overheard the brewery manager
and Dad talking about it.

893
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:00,900
Hey, how could you...

894
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,730
Did you keep that to yourself
all this time?

895
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,240
I didn't want Kang Soo to find out.

896
00:56:10,370 --> 00:56:14,080
I heard you recently found out.

897
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:18,510
You must've been flustered
and shocked.

898
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:20,280
It was a little tough at first,

899
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:21,780
but I'm fine now.

900
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,390
Even we are so embarrassed
and shocked.

901
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:26,690
How can you be fine?

902
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:31,430
I was surprised
and confused at first.

903
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:35,060
But Beom Soo helped me a lot.

904
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:40,000
That's why
you two always stuck together.

905
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:46,610
You must've been...

906
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:49,980
suffering alone all this time.

907
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:58,290
I grew up receiving a lot of love
from my parents and brothers.

908
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,490
Maybe that's why...

909
00:57:00,490 --> 00:57:03,660
I didn't hate or resent
my birth mother so much.

910
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:07,960
You are so brave and strong.

911
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,770
I must say you're admirable.

912
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:28,080
Beom Soo.

913
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:30,890
Maybe you should reconsider...

914
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:33,960
your relationship with Se Ri.

915
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,290
Are you sure
you can handle all this?

916
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,830
What did your family say?

917
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:47,500
They all seemed surprised.

918
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,940
But things will get better.

919
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:53,880
What if they want us to stop dating?

920
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,510
It is something
we will have to overcome anyway.

921
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:01,180
Let's not worry too much.

922
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,500
What time do you think it is now?
Why are you so late?

923
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,570
I went to Eagle Brewery.

924
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:22,540
I told them
that I was Kang Soo's mom...

925
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,710
and apologized.

926
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,310
What? Are you insane?

927
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:31,650
You're busy being his mom
after all this time.

928
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:33,950
Let me ask you a favor
one last time.

929
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:37,250
Don't mess with Eagle Brewery.

930
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:39,750
You may be grateful to them...

931
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:42,960
because they took your son in,

932
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:45,060
but that's not the case for me.

933
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:47,200
To me, Eagle Brewery is...

934
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,200
just an obstacle
that stands in my way.

935
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,970
I won't let you do
whatever you want.

936
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,600
I will never allow you...

937
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:58,440
to hurt Eagle Brewery.

938
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,570
Fine!

939
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:02,240
Let's see who wins, then.

940
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:16,520
Hello? It's me.

941
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:19,930
My housekeeper told me just now...

942
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:22,800
that you stopped by again.

943
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,170
On my way to the hotel
for the delivery,

944
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:29,040
I stopped by for a moment
as I thought...

945
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:30,370
your mother-in-law
must be lonely alone.

946
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:34,080
You don't have to try so hard.

947
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,240
It's not like that.

948
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,880
I mean, she's not nice to you.

949
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,110
Why do you keep seeing her...

950
00:59:40,110 --> 00:59:42,050
and hearing things
you don't deserve?

951
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,490
I'm upset when you hear
harsh things from her.

952
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:47,590
I already told you.

953
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,660
If you need to see her again
for any reason,

954
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:54,800
we'll meet her together, okay?

955
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:59,400
Why aren't you answering me?

956
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:04,340
Sure. I'll do that.

957
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,120
Did you hear
about the chairman remarrying?

958
01:00:14,350 --> 01:00:16,150
No way. With whom?

959
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:18,190
The brewery CEO
who delivers makgeolli...

960
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:19,420
to the hotel.

961
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:21,090
Gosh, how romantic.

962
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,860
- It feels like a Hollywood movie.
- I know.

963
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:26,060
Rumor has it the brewery CEO...

964
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,860
will head the F and B department
once they're married.

965
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:30,130
- Really?
- Yes.

966
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:32,330
Should we make
a good impression on her ahead of time?

967
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:33,840
- Maybe we should.
- We should.

968
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:39,410
(Pot Number 6)

969
01:00:51,450 --> 01:00:52,790
Hello, ma'am.

970
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,290
Could you come
to the hotel right now?

971
01:00:57,430 --> 01:00:58,760
Right now?

972
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,230
Ma'am.

973
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:08,100
Have a seat.

974
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,070
Right.

975
01:01:17,850 --> 01:01:20,210
You said you had something urgent
to tell me.

976
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:22,920
I'll get straight to the point.

977
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:26,950
I'm tense about
the chairman's second marriage...

978
01:01:28,060 --> 01:01:30,290
because I have to speak
for my late daughter.

979
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,230
Yes, of course.

980
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,330
I understand.

981
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,430
My top priorities...

982
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,230
are my grandchildren's happiness...

983
01:01:40,900 --> 01:01:42,500
and their inheritance.

984
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:45,210
That's why I want to resolve this...

985
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:48,540
while my mind is still sharp.

986
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,610
And here I thought
it was about something else.

987
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,520
I'm not interested...

988
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:58,090
in the chairman's money.

989
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:02,920
You should know...

990
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:05,490
that I turned down...

991
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,700
his marriage proposal at first.

992
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,000
If I were after his money,

993
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:12,700
- would I have done that?
- Keep up the good work.

994
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,730
Yes, sir.

995
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,100
Is that the truth?

996
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,110
This isn't something I can show you,

997
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:21,610
so how can I get you to believe me?

998
01:02:22,610 --> 01:02:25,350
If so, can you come with me
to meet a lawyer...

999
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:27,880
and sign away your rights?

1000
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,550
My rights?

1001
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:33,490
That you'll give up your claim
to the inheritance...

1002
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,690
and leave it
to my grandchildren instead.

1003
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,130
Absolutely.

1004
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:41,530
Really?

1005
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:44,430
Then, let's wrap this up
and take it to a lawyer.

1006
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:46,830
- Sure.
- Mother.

1007
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,010
Dong Seok?

1008
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:53,840
What do you think you're doing?

1009
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:51,030
(For Eagle Brothers)

1010
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:54,240
As much as I cherish and adore you,

1011
01:03:54,570 --> 01:03:57,210
I want others
to respect you equally.

1012
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:59,240
It's Mommy.

1013
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:00,680
My baby.

1014
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:03,010
She must be
your ex-husband's girlfriend.

1015
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:06,150
I'm only doing this
because I can't let that child...

1016
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,980
take care of my baby.

1017
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:09,350
It feels as though...

1018
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:11,520
- we've grown close,
- Cheers.

1019
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:12,990
which I like.

1020
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:14,820
I thought we were already close.

1021
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,860
I haven't been able to reach
my mother-in-law.

1022
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,330
She left the house
without telling anyone,

1023
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:21,930
and now I can't reach her.
She's not answering her phone.

1024
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:23,560
What are you saying?
