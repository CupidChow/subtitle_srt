00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:05,110
(Episode 49)

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,780
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

3
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,290
You have no idea...

4
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,960
what I had to endure just to last...

5
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,470
at this company.

6
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:39,610
If you hadn't thrown away your vote,

7
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,210
I'd still be CEO.

8
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,820
Honey, please.

9
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:48,990
I know no one should be trusted
in this world,

10
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,360
but I didn't know
you'd stab me in the back.

11
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,200
Never did I think...

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,600
you'd betray me.

13
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,670
I didn't betray you.

14
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,770
This wasn't a betrayal?

15
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,910
If that wasn't betrayal,

16
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:10,780
then what was it?

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,110
We've come too far,
carrying all this risk.

18
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,250
Once the legal matters
are behind us,

19
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,520
we can begin again
from the start, honey.

20
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,990
All I did was
spread one lousy video...

21
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,460
and embezzle money 30 years ago.

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,400
Did I do something that bad
that I should...

23
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,860
step down from my position?

24
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,140
Just like you wanted,

25
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:43,110
I'm...

26
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,380
finished.

27
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,610
No, honey. This isn't the end.

28
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,180
Losing Silla Brewery...

29
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:55,220
is like losing my entire life!

30
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,200
Why would you say that?

31
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,370
Whatever others say,

32
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,000
you are Silla Brewery's
largest shareholder.

33
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,440
The company belongs to you.

34
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,950
You mocked me to comfort me?

35
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,450
You kicked me out of my own company.

36
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,780
I'll see if you...

37
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,420
live happily with your son.

38
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,110
Mom.

39
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,080
What happened?

40
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,750
He was dismissed.

41
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,190
How is Dad? Is he okay?

42
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,860
He'll get over it.

43
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,030
He's strong.

44
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,070
He won't crumble easily.

45
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,470
What happens now?

46
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,880
Things will be tough for a while,

47
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,640
but it'll get better with time.

48
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,090
It will all pass.

49
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,430
(Warning: The river is deep,
take extra caution.)

50
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,910
I worked at Silla my whole life
and built up the whole company,

51
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,020
and to think that I got...

52
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,190
dismissed before my time.

53
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,320
All because...

54
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,360
my trusted wife betrayed me.

55
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,860
I was a fool.

56
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,810
Even though she hated me...

57
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,020
Even though she hated me,

58
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,620
for Se Ri's sake,

59
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,690
she shouldn't do this to me.

60
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,210
Hello, Mr. Lawyer.

61
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,350
Are you free to chat?

62
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,650
Yes. Go ahead.

63
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,890
The police investigation is over.

64
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,220
Your case was transferred
to the prosecution.

65
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,990
The witness' statement
was clear and very detailed.

66
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,560
I don't think you will be acquitted.

67
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,200
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,070
Okay.

69
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,370
I see.

70
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,810
You must prepare well
to deal with the prosecutor.

71
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,840
I'll do my best
so you can avoid a prison sentence.

72
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:41,810
Can you come to my office tomorrow?

73
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,820
Yes. I'll see you tomorrow.

74
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:25,420
I've known Dokgo Tak for many years,

75
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,190
but I didn't think he'd fall so far.

76
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,760
It won't be easy
to make a comeback...

77
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,330
if his case goes to the prosecution.

78
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,530
He forgot
the favors he'd received...

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,610
and did bad things
just to increase his profit.

80
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,980
People like him may seem successful
on the outside,

81
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,940
but they're bound
to cause their own downfall.

82
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,120
Yes. I think you're right.

83
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,350
Do you remember our dinner plans
with both of my mothers-in-law?

84
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,020
Yes.

85
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,060
I'll send a car
to the brewery on time.

86
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,600
Are you alone?

87
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,870
Yes.

88
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,400
The housekeeper just left
to get some groceries.

89
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,710
Do you remember
our dinner appointment?

90
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,910
Don't treat me like I'm a patient.

91
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,140
I'm not that scatterbrained yet.

92
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,750
I can handle my day-to-day schedule.

93
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,880
- Let's sit down.
- Okay.

94
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,630
Last time,

95
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,460
you said you wanted me
to live with you.

96
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:41,570
I'm grateful for the offer,
but I refuse.

97
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,300
I didn't make the offer flippantly.

98
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,870
I thought carefully
before bringing it up.

99
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,840
I know, and I'm grateful
that you thought of me,

100
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,610
but my ego won't allow me...

101
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,750
to depend on someone.

102
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,220
That's my principle
and how I live my life.

103
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:03,350
- But...
- If things become tough,

104
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:06,390
I'll look into other solutions then.

105
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,690
Don't worry about me already.

106
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,100
I have friends in the US too.

107
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,030
Even so, I'm worried.

108
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,770
I can't ignore others...

109
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,210
once I know they're ill
or in need of help.

110
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,280
Being kindhearted and affectionate
isn't always a good thing.

111
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,010
It's hard on you,

112
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,750
and you lose out a lot.

113
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,280
I'd rather lose out a bit...

114
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,720
if that would make me feel better.

115
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:37,360
You always want to have
the last word.

116
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Goodness.

117
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,890
You are...

118
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,600
a rarity.

119
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,900
And that makes you precious.

120
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,070
Hello.

121
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,910
Hello. It has been a while.

122
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,080
Ms. Ma won't join us?

123
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,480
She'll come straight to the hotel.

124
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,880
I see. Please.

125
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,320
Oh, are you going somewhere?

126
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,520
- Hello.
- Hi.

127
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:13,060
Chairman Han invited me to dinner.

128
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,430
I see.

129
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,160
Have a good time.

130
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,230
Okay.

131
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,380
Didn't she look
so elegant and classy?

132
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,160
I wish I could get
that kind of special treatment.

133
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,300
After you, madam.

134
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,100
I'll escort you
to the master bedroom.

135
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,900
Thank you, Mr. Oh.

136
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,140
Watch your step.

137
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,980
Come this way.

138
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,750
Hello.

139
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,830
Can I help with something?

140
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:25,700
No, there's nothing else to do.

141
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,800
If you want,
help prep the bean sprouts.

142
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,900
Okay.

143
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,340
We'll do it.

144
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,080
We met Ms. Gong outside.

145
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,110
She left to have dinner
with Chairman Han.

146
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,080
With Kwang Sook
and the other mother-in-law too.

147
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,090
The four of them
are meeting for dinner.

148
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,460
Are they meeting
to set a date for the wedding?

149
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,790
Oh, well...

150
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,860
It looks like
Kwang Sook will leave us...

151
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,000
pretty soon.

152
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,930
Yes.

153
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,470
We should prepare ourselves.

154
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,510
I don't think I can do this.

155
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,210
I don't feel well.

156
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,480
I should go and lie down for a bit.

157
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:16,710
What?

158
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,520
I'm sorry, Mi Sun.

159
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,450
There's no need to apologize.

160
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,690
Take her to your room.

161
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,360
Okay. Come with me.

162
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,700
Did she eat something bad?

163
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,930
She's just tired.

164
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,500
In just a few days,
they got married...

165
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,500
and visited her family in the US.

166
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:43,070
Goodness...

167
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,450
How is your mother-in-law doing?

168
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,220
Her condition isn't that bad yet.
It's still in the early stage.

169
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,150
I see.

170
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,930
Kwang Sook's too sweet
for her own good,

171
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,590
and when she said
she wanted to live with Ms. Park,

172
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,400
I felt almost distraught.

173
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,730
I'm glad you talked sense into her.

174
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,600
Thank you.

175
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,970
I'm sorry for causing you
so much concern.

176
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,880
Oh, gosh.

177
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,650
Hello.

178
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,690
Do you recognize me?

179
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,060
Don't treat me like I'm a patient.

180
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,190
I'm not treating you
like you're a patient.

181
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm worried about you. That's all.

182
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,430
Are you teasing me on purpose?

183
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,470
Take a seat, Mother.

184
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,710
Shall I?

185
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,260
I know...

186
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,330
I'm in no position to get involved,

187
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,590
but I'd like to say something.

188
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,800
The wedding.

189
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,600
How about having it this month?

190
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:21,470
I'm flying back to the US
on the last day of the month,

191
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,640
and I'd like to witness
your wedding before I leave.

192
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,380
Ms. Park.

193
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:28,880
Mother.

194
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,720
You're actually blessing
my daughter and Dong Seok...

195
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,820
with all your heart?

196
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:39,560
I couldn't say this
if I didn't mean it.

197
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:45,200
To be honest, I thought
you weren't good enough...

198
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,000
to become Dong Seok's spouse
at first.

199
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,370
Your poor education,
background, and circumstances.

200
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,070
But...

201
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,910
I experienced a lot of things
during my stay,

202
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,740
and it made me see...

203
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,110
you're the kind of person
Dong Seok needs.

204
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,220
Not someone
who accentuates what he has,

205
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,720
but one who makes up
for what he lacks.

206
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,490
Isn't that what true soulmates
are supposed to do?

207
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,600
Thank you for saying so.

208
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:24,030
That boosted my self-confidence too.

209
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,070
We might as well
take care of business while we can.

210
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,510
Let's set the date right now.

211
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,740
Mom. We can't pick a date
right away.

212
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:36,480
The chairman has a busy schedule.

213
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,680
I'll call Mr. Park a bit later.

214
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,690
We can set a date afterward.

215
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:42,950
Yes.

216
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,260
Dong Seok, since you're well-known
and have a certain social status,

217
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,690
we should have a grand wedding.

218
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:52,460
Book the biggest hall,

219
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:54,370
set up the brightest lights,
order flowers,

220
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,030
decorate the place lavishly,

221
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,400
organize an after-party, and...

222
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,740
It's not their first marriage.

223
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,640
Let's keep it small-scale.

224
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,940
Simple but cozy.

225
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,250
But there will be lots of guests...

226
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:09,780
and employees who will want to come.

227
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,080
I don't think we should cut corners.

228
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,950
I'm not saying
we should cut corners.

229
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,090
Let's keep it on the down low
but classy.

230
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,560
There's no need to show off.

231
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,530
That's right.

232
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:26,600
It's not good to show off.

233
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,900
What?

234
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,200
Your mother isn't saying...

235
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,370
she wants to show off.

236
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,140
She's saying she wants us...

237
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,980
to get married with the blessing
of as many people as possible.

238
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,790
Kwang Sook, what will you do
with the brewery?

239
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,250
I think you should leave...

240
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,920
and focus on running the household
and supporting Dong Seok.

241
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,260
At first, I also thought
that she should...

242
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,030
leave the brewery
as soon as she got married,

243
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,900
but not anymore.

244
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,870
It's old-fashioned for a woman
to drop everything to support a man.

245
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,310
A career can do wonders
for a woman's self-esteem,

246
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,340
and it enriches her life.

247
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,950
That's right.
I agree with you wholeheartedly.

248
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,450
Do you agree as well?

249
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,750
To be honest, I must say...

250
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:24,090
that disheartens me a bit.

251
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:28,330
What? Why did you change your mind?

252
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,890
We talked about it already.

253
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,030
Did you lie to me?

254
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,830
I didn't lie.

255
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,770
I'm saying how I really feel.

256
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:40,040
Why are you so stuffy
when you run a company yourself?

257
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,240
"Stuffy?"

258
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,270
Aren't you going a bit too far?

259
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,780
I'm not going too far.

260
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,110
Times have changed.

261
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,550
He can't demand
that his wife stay home.

262
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,550
Times might have changed,

263
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,250
but a woman
should follow the same rules.

264
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,320
Men like Dong Seok
who run a large company...

265
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,630
need a wife to stay grounded
so he can concentrate on his work.

266
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,590
Don't you know
how important that is?

267
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,430
Who says the wife
has to be the one to do that?

268
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,880
You both have a good point.

269
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,810
Kwang Sook and I will discuss
and come to a conclusion.

270
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,990
Yes. We'll discuss it carefully.

271
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,070
CEO Ma is calm and sincere,

272
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,140
but her mother
is a show-off and bragger.

273
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,740
I don't like her at all.

274
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,710
You only saw a certain side of her.

275
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,450
She's kind and pleasant.

276
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,920
If she were any kinder
or more pleasant,

277
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,550
people would think
she's the one with dementia, not me.

278
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,960
She doesn't seem
to have a sensible bone in her body.

279
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,030
Good night.

280
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,360
Sleep well.

281
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,480
Hello, sir.

282
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,380
Sorry for calling late at night.

283
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,720
I have something urgent to ask.

284
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,420
It's fine. What is it, sir?

285
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:40,360
Are any of our banquet halls
available on a weekend this month?

286
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,030
Whose wedding do you think?

287
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,030
It's mine, of course.

288
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,240
An ex-mother-in-law
should act the part.

289
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,070
Why does she act like
she's the groom's mom?

290
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:58,410
From the date of the wedding
to its size.

291
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:01,080
Why does she think
she has the final say?

292
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,380
She's worried. That's all.

293
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,750
Don't read too much into it.

294
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,090
Hey! I'm not reading
too much into it.

295
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,550
Whose side are you on?

296
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,790
Are you her daughter or mine?

297
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,820
I'm sick of your childish rant.

298
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:17,490
She's the childish one, not me.

299
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,000
Who does she think she is
that she wants to decide...

300
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,870
what happens
at her ex-son-in-law's wedding?

301
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,470
Come on.

302
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,140
- Someone's calling.
- I'm so hot.

303
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
Look.

304
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,980
Calm down and go to bed.

305
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,640
Sleep well.

306
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,890
I wanted this wedding to be,
at the very least,

307
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,920
big and fancy enough...

308
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,390
for the whole world to see.

309
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:50,860
Darn it.

310
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,900
Two Saturdays from now?

311
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,170
That soon?

312
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:05,910
I just got off the phone
with Mr. Park.

313
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,380
That's the only day
the banquet hall is available.

314
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:11,450
Even so...

315
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,750
We can't rush a marriage like that.

316
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,860
Kwang Sook.

317
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,460
Don't you look forward
to living with me?

318
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,800
I'm about to get upset.

319
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,170
That's not what I mean.

320
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,400
I want to prepare well...

321
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,940
so our beginning is nice and sweet.

322
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,340
Don't try
to make everything perfect.

323
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,810
It's okay to lack a few things,

324
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,510
and even if we forget stuff,
that's okay too.

325
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,650
Once we get together,

326
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,490
we can fill in the rest
as we need or want.

327
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,990
Okay.

328
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:56,560
Let's do that.

329
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,130
My dad was dismissed
from his CEO position,

330
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,470
and his case was transferred
to the prosecution.

331
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,870
It was such a long day.

332
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,810
I see that.

333
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,580
How is your mother?

334
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,980
She's having a rough time.

335
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,050
It looks like
she's turned against Dad.

336
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:28,330
Beom Soo's having a hard time too.

337
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,030
He very rarely shows how he feels.

338
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,030
Even when he smiles,
he suffers alone inside.

339
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,240
That's what he's like.

340
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,870
But these days...

341
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,640
It shows too much.

342
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,310
He has no energy,

343
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,480
and his eyes lack the usual sparkle.

344
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,950
I guess it's because
you're not by his side.

345
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,220
I feel like calling him
all the time,

346
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,200
but I'm not sure if I should.

347
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,060
I keep holding back.

348
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:10,400
My parents caused your family
so much pain,

349
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,440
so how could I
shamelessly be with him...

350
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,540
like nothing ever happened?

351
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:17,610
I can't do that.

352
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:21,080
There's nothing shameless about it.

353
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,750
That's love.

354
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:25,850
Beom Soo decided to be with you,
ready to face whatever came next.

355
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:29,350
The rest of the family doesn't think
of you any differently either.

356
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,720
What your parents did
is their business,

357
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,090
and your life is yours to live.

358
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,190
Thanks for putting it that way.

359
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,730
Also,

360
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:45,440
I find comfort in the fact
that we can share our worries.

361
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,040
I'm glad
I could help you feel at ease.

362
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,950
By the way,

363
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,350
is it okay to call you my brother?

364
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,390
What?

365
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,490
I've been calling you that to myself
since the last time we met,

366
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,960
but I didn't have the courage...

367
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,960
to say it out loud.

368
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:17,970
Would that be okay?

369
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,040
Of course.

370
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,110
Thanks, Kang Soo.

371
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,490
Honey.

372
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,330
I was kicked out of the company...

373
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,870
I spent my whole life building.

374
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,940
And...

375
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,270
by the hands of my own wife,
of all people.

376
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,110
So tell me.
Are you happy now that...

377
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,950
you've pushed me out?

378
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,480
Is it music to your ears?

379
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,990
Of course, I'm not happy
that you were removed as CEO.

380
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,120
It breaks my heart.

381
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,790
Then why...

382
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,500
Why did you do this?

383
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,570
Why did you throw everything away?

384
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:26,000
It was to protect what we have,
not to throw it away.

385
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,640
You might think differently,
but I did it for your sake.

386
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:32,240
You removed me
from the CEO position...

387
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,210
for my own good?

388
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,350
- That's right.
- What?

389
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,190
You were falling apart,

390
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,850
blinded by greed and anger.

391
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,360
So?

392
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,330
You got me to stop? Is that it?

393
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,030
That's right.

394
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,800
I had to stop you
before you hit rock bottom.

395
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,940
Unbelievable.

396
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,310
If you keep pushing like this,

397
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:14,480
you'll end up responsible
for much more.

398
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,050
An investigation
from the prosecutors' office,

399
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,220
distrust from your shareholders,

400
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,120
and panicking employees.

401
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,860
Do you really think
you can handle it all alone?

402
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,360
And after I'm dismissed,

403
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,630
do you really think
all those problems will disappear?

404
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:33,040
We can't expect
every issue to be fully resolved,

405
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,770
but you still need to have
an exit strategy.

406
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,140
And that will take time...

407
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,840
for both you and the company.

408
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,610
I chose not to vote...

409
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,780
to buy us that time.

410
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,530
Once the company returns to normal,

411
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,660
your shares will increase in value.

412
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,130
As long as you show
that you're repenting,

413
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,340
you could regain control
of the company.

414
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:09,240
So please,
cooperate with the investigation...

415
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,940
Are you picking me up
after kicking me down?

416
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,010
Honey, please.

417
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,280
Hurting me is one thing,

418
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:19,220
but you shouldn't have done this
for Se Ri's sake.

419
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,550
Do you understand?

420
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:24,720
Get out.

421
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,690
Get out of this house!

422
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,800
I will leave if you tell me to.

423
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,900
But I swear, I refused to vote...

424
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,170
for you and Se Ri, for our family.

425
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,440
Just shut that mouth!

426
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,920
Ms. Dokgo, I know it won't be easy,
but take good care of your parents.

427
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,560
Why do you keep calling me that
when I'm now calling you my brother?

428
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,300
You should call me by my name.

429
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,160
Is that so?

430
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,330
Take good care of them, Se Ri.

431
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,840
Got it.

432
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Mom?

433
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:21,780
Goodness.

434
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,280
How are you both here together?

435
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:30,290
I talked with my brother at a cafe,

436
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,490
and he offered to drive me home.

437
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,920
Your brother?

438
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,600
Anyway, what's with the suitcase?

439
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,500
Oh, this?

440
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,670
Your dad doesn't want me around.

441
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,270
What?

442
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:51,980
That's insane.

443
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,450
Are you saying he kicked you out?

444
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,950
It's nothing like that.

445
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,080
Your dad needs some time
by himself to think.

446
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,520
He has a lot to prepare
for the indictment and trial,

447
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:06,420
which is why
I'm giving him some space.

448
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,990
I wouldn't mind
getting a breather myself.

449
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,860
Where are you going to stay?

450
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,600
I booked a room at a hotel.

451
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,440
I'll take you there.

452
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,120
I heard you forfeited your vote
at the shareholders' meeting.

453
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,790
Why did you do that?

454
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:45,430
He wouldn't stop,
even though he had to.

455
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,270
He was putting everyone in danger,

456
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,600
and I had to stop him.

457
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,540
Will you be all right?

458
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,650
Se Ri's father and I...

459
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,380
are paying off the debt we owe.

460
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,690
We're being punished.

461
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,490
I want you...

462
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,890
to hurt less, Mother.

463
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,470
Don't worry.

464
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,940
If you can't avoid it, it's better
to face the punishment sooner.

465
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,670
And if it's inevitable,

466
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,780
the punishment should be painful.

467
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,050
If it's still too much for you,
don't bear the pain alone.

468
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,790
Just reach out to me.

469
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,560
Thanks.

470
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,530
Beom Soo, are you asleep?

471
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,000
No, come in.

472
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,140
You got off work later than usual.

473
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,440
Well...

474
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,840
I met up with Se Ri
and took her home.

475
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,480
Se Ri?

476
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,650
She's going to call me
by my name as well now.

477
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,720
That's good to hear.

478
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,560
I also dropped Mother off
at a hotel.

479
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:56,090
Why a hotel?
What do you mean by that?

480
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,700
She left her house.

481
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,360
What?

482
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,100
Mother forfeited
her right to vote...

483
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,030
at the shareholders' meeting,

484
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,670
which resulted in
CEO Dokgo Tak's dismissal.

485
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,240
Right, I see.

486
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,480
Se Ri's having a rough time.

487
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,710
She needs you by her side
at a time like this.

488
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,580
I wanted to keep the promise
I made to you,

489
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,980
but talking to Kang Soo
made me worried,

490
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,250
and I couldn't stay away.

491
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,790
I'm sorry for breaking my word.

492
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,310
Thank you...

493
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,610
for breaking our promise first.

494
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,320
It's been tough, hasn't it?

495
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,550
Yes.

496
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:07,220
I felt like
everything was falling apart.

497
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,900
Everything isn't falling apart.

498
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,170
Just your heart is breaking.

499
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:19,740
That is what's making you
even lonelier and more afraid.

500
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,270
It felt like
I was all alone in the world.

501
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,110
How could you be alone...

502
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:29,010
when I'm right here,
ready to offer you my hand?

503
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,980
Take it whenever you want.

504
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,820
You can lean on me too.

505
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,290
You can also ask me to be your rock.

506
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,940
Thank you, Professor.

507
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,450
Hey!

508
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,090
- Come a little closer.
- What?

509
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,760
It's fine.

510
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,660
What do you mean?

511
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,290
Just come a little closer.

512
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,630
- Come on.
- A little bit more.

513
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:22,930
I understand they're newlyweds,

514
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,170
but they can't be doing this
first thing in the morning.

515
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,540
Tell me about it.

516
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,640
They're not the only newlyweds here.

517
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,340
We're newlyweds too.

518
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:33,910
Stop it.

519
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,280
(Gongjubuyang Shampoo)

520
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:40,120
No way.

521
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,150
How is it, Heung Soo? Isn't it fire?

522
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,220
Right, it sure is.

523
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,890
The massage is on fire as well.

524
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,500
I'll give you the full experience,

525
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,330
so just sit back and relax.

526
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:56,330
Sure.

527
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,940
Who is it?

528
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,200
Don't you think
it's a bit early in the morning...

529
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,910
for an R-rated performance?

530
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,780
I get that you're newlyweds,

531
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,480
but let's dial it down a bit.

532
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,710
Heung Soo,
there are other people living here.

533
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,150
What are they talking about?

534
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,820
Beats me.

535
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,120
What the...

536
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,330
Why are you all standing out here?

537
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:23,930
Were you washing your hair?

538
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,600
Yes.

539
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,000
Ok Bun was shampooing my hair.

540
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:30,870
What's wrong?

541
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,170
Get back to it, then.

542
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,040
Goodness.

543
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,490
Oh, my.

544
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,860
I doubt there's another guy
in Korea...

545
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,660
who gets the full treatment
like I do.

546
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,130
I, Oh Heung Soo,
hit the jackpot with my wife.

547
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:01,300
Are you only realizing that now?

548
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,530
- Check the texture of your hair.
- Sure.

549
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,240
It's nice and soft.

550
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:11,540
You hardly have to do anything...

551
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,810
to give your hair
this kind of volume.

552
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,910
I see.

553
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,310
What do you think? Do you like it?

554
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:19,180
I do. Good.

555
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,920
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

556
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,390
Ms. Yoon.

557
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,830
Yes, Mr. Chairman?

558
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,730
What's the trend
for marriage proposals these days?

559
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:38,730
Sorry?

560
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:41,570
Getting down on one knee...

561
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,570
and handing over a ring...

562
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,740
It all feels too awkward for me.

563
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,240
It's not like
I'm shooting a movie here.

564
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,750
What does CEO Ma want?

565
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,780
If I ask her, she'll probably say
it's unnecessary.

566
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:58,250
But I can't shake the feeling that
she might get upset down the line.

567
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:01,590
Of course. Women get upset...

568
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,460
when men skip wedding proposals.

569
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,600
Darn.

570
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,870
(Chairman's Office)

571
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,670
What is it?
Did something happen in there?

572
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,670
The chairman seems to have
a headache about how to propose.

573
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,480
Is he going to propose?

574
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,580
It seems that way.

575
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,280
Hello.

576
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,050
Hello.

577
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,420
Is there something exciting?

578
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,760
What is it?

579
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:39,500
The chairman seems to have
a headache about how to propose.

580
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,500
He's going to propose?

581
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,730
It looks like
he's going to officially propose...

582
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,570
with a ring and everything.

583
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,610
Gosh, a proposal sounds
embarrassing.

584
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,910
You can't let him know
that we told you, CEO Ma.

585
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,610
Sure.

586
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:03,920
How many guests do you think
you'll invite to the wedding?

587
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,060
I'm not sure.

588
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,030
I'd prefer to invite
just my family...

589
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:12,030
and the employees at the brewery.

590
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,730
Ten will be enough for me.

591
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,170
Come on.

592
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,540
Even a birthday party
for an elementary school kid...

593
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,100
would have more guests.

594
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,510
Don't you have
more people to invite?

595
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,410
It's not like
this is my first marriage.

596
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:30,050
As I said before,

597
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:33,180
I want a small wedding,

598
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,580
just with our families.

599
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,460
What you're suggesting is
more like a micro-wedding.

600
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,490
How many guests are you thinking
of inviting, sweetie?

601
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,430
The hotel board members,

602
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:52,100
some business leaders, politicians,

603
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,000
the press,

604
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:58,710
my relatives, and friends.
All in all,

605
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,440
even if I leave out the ones
who don't need to be there,

606
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,180
I'm expecting about 500.

607
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,220
Five hundred guests?

608
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,350
Wait a second.

609
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:12,250
This isn't the company anniversary.

610
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:15,220
Who invites this many people
to a wedding?

611
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:18,030
Hold on.
Is 500 people really that many?

612
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,600
I only counted the people
who need to be there...

613
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,500
and didn't even include the others.

614
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:27,600
Even your mother-in-law mentioned...

615
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:31,110
that it'd be better to have
a small but meaningful wedding.

616
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:34,540
That's just
what my mother-in-law thinks.

617
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:40,120
I want to brag to the world...

618
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,450
that I'm marrying an amazing woman.

619
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,790
I don't want to do things halfway...

620
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,720
just because
it's our second marriage.

621
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,190
I'd like our wedding
to be formal and proper.

622
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:55,130
Like formalities really matter.

623
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:57,570
In the end, it's all just for show.

624
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:58,600
Exactly.

625
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,540
I want the whole world to see...

626
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:05,270
that you're my wife.

627
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,880
I want to make it official...

628
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,450
and brag to everyone
that you're by my side.

629
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,580
But...

630
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,420
marriage isn't about boasting
or flaunting.

631
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:22,020
It's an event
where we pledge to build...

632
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,460
a beautiful future together.

633
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,830
I don't care
about wearing a fancy dress...

634
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:31,230
or having an extravagant ceremony.

635
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,340
All I need is...

636
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,070
for you to take my hand...

637
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:42,310
and let me be part of your life.

638
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,150
Rather than showing off to people,

639
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:53,490
I want a wedding
that will be remembered.

640
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:58,930
Goodness.

641
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,600
You're so stubborn.

642
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,540
(Eagle Brewery)

643
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:32,090
You're busy, so I'll keep it short.

644
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,740
What is this?

645
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:45,010
My stake in Silla Brewery.

646
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,210
I want to transfer it all
to Eagle Brewery.

647
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:55,850
What do you mean
you'll transfer your stake?

648
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,960
If you don't want the shares,

649
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:02,520
I'll sell them
and give you the cash.

650
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,960
It's not enough, but with this,

651
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,970
I'd like to make up
for some of the pain and damage...

652
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,740
my husband and I caused you
and your business.

653
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,580
Around 30 years ago,

654
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:25,650
my husband and I
stole funds from Eagle Brewery...

655
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,780
and eloped.

656
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,050
I hoped to become successful
and repay the debt soon.

657
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,990
We took too long.

658
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,060
My husband had always said...

659
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:42,970
the brewery would make more money
if they followed his idea...

660
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:46,370
but that the late Mr. Oh...

661
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,040
was too old-fashioned...

662
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:52,170
and insisted on following tradition.

663
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:56,150
My father and Mr. Dokgo
argued a lot.

664
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,910
I remember watching them.

665
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,820
My husband...

666
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,090
wouldn't stop saying he wanted to...

667
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,550
make rice wine his own way,

668
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,790
and I wanted to do something
to help him realize his dream.

669
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:11,630
Now I look back and see...

670
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,570
how immature I was.

671
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,470
I get all that.

672
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,970
But you should've considered
Kang Soo.

673
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:30,950
Since the day I left him behind,

674
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,520
I spent each day
feeling weighed down by a boulder.

675
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,130
We started Silla Brewery...

676
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:47,530
with the money
we stole from Eagle Brewery.

677
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,870
I thought it was only right
that I give you my stake in Silla.

678
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,370
Even if you think so,

679
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,710
we can't accept this.

680
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:03,480
Take it and leave.

681
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,650
Your parents raised Kang Soo well.

682
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,090
It's hardly enough.

683
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,630
Please accept it.

684
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,570
Please...

685
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:30,740
accept it.

686
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:55,630
I cooked bean sprout soup
to soothe your hangover.

687
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:11,650
Mom left yesterday
to stay at a hotel.

688
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:20,420
Don't blame her too much.

689
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,660
She did it for you.

690
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,700
Hello, Mr. Lawyer.

691
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,510
The prosecutor called.

692
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:42,680
He wants you to come in
for questioning on Monday at 10 a.m.

693
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,580
Monday at 10 a.m.?

694
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:51,850
Yes. I'm expecting
an official request for attendance.

695
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,590
You'll be questioned...

696
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,220
on the fake video...

697
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,530
and details
of Director Seo's statement.

698
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:00,130
It's the beginning.

699
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:03,630
They'll be pretty aggressive.

700
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,730
Prepare yourself mentally as well.

701
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:09,440
Okay. I understand.

702
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:21,850
Eat up.

703
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:33,000
Ha Ni. Dad's here.

704
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,200
- Hello.
- There you go.

705
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,700
Thank you.

706
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:39,670
She ate well and had a nice nap.

707
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:41,440
Well done, Ha Ni.

708
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:44,370
- Here's her bag.
- Thanks.

709
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,580
I left something boiling
on the stove.

710
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,010
- I have to rush back inside.
- See you tomorrow.

711
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:53,380
- See you tomorrow. Bye, Ha Ni.
- Say bye, Ha Ni.

712
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,020
Let's go home.

713
00:46:59,890 --> 00:47:00,960
Get inside.

714
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,560
Good girl.

715
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:08,360
There.

716
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,970
Hey. Ha Ni.

717
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,000
What are you holding?

718
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,550
You're home.

719
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:37,830
Here.

720
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:41,060
- What's this?
- Take a look.

721
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,140
There was a flea market on campus,

722
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,670
and I thought it was pretty.

723
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,910
You're always looking
for a hair tie.

724
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:54,940
It's beautiful.

725
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,410
Do you like it?

726
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,150
Yes.

727
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,540
Na Young Eun.

728
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:37,920
Where did you just come from?

729
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:41,460
- Beom Soo.
- Why were you in this building?

730
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,460
I'll explain. What happened was...

731
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,000
You lied to me?

732
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,130
Were you spending time
with Ha Ni behind my back?

733
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:56,740
I'm sorry for lying to you.

734
00:48:58,140 --> 00:48:59,570
But Ha Ni is my daughter.

735
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:00,710
Don't you remember...

736
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,450
you gave up your rights as her mom?

737
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:07,080
I told you.

738
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,780
I never gave that up.

739
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:12,090
I just left her
in your care for a while!

740
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,860
There's no point in talking to you.

741
00:49:29,910 --> 00:49:31,970
Is this Chairman Jang Je Hyeong's
secretary's office?

742
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,080
My name is Oh Beom Soo.

743
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,980
I must speak with the chairman
about Ms. Na Young Eun.

744
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,990
Would you like a coffee?

745
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,920
Sure.

746
00:50:21,090 --> 00:50:22,120
I'll get them.

747
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,190
No. You're busy. I'll go.

748
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,600
The fabric order list...

749
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,280
Wait. This is...

750
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,290
Thanks.

751
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:02,930
What? Do you have something to say?

752
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:05,730
What? Oh, no.

753
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:09,500
- It's hot.
- Are you okay?

754
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,240
Yes. I'm fine.

755
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:18,950
It's okay.

756
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,520
Thanks to you,

757
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,090
I'm getting spoiled a bit too much.

758
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,930
I just got a massage
at the hotel spa.

759
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:31,790
Good for you.

760
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:34,100
What do you want to talk about?

761
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,830
I did some thinking.

762
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:40,570
Once Kwang Sook and I get married,

763
00:51:41,570 --> 00:51:45,310
you'd feel too out of place
at the brewery.

764
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,380
That wouldn't seem right.

765
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:51,680
You could move in with us
and stay at our home.

766
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,680
Gosh, no.

767
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,120
That's nonsense.

768
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,890
Why would I live with you?

769
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:03,260
Would you like me
to get you an apartment?

770
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:08,330
I don't want to ask too much of you.

771
00:52:08,330 --> 00:52:09,970
Don't say that.

772
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:12,670
I'm your son-in-law now.

773
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,900
We're family,
so we don't owe each other anything.

774
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,270
If I hadn't invested in the brewery,

775
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:23,280
the ideal outcome would be
for me to return to Golden Castle.

776
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:26,280
"Golden Castle?"

777
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,450
It's one of Korea's
best retirement homes...

778
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,490
for senior citizens.

779
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:33,590
I had to move out
because she needed...

780
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,890
the security deposit
to take over the brewery.

781
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:38,560
Then...

782
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:42,500
do you want to go back
to Golden Castle?

783
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,540
(Lynx Golf)

784
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:54,740
Welcome.

785
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:55,740
Hello.

786
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,820
How should I put it?

787
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:06,250
I came to get something
for my girlfriend.

788
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:07,760
Oh, I see.

789
00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:10,530
What is she like? Her style.

790
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:12,930
Her style... Let's see.

791
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:15,330
She's very stylish.

792
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:19,000
She's classy and elegant.

793
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,270
She's cute and sweet.

794
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,070
- Is she?
- Yes.

795
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,210
How about this?

796
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:33,320
The print is the whole point
of this top,

797
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,780
and it's pretty easy
to mix and match.

798
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,050
Oh, this is...

799
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:42,390
Mrs. Gong
would look extra cute in this.

800
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,090
I'll take it.

801
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:48,600
Do you need anything else?

802
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:52,100
I like this cap too.

803
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:55,870
You have a great eye.

804
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:57,870
I get that a lot.

805
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:02,310
Can you gift-wrap these
together nicely?

806
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,980
- Yes, of course.
- Thanks.

807
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,650
My gosh.

808
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:11,990
You scared me.

809
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,660
Why are you here, Mrs. Gong?

810
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:18,330
I came to discuss something urgent.

811
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:20,830
What is it?

812
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:22,460
I think...

813
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:25,730
I'll return to Golden Castle soon.

814
00:54:26,570 --> 00:54:28,240
Come with me, Mr. Go.

815
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:30,140
Why would I go there?

816
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:32,470
Why else?

817
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:34,610
If I move back,

818
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:36,580
you must come with me.

819
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:40,320
I'm not old enough
to move to a retirement home.

820
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,450
It's not a retirement home.

821
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,720
It's a premium residence
for seniors.

822
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,920
There's a swimming pool,
a jogging trail,

823
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,160
and lots of fun programs
to keep us occupied.

824
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,260
If I were to go there,

825
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:53,730
who would run the brewery?

826
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,700
Is it me or the brewery?

827
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,430
Pick just one.

828
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,070
What?

829
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,280
Well...

830
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,510
Okay.

831
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,920
So, what did you decide to do
for the wedding?

832
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:21,520
I put my foot down and said
we'll have a small family affair.

833
00:55:22,060 --> 00:55:23,190
Well done.

834
00:55:23,390 --> 00:55:25,830
You need to
raise your voice sometimes.

835
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,560
Yes. You're right.

836
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,400
I'm home.

837
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:32,730
- I'm home, Mother.
- Hello.

838
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,870
How come you returned together?

839
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,740
We met by the door.

840
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:40,310
What are you doing?

841
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,510
I thought the Diamond Game
would be a good brain exercise,

842
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:48,480
so we decided to play it
for an hour each day.

843
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,990
Watch this. Hop and hop.

844
00:55:51,990 --> 00:55:54,190
I hopped twice, and it's game over.

845
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:56,090
I'm the winner.

846
00:55:57,230 --> 00:55:58,330
My gosh.

847
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:01,160
You won seven times in a row.

848
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,530
You're the Diamond Game queen.

849
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:06,000
Thank you.

850
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:09,140
The will to win
must revive dead brain cells.

851
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:14,510
- Another game?
- Sure!

852
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:16,710
All right.

853
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:18,680
Let's begin.

854
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:21,350
Two Saturdays from now?

855
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,620
Yes.

856
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,720
It's a bit soon,

857
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:29,520
but that's the only weekend day
the hall is available.

858
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,360
Even so, two Saturdays from now...

859
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,000
That's right around the corner.

860
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:38,000
I know.
We don't have to prepare anything.

861
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,370
Chairman Han will handle everything.

862
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:45,970
I'll do your hair and makeup.

863
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:48,940
I'd be grateful if you'd do that.

864
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:52,010
I thought it would be better...

865
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,680
if I told you instead of Kwang Sook,

866
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,080
which is why I gathered you all.

867
00:56:56,890 --> 00:56:59,050
Okay. We understand.

868
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:14,070
Why the long face?

869
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:15,570
What?

870
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,170
Hearing that
they set a date for the wedding...

871
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:20,480
still feels surreal.

872
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:24,110
Is it really time
to part with Kwang Sook?

873
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:27,380
You knew this day would come.

874
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,190
Don't let her see that you're upset.

875
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:32,490
Let's be cool about it
and marry her off.

876
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:36,060
Yes. We should do that, right?

877
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:37,660
Right.

878
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,640
What guy bawls his eyes out...

879
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,540
because his sister-in-law
is getting married?

880
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,550
You're not a child.

881
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:00,980
I knew it was coming,

882
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,920
but I didn't expect it
to be this soon.

883
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:08,320
Two Saturdays from now
is just too soon.

884
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:15,300
Don't cry. Stop it.

885
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:17,900
Ok Bun.

886
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:21,600
My mind says
I should congratulate her,

887
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,470
so why can't I stop crying?

888
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,650
You're so sensitive and emotional.

889
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:36,450
Don't cry too much.
You'll get a headache.

890
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:37,750
Okay? Stop.

891
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,260
Don't cry.

892
00:58:56,270 --> 00:58:57,510
Why are you out here?

893
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:01,140
One side of my heart feels empty.

894
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,380
I knew for a long time
that we'd part ways eventually,

895
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:07,550
but now that we have a date,

896
00:59:07,550 --> 00:59:09,350
a corner of my heart feels bare.

897
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,650
You too?

898
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:13,490
Of course.

899
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,290
Kang Soo.

900
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:18,630
Let's become stronger men.

901
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:22,400
Then Kwang Sook
won't feel too bad about leaving.

902
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:26,870
Okay.

903
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:45,920
Thanks a lot for today.

904
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,390
You must be busy with the brewery,

905
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:49,820
but you made the time
for my mother-in-law.

906
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,560
I said...

907
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,900
I'd be a daughter to her
from now on.

908
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,030
Kwang Sook, you're...

909
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,340
You truly are an amazing woman.

910
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:04,370
Says the man
who called me a mad psycho.

911
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:06,980
Why would you bring that up again?

912
01:00:07,410 --> 01:00:09,410
You can hold a grudge sometimes.

913
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,950
- I'll get going.
- Drive safely.

914
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,590
(Eagle Brewery)

915
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:21,460
That reminds me.

916
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,520
I have something to get
from the back of the truck.

917
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,790
Can you get the door?

918
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,070
What the...

919
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:54,960
(Dong Seok, sweetie,
will you marry me?)

920
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,940
I heard you were stressing
over the wedding proposal,

921
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:18,010
so I beat you to it.

922
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:19,850
What?

923
01:01:21,950 --> 01:01:24,090
Who says only men
should pop the question?

924
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:26,890
My gosh.

925
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:31,160
It may not match the elegance
of a hotel chairman,

926
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:33,730
but it's still cute, isn't it?

927
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,830
I love it.

928
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:40,940
(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

929
01:01:50,340 --> 01:01:51,450
Will you...

930
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:57,120
marry me?

931
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:03,860
Of course.

932
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:30,520
(Dong Seok, sweetie,
will you marry me?)

933
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:11,530
(For Eagle Brothers)

934
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:13,830
I can't say
I'm all that happy about it.

935
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,660
If your sister-in-law
becomes my stepmom...

936
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:19,230
That will complicate things
between us.

937
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,670
It's bad.

938
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:23,000
I think she should see
a medical specialist.

939
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,970
Rather than a hospital, she needs
something from the pharmacy first.

940
01:03:26,070 --> 01:03:27,540
How could you make
such an important decision...

941
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,910
without discussing it with me first?

942
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:33,080
I didn't want to burden you.

943
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:36,250
This isn't something
that can just be brushed aside.

944
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:37,920
I totally agree.

945
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:39,890
The wedding isn't
what's important anymore.

946
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:41,960
- Put the wedding on hold.
- Put the wedding on hold.
