00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:03,710
(Episode 3)

00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,619
(Eagle Brewery)

3
00:00:14,789 --> 00:00:19,559
(In Mourning)

4
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,439
How...

5
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,109
How could you...

6
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:42,850
leave me all alone like this?

7
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:45,920
How is this fair?

8
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,890
This doesn't make any sense.

9
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,090
Jang Soo.

10
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,329
Don't just smile and answer me.

11
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,040
Kwang Sook, take a deep breath.

12
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:10,810
You promised...

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,579
to pick me up when I got off work.

14
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:17,379
Why didn't you keep your promise?

15
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,150
Why?

16
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:24,290
Why didn't you?

17
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:33,500
Jang Soo.

18
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,299
You can't be like this.

19
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,769
Wake up.

20
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:41,370
You wouldn't die...

21
00:01:42,109 --> 00:01:45,409
and leave me behind.

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:02,730
Jang Soo, you wouldn't die
and leave me all alone.

23
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,099
Jang Soo...

24
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:07,469
Jang Soo.

25
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,750
The chief mourner
should stay by Jang Soo's side.

26
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:27,750
You shouldn't get drunk.

27
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:33,689
Jang Soo died...

28
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:38,000
because of me.

29
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,930
He found out I had quit my job,

30
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,699
which shocked him.

31
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:44,800
I doubt he was in his right mind.

32
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,180
I'm the reason he's dead.

33
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,689
I should've died instead of him.

34
00:03:01,889 --> 00:03:03,319
I'm the worst.

35
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:18,770
It wasn't your fault.

36
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,169
It's actually mine.

37
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:28,050
I disappointed him too much.

38
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,879
It wasn't your fault.

39
00:03:38,889 --> 00:03:43,560
(Paju Funeral Hall)

40
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,439
Why are you there...

41
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:58,780
when you still had
your whole life ahead of you?

42
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,280
You just got married ten days ago.

43
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:07,949
This is wrong on so many levels.

44
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,670
Whose fate did you take after?

45
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:26,699
As if my daughter deserved this.

46
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,339
You became a widow...

47
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,379
only ten days after your wedding.

48
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,779
That's enough.

49
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,879
We should talk.

50
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,800
You've been here enough,

51
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,399
so change out of that
and come with me.

52
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:54,500
Where would I go?

53
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:57,769
Are you really going to act as
the chief mourner for three days?

54
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,699
Act as the chief mourner?

55
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,569
How can you be one...

56
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,680
when you were only his wife
for ten days?

57
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,610
I'm not taking on any role.

58
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:07,949
I am the chief mourner.

59
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:11,379
I was Jang Soo's wife.

60
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,720
How can you be his wife?
You never registered your marriage.

61
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,490
We did.

62
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:18,420
You did? When?

63
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:21,360
Right after we got back
from our honeymoon.

64
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:23,629
My gosh!

65
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,500
Why did you rush to do it
when there was no urgency?

66
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:29,769
They wait at least a year or two
before registering their marriage.

67
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,209
How can you even say that
in this situation?

68
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,379
My daughter became a widow
just ten days after her wedding,

69
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,379
so I can say this much
as her mother!

70
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:42,810
Just leave
if you're going to talk nonsense!

71
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:44,720
Goodness me.

72
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,850
My gosh.

73
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:54,360
Kang Soo.

74
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,459
Your friends from high school
are here.

75
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,769
My mom only said that
being upset and all.

76
00:06:06,769 --> 00:06:08,110
Don't let it bother you.

77
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:12,240
Of course. I understand.

78
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:29,660
It feels like I'm dreaming.

79
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
Me too.

80
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,000
How could something like this
happen to someone...

81
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,110
as good and sweet as Jang Soo?

82
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:51,050
(Paju Funeral Hall)

83
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,550
I should've been taken instead.

84
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:58,120
You should've taken useless me!

85
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,600
Why on earth did you take someone
who had just gotten married?

86
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:21,610
Eagle Brewery's Oh Jang Soo's dead?

87
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,879
Yes. I just got a call
from the association.

88
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:28,250
A drunk driver's truck
plowed into him.

89
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,120
He died on the spot.

90
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:33,790
I heard just days ago
that he'd gotten married.

91
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,060
Yes.

92
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,699
He died just ten days
after the wedding.

93
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:44,300
My goodness...

94
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,620
Hello?

95
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:01,720
Are you looking for someone?

96
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,420
No, I'm not.

97
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,759
Maybe next time.

98
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:12,800
Who was that?

99
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,040
- Ta-da.
- My gosh.

100
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,310
What are you doing here, Se Ri?

101
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:29,250
I came by to reacquaint myself
with the teaching assistant...

102
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:32,179
and greet the professors,
and then I came to see you.

103
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,549
Thank you.

104
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,590
Aren't you scared at all?

105
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:40,789
No. I like being alone
at this time of day.

106
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,860
It's quiet as if I'm underwater.

107
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:47,870
This place gives me the chills.

108
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,100
Lots of students stay here late,

109
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,600
so the security guard's
around at night.

110
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,909
Hey. I noticed some guy...

111
00:08:55,909 --> 00:08:57,639
peering into this room.

112
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,080
I couldn't see his face well
because he was wearing a cap.

113
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,879
Do you know him, Bom?

114
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:06,519
I'm not sure.

115
00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:08,450
I didn't see anyone.

116
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:16,330
You'll film the show I mentioned
this Thursday, sir.

117
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,259
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

118
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,029
Do I have to do stuff like that?

119
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,470
It'll help promote the hotel,
so do it with a happy heart.

120
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,500
The staff are excited about it.

121
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,269
I agreed to it,
so I must do it, I guess.

122
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,539
- Here.
- Thank you, sir.

123
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:35,649
My gosh.

124
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:06,210
(Fast forward)

125
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,210
(Rewind, 5 seconds, key frame)

126
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,820
(Rewind, 10 seconds, key frame)

127
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:20,759
Hey.

128
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,129
Oh, dear.

129
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,500
What a bother.

130
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,570
(Fast forward)

131
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,370
(Rewind, 10 seconds, key frame)

132
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:39,039
She kept eating and dancing.

133
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,049
She's not normal.

134
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,759
I can't believe this happened.

135
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:02,929
This is so cruel.

136
00:11:03,169 --> 00:11:04,870
You were married for mere days.

137
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,309
I feel so sorry for you, Ms. Ma.

138
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:12,039
I guess the deities were jealous...

139
00:11:12,409 --> 00:11:14,179
because you two were so in love.

140
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:16,409
There's no other explanation.

141
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:21,519
You can't let go of yourself now.

142
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,220
You must stay strong and in control.

143
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:26,490
Okay.

144
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,460
I know you're mourning too,
but look out for Ms. Ma for us.

145
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:35,000
Can I have a word?

146
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,269
Sure.

147
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:44,139
I just don't think this is right.

148
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,610
You're the second eldest,
so sort things out for me.

149
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:50,480
What do you mean by that?

150
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:54,590
I can't help it if this offends you,

151
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,960
but to be honest,
they were married for just ten days.

152
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:00,090
Don't you think
it's not appropriate...

153
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,590
for Kwang Sook
to be the chief mourner?

154
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,230
It's not fair that she was widowed
ten days into her marriage.

155
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,970
Now she's standing here...

156
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:09,600
greeting guests
like she's in charge.

157
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:13,970
As her mother, I just don't like it.

158
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,080
Our brother's leaving this earth,

159
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,039
and you want him to be alone?

160
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,950
Don't you know you can't take back
a card you played?

161
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,590
It was just ten days,
but they were married.

162
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,690
Heung Soo.

163
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:36,129
Am I wrong?

164
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:38,360
I didn't think this of you,

165
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,159
but you're quite rude.

166
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,429
I'm not the one who's rude. You are.

167
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,769
Will you stop it?

168
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,909
You can't speak like that
to an elder.

169
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,840
Is that how
Jang Soo and I taught you?

170
00:12:56,379 --> 00:12:57,850
I understand what you mean.

171
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,919
I'll discuss it with Kwang Sook.

172
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,799
Whether it was 10 months or 10 days,
they were still married.

173
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,440
How can she think of running off
as soon as her husband died?

174
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,139
Watch your language.

175
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,769
She is about to run off.

176
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:25,179
Mr. Oh.

177
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,350
Hurry up.

178
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,779
Why are you all here?

179
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,289
We had to come
when we heard the tragic news.

180
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,820
We're not complete strangers.

181
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,029
He's my second eldest brother.

182
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,070
Hello.

183
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,769
I'm their instructor.

184
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,070
I see.

185
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,440
Thank you for sparing your time.

186
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,779
Sure.

187
00:13:58,379 --> 00:13:59,639
- Take them inside.
- Okay.

188
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:01,649
- Do come inside.
- Okay.

189
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,059
We all chipped in.

190
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,470
You didn't have to.
I'm grateful that you came.

191
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,539
Take it.

192
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,909
Wait.

193
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,779
Here's my offer of condolences.

194
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,019
(Condolence Money)

195
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,850
You're a new member,

196
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,289
and this is too much.
I feel uncomfortable.

197
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,789
Why would you feel uncomfortable
around me?

198
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,830
What do you mean?

199
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,830
Well,

200
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:52,629
our elders said
that a teacher and pupil...

201
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,269
are as close as a parent and child.

202
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:59,240
I meant that's how close we were.

203
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,370
Oh, I see.

204
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:19,889
Come in.

205
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:26,899
Professor Kim Ja Young's here.

206
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:28,470
Professor Kim Ja Young?

207
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:31,840
Oh, let her in.

208
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Yes, sir.

209
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,840
I was afraid you'd have left,
but you were still here.

210
00:15:38,309 --> 00:15:42,110
Yes, well,
I was just about to head home.

211
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,950
What brought you here?

212
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:47,950
We delivered a painting,
and I tagged along.

213
00:15:48,289 --> 00:15:51,220
We just finished selecting a spot
and putting it up.

214
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:53,590
Do you always...

215
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,259
tag along to monitor the delivery?

216
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,730
Of course not.

217
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:06,169
I took extra care
because you're Bom's father.

218
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,570
In return,

219
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,539
will you treat me to a nice dinner?

220
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,750
My gosh.

221
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:24,289
That vixen came to the hotel?

222
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,289
She must be determined...

223
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:29,759
to be his new wife.

224
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,659
What should I do with this?

225
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,470
I've heard a lot...

226
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,570
from Bom about her dad.

227
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:45,539
So you didn't seem unfamiliar
even when we first met.

228
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:48,580
It felt like we had known each other
for a long time.

229
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:50,980
I see.

230
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,480
I have focused only on my work,

231
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,620
so I don't have a large network
of relationships.

232
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:58,220
Okay. I understand.

233
00:16:58,659 --> 00:17:00,059
I'd like you to be...

234
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,960
my so-called guy friend.

235
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,329
You have nothing to lose
by being my friend.

236
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,839
My goodness.

237
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:17,039
It's you, Mr. Han.

238
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:19,309
Are you here to eat?

239
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,539
Yes.

240
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,309
I was stopping by...

241
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,579
to have a quick dinner
after working out.

242
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:27,349
But I don't feel like eating alone,

243
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,650
so I was about to leave.

244
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,289
I'm so hungry
that I have no strength to walk now.

245
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,390
And it's not like I can join you.

246
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,200
Then why don't you join us?

247
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:47,069
She's the mother of Bom's friend.

248
00:17:47,069 --> 00:17:48,069
Do you mind?

249
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,240
Sure. Of course not.

250
00:17:58,880 --> 00:17:59,950
Thank you.

251
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,920
I'll just have a sandwich and leave.

252
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,930
I'll have one sandwich
and an Americano.

253
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,059
Yes, ma'am.

254
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,109
I know I might sound rude,

255
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,809
but I'm the type
that can't stand being curious.

256
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,309
Are you Mr. Han's girlfriend?

257
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,819
Gosh, she's not my girlfriend.

258
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:35,619
She's Bom's professor.

259
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:39,359
I see.

260
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,329
My goodness. I'm so sorry.

261
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,990
Please excuse my words.

262
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,299
But then again,

263
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,430
there's no way...

264
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,529
a loving husband like Mr. Han
would have a girlfriend.

265
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,339
He has missed...

266
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,710
his late wife every day
for ten years.

267
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,809
Actually, if it was my husband,

268
00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:01,079
he would've got married again
like a dozen times.

269
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,279
As you may know,

270
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:07,890
he's such a romanticist
that you can't find these days.

271
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,390
He's a coldhearted man
who never opens up,

272
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,359
but he is also a man
with a pure heart...

273
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:16,529
who misses his late wife.

274
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:21,059
Bom's mother must be happy up there.

275
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:23,930
She's still loved a lot
by her husband.

276
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,039
Don't you think so?

277
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,750
You seem hungry.

278
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,779
Please stop talking...

279
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:39,880
and eat.

280
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,089
Shall I?

281
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:47,319
It smells so good.

282
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:57,500
Unbelievable.

283
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,970
So did you meet Bom's professor?

284
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,039
I did.

285
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,779
I made it clear...

286
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:08,349
that she couldn't have him.

287
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,380
And what did she say?

288
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:11,779
What do you think?

289
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:14,180
Her face turned red and purple...

290
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,450
with rage.

291
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:19,019
Then you don't have to worry.

292
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:22,789
You never know
what will happen in life.

293
00:20:22,789 --> 00:20:25,500
What if Bom's dad loses his mind...

294
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,329
and suddenly wants to marry a woman
who's far from good enough?

295
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,599
I don't think it will happen.

296
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,440
You can't be so sure.

297
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,470
Trust makes way for treachery.

298
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,539
So...

299
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:40,480
you should be his daughter-in-law
as soon as possible...

300
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,309
and hold the purse strings
in the house.

301
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,579
Only then can I sleep without worry.

302
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:47,680
You know what I mean, right?

303
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,920
I know what you're saying.

304
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,160
I do like Gyeol,

305
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,460
but to be honest, I'm not sure...

306
00:20:58,460 --> 00:20:59,960
if I want to marry him.

307
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,869
If you don't hate him, that's fine.

308
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:04,869
What's so complicated?

309
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,500
Once you marry Gyeol,

310
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,769
you will be part
of the royal family.

311
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,109
It's not Buckingham Palace.
Why are they the royal family?

312
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:16,549
It's just as good
as Buckingham Palace.

313
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:19,420
Gyeol's family is not worse
in any way.

314
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,390
A royal family
with a long history...

315
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,660
is completely different
from nouveau riche.

316
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,920
Not all money is the same.

317
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:29,190
Then what are we?

318
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:31,029
Us?

319
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:33,200
Are we nouveau riche?

320
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,000
We're not nouveau riche.

321
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:39,400
We just succeeded on our own.

322
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:55,849
(Eagle Brewery)

323
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:04,829
(Pot Number 4)

324
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,970
Hey, Tak. What have you done?

325
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:18,609
What did you add to the makgeolli
while I was away?

326
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:19,910
At other breweries,

327
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:22,009
they all use some additives.

328
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:25,220
People's taste is changing.

329
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,750
Makgeolli made only with nuruk,

330
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,119
rice, and water...

331
00:22:28,119 --> 00:22:29,920
is considered too rough and bland.

332
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,119
What you made isn't makgeolli.

333
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,220
It's just water with additives.

334
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,690
You should suit people's taste.

335
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,759
Why are you being so stubborn?

336
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,900
What's the point of making makgeolli
that no one wants to drink?

337
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,430
Hey, I'd rather give up my business.

338
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,839
But I will never sell
such crude makgeolli!

339
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,069
It's not crude.
That's what ordinary people like.

340
00:22:49,069 --> 00:22:50,369
Darn it!

341
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,750
My gosh.

342
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,220
Please calm down, Dad.

343
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,380
Hey, get out this instant.

344
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,619
A swindler like you
has no right to make makgeolli.

345
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,319
Get out!

346
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:07,819
Go away!

347
00:23:12,759 --> 00:23:13,799
Darn it.

348
00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:15,630
I'm going home.

349
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,430
Aren't you going in
to offer your condolences?

350
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,769
Forget it. I'm tired.

351
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,779
It's not just about the funeral.

352
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:31,720
You should at least come
for the funeral cortege.

353
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,519
Do you not know
that Jang Soo was like my dad?

354
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,059
Stop using Yeoung Ju as an excuse!

355
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,829
She will be fine
with you away for a couple of days.

356
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,130
If you don't come this time,

357
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,140
I'm not sure what I'll think of you.

358
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,769
Do as you please.

359
00:24:32,609 --> 00:24:34,740
People in the neighborhood
told me...

360
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,480
that your brother died
in a car accident.

361
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:40,180
I heard he'd just gotten married.

362
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,789
Yes.

363
00:24:42,819 --> 00:24:44,319
It still hasn't hit me.

364
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:48,460
I feel like I can hear his voice
calling my name.

365
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,059
Everything feels like a lie.

366
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,630
I understand.

367
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:59,099
My dad passed away early this year.

368
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,069
I see.

369
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:04,470
By the way, did you move here?

370
00:25:04,809 --> 00:25:07,180
Well... I recently opened...

371
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,250
a convenience store
near the intersection.

372
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,150
Did you come
with your husband and children?

373
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
What? Yes.

374
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:16,049
How many children do you have?

375
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,650
I have one daughter.

376
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,019
She's in the States with her mom.

377
00:25:20,589 --> 00:25:23,059
I see. I don't have children.

378
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:27,000
We're more about
leading a child-free but happy life.

379
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,529
Despite our age,
we haven't matured yet.

380
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,569
I see.

381
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,869
We should grab a bite to eat
with your husband.

382
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,380
Sure.

383
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:44,079
Our classmates told me
you were a hotshot fund manager.

384
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,180
At Hanseong Securities, right?

385
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:48,819
What?

386
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:50,490
Oh, right.

387
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,920
You must be loaded with money.

388
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,289
Not really.

389
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,400
Is there anything else you need?

390
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,599
- I'm good.
- I'm good.

391
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:07,470
You didn't even touch
the yukgaejang.

392
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:10,539
The broth is spicy and refreshing,

393
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,210
so empty the bowl.

394
00:26:12,609 --> 00:26:13,680
Sure.

395
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:15,279
Sure.

396
00:26:18,349 --> 00:26:19,519
Goodness me.

397
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:22,150
My gosh.

398
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,920
Ms. Ji, why are you still here?

399
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,519
The others all left earlier.

400
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,259
It's my salon's regular day off.

401
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:30,490
Don't mind me.

402
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,460
But...

403
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:40,839
What's her deal?

404
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,279
Yes, ma'am.

405
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:55,220
Just a second.

406
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,930
What about your mother?

407
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:09,529
She left a while ago.

408
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,539
Earlier, my mom said that
out of grief.

409
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,680
Don't be bothered by it.

410
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:27,450
Your mother has every right
to think that way.

411
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,359
Chun Soo already told you,

412
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:35,430
but we can stay at
the hall ourselves.

413
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,430
If you want...

414
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,259
Not you too.

415
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:41,869
Where would I go
when this is where my husband is?

416
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,299
I refuse...

417
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:45,940
to move a single inch.

418
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,509
Thank you, Kwang Sook.

419
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:56,180
Thank you for keeping him company
as he crosses over.

420
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:01,849
I'm going out for some air.

421
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:14,029
Something important came up,
so I can't come home to you, Ha Ni.

422
00:28:14,029 --> 00:28:16,230
You'll sleep tight with her, okay?

423
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:19,799
Your dad will be home
after two nights.

424
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,339
There you go.

425
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,140
Good night, my princess.

426
00:28:38,019 --> 00:28:39,920
A few hours before the accident,

427
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:42,730
Jang Soo came by my house.

428
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,130
I was on my way home with Ha Ni...

429
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,869
after my trip to the store
for baby formula and diapers.

430
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:53,700
I'll never forget the shocked look
on his face when he saw me.

431
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:59,579
Finding out
that I was a single dad...

432
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,779
completely shocked him.

433
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:06,750
That could be why...

434
00:29:10,289 --> 00:29:12,619
he got into the car crash.

435
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:16,259
He must not have been
in his right mind...

436
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:19,130
from the disappointment...

437
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,599
and despair.

438
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:25,640
I'm the reason he's dead.

439
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,369
I'm sorry, Kwang Sook.

440
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:34,809
That's absurd.

441
00:29:36,549 --> 00:29:37,779
If we're pointing fingers,

442
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,450
I should be blamed for asking him...

443
00:29:42,019 --> 00:29:43,390
to deliver kimchi to you.

444
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,160
If I hadn't asked,

445
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:49,829
he wouldn't have gone to your place.

446
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:52,630
Then,

447
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,730
there wouldn't have been
any accident.

448
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:58,029
Gosh, no.

449
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,099
It's all my fault.

450
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,140
It's no one's fault.

451
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,579
I guess...

452
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,980
it was fate.

453
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:17,319
How could anyone...

454
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,559
defy fate, right?

455
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:25,299
We must accept it.

456
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,019
Before...

457
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:56,130
you leave to a place far away,

458
00:30:58,259 --> 00:30:59,829
I'll say it clearly...

459
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:03,230
right into your ear.

460
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,670
- Smile.
- Cheese.

461
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,400
That I'm truly grateful...

462
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,140
and that I love you...

463
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:13,980
so very much.

464
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:16,650
No peeking.

465
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,980
Are we there yet?

466
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,980
- Also...
- All right.

467
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,480
Ta-da.

468
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,880
Thanks to your love,

469
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:25,490
my days were blessed with joy.

470
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,529

(Rest in Eternal Bliss)

472
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:50,250
Goodbye, Jang Soo.

473
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,490
We will meet...

474
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:02,490
again someday.

(The late Oh Jang Soo)

476
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:36,160
Our marriage was short,

477
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,359
but you were...

478
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:44,799
the best husband to me.

479
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,140
So...

480
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,910
don't feel guilty.

481
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,509
Also,

482
00:32:57,009 --> 00:32:58,750
don't be lonely.

483
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,420
Just like that,

484
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,259
you will always be...

485
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:09,190
in my heart...

486
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,400
holding that smile of yours.

487
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:19,299
(The late Oh Jang Soo)

488
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,730
The gimbap lady?

489
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,170
I think it's her.

490
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,410
What...

491
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,740
Wait.

492
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:03,279
What...

493
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,119
Are you all right?

494
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,190
Hold on.

495
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,059
What on earth?

496
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,000
She didn't even bother
to say thank you.

497
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,199
But she's the gimbap lady.

498
00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:31,070
What...

499
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,110
Darn.

500
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,150
Goodness.

(The late Kang Min Seo)

503
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,000
Happy birthday, honey.

504
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,500
It seems
our children have forgotten,

505
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,269
so I came alone.

506
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,570
Don't be too upset about it though.

(Taking the world by storm,

509
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:50,519
I can't believe I met you again.

510
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:53,260
I'm still not sure
if this is a dream or not.

511

00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,630
I'm the former head
of your fan club.

00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,869
It's Jang Mi.

514
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,369
Ok Bun.

515
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:14,079
Oh, hey.

516
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,809
Take a seat.

517
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:19,320
The perm won't last for long.

518
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,019
Make sure to curl them properly.

519
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,949
Go get yourself a helmet then.

520
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:25,050
Don't come to me.

521
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,489
My goodness.
Am I not allowed to have an opinion?

K-beauty pioneer G Hair Salon.

524

With every curl I put in
my clients' hair,

525
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,869
I do it with a sense of duty.

526

That's my philosophy
as a hairdresser.

527
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,480

- What do you mean?

We left right away
after paying our respects,

531
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,619
but you were nowhere to be seen.

532
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,090
Oh, that.

00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,929

By the way,

535

Mr. Oh seemed haggard yesterday.

536
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,739
His big brother was
like a father to him.

537
00:37:12,739 --> 00:37:14,400
Now that he's gone,

538
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,170
he must be feeling empty and lonely.

539
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:21,710
Mr. Oh should find a decent woman...

540
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:25,309
and start a family for himself
as soon as possible.

541
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,280

00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:29,719
Of course, I do.

There will be no doubt about it
if you're setting him up on a date.

You said you had someone
in mind for him.

- Goodness.
- What...

549
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,539
Give it some time.

00:37:50,739 --> 00:37:52,440
(Silla Brewery)

551
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,650
I quietly looked into it
right after your instruction.

552
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,920
In addition...

553
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,789
to the government loan
issued to small businesses,

554
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:05,250
he borrowed a million dollars
from Hanbit Bank...

555
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:07,789
to buy the land around the brewery.

556
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:09,559
It also seems he received...

557
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:11,460
a lot of money in advance
from wholesalers.

558
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:14,829
He received money in advance
from wholesalers?

559
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,230
Eagle Brewery's makgeolli...

560
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,530
is well-received in the market,

561
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,739
so I guess the wholesalers paid him
in advance...

562
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:22,409
to secure their supply sooner.

563
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:24,710
They took six-month promissory notes
from us,

564
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,510
but paid Eagle Brewery in advance?

565
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:30,250
The liquor from Eagle Brewery
is premium.

566
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:33,119
Expecting premium quality
from cheap makgeolli?

567
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,920
Is this a charity we're running?

568
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,150
Are we making liquor
with free water from the Han River?

569
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,190
We can only keep the business going
if it makes a profit.

570
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,960
Yes, of course.

571
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,730
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

572
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:45,929
Darn.

573
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,530
This is actually for the best.

574
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:54,800
I'll talk to the bank,

575
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:56,869
so have the wholesalers...

576
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:58,110
collect the advance payments
they've made.

577
00:38:59,179 --> 00:39:01,380
Then, like you said before...

578
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,579
That's right.

579
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:03,849
We'll take over Eagle Brewery.

580
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,349
We can afford it, can't we?

581
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:08,780
We can, but...

582
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,090
But what?

583
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:12,659
It's nothing.

584
00:39:13,719 --> 00:39:15,219
So that word doesn't spread,

585
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,159
take a few tight-lipped employees...

586
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,929
and quietly seal the deal.

587
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:20,300
If there's any trouble...

588
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:22,599
You know what'll happen.

589
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:25,599
Yes, sir. I'll keep that in mind.

590
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:36,980
Is Dad coming home late tonight?

591
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,949
As if your father ever bothers
to tell me things like that.

592
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:42,420
He'll be here
when he gets here, I suppose.

593
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,750
By the way,

594
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:47,659
how did you and Dad first meet?

595
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,530
What? Why are you asking me that?

596
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,260
You don't really tell me...

597
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,730
when I ask about things in the past.

598
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,130
I'm curious, that's all.

599
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,329
Where else could we have met?

600
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,000
At work, of course.

601
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,809
Was it an office romance?

602
00:40:06,309 --> 00:40:07,340
An office romance?

603
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:11,380
Well, I guess you can call it that.

604
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,619
What? It's Bom.

605
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,119
Hey, Bom.

606
00:40:19,489 --> 00:40:20,860
Are you free tomorrow?

607
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:22,420
Why? Is something up?

608
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:25,929
I wanted to get fresh air
and visit my brother.

609
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:27,159
Do you want to come with me?

610
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,199
- To Jinhae?
- Yes.

611
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:31,800
We'll be too busy
once the new semester begins.

612
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,070
We should recharge before then.

613
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:35,139
I'll ask my mom.

614
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:38,340
I'll call you back later. Sure.

615
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,780
Bom's going to see Gyeol...

616
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,849
and asked me to join her.

617
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,650
That's great.

618
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,550
I was hoping you'd pay him a visit,

619
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,219
but the opportunity just came to us.

620
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:50,519
Bom actually helped us out.

621
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:57,690
But Mom,
do I really have to marry Gyeol?

622
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:03,630
You tend to say odd things
every now and then.

623
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,469
Gyeol can be considered
as the best candidate for a husband.

624
00:41:07,469 --> 00:41:10,309
To be honest,
it's him who'll be marrying down.

625
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:12,110
I know that, but...

626
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:14,880
But what?

627
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,449
I feel like a fated love
might be waiting for me somewhere.

628
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,590
Like the red thread of fate,
you know.

629
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,019
The red thread of fate?

630
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:30,059
Yes. They say we're all born...

631
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:33,960
with a red thread tied
to our little fingers.

632
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,869
At the end of that red thread...

633
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,570
awaits the one
we are destined to be with.

634
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:42,840
My sweetheart can be this naive.

635
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:46,039
What you're describing
is a fairy tale story.

636
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:48,210
Cut this nonsense
and listen to what I say.

637
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:51,510
Once you marry Gyeol,

638
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,449
you will have a life...

639
00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:55,179
that is envied by women
all over the world.

640
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:59,050
Have you ever lost out
from taking my advice?

641
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:05,659
Then, don't question it
and just do as I say.

642
00:42:05,659 --> 00:42:06,800
Got it?

643
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,300
- Sure.
- Eat up.

644
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:19,480
(Incoming call)

645
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:21,139
I don't recognize the number.

646
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:25,480
Hello?

647
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,679
It's me.

648
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,750
I'm hanging up.

649
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,989
I'm outside your house,
so come out for a minute.

650
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:31,519
I have something to say.

651
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,159
It's important.

652
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,119
I already told you...

653
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,559
that I have nothing to say to you,

654
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:37,989
nor do I have any reason
to meet you.

655
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:40,659
If you keep harassing me,
I'll call the police.

656
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,039
Chairman Han is here.

657
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,949
He said he had plans for dinner,

658
00:42:57,949 --> 00:42:59,320
but he's home early.

659
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:04,989
- Dad?
- Goodness.

660
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:11,489
Did you injure yourself?

661
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,460
I sprained my back a little,
but it's no big deal.

662
00:43:16,369 --> 00:43:17,469
Did you see a doctor?

663
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:19,900
It should get better with some rest.

664
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,039
- It's nothing.
- Then...

665
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:22,840
- I'll get a hot compress.
- Sure.

666
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,869
- You did good work.
- Thank you, sir.

667
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,849
Were you working out?

668
00:43:37,389 --> 00:43:38,420
No.

669
00:43:39,289 --> 00:43:41,460
I visited your mom
earlier in the day...

670
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,090
and lost my footing on the steps.

671
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,360
You went to see Mom again?

672
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,230
It's her birthday, remember?

673
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:51,969
Gosh, it slipped my mind.

674
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,139
That's understandable.

675
00:43:54,570 --> 00:43:56,469
I went for the whole family,

676
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:57,639
so don't be bothered by it.

677
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:01,340
I can't believe
I forgot her birthday.

678
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,409
I'll go tomorrow...

679
00:44:03,409 --> 00:44:05,349
Wait, Se Ri and I
are going to see Gyeol.

680
00:44:06,019 --> 00:44:07,849
I'll go see her
the day after tomorrow.

681
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:11,289
Can you get me the hot compress?

682
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,320
Gosh, silly me.

683
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:20,260
My goodness.

684
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,500
What...

685
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,599
Are you all right?

686
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,170
It was the gimbap lady for sure.

687
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,139
Why was she in a mourning dress...

688
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,349
when she got married
just a few days ago?

689
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:42,250
Did she lose a parent?

690
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,329
I feel like I betrayed Mom.

691
00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:56,099
How could I forget about
her birthday?

692
00:44:56,269 --> 00:44:57,900
(Maritime Medical Center)

693
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,539
I was so busy at work
that I forgot too.

694
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:02,469
I forgot Mom's birthday,

695
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,110
but I had the time to set Dad up
with my professor.

696
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:09,710
She must definitely feel betrayed.

697
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,110
Hardly. I bet she's proud of you.

698
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:15,920
Shouldn't Dad see a doctor though?

699
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,050
Don't ask me.

700
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,750
You know he hates doctors
and hospitals.

701
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,019
I can't believe you.

702
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,320
Hold on.

703
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,030
Where did you go
that you drank so much?

704
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:27,030
I was in a good mood.

705
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:28,460
My gosh.

706
00:45:29,429 --> 00:45:33,369
You always have an excuse to drink.

707
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,610
- Mi Ae!
- My gosh.

708
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,539
What got into you?

709
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:40,940
I can't breathe.

710
00:45:43,179 --> 00:45:47,449
Can't you play along
on a day like this?

711
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,820
What day is it today?

712
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:52,489
It's the day...

713
00:45:53,489 --> 00:45:54,789
I became victorious.

714
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:57,190
What nonsense is that?

715
00:45:57,559 --> 00:45:58,829
It's the day...

716
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:03,329
that I, Dokgo Tak,
took over Eagle Brewery.

717
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:07,599
What do you mean?

718
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,809
It's exactly what I said.

719
00:46:09,969 --> 00:46:12,039
I'll swallow up...

720
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:14,179
Eagle Brewery.

721
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:15,739
Gulp.

722
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:21,349
How will you swallow Eagle Brewery?

723
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:26,460
Oh Jang Soo's dead.

724
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:34,260
How did the man
who just got married end up dead?

725
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,599
There was a car crash,

726
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:40,739
and he died instantly.

727
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:45,809
Once I take over Eagle Brewery,

728
00:46:46,579 --> 00:46:50,449
I can erase the whole past.

729
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:56,289
Of course, luck is...

730
00:46:57,389 --> 00:46:58,989
on my side.

731
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,960
Dokgo Tak!

732
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,460
You lucky fool!

733
00:47:26,349 --> 00:47:27,480
What are you doing?

734
00:47:27,579 --> 00:47:29,480
Nothing good
will come from staying here.

735
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,989
It's best to pack up and leave
as soon as possible.

736
00:47:32,389 --> 00:47:33,519
Mom.

737
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,320
Why do you keep calling me?

738
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:39,699
Will you live here
without your husband?

739
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,659
Of course.

740
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:44,000
Get a grip, you brat.

741
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:45,500
You'll live as a widow...

742
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,940
and rot away in this house
for the rest of your life?

743
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:51,139
Whether it was
for 10 years or 10 days,

744
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:53,440
Jang Soo was my husband,

745
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,340
and I was his wife.

746
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,409
You crazy...

747
00:47:57,949 --> 00:48:01,250
Whatever others say,
I'll die and haunt this house!

748
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,019
You lost your darn mind.

749
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:05,190
Yes. I lost my mind.

750
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:08,090
So stay out of my business
from now on!

751
00:48:09,489 --> 00:48:11,090
Are you a psycho?

752
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,429
"MP" was my nickname.

753
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:17,900
What? "MP?"

754
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:21,840
"Mad Psycho."

755
00:48:23,909 --> 00:48:25,269
To think I had seaweed soup...

756
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:27,510
to recover after having you!

757
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:30,110
That hurt, Mom.

758
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,710
I hit you to hurt you.

759
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,719
Do you think I hit you out of love?

760
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,289
- Darn you.
- Don't.

761
00:48:37,190 --> 00:48:38,949
Mom!

762
00:48:43,889 --> 00:48:44,889
Oh, my gosh.

763
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,469
How could she be my daughter?

764
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,269
Darn it.

765
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,139
Oh, dear.

766
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:02,340
Hello, Beom Soo.

767
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:04,809
Let's talk.

768
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,750
My daughter Ma Kwang Sook...

769
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,690
wants to haunt this house.

770
00:49:11,889 --> 00:49:12,889
What?

771
00:49:12,889 --> 00:49:14,519
Does this make objective sense?

772
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:17,230
She was widowed
ten days into the marriage.

773
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:20,429
The young thing wants to stay here,
mourn her dead husband,

774
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:22,329
and become a ghost in this house.

775
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:25,570
What do you think about that?

776
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,900
She should pull herself together
and start over.

777
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:30,869
Jang Soo would want that too.

778
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:32,139
Exactly.

779
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:35,280
Let her pack her things
and leave tonight.

780
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:37,510
Or you'll be stuck with her.

781
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:40,550
I get what you're saying.

782
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:44,019
I trust
you'll take care of it for me.

783
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:45,750
Bye.

784
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:01,699
You want to shut down the brewery?

785
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,039
There's no choice.
There's a mountain of debt.

786
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,809
But wasn't our makgeolli popular?

787
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:08,309
So what if it's popular?

788
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:09,639
The more we make, the more we lose.

789
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:13,010
Even so,

790
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:14,949
this place was a part
of our grandfather,

791
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,889
father, and brother.

792
00:50:16,989 --> 00:50:18,550
We can't shut it down overnight.

793
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,389
Will you run the brewery, then?

794
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,130
Can you do it?

795
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:31,769
Does anyone here know
how to make makgeolli?

796
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,900
Is anyone here capable
of running the brewery?

797
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:36,440
We can't be emotional about this.

798
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,010
We must be rational.

799
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,309
There's no option.
This is the best we can do.

800
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:47,519
And about Kwang Sook...

801
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,289
Let's let her go.

802
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:53,619
Right now?

803
00:50:54,389 --> 00:50:56,559
Kwang Sook. Can we come in?

804
00:50:58,289 --> 00:51:00,329
Yes. Come in.

805
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:06,539
How do you feel?

806
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,909
I'm much better.

807
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:16,510
Here.

808
00:51:22,619 --> 00:51:24,150
What's this?

809
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:25,949
It's the money that was left...

810
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,090
after paying for the funeral.

811
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,260
Why are you giving it to me?

812
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:38,329
I'm sorry
this is all we can give you.

813
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,440
It would've been easier
to start over...

814
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:43,309
if Jang Soo had left you a lot.

815
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:46,110
I'm sorry for everything.

816
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:49,039
What do you mean, "start over?"

817
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:51,110
I got angry at the thought of you...

818
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:53,920
starting over
when Jang Soo had just died.

819
00:51:55,019 --> 00:51:56,789
Now I think I was in the wrong.

820
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,519
You have many more years
left to live.

821
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,429
Do you want me...

822
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,889
to leave this place?

823
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:09,199
Yes. I can't help it
if it sounds cruel.

824
00:52:10,369 --> 00:52:12,300
It'll only become harder to leave.

825
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,670
Pack your things.
I'll take you home.

826
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:17,440
- Beom Soo.
- That's best for you,

827
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:19,469
and it's what Jang Soo would want.

828
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,110
How do you know...

829
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,510
what Jang Soo would want?

830
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,780
Do you know your brother that well?

831
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:29,420
This is what I'd do if I were him.

832
00:52:31,619 --> 00:52:33,489
No man would want...

833
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:36,059
the woman he loved
to cling to mere memories.

834
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,690
He'd want her to be happy again.

835
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,030
Leave and believe
it will put Jang Soo at ease.

836
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,300
That's the best for everyone.

837
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:49,039
Even so...

838
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:53,309
Jang Soo only just died.

839
00:52:54,139 --> 00:52:55,579
And you want me gone already?

840
00:52:56,949 --> 00:52:59,079
How can you all be this cruel?

841
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,150
Yes.

842
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,119
We're being too hasty.

843
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:07,960
Until she's ready
to come to terms with...

844
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:09,820
Do you think we enjoy doing this?

845
00:53:10,829 --> 00:53:13,300
The longer we give you,
the harder it'll be for you to go.

846
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:15,400
This is what's right for you.

847
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,269
Please do as we ask, Kwang Sook.

848
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:35,980
Hello?

849
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:37,650
I'm Beom Soo, Ms. Gong.

850
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:40,460
Yes, I know. The professor.

851
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:43,090
Kwang Sook agreed to leave tonight.

852
00:53:43,789 --> 00:53:45,860
She'll leave
with a few items of clothing,

853
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:48,460
and we'll send the rest
of her belongings later on.

854
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,070
Okay.

855
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:52,599
Thank you, Beom Soo.

856
00:53:52,769 --> 00:53:55,639
I wish you good health, Ms. Gong.

857
00:53:55,639 --> 00:53:58,440
Please take good care of Kwang Sook.

858
00:53:58,469 --> 00:53:59,510
I will.

859
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:11,449
His brothers are decent,
just like he was.

860
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:16,730
It can't be helped.

861
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:21,500
The dead are gone,
and the living must go on.

862
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,309
(Eagle Brewery)

863
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,849
It's the same as before.

864
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,949
Nothing has changed.

865
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:54,400
What are you doing here?

866
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,099
It's been a while, Ja Dong.

867
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:01,139
I don't think we're in a position
to greet each other.

868
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,869
I heard Jang Soo died.

869
00:55:04,869 --> 00:55:06,440
I felt bad, so I came here.

870
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,440
If you felt that bad,

871
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,380
you should've come
when he was alive...

872
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:13,179
and asked for forgiveness
like a decent human being.

873
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,280
Don't think so badly of me.

874
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,489
I had my own circumstances
that I couldn't avoid.

875
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:22,920
Just leave before others see you.

876
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,059
Don't cause trouble for nothing.

877
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:26,900
Ja Dong.

878
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,170
What are you going to do?

879
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:32,130
What?

880
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:33,500
Jang Soo is gone.

881
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,699
Will you stay here?

882
00:55:36,769 --> 00:55:37,969
If you have no place to go...

883
00:55:37,969 --> 00:55:38,969
Why?

884
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:41,340
Do you want to offer a position
at Silla Brewery?

885
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,449
I can talk to my husband.

886
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:46,110
You two used to get along well.

887
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:47,750
Don't be ridiculous.

888
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:49,949
Just go home. Now!

889
00:55:52,989 --> 00:55:55,090
It was nice to see you
after such a long time.

890
00:55:58,659 --> 00:55:59,659
Mr. Go.

891
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,900
Hey, Kang Soo.

892
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:05,199
Who was that?

893
00:56:05,869 --> 00:56:08,170
Some lady asked me the way.

894
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:09,300
It's no big deal.

895
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,440
Are you here to pick up
some makgeolli?

896
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,440
Yes.

897
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,780
Whether she fell down
the stairs or not,

898
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:53,079
I shouldn't have cared.

899
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,119
I was being too kind.

900
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:57,590
My gosh.

901
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,190
It's all messed up.

902
00:57:05,489 --> 00:57:06,659
Darn it.

903
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:25,710
(Live brightly, have a broad mind,
and have big hopes.)

904
00:58:03,789 --> 00:58:07,219
(Eagle Brewery)

905
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,610
By the way, Jang Soo.

906
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:26,070
What should we name this makgeolli?

907
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,079
I don't know.

908
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:28,210
(Jang-Kwang liquor)

909
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:29,510
How about Jang-Kwang liquor?

910
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:30,750
Jang-Kwang liquor?

911
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,619
Liquor made by Jang Soo
and Kwang Sook.

912
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,019
Jang-Kwang liquor.

913
00:58:36,519 --> 00:58:37,590
That sounds nice.

914
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:39,349
Jang-Kwang liquor.

915
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,059
It turned out well.

916
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:05,280
It smells like Jang Soo.

917
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:08,420
(Jang-Kwang liquor)

918
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:22,460
What about Kwang Sook?

919
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:24,570
She just left.

920
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,239
You should've told me.

921
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:28,670
I wanted to say goodbye.

922
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:31,510
I didn't tell you
so she could leave at ease.

923
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:34,110
That's good.

924
00:59:34,110 --> 00:59:36,079
Crying and making a scene
will only hurt you more.

925
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:39,449
It's better to leave
without saying a word.

926
00:59:43,949 --> 00:59:45,150
I'm just glad...

927
00:59:45,889 --> 00:59:48,920
that Jang Soo didn't die single.

928
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:52,489
But I feel really bad
for Kwang Sook.

929
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:55,730
He did a terrible thing
for her before he left.

930
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:57,230
I don't know what to say.

931
00:59:59,969 --> 01:00:01,000
By the way,

932
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,340
what's with your wife, Chun Soo?

933
01:00:05,710 --> 01:00:08,710
Jang Soo was really nice
to you and your wife.

934
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:11,010
How could she not show up?

935
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:14,079
I'm sorry.

936
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,320
I have no excuse for that.

937
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:19,989
I mean, is it because
she can't afford the flight ticket?

938
01:00:19,989 --> 01:00:23,420
Or is it that she doesn't care about
her in-laws at all?

939
01:00:23,929 --> 01:00:25,130
Stop it, Heung Soo.

940
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,760
Why should I stop?

941
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:30,599
To be honest,
I didn't like your wife...

942
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:31,969
even before she went to the States.

943
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:33,940
She has never visited our family...

944
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:35,699
on holidays
or attended our family events.

945
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,670
She always got away with it
by making some excuses.

946
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:41,079
That's because I'm a bad husband.

947
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:44,809
Why are you a bad husband?

948
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:46,880
You graduated from
a prestigious college.

949
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,179
Working at the top securities firm
in the country,

950
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:50,550
you deliver the best performances.

951
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,320
You even let your daughter study
in the States.

952
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,650
I got fired.

953
01:00:54,289 --> 01:00:55,420
Two years ago.

954
01:01:01,030 --> 01:01:02,360
Did you know about that?

955
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,869
I just found it out a few days ago.

956
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,739
What did you do wrong to get fired?

957
01:01:08,739 --> 01:01:10,070
He didn't do anything wrong.

958
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:12,070
He just took responsibility
for things that went wrong.

959
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:13,980
Why would you take responsibility?

960
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,480
Why do you always
have to be the moral one?

961
01:01:27,019 --> 01:01:28,090
Hello, ma'am.

962
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:30,789
I guess Ha Ni misses her dad.
She keeps whining.

963
01:01:30,789 --> 01:01:32,190
So I'm calling you.

964
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:33,360
Can we talk now?

965
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,530
Sure. It's okay.

966
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,230
Hi, sweetheart.

967
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:39,000
- Did you miss me?
- Say hello to your dad.

968
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,940
I see. You did?

969
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,139
I'll spend the night here.

970
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:45,769
I'll come back early in the morning.

971
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:47,239
Go to sleep with Grandma,

972
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:48,239
okay?

973
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:51,480
"Don't worry about me, Dad."

974
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,579
Say that to your dad.

975
01:01:53,050 --> 01:01:55,980
I'm sorry that you can't rest.

976
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:59,449
She's so sweet and gentle,
so I'm not tired at all.

977
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:00,860
Don't worry about her...

978
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,719
and finish things up well.

979
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:04,289
Okay. Thank you.

980
01:02:04,289 --> 01:02:06,530
Goodnight, Princess.

981
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:08,159
I'll see you tomorrow.

982
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:13,030
Hey.

983
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:15,340
What is going on?

984
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,440
You heard me. She's my daughter.

985
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,710
They say it's always the quiet ones
that cause trouble.

986
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:25,809
This nerdy one did something big.

987
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:27,820
Who's the mother?

988
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,349
We broke up.

989
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:31,590
- What?
- What?

990
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:34,059
Let's drink.

991
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:44,900
Jang of Oh Jang Soo.

992
01:02:45,269 --> 01:02:47,199
Kwang of Ma Kwang Sook.

993
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:51,610
This Jang-Kwang liquor
tastes so good.

994
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:54,480
Oh Jang Soo!

995
01:02:55,309 --> 01:02:59,409
Where on earth did you go, you jerk?

996
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,860
Well-fermented makgeolli...

997
01:03:43,659 --> 01:03:44,889
has an apple-like aroma.

998
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:59,239
It sounds like rain.

999
01:03:59,809 --> 01:04:00,880
Right.

1000
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,380
That's the sound
of alcohol ripening.

1001
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,000
Kwang Sook.

1002
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:24,300
Kwang Sook.

1003
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:34,400
Hello?

1004
01:05:37,469 --> 01:05:38,610
Gosh, hello.

1005
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,980
Sorry? What do you mean by that?

1006
01:05:44,579 --> 01:05:46,710
She said she was
going back last night.

1007
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:51,090
What's wrong?

1008
01:05:52,289 --> 01:05:53,719
It's Kwang Sook's mother.

1009
01:05:53,889 --> 01:05:55,320
Kwang Sook didn't make it home.

1010
01:05:56,519 --> 01:05:57,789
Where did she go, then?

1011
01:05:58,389 --> 01:06:00,929
Guys, get out here. Quickly!

1012
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:02,699
Hey!

1013
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,030
- Kang Soo!
- I'll call you back.

1014
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,940
What? What is it?

1015
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:12,369
Go to the brewery.

1016
01:06:12,869 --> 01:06:13,909
The brewery?

1017
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:16,110
Why the brewery?

1018
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:17,679
You'll know once you get there.

1019
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:29,019
What on earth?

1020
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:31,389
(Pot Number 1)

1021
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,929
(Pot Number 2)

1022
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:49,909
- Kwang Sook!
- Kwang Sook!

1023
01:07:05,659 --> 01:07:06,829
I slept like a baby.

1024
01:07:12,869 --> 01:07:15,739
Good morning, my brothers-in-law.

1025
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:05,619
(For Eagle Brothers)

1026
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:07,250
This is truly unique.

1027
01:08:07,289 --> 01:08:08,619
I have no idea what'll happen next.

1028
01:08:08,619 --> 01:08:10,889
Are you making a move on me?

1029
01:08:10,889 --> 01:08:12,760
I have no intention
of grabbing coffee with you.

1030
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:15,360
Why are you forcing me out
when I did nothing wrong?

1031
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,159
How was I the one who started this?

1032
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:18,229
It was them!

1033
01:08:18,329 --> 01:08:20,029
- I don't want to.
- It'll be fine.

1034
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:21,500
Stay back.

1035
01:08:22,569 --> 01:08:23,600
Oh Kang Soo?

1036
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:24,970
Did everything go as planned?

1037
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:26,510
What do you mean he duped you?

1038
01:08:26,510 --> 01:08:27,979
You're being harsh.

1039
01:08:27,979 --> 01:08:29,479
How much does he owe you...

1040
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:32,149
that you're making him out
to be a scammer?

1041
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:35,550
Will Eagle Brewery
now become a distant memory?
