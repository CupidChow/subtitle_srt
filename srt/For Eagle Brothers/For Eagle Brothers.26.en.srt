1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,340
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,380
Who are you?

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:06,580
I'm Detective Kim Jong Hoon...

4
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,880
from the Investigation Division.

5
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,150
I see.
What brings you here, officers?

6
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,990
We're here to meet Director Seo.

7
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,890
This is not an arrest
under a formal warrant,

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,530
but a voluntary escort
for investigation.

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:24,430
Where is Director Seo Gil Yong now?

10
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:29,830
He resigned and left the company
this morning.

11
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,470
He resigned? Does that mean
he's not in the office now?

12
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,270
Well... I don't know.

13
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,780
Why would he stay in the office
after resigning?

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,510
He suddenly came
to me this morning...

15
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,080
and handed in his resignation.

16
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,380
So I thought it was strange.

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,120
What's the matter?

18
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,250
There was a confession that
Director Seo Gil Yong instigated...

19
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,120
the creation
of a false video to slander...

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,290
Eagle Brewery.

21
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,730
What?

22
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,630
Is that really true?

23
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,330
Did you not know anything
about it, Mr. Dokgo?

24
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:04,500
I had no idea.

25
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:08,240
Why on earth would
Silla Brewery slander...

26
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,480
a tiny mom-and-pop store
like Eagle Brewery?

27
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,010
He said he'd resign
for personal reasons,

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,880
so I wondered if he had any problem.

29
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,390
My gosh. Director Seo
wouldn't do such a thing.

30
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,490
Are you sure there wasn't
some kind of misunderstanding?

31
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:31,230
The police investigation
into Silla Brewery has begun.

32
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:34,030
But Chairman Dokgo Tak claims
he doesn't know anything about it.

33
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,570
Really? Then who did it?

34
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,870
Silla Brewery claims...

35
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,240
that Director Seo Gil Yong
may have instigated it,

36
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,340
as he wanted to do something
for his promotion to CEO.

37
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:46,180
But to be honest,
I find it hard to believe.

38
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:48,910
Then what about Director Seo?

39
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:51,080
He has gone into hiding
in the Philippines.

40
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,790
It will take a lot longer
than expected.

41
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,890
Hello, Chairman Han.

42
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,830
Did you hear that
the suspect confessed to the crime?

43
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,670
Yes.

44
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,070
I just got a call
from the detective...

45
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,340
and am on my way to Silla Brewery
to meet Chairman Dokgo Tak.

46
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,640
- By yourself?
- Yes.

47
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,380
I will never let that jerk
get away with this.

48
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,350
Whenever things got tough
at the brewery, he showed up...

49
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,850
and told me to sell the brewery,
which was really upsetting.

50
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,220
And he ended up doing this.

51
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,260
But since there is...

52
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,390
no evidence that...

53
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,890
Chairman Dokgo Tak instigated it,

54
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,860
you might end up in trouble.

55
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,900
You shouldn't go.

56
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,400
There's no use making excuses now.

57
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:43,300
Dokgo Tak, that jerk did it.

58
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,440
Thirty years ago,

59
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,540
he was working at Eagle Brewery
as the brewery manager.

60
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:50,140
And he embezzled the company's money
and started Silla Brewery.

61
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,110
Is that true?

62
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,110
For the sake of social justice,

63
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,180
a villain like him must be punished.

64
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,350
I should never let it slide.

65
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,290
I understand
that you're upset and frustrated.

66
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,860
But you have to stay coolheaded
at a time like this.

67
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,060
If you deal with it emotionally,
you might end up getting hurt.

68
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,760
I'm driving, so I'll hang up first.

69
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,370
Hang on, CEO Ma. Wait...

70
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,890
(Eagle Brewery)

71
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,240
Hello. How may I help you?

72
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,270
I'm here to meet Chairman Dokgo Tak.

73
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,710
Did you make an appointment?

74
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:55,940
No, I didn't.

75
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,680
My gosh. Excuse me.

76
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,410
You can't barge in like this.

77
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,320
It's all right. You may get out.

78
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,490
What brings you here
without an appointment?

79
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,890
Do you not know what this is about?

80
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,430
If you're here
because of the incident,

81
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,660
I must say I don't know
anything about it.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,900
Do you honestly
expect me to believe that?

83
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,040
I understand
you can get the wrong idea,

84
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,870
but it has absolutely nothing...

85
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:32,140
to do with me.

86
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,180
It seems like my employee did it
to impress the company...

87
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,820
before his promotion.

88
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,690
How unfortunate.

89
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,450
"How unfortunate?"

90
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:46,120
My brewery is about to go down,

91
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,230
and all you can say is
"How unfortunate?"

92
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,770
By the way, how dare you come here
and make a scene?

93
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,100
Even 30 years ago,

94
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,240
you embezzled the company's money
at Eagle Brewery...

95
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,810
and ran away
in the middle of the night.

96
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,570
And now,

97
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,940
you are harassing us by framing us?

98
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,950
Do you really have to run
your business so nastily?

99
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,550
What nonsense are you talking about?

100
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,850
Get out of my office now!

101
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,250
I won't.

102
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,090
Before you confess what you did,

103
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,090
I won't move an inch.

104
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,730
I said it had nothing to do with me.
Why are you bothering me?

105
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,500
I already have a lot on my mind!

106
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,600
If you're incapable,
you have to make an effort.

107
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,140
You framed me for a crime
I didn't commit...

108
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,510
and then stabbed me in the back?

109
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,280
Stop making
cheap makgeolli like this...

110
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,010
and come up with a proper one
to compete with me fairly!

111
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,350
Drag this woman
out of my office now!

112
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,890
Sorabol's Moonlit Night, my foot.

113
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,260
What are you doing?

114
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,800
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

115
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,230
Hey!

116
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,740
What are you waiting for?
Drag her out this instant!

117
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,170
Let go of me! Let go!

118
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,810
- Get off me!
- Let go of her!

119
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,950
Chairman Han.

120
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,780
What brings you here?

121
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,650
Let go of her now.

122
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,390
Get out.

123
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:36,800
I don't think it is right to treat
CEO Ma Kwang Sook like this,

124
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,570
who suffered enormous damage
because of the recent incident.

125
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:45,080
No, there was a misunderstanding
between us, so...

126
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,850
How could you say that
even after seeing me like this?

127
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,950
I'll take CEO Ma with me.

128
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,480
Let's go.

129
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,420
Just wait and see.
I won't let you get your own way!

130
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,120
That's enough. Let's just go.

131
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,760
That crazy brat.

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,300
Darn it!

133
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,230
By the way, why is Chairman Han...

134
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,740
taking her side?

135
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,850
What kind of woman is this fearless?

136
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,320
How could you jump
into the enemy camp...

137
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,120
with no allies on your side?

138
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,990
What if he does something
to harm you?

139
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,760
I was condemned by people...

140
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,460
because of that jerk's petty tricks.

141
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,860
And it seriously hurt my business.

142
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,890
I had to do it
because I was so frustrated.

143
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:37,760
I understand how you feel,

144
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,260
but how could you pour
makgeolli on him?

145
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,770
You should learn
to control your anger.

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,170
He was telling an obvious lie,

147
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,240
saying he didn't know anything.

148
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,640
There's no evidence
that he made his employee do it.

149
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,550
It's not that hard to tell, is it?

150
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,680
Would an employee do
such a dangerous thing...

151
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,680
when he wasn't even told to do it?

152
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,690
That's what you think.

153
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,120
The investigation
hasn't revealed anything yet.

154
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,320
Whose side are you on now?

155
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,890
Me or Dokgo Tak?

156
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
CEO Ma.

157
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,670
Are you a fool?

158
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,180
Why would I come all the way here
if I wasn't on your side?

159
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,780
Of course, I'm on your side.

160
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,660
Why are you crying?

161
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:41,060
Just thinking that I have someone
on my side...

162
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,360
makes me want to cry.

163
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,470
You don't have to cry though.

164
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,140
Wipe your tears.

165
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,310
Since someone told me
he was on my side,

166
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,210
I was touched.

167
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,390
Having me on your side...

168
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,630
is like having
an unlimited credit card...

169
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,700
or having a free pass...

170
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,030
that can take you anywhere.

171
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,900
It is touching.

172
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,180
Why are you staring at me like that?

173
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,110
Was I being too condescending?

174
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,320
It's not that.

175
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,150
Why are you being so nice to me?

176
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,620
Am I?

177
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,860
Yes, you are.

178
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,500
The chairman I know is prickly.

179
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,730
But you're being nice to me
all of a sudden.

180
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,770
I just can't get used to it.

181
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,500
That's just...

182
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:05,740
You're the CEO
of my hotel's supplier.

183
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,080
So I should protect you.

184
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,580
I want to work things out...

185
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,380
so this incident won't tarnish
the image of my hotel.

186
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,720
Do you not understand that?

187
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,390
Just think about the food
that we've eaten together...

188
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:22,830
and the drinks we've shared.

189
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,330
It's showing that I care
as a human being.

190
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:27,870
It's two human beings
showing we care.

191
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,040
You don't get it?

192
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,470
I do.

193
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,180
I get it.

194
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,310
That's it, of course.

195
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,620
Your car's here, sir.

196
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,490
- Hello.
- Hello.

197
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:52,420
Don't get too emotional
and control yourself.

198
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,190
Sort everything out one by one.

199
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,390
I will.

200
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,230
Goodbye, then.

201
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,840
Goodbye.

202
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,510
Oh, right.

203
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,460
Why am I being so nice to her?

204
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,190
How could she ask that to my face?

205
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,100
(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

206
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,590
It was a dreadful mistake...

207
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,530
to come after
Ma Kwang Sook like that.

208
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,800
I'll make you regret it.

209
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,340
Dokgo Tak.

210
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,140
You are...

211
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,870
a dead man.

212
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:24,150
I heard we have police officers
in the Philippines.

213
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,720
Can we catch him, then?

214
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,720
We contacted them...

215
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,950
at the consulate in Manila
through Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

216
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:31,990
but unfortunately,

217
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,130
he'd already landed
and gone underground.

218
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,590
I don't believe...

219
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,430
he did this on his own.

220
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,560
I'm positive...

221
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,970
Silla Brewery's CEO Dokgo Tak
was behind this.

222
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,970
He got his subordinate
to take the fall and disappear.

223
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,410
Are you on bad terms
with Silla Brewery?

224
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,140
Pardon?

225
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,380
Around 30 years ago,

226
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,480
Dokgo Tak,
who is now the CEO of Silla Brewery,

227
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,250
was our brewery manager.

228
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:03,890
He embezzled from the company
and ran away.

229
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,190
You didn't report him?

230
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,830
My father...

231
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,760
didn't want to send
a long-time employee to prison.

232
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,570
I believe he never told the police.

233
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,410
We're following many leads.

234
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:24,340
Please wait.

235
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,280
Our brewery's...

236
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,450
close to shutting down
because of that video.

237
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,750
Please work faster.

238
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,650
I'll try.

239
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,750
- Please do your best.
- I will.

240
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,860
(Closed Today)

241
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,200
The convenience store's closed.

242
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,270
It is.

243
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,270
Is something wrong?

244
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,280
The phone is turned off.
Transferring to voicemail.

245
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,950
What's going on?

246
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,620
Goodness.

247
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,790
Did you talk to Dokgo Tak?

248
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,660
He denied knowledge of everything.

249
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,960
There's no way
the sly weasel would tell the truth.

250
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,200
He's not a sly weasel.
He's a 100-year-old snake.

251
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,070
That's an insult to snakes.

252
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,940
He's a 100-year-old worm.

253
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,770
That darn worm.

254
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,280
I'll crush him!

255
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,140
(Office)

256
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,220
The woman's so greedy,

257
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,620
she's fighting her brothers-in-law
over the inheritance.

258
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,820
Taking the family assets...

259
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,890
following his death.

260
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,860
That's the definition
of a gold digger.

261
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,060
That Ma Kwang Sook is a gold digger.

262
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,500
A gold digger like a venomous snake.

263
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,410
He spoke ill of CEO Ma...

264
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,880
because he wanted
to supply my hotel.

265
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,520
To think my son will marry
into such a terrible family.

266
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,090
(ENT specialist, Han Gyeol)

267
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,660
You've been looking blue all day.

268
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,470
Is something wrong?

269
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,470
What?

270
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,800
No.

271
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,210
We met in the newborn unit,

272
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,070
and went to the same kindergarten
and schools...

273
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,710
right through to university.

274
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:42,010
I've known you for over 30 years.

275
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,620
Don't you know
I can tell how you feel...

276
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,150
just by scanning your gaze?

277
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,490
Come on.

278
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,460
What is it about?

279
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,630
I think...

280
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,300
I have to start over.

281
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
With what?

282
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Yes?

283
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,510
Mother.

284
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,580
I wasn't expecting you.

285
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,910
I'd like to speak with you.

286
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,110
Are you free?

287
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:16,580
I should go, then.

288
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,580
Bye.

289
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,250
Please take a seat.

290
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,490
I hope I didn't disrupt
your busy day.

291
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,260
You didn't.

292
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,630
I was having a break after lunch.

293
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,630
I see.

294
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,640
I bet you were surprised yesterday.

295
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,240
I was.

296
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,010
To be honest, I was taken aback.

297
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,810
I'd understand
and let it go if it were...

298
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,480
the typical cold feet situation.

299
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,820
But I can't go ahead
with the marriage...

300
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,820
knowing she has feelings
for another man.

301
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,390
There's no need
to hide anything now,

302
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,590
so I'll tell the whole truth.

303
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,330
Se Ri's professor is a single dad.

304
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,540
He's raising a baby on his own,

305
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,300
and you can imagine
how hard it must be.

306
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,670
My sweet, kindhearted Se Ri
saw that...

307
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,740
and felt bad for him
and wanted to help.

308
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:22,650
She babysat the child
when she was free,

309
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,680
and they got a bit closer.

310
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,420
I think that's why she's wavering.

311
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,050
You mean...

312
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,790
she has a crush on her professor?

313
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,330
A crush is too strong a word.

314
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,660
It's more like pity.

315
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,900
It's nothing more than that.

316
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,500
Women have a maternal side.

317
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,310
Just now,

318
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,570
I met her professor in his office.

319
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,880
He has no feelings
for Se Ri whatsoever.

320
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,580
Se Ri's kicking up a fuss
on her own.

321
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,320
She'll get over it soon.

322
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,450
Will you give her time and wait?

323
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,760
Please?

324
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,970
Ms. Jang?

325
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:20,000
I'm Se Ri's mom.

326
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,540
What?

327
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,970
Who knew...

328
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,710
we'd meet again like this?

329
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,950
Can I sit down?

330
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:47,900
You have a lecture,
so I'll get to the point.

331
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,540
Let my Se Ri go.

332
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,210
She has a fiance.

333
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,140
But she's been wavering since
she met you.

334
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:03,980
Our families go a long way back.

335
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,480
For a long time,

336
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,580
I considered the young man
my future son-in-law...

337
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,220
There seems to be
a misunderstanding.

338
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,890
I don't know
why I should listen to this.

339
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,660
I never considered Se Ri
dating material.

340
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:20,230
To me, she's just a student
and a teaching assistant.

341
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:22,700
Do you mean that?

342
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,500
I do.

343
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,840
Then my Se Ri
has a one-sided thing for you?

344
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,010
That's none of my business.

345
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,880
What a relief.

346
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,980
I just have to convince her, then.

347
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,420
Please leave.

348
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:39,620
I have to head to the lecture hall.

349
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,390
Okay.
Thanks for sparing me your time.

350
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,060
Sorry for intruding.

351
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,090
You were smart and got good grades,

352
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,800
and your father
was always proud of you.

353
00:19:57,270 --> 00:19:59,070
I'm glad you grew up well.

354
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,000
I mean that.

355
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,180
I know...

356
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,980
you hated me a lot.

357
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,180
It sounds like an excuse,

358
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,180
but I was at a dead end...

359
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,720
and had no other choice at the time.

360
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,490
I've lived with the guilt
and regret my whole life.

361
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,360
You've lived with the guilt
and regret your whole life?

362
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,230
It's the truth.
I regretted it a lot.

363
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,570
My father never got an answer
until the day he died.

364
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,340
"Why did Ms. Jang do this to me?"

365
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,510
"I get why the brewery manager
betrayed me,"

366
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,950
"but why did Ms. Jang
betray me too?"

367
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,880
"She shouldn't have,
at least for Kang Soo's sake."

368
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,120
"So why?"

369
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,760
How did you know?

370
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,560
I overheard his conversation
with Ja Dong...

371
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,660
when I was a kid,

372
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,060
My brothers don't know...

373
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,730
that Kang Soo is your son.

374
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,410
Even though my father was advised
to call the police,

375
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:16,050
he never went near a police station
for Kang Soo's sake.

376
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,520
Now that I know
Se Ri is your daughter,

377
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:25,090
whatever you're worried about
will never happen.

378
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,960
You can head home reassured.

379
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm sorry.

380
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,300
Don't.

381
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:37,870
Even apologies
have their expiration dates.

382
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,400
Your apology now...

383
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,510
is worthless to us.

384
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,450
I'd like to ask for one more favor.

385
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,790
Please don't tell Se Ri
about our history.

386
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:03,760
Please.

387
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,630
Fine.

388
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,240
How did people like Ms. Jang
and Dokgo Tak...

389
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,410
have a child like Se Ri?

390
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,620
Of course, we should make purchases.

391
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,190
Now that the police
have made an arrest,

392
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:30,350
the brewery will be back to normal.

393
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:35,030
You did the right thing.

394
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,130
I'll send the advance payment
in a few days.

395
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,060
Sure thing.

396
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,700
Who was that?

397
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:46,870
Our partner rice farm.

398
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,910
They're asking
for an advance payment.

399
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,610
This is bad.

400
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,820
The person who filmed...

401
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,280
the slander video about our brewery
has been arrested.

402
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,850
She was hired
by one of our competitors.

403
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Unbelievable.

404
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,430
Everything will be back to normal,

405
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,860
so could you please extend...

406
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,670
the loan we took out?

407
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:19,470
Like I told your CEO,

408
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:22,010
the head office won't grant
an extension of the loan...

409
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,010
due to risk management concerns.

410
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,680
What do you mean by risk management?

411
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,650
Once a company loses the trust
of its consumers,

412
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:32,380
it takes a long time to regain it.

413
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,580
The head office is assuming...

414
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,150
that other risk factors may come
into play during that time.

415
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,860
I have enough experience
working in finance myself.

416
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,190
This is just
a temporary cash flow issue.

417
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,360
Aren't primary banks meant
to help companies...

418
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,560
during times like this?

419
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,600
(Yuil Bank)

420
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,380
Hey, Heung Soo.

421
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,280
You must be out of the office.

422
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,750
I'm on my way back
after meeting with the bank manager.

423
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,150
Did it go well?

424
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,650
Nothing I say will change his mind.

425
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,490
I don't think
this is going to work out.

426
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,500
What will happen
if the extension isn't granted?

427
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,500
Banks will stop authorizing
our transactions,

428
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,030
and we won't be able
to take out loans.

429
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,570
We won't be able
to keep the business running.

430
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,000
That sounds serious.

431
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,540
Kwang Sook must be feeling grim.

432
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,240
Sure, Chun Soo.
We'll talk again soon.

433
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,290
Yes?

434
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,760
Hello.

435
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,500
Mr. Rooftop House,
what brings you by?

436
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:55,130
I'm afraid I have to move out.

437
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,770
That's out of the blue.

438
00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:00,170
The family's suffering,
and I need the money.

439
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,810
You can wire me my deposit
after deducting this month's rent...

440
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,110
Your girlfriend has already paid
three months' rent in advance.

441
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,880
My girlfriend?

442
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,550
(Congratulations on Your Opening,
Ji Ok Bun)

443
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,230
Welcome.

444
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,860
- My gosh!
- Come on in.

445
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,730
Congratulations
on opening your new shop.

446
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,940
You must've made
quite a nice little fortune.

447
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,740
I didn't know you had enough
to open a shop like this.

448
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,440
It's nowhere near what you've made.

449
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,250
You only opened today,
but the place is bustling.

450
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,680
You'll be rolling in money
in no time.

451
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,820
Come on. As if that'll ever be true.

452
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,350
Goodness. Thank you.

453
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,160
Ok Bun, have a seat.
I'll make you a sandwich.

454
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,490
The toasted sandwiches we serve
are to die for.

455
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,030
Okay.

456
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,870
- By the way,
- Yes?

457
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:06,040
how much did it cost you
to open a shop like this?

458
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,100
(3H Acupressure Bed)

459
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,010
Well, nothing's
out of the ordinary, is it?

460
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,940
- It isn't.
- I'm heading home, then.

461
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,610
Sure thing.
Have a pleasant evening, Ms. Gong.

462
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,010
- Keep up the good work.
- Sure.

463
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,920
Yes, Dr. Hwang. It's been a while.

464
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,420
I felt too bad to call...

465
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,430
after what happened
with my daughter's blind date.

466
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,590
They were simply not meant to be.

467
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,200
It's nothing to feel bad about.

468
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,100
Thank you for putting it that way.

469
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:39,970
Ms. Gong, could you make time
this Saturday?

470
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,370
If you're the one asking, Dr. Hwang,

471
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,470
I'll always be available.

472
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,910
It's just that the dance team
at Golden Castle...

473
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:50,210
is having a small recital.

474
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,820
A recital?

475
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:54,680
You may no longer be a resident,

476
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:57,950
but since you were on the team,
I'd like to invite you to it.

477
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:00,960
I see.

478
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,790
Feel free to bring
your daughter and friends too.

479
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,100
I'll send the invitation
to your home address.

480
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,730
Sure. I'll see you on Saturday.

481
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:17,240
Elderly men and women
on the dance floor?

482
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,340
All we'll hear is bones cracking
against each other.

483
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,640
Why would you bother with a recital?

484
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,690
Are you back?

485
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:32,920
Hey.

486
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,730
- Are you not feeling well?
- What?

487
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,400
I'm aching all over.
I have the chills.

488
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,500
Goodness me.

489
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,670
Hold on.

490
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,040
You're burning up.

491
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:49,640
Let me take you to a doctor.

492
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,570
It's okay.
I just took some medicine,

493
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,480
so I'll be able to sleep it off.

494
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,120
Go with the tide.

495
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,360
Don't fight against the current.

496
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,490
When Jang Soo died,
you should've let...

497
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,400
the brewery shut down.
That was the course of nature.

498
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,830
Even if I do shut it down,

499
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,170
I can't let it end
with a tarnished reputation.

500
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,270
I'll keep fighting
until Eagle Brewery's name...

501
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:24,410
is cleared of the mud
that's been thrown on it.

502
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,480
You just can't help
but make life harder for yourself.

503
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,080
Why would you choose...

504
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,090
to walk on nails
when you could walk on silk?

505
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,040
But it has absolutely nothing...

506
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,970
to do with me.

507
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,570
It seems like my employee did it
to impress the company...

508
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,140
before his promotion.

509
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,980
How unfortunate.

510
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,580
That jerk.

511
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,450
I'll make you regret this.

512
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,860
Gosh, my head.

513
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,130
Goodness.

514
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,740
Let go of me! Let go!

515
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,770
Let go of her!

516
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,910

517
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,680
Let go of her now.

518
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,090
What's going on
between him and that pit bull?

519
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,390
My gosh.

520
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,330
Are they in love or something?

521
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,560
No way. That can't be it.

522
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,800
But what if it's true?

523
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:03,370
It will give me a serious headache.

524
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,550
We distributed press releases
to the media...

525
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,150
stating that the video showing...

526
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,620
the stale rice at Eagle Brewery
was fabricated by a competitor,

527
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,650
and it will be reported
on the nine o'clock news.

528
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,450
The PR team sent
separate press releases...

529
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,860
that say LX Hotel
trusts Jang-Kwang Makgeolli...

530
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,820
of Eagle Brewery...

531
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,130
and will continue
to do business with them.

532
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,860
We will have to continue
the PR work...

533
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:29,730
until the truth about the incident
is revealed...

534
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,830
and the misunderstandings
about Eagle Brewery are cleared up.

535
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,940
That way,
we can save our supplier...

536
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,270
and improve the image of our hotel.

00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,540
(Live brightly, have a broad mind,
and have big hopes.)

539
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:17,510
My gosh, Chairman Han.

540
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,280
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

541
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,880
Isn't this
Ms. Ma Kwang Sook's phone?

542
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,790
Yes, it is.

543
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:26,020
I'm her mom.

544
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,560
Oh, I see. Hello.

545
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:32,260
Kwang Sook is not feeling well now,

546
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,400
so I'm answering her phone.

547
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:38,200
Is she sick?

548
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,770
What's wrong?

549
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,240
She has a high fever...

550
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,770
and aches all over.

551
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,610
She just took a pill
and fell asleep.

552
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,940
I see.

553
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,550
So what are you calling...

554
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,920
Kwang Sook about?

555
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,520
Well... It's nothing special.

556
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,760
The real culprit who fabricated
the video has been caught,

557
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,630
so we have things to discuss.

558
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,500
It's no big deal,
so you don't have to worry.

559
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,970
Yes. I'm hanging up then.

560
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,510
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

561
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:22,110
Please come in.

562
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:35,360
Send some Korean beef sets...

563
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,930
and a fruit set...

564
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,130
to CEO Ma Kwang Sook
of Eagle Brewery.

565
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,430
Mr. Kim knows the address,
so you can ask him.

566
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,100
Yes, sir.
I'll take care of it right away.

567
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,610
She's been through a lot.

568
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,510
No wonder why she's feeling sick.

569
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,840
Go to Gyeol
and beg for forgiveness now.

570
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,880
What did I do wrong
to go and beg him?

571
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:28,140
You broke your promise to marry him.

572
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,280
I said I was sorry.

573
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,380
Put yourself in his shoes.

574
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,120
Would you feel better...

575
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,350
just because he apologized?

576
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,160
You have to sincerely
ask for forgiveness.

577
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,820
Don't get your hopes up anymore.

578
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,560
I'm not marrying Gyeol.

579
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,860
Then what?

580
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,970
Will you marry a divorced man
with a child...

581
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,070
and raise a child who's not yours
for the rest of your life?

582
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,640
I want to do that
if Professor Oh says yes.

583
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,410
Do you need permission
to live with that pathetic guy?

584
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,640
Are you out of your mind?

585
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,280
You fool!

586
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,050
Do you really want me
to kill myself?

587
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,090
Are you really Se Ri, my daughter?

588
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,360
How can you do this to me?

589
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,800
I love Professor Oh.

590
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,170
And I really like Ha Ni.

591
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,040
Pull yourself together.

592
00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:35,750
He said he wasn't even interested
in you at all.

593
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,180
Did you meet him?

594
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,380
Yes, I did.

595
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,190
How could you meet him...

596
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,120
without telling me about it?

597
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:47,090
What did you tell him?

598
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,090
I said my daughter had
a man to marry,

599
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,500
so he had to get away from her.

600
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Mom!

601
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:56,130
The professor said he'd never
seen you in a romantic way.

602
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,840
You were the only one
in this relationship, you fool!

603
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,640
I told you...

604
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,140
that he's not interested in me.

605
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,840
I just have a crush on him.

606
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,010
What?

607
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,540
I told you already.

608
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,480
I told you everything,

609
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,450
but why did you go to him?

610
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:16,720
He must've been
offended and flustered.

611
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:21,120
You just keep talking
about the professor.

612
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,260
Is that all you can think about?

613
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,030
Are you not worried
about your mom and dad at all?

614
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,400
I've always done everything
you told me to do.

615
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,270
Can't I...

616
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,380
live my life the way I want
from now on?

617
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,080
Just do as I say with the marriage.

618
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,120
After that,

619
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,250
I will never interfere
with your life.

620
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:52,490
How can I marry a man you want?

621
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,690
Then it will be your life, not mine.

622
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,860
I do have...

623
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,870
the right to be happy
with the person I love.

624
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,200
Se Ri!

625
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,290
How did my daughter
end up like that?

626
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,090
Does she not know
how I've raised her?

627
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,130
Why does it have to be
the son of the brewery?

628
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,060
Professor.

629
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:15,540
I heard my mom went to see you.

630
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,940
I'm sorry.

631
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,210
For a mother with a daughter
who's about to get married,

632
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,040
I think it's understandable.

633
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,950
You don't have to apologize.

634
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,620
My mom must've said something harsh.

635
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,490
I'm sorry.

636
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,490
I apologize on her behalf.

637
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,860
If you're really sorry,

638
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:36,260
you should go back
to where you belong.

639
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,730
You liked my daughter,

640
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,630
and you felt bad for me
when you learned about my situation.

641
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:44,200
So you got confused
about your feelings for a moment.

642
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,300
Don't confuse sympathy with love.

643
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,010
I never had sympathy for you.

644
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,340
I have no reason to feel that way.

645
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,550
The parents set the wedding date...

646
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,180
against my will.

647
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,050
And I've always thought of him
as my brother.

648
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,820
I've never felt anything
more than that.

649
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,590
That's right.

650
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,830
If I hadn't met you,

651
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,660
I might have married him.

652
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,160
But now that I met you,

653
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,870
I can't marry him.

654
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:18,870
Se Ri.

655
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,370
When I imagine a future with you,

656
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,540
I feel excited and happy.

657
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:28,610
And it gives me the courage
that I can overcome any hardships.

658
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,450
Isn't that what matters?

659
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,450
Do you care only
about your feelings?

660
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,350
What about mine?

661
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,420
Do you really not have
any feelings for me?

662
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,520
Not at all?

663
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:51,970
I asked Seon Mi
to find a new teaching assistant.

664
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,040
Professor!

665
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,800
She will call you
once she finds someone...

666
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,870
for the transition.

667
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:59,080
From now on, I won't be seeing you
in person except during class.

668
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,350
Why is this open?

669
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,090
My goodness.

670
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,160
You're back, Heung Soo.

671
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,230
What are you doing here?

672
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:55,460
Can't you tell?
I'm preparing dinner.

673
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,340
How did you get in?

674
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,440
I found the spare key
under the flowerpot.

675
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:06,280
I saw you put it there last time.

676
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:13,120
I'm cooking kimchi jjigae with pork.

677
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,580
It won't be much longer.

678
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,960
Did you clean my place?

679
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,760
Yes. I cleaned the bathroom too.

680
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,430
What's this?

681
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:32,300
Your socks and underwear had holes,
so I got you new ones.

682
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,310
Ok Bun.

683
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:40,080
You're going way too far.

684
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,940
What?

685
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,110
Just because
we spent one night together,

686
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,820
you're acting like we're newlyweds.

687
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,850
You can't do this.

688
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:50,190
We promised
not to tie each other down.

689
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,160
I'm not tying you down.

690
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,760
As if you're not.

691
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,430
You tied my arms and legs.

692
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,530
Now you're grabbing my throat
and shaking me.

693
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,830
It's nothing like that.

694
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,470
You paid my landlady...

695
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,740
three months' rent in advance.

696
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,100
How could you do that
without asking me?

697
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,810
I'm sorry if you're offended.

698
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:16,250
I just thought
you were struggling financially...

699
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,650
and wanted to help.

700
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,010
Are you looking down on me...

701
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,520
just because you have some money?

702
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,450
I wouldn't do that.

703
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:26,290
That's nonsense.

704
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:28,020
If you cross the line like this,

705
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,330
I feel like you're belittling me.

706
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,130
I'm sorry
if I made you feel that way.

707
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,300
I apologize.

708
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,940
Forget it. You should go.

709
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,970
And don't come here
without my permission.

710
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,090
Bye, then.

711
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,720
When the jjigae is done,

712
00:42:02,490 --> 00:42:04,760
eat it with the rice
in the rice cooker.

713
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,730
Stay and eat, then.

714
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,240
No, thanks.

715
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:25,350
Was I too harsh?

716
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,020
Hello?

717
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,490
Yes, Mr. Kim.

718
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,730
Right now?

719
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:15,130
- Come in.
- Okay.

720
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,010
Here you go.

721
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:27,640
What's all this?

722
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,550
Chairman Han sent them.

723
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:35,820
Who...

724
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:40,660
Hello. I'm Chairman Han's chauffeur.

725
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,960
- Right, we met before.
- Yes.

726
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:47,030
Did the chairman send all this?

727
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:50,600
Yes. I believe he sent these over...

728
00:43:50,970 --> 00:43:52,430
to wish Ms. Ma good health.

729
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,900
I should go now.

730
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:59,070
Why not stay for some tea?

731
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,880
No, thank you. I'll see you again.

732
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,520
Goodbye.

733
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:10,420
Drive safely.

734
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:13,520
Oh, my gosh.

735
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,990
The chairman's such a nice man.

736
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,200
He called while you were asleep,

737
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,930
and I said you were ill
and had taken some medicine.

738
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:25,400
He must've sent this
because he was worried about you.

739
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,340
Why would he send food
just because I'm sick?

740
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:34,710
Come on. Are you that dense?

741
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:36,710
If the woman he likes is ill,

742
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,920
of course, he'd send beef ribs
if not even more.

743
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,320
All you have to do now
is thank the chairman...

744
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,620
and enjoy the good food.

745
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,360
Dried yellow corvina?

746
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,490
What's in here?

747
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,600
My goodness.

748
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,840
He sent
such beautiful, sweet-looking fruit.

749
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,240
What's all this?

750
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,480
Oh, this?

751
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,490
They're from a doctor I know well
at Golden Castle.

752
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:18,690
He wished me good health.

753
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,920
Gosh. They look appetizing.

754
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,790
I'll cook everything up nicely.

755
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,160
Can you bring it all to the kitchen?

756
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,360
Yes, of course.

757
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,670
Be gentle.

758
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,470
Here we go.

759
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:35,940
Let's go.

760
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,170
Hello?

761
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,600
It's Ma Kwang Sook.

762
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:08,670
How do you feel?

763
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,340
I took some medicine...

764
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:13,610
and had a nap,
and I feel much better.

765
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,250
By the way, Chairman Han,

766
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,850
why did you send all the food?

767
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,650
You'd been looking tired,

768
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:28,620
so I sent them to cheer you up.

769
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,460
It's nothing at all.
Don't mind it too much.

770
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:34,060
How can I not mind it?

771
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,330
I feel like I've been receiving
a lot from you lately,

772
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,830
which makes me uncomfortable.

773
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,910
You just have to receive.

774
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:44,540
What?

775
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:46,640
I'll do the giving,

776
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,810
so you just have to receive.

777
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:51,880
What does that mean?

778
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,420
There's no need
to analyze the meaning.

779
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:56,050
Just accept it.

780
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:58,850
- What?
- Goodbye, then.

781
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:02,090
Enjoy your dinner.

782
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:05,190
Hello? Chairman...

783
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,630
"You just have to receive?"

784
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,270
What does that mean?

785
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,170
Even I think...

786
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,540
that was a cool quote.

787
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:40,530
You're home?

788
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,070
Are you unwell?

789
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:46,270
My lunch didn't agree with me.

790
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,570
Shouldn't you see a doctor?

791
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,970
I'll be fine after a good rest.

792
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:54,210
I don't have the energy to cook.

793
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,510
Have dinner delivered.

794
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:03,790
Darn it.

795
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,750
Are you in, Se Ri?

796
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:15,360
What's up with you?

797
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,530
My head aches.

798
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,430
Did you take a painkiller?

799
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:20,900
Yes.

800
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,200
Have you eaten?

801
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,510
I'm not hungry.

802
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,010
Fine.

803
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,880
Darn.

804
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,050
My head's already spinning
from everything going on at work,

805
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,820
but it's no better at home.

806
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:46,730
Yes, Mr. Jung. What is this about?

807
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,430
You might want
to watch the news, sir.

808
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:52,370
Our company is being mentioned
on the news.

809
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:53,840
What?

810
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,710
Eagle Brewery, known for producing
its premium Jang-Kwang Makgeolli...

811
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,810
using only organic rice,

812
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:05,880
sparked public outrage...

813
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,680
after a video revealed...

814
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,120
that it had been using
stale rice instead.

815
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,850
However, the video in question
was later revealed...

816
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:15,520
to have been fabricated
by a competitor.

817
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,430
Park, the suspect
who fabricated the video,

818
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,730
confessed to the police
that she had received...

819
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:23,470
financial compensation
from Director Seo of Silla Brewery,

820
00:49:23,470 --> 00:49:24,930
who orchestrated the crime.

821
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:27,600
The prime suspect,
Director Seo of Silla Brewery,

822
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,240
submitted his resignation...

823
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:30,940
and fled abruptly
to the Philippines.

824
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,970
His whereabouts
are currently unknown.

825
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,950
The company itself
wasn't involved in this conspiracy.

826
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:39,510
We are also conducting
an internal investigation.

827
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,120
Dokgo Tak.
This was obviously his doing,

828
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,420
so why are they after someone else?

829
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:45,290
Tell me about it!

830
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:47,820
Is the Grim Reaper on vacation?

831
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,790
Those pigs should get what's coming.

832
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,800
If the Grim Reaper won't do it,

833
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,370
I'll get them myself.

834
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:57,900
- What?
- What?

835
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:00,070
Just wait and see.

836
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,170
I, Ma Kwang Sook,

837
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:04,870
will become...

838
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:08,180
Dokgo Tak's own Grim Reaper!

839
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:12,910
Silla Brewery claims...

840
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,980
that the director acted alone
in the incident...

841
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,490
because he was obsessed...

842
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:18,050
with getting a promotion.

843
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,620
The brewery further stated...

844
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,060
that it had no knowledge
of his wrongdoing.

845
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,660
The police are keeping
all options open...

846
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:26,090
and will collaborate
with the Philippine authorities...

847
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,630
to determine
Director Seo's whereabouts.

848
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,400
Darn it!

849
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,170
What did I just hear?

850
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,580
Are you out of your mind?

851
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:43,040
How could you do
something like this?

852
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,420
I don't know
what you're talking about.

853
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:49,850
Director Seo...

854
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,590
orchestrated it behind my back.

855
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,020
I knew nothing about it.

856
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,620
Director Seo?

857
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,390
That bootlicker orchestrated
something this big...

858
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:00,100
without your approval?

859
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,730
Do you expect me to believe that?

860
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,730
You should trust
your husband's words,

861
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,730
not second-guess him!

862
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:07,070
I said I didn't know!

863
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:09,070
I clearly warned you.

864
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,510
You were not to mess
with Eagle Brewery.

865
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,910
Don't pretend
you're innocent in all of this.

866
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:18,450
Thirty years ago,

867
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,580
you were the one who egged me on.

868
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:22,850
That's right.

869
00:51:23,490 --> 00:51:25,090
I egged you on.

870
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,720
But I promised myself...

871
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,460
that when I was able,

872
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:33,090
I would repay the debt I owed
to Eagle Brewery.

873
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,800
Not a day went by...

874
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,830
without thinking about that promise.

875
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:39,030
That's awfully naive.

876
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,600
This is a war zone.

877
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:44,810
We're fighting in a war...

878
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,480
that could end our brewery
if we make one wrong move.

879
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:51,810
I will do anything and everything
for the sake...

880
00:51:51,810 --> 00:51:53,650
of my family and company.

881
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:56,590
Please give up your greed!

882
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:59,590
Without that greed,
I wouldn't have come this far!

883
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:04,560
You will pay immensely
for what you have done this time.

884
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:09,430
You should've listened to me
when I first warned you.

885
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,940
That darn woman.

886
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:45,970
The phone is turned off.
Transferring to voicemail.

887
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:48,070
You will be charged after the tone.

888
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:51,170
Could something be up?

889
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:00,850
I can't seem to reach you
on your phone.

890
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,850
I hope everything's okay.

891
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:05,090
I'm worried about you,

892
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:07,060
so call me
as soon as you get this message.

893
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,880
Kang Soo, may I come in?

894
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,180
Of course, Kwang Sook.

895
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:35,220
Were you getting ready
for work tomorrow?

896
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,050
I was ironing the suit
I'll be wearing at the office.

897
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:40,460
Finally,

898
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,990
it's your first day at work.

899
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,500
What's this?

900
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,800
I gave it to Jang Soo as a gift
before we got married.

901
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,740
He rarely had the chance
to wear suits,

902
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:57,840
so he hardly wore it
more than a few times.

903
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:00,940
It was one of his favorite ties,

904
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,280
so I've kept it.

905
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,780
Now, I'd like you to have it.

906
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,520
Please wear it
to celebrate your first day at work.

907
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,520
Kwang Sook...

908
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:12,950
Think that Jang Soo is by your side,

909
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,160
and do good work at the office.

910
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,090
I'll be rooting for you.

911
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,160
Thank you.

912
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,100
You should try it on to see
if it looks good on you.

913
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,840
No way.

914
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,410
I knew it'd suit you.

915
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,580
It looked slightly better
on Jang Soo,

916
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,250
but it looks good on you.

917
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:19,790
I will treasure this.

918
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:22,560
Thank you, Kwang Sook.

919
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,720
Lieutenant Oh.

920
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,950
Bom.

921
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:54,890
I see you went the extra mile
for your first day at work.

922
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,790
That's a good-looking tie.

923
00:55:58,730 --> 00:55:59,760
Thank you.

924
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,330
You look amazing too.

925
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:07,500
By the way, I think
I should address you differently.

926
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,810
It'll confuse people...

927
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:12,840
if I stick to Lieutenant Oh.

928
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,380
I guess you're right.

929
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,150
You can call me by my name.

930
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:20,520
Like Kang Soo?

931
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,690
Sure.

932
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,930
Shall we head inside?

933
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:33,800
This team was put together...

934
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,300
to launch a premium line
of golf wear.

935
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:37,370
Go ahead and say hello.

936
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:40,500
I'm Assistant Manager Lee Hye Seong
in charge of planning and marketing.

937
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,600
It's good to meet you all.

938
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,540
I'm Assistant Manager Kim Do Yoon...

939
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:46,240
in charge of the designs.

940
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:49,510
The two of you have already
proven your talents at this company.

941
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:52,250
Meanwhile, they are interns...

942
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,250
taking their first steps
into society at this company.

943
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:55,650
Welcome.

944
00:56:58,950 --> 00:57:01,490
I'm Oh Kang Soo,
a planning and marketing intern.

945
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,120
As a former UDT member,

946
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,960
I will apply myself
to the work here...

947
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,090
like I did out at sea.

948
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,160
I hope we get along.

949
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,400
I'm Han Bom, a design intern.

950
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:15,270
After studying fine arts
in college...

951
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:17,570
and pursuing fashion design
in grad school,

952
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:19,010
I'm now beginning my new journey.

953
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:20,710
I hope we get along.

954
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:23,680
We certainly hope so.
You're the chairman's daughter.

955
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:29,580
A styling class
will be held this weekend...

956
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,550
to help promote our new spring
and summer collection.

957
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:34,990
Since we'll be busy
with preparations,

958
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:37,490
we won't be gathering for tea
or a meal today...

959
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:39,030
even though it's your first day.

960
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:42,430
I'll ask you interns
to make yourselves busy...

961
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:43,730
by shadowing your mentors.

962
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,030
- Sure.
- Sure.

963
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:47,900
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

964
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:02,080
Hello?

965
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,220
This is Han Dong Seok.

966
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:06,720
I didn't expect a call this early
in the morning.

967
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,520
I wanted us to meet
so we could discuss something.

968
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,190
Are you at the office?

969
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:14,600
Well, I'll be there
in a few minutes.

970
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:17,500
I'll head to your office
straight away.

971
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,870
Sure. I'll see you in my office.

972
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,710
I already have a lot on my mind.

973
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:28,810
What does he want to see me about?

974
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,080
Goodness.

975
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,420
- Wait.
- Yes, sir.

976
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:40,690
(Silla Brewery Dokgo Tak,
Apologize for the fake video)

977
00:58:40,690 --> 00:58:42,190
What the heck is that woman doing...

978
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,060
outside my business?

979
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,530
What does it say?

980
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,500
(Silla Brewery Dokgo Tak,
Apologize for the fake video)

981
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,470
"Silla Brewery Dokgo Tak,"

982
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:56,300
"apologize for the fake video."

983
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,850
She's a psycho.

984
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,520
Go around the block.
Take the back entrance.

985
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,580
Yes, sir.

986
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:14,890
Silla Brewery's Dokgo Tak...

987
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:17,590
should apologize to the public!

988
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,700
The man who orchestrated
the fake whistle-blowing...

989
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:22,830
should be repatriated immediately!

990
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:26,100
Silla Brewery's Dokgo Tak...

991
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:28,900
should bite his own tongue
to show his remorse!

992
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:31,610
This evil company
faked a video to kill a competitor!

993
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:34,310
Silla Brewery should be ousted!

994
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:38,280
What the heck?

995
00:59:39,110 --> 00:59:40,920
That mad woman...

996
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,550
has some serious guts.

997
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,220
She's a total nutcase.

998
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,420
My gosh.

999
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,530
How did someone like that
end up at Eagle Brewery?

1000
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:52,630
Goodness.

1001
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:58,430
Silla Brewery's Dokgo Tak...

1002
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,240
should apologize to the public!

1003
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,170
- The man who orchestrated...
- Sir.

1004
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:05,740
- We've arrived?
- the fake whistle-blowing...

1005
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,310
- should be repatriated immediately!
- Look to your right.

1006
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,850
This evil company
faked a video to kill a competitor.

1007
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,610
Silla Brewery should be ousted.

1008
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:17,250
- Silla Brewery's Dokgo Tak...
- Who is that?

1009
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,250
- should bite his own tongue!
- It's CEO Ma.

1010
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,260
Yes, it seems so.

1011
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,620
Silla Brewery's Dokgo Tak...

1012
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,990
should apologize to the public!

1013
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:29,260
- The man who orchestrated...
- What's she doing now?

1014
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:31,400
the fake whistle-blowing
should be repatriated immediately!

1015
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:34,670
Silla Brewery's Dokgo Tak...

1016
01:00:34,670 --> 01:00:37,070
should bite his own tongue
to show his remorse!

1017
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:39,910
Silla Brewery's Dokgo Tak...

1018
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:42,310
should apologize to the public.

1019
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:45,110
Silla Brewery's Dokgo Tak...

1020
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:47,850
should bite his own tongue
to show his remorse!

1021
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,520
What...

1022
01:00:56,290 --> 01:00:57,390
Chairman Han.

1023
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:59,790
What are you doing here all alone?
You should know better.

1024
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:02,730
Ignore me and go on your way.

1025
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,670
I'm blinded with fury.

1026
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,830
Silla Brewery...

1027
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:09,070
That's enough. Let's...

1028
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,110
I just got here.

1029
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,040
I'm just getting started.

1030
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,940
I'll make Dokgo Tak
apologize to you.

1031
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:18,380
So stop doing this.

1032
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:21,920
You'll do that?

1033
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:23,720
Yes.

1034
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:26,550
I'll get him to apologize to you,
so please stop this.

1035
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:29,860
Why?

1036
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:34,600
Because...

1037
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,730
I don't want people to mock you.

1038
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,040
Why?

1039
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,840
What man would like...

1040
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:47,740
someone he cares about
being stared at?

1041
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:54,120
Someone you care about?

1042
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,250
Who's that?

1043
01:02:03,160 --> 01:02:04,260
Me?

1044
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:07,100
Yes, you.

1045
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:11,800
Wait.

1046
01:02:12,830 --> 01:02:15,700
You don't mean...

1047
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:22,210
It really makes no sense at all,

1048
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:24,910
but do you...

1049
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:26,950
have...

1050
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,480
feelings for me?

1051
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,020
It's stupid, isn't it?

1052
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,430
I must've briefly lost my mind.

1053
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:41,630
Sorry. Pretend you didn't hear me.

1054
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:44,100
You're right.

1055
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:49,700
I'm right?

1056
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:53,210
Yes, you're right.

1057
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,150
I have feelings for you.

1058
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:02,620
What?

1059
01:03:48,730 --> 01:03:51,230
(For Eagle Brothers)

1060
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:52,730
What on earth did I just hear?

1061
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:54,270
I shouldn't have asked.

1062
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,670
That's enough. Stop.

1063
01:03:56,700 --> 01:03:59,510
If I hear any more,
things might get weird.

1064
01:03:59,810 --> 01:04:01,680
The women at Golden Castle...

1065
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,210
will brag to no end.

1066
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:07,250
Mr. Go. Are you free this Saturday?

1067
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,450
I can't reach the store owner.

1068
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:10,820
Have you heard from her?

1069
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:12,950
Do as Chairman Han says,
whatever the cost.

1070
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,560
Don't you want to marry Se Ri off?

1071
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:15,990
If Se Ri's marriage falls through,

1072
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:17,860
I'll divorce you, and that's final!
