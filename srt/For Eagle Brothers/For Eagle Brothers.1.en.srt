Just try to impress the chairman.

183
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,130
Why won't you answer?

184
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,110
Okay.

185
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,850
We don't want to be late. Let's hurry.

186
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,390
Yes.

187
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,060
Hey, Se Ri.

188
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,240
Have you been well?

189
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,630
Long time no see, Bom.

190
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,270
Thank you for remembering to stop by.

191
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,930
How could I forget your mom's remembrance day?

192
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,260
You and Se Ri have been like twins since kindergarten days.

193
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,140
Gyeol isn't here yet, is he?

194
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,850
No. He'll arrive when the memorial service starts.

195
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,890
It's not easy traveling from Jinhae.

196
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,100
How about the food preparation?

197
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,600
I'm almost done.

198
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,320
You cook and handle family events so easily.

199
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,170
How come you're so mature?

200
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:57,960
My Se Ri doesn't know how to do anything.

201
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:02,390
Aunt* does everything. All I do is help.
(A title for housekeeper/helper)

202
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,160
Oh, my gosh!

203
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,400
That scared me.

204
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,770
He does nothing but listen to music in his study all day.

205
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:32,590
<i>I'm coming in, Dad.</i>

206
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,400
Dad.

207
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,940
Hello.

208
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,520
Have you been well?

209
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,080
Who are you...

210
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,270
It's Se Ri's mom.

211
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,300
Your face changes a bit whenever I see you.

212
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:00,890
Dad!

213
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,200
He's more of a straight talker than you think.

214
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,450
Gosh.

215
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,010
The violin sounds beautiful.

216
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:19,360
It's not the violin. It's the cello.

217
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm dumb when it comes to classical music...

218
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,860
I mean, I'm ignorant.

219
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,780
Give it to him.

220
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,280
Here you go.

221
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,350
It's the new top-quality cheongju from my husband's company.

222
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,900
I brought it for the memorial service.

223
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,170
You're so generous.

224
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,450
Thank you, Mother.

225
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:48,380
Come on. You don't have to thank me for it.

226
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,270
We're no strangers.

227
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:54,630
My wife never drank cheongju.

228
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,940
She only drank a bit of the Almaviva wine.

229
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,080
Oh, Alibaba?

230
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,090
It's not Alibaba.

231
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,400
It's Almaviva. It's a red wine.

232
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,640
Dad.

233
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,210
Oh, a red wine.

234
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:20,040
She used to drink a glass of Almaviva even when she was sick.

235
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,090
She said it warms her hands and feet and helps her sleep.

236
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:29,180
That's why we use Almaviva for the memorial service every year.

237
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:35,120
I've never seen anyone using wine for a memorial service.

238
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,170
It's American style.

239
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,250
Or is it French style?

240
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,950
Mom.

241
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,600
We'll drink it together after the memorial service.

242
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,790
Thank you, Mother.

243
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:50,590
Sure. You do that.

244
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,680
Here. Hold me.

245
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,120
Be careful.

246
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,440
You should give up on high heels now.

247
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,790
Giving up on high heels means giving up on being a woman.

248
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,600
You think you're a woman?

249
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,860
What am I, a man?

250
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,530
<i>Ms. Gong!</i>

251
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:29,020
Oh, hello!

252
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:36,430
I haven't seen you on the field. You must've had an outing.

253
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,580
Yes. We went shopping for my daughter's wedding dress.

254
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,010
This is my daughter.

255
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,390
Hello.

256
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:44,560
This is my son-in-law.

257
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,570
My mother-in-law is in your care.

258
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:49,130
No, we're in her care.

259
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:54,510
Ms. Gong is like oxygen to the Golden Castle.

260
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,830
I think the wedding dress would look great on you, too, Ms. Gong.

261
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,510
Then...

262
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,100
if I wore the wedding dress, would you lock arms with me?

263
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,810
N-No. Hold on.

264
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:13,090
I'm still well and alive. Why would Dr. Lee lock arms with you?

265
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,060
Stay out of this, Dr. Kim.

266
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,750
Ms. Gong made a move on me just now.

267
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:20,730
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!

268
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,650
Don't jump the gun.

269
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:27,790
Ms. Gong and I have been soulmates for a long time.

270
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,670
- What are you talking about?
- Okay, stop fighting.

271
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,470
Do rock, paper, scissors instead.

272
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:35,020
<i>Rock, paper, scissors?</i>

273
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,070
Okay. Rock, paper, scissors!

274
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,580
Rock, paper, scissors!

275
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,530
Rock, paper, scissors!

276
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,520
Rock, paper, scissors!

277
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,350
- Rock, paper, scissors!
- Again, again, again!

278
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,950
When we get married,

279
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,740
how about we live with Mother?

280
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,660
You want to live with Mom?

281
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,070
I know it's a nice retirement community.

282
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:02,820
But she must feel lonely alone.

283
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,620
How could you say that after what we just saw?

284
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:08,880
Don't suggest that even in your dreams.

285
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,730
Being apart lets us maintain the relationship.

286
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,840
Hey, Cheon Soo.

287
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,460
<i>Are you on your way, Hyungnim?</i>

288
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,070
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

289
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,230
Is everyone there?

290
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,770
<i>Yes. We're just waiting for the youngest.</i>

291
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,030
<i>He's almost here.</i>

292
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,360
Okay, see you later.

293
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,610
Is Cheon Soo the second oldest?

294
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,440
The one who's in finance?

295
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,940
Yes.

296
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,430
<i>He's the investment team leader at Hanseong Finance's Gangnam branch.</i>

297
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,070
This is what I think.

298
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,560
Everyone,

299
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,970
I recommend buying it. It's a must-buy.
[Oh Cheon Soo, Investment Team Leader of Hanseong Finance]

300
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,950
<i>I don't know much about that field,</i>

301
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,410
<i>but he's on TV often.</i>

302
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,400
<i>Anyway, I guess he's really successful.</i>

303
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,460
Trust me and buy it.

304
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,040
I'm getting money from my time deposit next month.

305
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,750
I should let Cheon Soo handle it.

306
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:04,450
The third one is Oh Heung Soo.

307
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:06,710
He's a choreography director at an entertainment company.

308
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:10,750
He does choreography for famous idol groups.

309
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,250
Wow, daebak.

310
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:22,810
<i>Anyway, he's been different since he was young.</i>

311
00:20:22,810 --> 00:20:26,420
<i>He likes dancing more than eating or sleeping.</i>

312
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:30,150
He danced in front of the brewery whenever he had a chance.

313
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,910
K-pop is all the rage these days.

314
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,920
<i>I was worried he wouldn't be able to make a living.</i>

315
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,930
<i>But it's a relief.</i>

316
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,710
We won't be seeing the third oldest today, right?

317
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:49,760
The American Economic Association announces the award recipient of 2024.

318
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,890
The Best Thesis Award in Applied Economics. Beom Soo Oh.

319
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,830
You'll meet Beom Soo on the wedding day.

320
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:00,150
He got his master's and Ph.D. at Stanford.

321
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,530
He was hired as a professor at Hanguk University. So, he'll return to Korea.

322
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,700
Wow, he's a super, ultra-elite.

323
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,210
<i>He's been called a genius since he was young.</i>

324
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,630
<i>He was at the top of his class in Finance and Economics while at Seoul University.</i>

325
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:17,470
<i>He's getting an award for his thesis now.</i>

326
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,140
<i>Anyway, he's nothing like me.</i>

327
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,000
<i>In the family portrait,</i>

328
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,330
<i>the youngest did look totally different.</i>

329
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:30,200
He doesn't resemble you at all.

330
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:34,670
<i>The youngest is the biggest catch of them all.</i>

331
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:38,510
<i>He's got the body and the face, they say.</i>

332
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,470
<i>He's a member of the Navy Special Warfare Flotilla.</i>

333
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:44,160
<i>He's determined, warmhearted, and kind.</i>

334
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,970
<i>He'll treat you like a real sister.</i>

335
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,750
[Eagle Brewery]
My husband raised good brothers.

336
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,860
I did nothing.

337
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,180
They took good care of themselves.

338
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:03,200
You said you paid for their tuition and living expenses.

339
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,600
I rarely paid the tuition because they got scholarships.

340
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,930
They earned most of their living expenses through part-time jobs.

341
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:14,350
Since they had a brother who only knew how to make makgeolli,

342
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,780
they had to struggle a lot.

343
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,150
How could you be so proper?

344
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,320
I just love you so much.

345
00:22:37,626 --> 00:22:39,306
What?

346
00:22:39,306 --> 00:22:41,606
Gosh, you smell like an old bachelor.

347
00:22:43,306 --> 00:22:45,076
Even a successful finance professional

348
00:22:45,076 --> 00:22:48,326
can't hide he's been away from his family for 10 years.

349
00:22:49,296 --> 00:22:51,986
What are you wearing, then?

350
00:22:51,986 --> 00:22:54,466
We're meeting our sister-in-law for the first time.

351
00:22:54,466 --> 00:22:56,306
Couldn't you dress properly?

352
00:22:56,306 --> 00:22:58,996
People call you a geezer if you say stuff like that.

353
00:22:58,996 --> 00:23:01,166
It's hip-hop. Hip-hop.

354
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:03,836
- Hey.
- The youngest is here.

355
00:23:03,836 --> 00:23:07,306
Over here! Hey!

356
00:23:07,306 --> 00:23:10,476
Wow, you got even bigger than the last time.

357
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:12,036
Look at this.

358
00:23:12,916 --> 00:23:14,026
Have a seat.

359
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:16,556
Wow, you look even younger.

360
00:23:16,556 --> 00:23:19,516
I'm an artist, you know.

361
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:23,956
It looks like the youngest is having a blind date.

362
00:23:23,956 --> 00:23:26,826
I dressed up since I'm meeting the sister-in-law for the first time.

363
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:30,496
Yes. Good job. You look nice.

364
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:32,386
Anyway,

365
00:23:34,236 --> 00:23:40,346
who captured the heart of our oldest brother who's makgeolli obsessed?

366
00:23:41,776 --> 00:23:44,896
To be honest, I couldn't sleep last night.

367
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:47,986
I can't wait.

368
00:24:04,766 --> 00:24:06,676
She's so freaking pretty.

369
00:24:06,676 --> 00:24:07,976
Watch your language.

370
00:24:07,976 --> 00:24:10,216
You geezer. Seriously.

371
00:24:13,226 --> 00:24:15,276
They're my brothers.

372
00:24:15,276 --> 00:24:18,186
This is the second oldest, Cheon Soo.

373
00:24:18,186 --> 00:24:20,356
This is the third oldest, Heung Soo.

374
00:24:22,056 --> 00:24:24,376
This is the youngest, Kang Soo.

375
00:24:24,376 --> 00:24:27,556
I'm Ma Kwang Sook. I'm in your care.

376
00:24:27,556 --> 00:24:30,356
- Yes.
- No, we're in your care.

377
00:24:30,356 --> 00:24:33,766
And speak to us casually, Sister-in-law.

378
00:24:33,766 --> 00:24:35,446
Should I, then?

379
00:24:38,396 --> 00:24:40,746
Maybe, but...

380
00:24:40,746 --> 00:24:43,906
I'll do it once we get to know each other better.

381
00:24:45,356 --> 00:24:48,626
Wow, our sister-in-law is funny.

382
00:24:50,826 --> 00:24:53,076
Have a seat.

383
00:24:53,076 --> 00:24:54,726
Thank you.

384
00:24:55,906 --> 00:24:57,516
Sit.

385
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:13,616
Three sets of eyes are looking at me at once.

386
00:25:13,616 --> 00:25:16,546
I feel like a burning sweet potato.

387
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:20,416
Come on. You can't stare at her like that.

388
00:25:21,316 --> 00:25:24,486
- I'm sorry.
- Come on...

389
00:25:24,486 --> 00:25:26,186
This must be my only chance...

390
00:25:26,186 --> 00:25:31,156
to be looked at by handsome men like you.

391
00:25:32,806 --> 00:25:35,116
Look at me all you want.

392
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:47,766
<i>Let me pour you some.</i>

393
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:52,076
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

394
00:25:53,656 --> 00:25:56,206
No, I need to drive.

395
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:01,766
I hope we get along well from now on.

396
00:26:01,766 --> 00:26:03,786
Let's drink.

397
00:26:03,786 --> 00:26:06,396
Okay, then. I'll start off with a chant.

398
00:26:06,396 --> 00:26:09,916
For our sister-in-law and the Five Eagle Brothers!

399
00:26:09,916 --> 00:26:12,696
<i>Cheers!</i>

400
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:24,236
How much liquor can you handle?

401
00:26:24,236 --> 00:26:26,336
How much liquor?

402
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:30,316
Well, I'm not so sure, either.

403
00:26:30,316 --> 00:26:32,986
You'll make the perfect matriarch of the Eagle Brewery.

404
00:26:32,986 --> 00:26:36,386
Thank you for the acknowledgment.

405
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,146
Have some.

406
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:41,126
Wow.

407
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,566
Hyung,

408
00:26:44,566 --> 00:26:46,226
you look happy.

409
00:26:53,476 --> 00:26:56,526
So, you're getting married in three months since you met.

410
00:26:56,526 --> 00:27:00,056
What made you fully accelerate like that?

411
00:27:01,026 --> 00:27:03,226
You answer, Kwang Sook.

412
00:27:05,426 --> 00:27:08,706
Every Wednesday at four,

413
00:27:08,706 --> 00:27:10,876
without missing a week,

414
00:27:10,876 --> 00:27:15,396
he came to the post office to mail a letter.

415
00:27:33,996 --> 00:27:35,616
Thank you.

416
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:40,956
<i>No one writes a letter in this day and age.</i>

417
00:27:40,956 --> 00:27:43,406
<i>I thought he was strange.</i>

418
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:47,566
<i>I noticed the names on the letters.</i>

419
00:27:47,566 --> 00:27:49,836
<i>Oh Cheon Soo. Oh Heung Soo.</i>

420
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:52,826
<i>Oh Beom Soo. Oh Kang Soo.</i>

421
00:27:52,826 --> 00:27:56,066
<i>The names were similar. I thought they might be brothers.</i>

422
00:27:56,066 --> 00:27:58,696
<i>So, I asked him.</i>

423
00:27:58,696 --> 00:28:00,726
Looks like you're writing your brothers.

424
00:28:00,726 --> 00:28:04,056
Yes. My younger brothers live far away.

425
00:28:04,056 --> 00:28:07,096
People don't write letters these days.

426
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:09,216
Don't you know how to use a computer?

427
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:13,426
They're working hard away from home.

428
00:28:13,426 --> 00:28:16,906
I wrote them as if I were praying, hoping they were well.

429
00:28:16,906 --> 00:28:19,116
I had to put effort into them.

430
00:28:20,246 --> 00:28:24,566
<i>A man like him still exists on this planet?</i>

431
00:28:24,566 --> 00:28:27,136
<i>I was totally moved.</i>

432
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:29,526
Hello, sir.

433
00:28:29,526 --> 00:28:31,676
Hey, welcome.

434
00:28:32,636 --> 00:28:35,056
Put it there. Yes.

435
00:28:36,746 --> 00:28:38,246
How much?

436
00:28:44,776 --> 00:28:46,326
Oh, okay.

437
00:28:47,336 --> 00:28:49,186
- Thank you.
- Sure.

438
00:28:56,126 --> 00:28:57,646
Bye!

439
00:29:31,196 --> 00:29:33,326
Are you okay?

440
00:29:33,326 --> 00:29:34,986
Dad.

441
00:29:34,986 --> 00:29:38,836
I miss my dad.

442
00:29:38,836 --> 00:29:41,526
I miss my dad.

443
00:29:41,526 --> 00:29:44,826
I miss my dad.

444
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:47,336
<i>The day my mom moved into a retirement home,</i>

445
00:29:47,336 --> 00:29:51,636
<i>I drank out of loneliness and passed out drunk.</i>

446
00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:55,476
<i>But Jang Soo showed up and saved me.</i>

447
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:16,816
<i>Wow.</i>

448
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:19,446
A collaboration between the letters and makgeolli.

449
00:30:19,446 --> 00:30:22,486
What a refreshing love story.

450
00:30:22,486 --> 00:30:25,936
Just hearing about it warms my heart, Sister-in-law.

451
00:30:25,936 --> 00:30:29,296
Sister-in-law and Hyung, remain seated.

452
00:30:29,296 --> 00:30:31,726
We're all getting up.

453
00:30:31,726 --> 00:30:32,856
Why?

454
00:30:32,856 --> 00:30:34,026
What are we doing?

455
00:30:34,026 --> 00:30:36,086
Attention.

456
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:37,876
Salute the sister-in-law.

457
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:39,226
Salute.

458
00:30:39,226 --> 00:30:40,616
Salute.

459
00:30:40,616 --> 00:30:42,516
Salute.

460
00:30:42,516 --> 00:30:44,766
You took in our oldest brother.

461
00:30:44,766 --> 00:30:48,216
You're our forever captain from now on.

462
00:30:54,406 --> 00:30:56,406
Salute!

463
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,376
Have you been in the military?

464
00:31:02,236 --> 00:31:04,096
Is this right?

465
00:31:11,456 --> 00:31:14,196
I had fun meeting you today.

466
00:31:14,196 --> 00:31:17,246
Let's see each other often,

467
00:31:17,246 --> 00:31:19,196
brothers-in-law.

468
00:31:20,906 --> 00:31:22,286
Yes.

469
00:31:22,286 --> 00:31:25,036
Get home safely, Sister-in-law.

470
00:31:25,036 --> 00:31:30,126
Hold him tight enough to break his rib cage.

471
00:31:30,126 --> 00:31:33,416
I'm sure they're fractured already.

472
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:39,196
We'll stay up all night saying goodbye.

473
00:31:39,196 --> 00:31:41,546
Let's get going now.

474
00:31:41,546 --> 00:31:43,036
We'll go, then.

475
00:31:43,036 --> 00:31:44,696
See you later.

476
00:31:50,876 --> 00:31:52,916
- Take care.
- Take care.

477
00:31:53,806 --> 00:31:55,526
Drive safely!

478
00:31:56,356 --> 00:31:59,646
She looks kind and easygoing.

479
00:31:59,646 --> 00:32:02,686
Yes, I'm finally relieved.

480
00:32:04,126 --> 00:32:06,866
We're in a good mood. Let's go for a second round.

481
00:32:06,866 --> 00:32:09,816
It's a historic day. Don't say no.

482
00:32:09,816 --> 00:32:12,266
It's my treat.

483
00:32:15,826 --> 00:32:17,206
Cheers.

484
00:32:18,286 --> 00:32:21,156
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

485
00:32:34,296 --> 00:32:38,956
Anyway, shouldn't we combine forces for his wedding?

486
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:42,076
Of course. We should.

487
00:32:45,226 --> 00:32:49,006
You're the money expert. Why do you look sad?

488
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:54,506
I have been sending more money to the US since my child is growing up.

489
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:57,036
I haven't been able to save much.

490
00:32:58,116 --> 00:33:02,716
I lost a lot when the market crashed last year, too.

491
00:33:02,716 --> 00:33:05,266
Did a monkey fall off a tree?

492
00:33:05,266 --> 00:33:08,036
Why would you make a mistake like that?

493
00:33:12,506 --> 00:33:16,096
This isn't much. I hope it helps.

494
00:33:16,096 --> 00:33:18,106
This is full of Shin Saimdang*.
(The figure on the 50,000 won bill)

495
00:33:18,106 --> 00:33:20,636
- Really?
- It's not much.

496
00:33:20,636 --> 00:33:22,946
You were secretly rich.

497
00:33:22,946 --> 00:33:25,406
Hyung, our youngest, is the richest.

498
00:33:25,406 --> 00:33:26,776
You're right.

499
00:33:26,776 --> 00:33:28,536
Why are you doing this now, Cheon Soo?

500
00:33:28,536 --> 00:33:31,566
It's because we're proud of you.

501
00:33:31,566 --> 00:33:32,716
Hey, hey. Let's stop.

502
00:33:32,716 --> 00:33:34,996
- You creep me out!
- That's enough.

503
00:33:34,996 --> 00:33:36,306
Let me kiss you on the cheek.

504
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:37,436
Hey, that's enough.

505
00:33:37,436 --> 00:33:40,586
I didn't get to grow tall because I carried you as a baby.

506
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:42,456
That's enough!

507
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,646
Thank you for today...

508
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:52,326
for getting along well with my brothers.

509
00:33:52,326 --> 00:33:54,626
What do you mean, your brothers?

510
00:33:54,626 --> 00:33:57,376
They're my brothers, too, now.

511
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:10,346
I'm grateful and relieved that you said that.

512
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:13,036
Gosh.

513
00:34:13,036 --> 00:34:16,396
You're so sensitive for a big man.

514
00:34:19,726 --> 00:34:22,136
Because our mother passed early,

515
00:34:22,136 --> 00:34:26,046
they didn't get enough love. I feel bad for them.

516
00:34:26,046 --> 00:34:28,906
Yes, yes. Don't worry.

517
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:33,406
This sister-in-law will fill your late mother's empty spot now.

518
00:34:33,406 --> 00:34:35,146
Just wait and see.

519
00:34:37,206 --> 00:34:39,736
What can I do?

520
00:34:40,766 --> 00:34:44,876
I'm so appreciative of how sweet you are.

521
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:48,636
I don't know how to return the favor.

522
00:34:49,526 --> 00:34:52,656
Didn't you hear Heung Soo earlier?

523
00:34:52,656 --> 00:34:57,516
He told me to love you hard so your rib cage cracks.

524
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:06,286
Come on. You're blushing again.

525
00:35:07,346 --> 00:35:12,276
I suppose I fell in love with that side of you.

526
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,906
Let's get going.

527
00:35:13,906 --> 00:35:15,236
You go in first, Kwang Sook.

528
00:35:15,236 --> 00:35:17,536
It's okay. You should leave first.

529
00:35:17,536 --> 00:35:19,136
I want to see you go in first.

530
00:35:19,136 --> 00:35:22,056
No, I want to see you off. Get going.

531
00:35:22,056 --> 00:35:24,066
I'll see the light in your room turn on and go.

532
00:35:24,066 --> 00:35:26,706
That'd make me feel better.

533
00:35:28,686 --> 00:35:30,986
All right.

534
00:35:30,986 --> 00:35:34,056
- Drive safely.
- Okay.

535
00:35:39,016 --> 00:35:40,806
Kwang Sook.

536
00:36:30,876 --> 00:36:35,176
[Eagle Brewery]

537
00:36:42,626 --> 00:36:45,756
You worked hard all day. I'm sorry.

538
00:36:45,756 --> 00:36:47,456
What are you sorry for?

539
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:52,846
I feel like I'm escaping from living single by myself.

540
00:36:52,846 --> 00:36:54,766
I feel guilty toward you.

541
00:36:54,766 --> 00:36:57,526
Why would you say that?

542
00:36:57,526 --> 00:37:01,196
I'll ask Kwang Sook and get you a female worker

543
00:37:01,196 --> 00:37:04,776
from the post office, who'd be a good match for you.

544
00:37:04,776 --> 00:37:09,466
Gosh, don't be silly. Just focus on your wedding prep.

545
00:37:12,586 --> 00:37:15,596
Gosh, it smells amazing.

546
00:37:15,596 --> 00:37:18,276
It can be strained in a couple of days.

547
00:37:20,796 --> 00:37:23,516
I need to get going. I need to stretch my back.

548
00:37:23,516 --> 00:37:25,466
Okay. Rest well.

549
00:37:25,466 --> 00:37:27,286
Okay.

550
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:33,616
Okay.

551
00:37:44,056 --> 00:37:45,886
How nice.

552
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,966
Yes, that's the taste.

553
00:38:00,276 --> 00:38:05,366
What kind of woman only knows how to spend money?

554
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,296
You don't even make a single penny.

555
00:38:07,296 --> 00:38:09,566
How could you be this shameless?

556
00:38:09,566 --> 00:38:12,946
You spend millions of won like it's nothing.

557
00:38:12,946 --> 00:38:16,106
I told you. Today was Bom's mom's remembrance day.

558
00:38:16,106 --> 00:38:20,316
I don't care if it was her great-grandpa's remembrance day.

559
00:38:21,376 --> 00:38:23,026
Come on, Honey.

560
00:38:23,026 --> 00:38:27,236
Why would I spend money on Bom's great-grandpa, whom I've never met?

561
00:38:27,236 --> 00:38:29,886
Don't talk back at me after what you did.

562
00:38:30,846 --> 00:38:33,656
Do you want to act like a chaebol now that we can finally afford things?

563
00:38:33,656 --> 00:38:35,416
That's so wrong!

564
00:38:35,416 --> 00:38:37,546
No chaebol lives like me.

565
00:38:37,546 --> 00:38:41,416
They don't use their husbands' cards with a 500,000 daily limit.

566
00:38:41,416 --> 00:38:42,836
What?

567
00:38:43,806 --> 00:38:47,606
You once were an accountant.

568
00:38:47,606 --> 00:38:51,016
Why are you so bad with money? Huh?

569
00:38:51,986 --> 00:38:55,126
Bringing up the past won't do either of us good.

570
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:57,956
I have a lot to say, too.

571
00:38:57,956 --> 00:39:03,446
If it wasn't for me, you'd still be stirring makgeolli at the Eagle Brewery now.

572
00:39:03,446 --> 00:39:08,816
If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have become Chairman Dokgo Tak of Silla Brewery.

573
00:39:08,816 --> 00:39:11,776
Are you patting yourself on the back?

574
00:39:11,776 --> 00:39:16,076
No, I'm not. I'm fact-checking, as they say.

575
00:39:16,076 --> 00:39:17,886
So, don't mess with me.

576
00:39:17,886 --> 00:39:21,286
I'll live the way I want.

577
00:39:21,286 --> 00:39:22,866
I'm not done talking yet.

578
00:39:22,866 --> 00:39:24,846
But I am!

579
00:39:25,966 --> 00:39:28,916
What a temper. Seriously.

580
00:39:42,316 --> 00:39:44,116
Mom,

581
00:39:44,116 --> 00:39:46,616
did Dad scold you a lot?

582
00:39:46,616 --> 00:39:50,166
I only spent some money on Bom's mom's remembrance day.

583
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:52,306
How annoying.

584
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:55,706
By the way, does her dad look down on me?

585
00:39:55,706 --> 00:39:58,166
Why is he so prickly about everything?

586
00:39:58,166 --> 00:40:02,296
His nickname is Prince Hedgehog, apparently.

587
00:40:02,296 --> 00:40:04,536
His words have needles on them.

588
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:07,086
They poke at me all the time.

589
00:40:10,696 --> 00:40:14,086
"My wife never drank cheongju.

590
00:40:14,086 --> 00:40:18,096
She only drank a bit of the Alibaba wine."

591
00:40:18,096 --> 00:40:20,836
It's Almaviva, not Alibaba.

592
00:40:20,836 --> 00:40:23,706
Was he looking down on me in my face or what?

593
00:40:23,706 --> 00:40:27,126
He acts classy, superior, and prestigious.

594
00:40:27,126 --> 00:40:32,536
I've never seen a family who uses red wine for a memorial service.

595
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:35,136
It's Gyeol.

596
00:40:35,136 --> 00:40:38,326
My gosh. He must be home now.

597
00:40:38,326 --> 00:40:40,846
Be as sweet and lovely as possible.

598
00:40:40,846 --> 00:40:42,846
Do-re-mi-fa-sol.

599
00:40:42,846 --> 00:40:44,616
Oppa.

600
00:40:44,616 --> 00:40:47,536
Do-re-mi-fa-sol.

601
00:40:49,686 --> 00:40:51,686
Yes, Oppa.

602
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:55,256
I heard you were here earlier today.

603
00:40:55,256 --> 00:40:58,216
Thank you. Say hello to your mother for me.

604
00:40:58,216 --> 00:41:01,426
Don't thank me. It was nothing.

605
00:41:02,266 --> 00:41:03,786
You must be tired from studying.

606
00:41:03,786 --> 00:41:06,206
Studying is nothing new to me.

607
00:41:06,206 --> 00:41:10,336
But you live in Jinhae alone, away from your family.

608
00:41:10,336 --> 00:41:12,526
You must be tired.

609
00:41:12,526 --> 00:41:16,276
You should come over when you get a chance.

610
00:41:20,006 --> 00:41:22,266
Yes, Oppa. I will.

611
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:26,056
Okay. Have a nice memorial service.

612
00:41:27,556 --> 00:41:30,766
- What did he say? Did he invite you to Jinhae?
- Yes.

613
00:41:30,766 --> 00:41:32,576
Of course. He's a man, too.

614
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:36,746
He acts superior, but he's hopeless in front of my baby.

615
00:41:37,716 --> 00:41:39,006
Are you sure I can go?

616
00:41:39,006 --> 00:41:41,266
He said to come. Why wouldn't you?

617
00:41:41,266 --> 00:41:45,226
Go get something tasty and enjoy the scenery.

618
00:41:45,226 --> 00:41:48,566
You should stay overnight.

619
00:41:48,566 --> 00:41:50,116
Overnight?

620
00:41:50,116 --> 00:41:55,926
Relationships turn cold if they stay lukewarm.

621
00:41:55,926 --> 00:42:00,836
Sprinkle a bit of seasoning while things are heating up.

622
00:42:00,836 --> 00:42:03,196
Seasoning?

623
00:42:03,196 --> 00:42:05,256
Gosh.

624
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:10,976
Your only flaw is that you're too pure and innocent.

625
00:42:10,976 --> 00:42:16,986
You need a bit of MSG to move a relationship along.

626
00:42:21,176 --> 00:42:22,856
- Are you crazy?
- Geez!

627
00:42:22,856 --> 00:42:24,926
Dad.

628
00:42:24,926 --> 00:42:28,946
What is this woman telling a child right now?

629
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,206
Se Ri isn't lacking at all.

630
00:42:31,206 --> 00:42:34,066
Why are you so eager to get rid of our only daughter?

631
00:42:34,066 --> 00:42:37,206
I'm not eager to get rid of her. I'm trying to put her somewhere nice.

632
00:42:37,206 --> 00:42:38,976
Shut your mouth!

633
00:42:59,106 --> 00:43:03,746
<i>I'm getting old alone without you.</i>

634
00:43:03,746 --> 00:43:07,516
<i>Do you know how horrible that is, Honey?</i>

635
00:43:07,516 --> 00:43:09,726
You should take a bow, too.

636
00:43:34,606 --> 00:43:37,096
<i>Life is getting boring...</i>

637
00:43:37,096 --> 00:43:39,736
<i>and I get irritated over nothing.</i>

638
00:43:39,736 --> 00:43:44,406
<i>It feels like my blood is turning cold.</i>

639
00:43:48,366 --> 00:43:50,326
<i>I miss you, Honey.</i>

640
00:43:55,396 --> 00:43:57,386
Is work managable?

641
00:43:57,386 --> 00:43:59,476
The senior army surgeons get to have all the fun.

642
00:43:59,476 --> 00:44:05,386
They say you should marry while in the army to enjoy married life.

643
00:44:05,386 --> 00:44:07,366
Do you have someone you like?

644
00:44:07,366 --> 00:44:11,816
Don't worry about me. Find yourself a girlfriend first.

645
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,396
Your mom would be sad to hear that.

646
00:44:15,546 --> 00:44:18,046
I'm sure she'd be happy, too.

647
00:44:21,636 --> 00:44:26,716
Mom must be upset that you're living lonely.

648
00:44:28,786 --> 00:44:30,446
It's from Se Ri's dad's company.

649
00:44:30,446 --> 00:44:33,966
Her mom brought it for the memorial service.

650
00:44:39,116 --> 00:44:40,746
Try some.

651
00:44:49,496 --> 00:44:51,206
What do you think?

652
00:44:53,026 --> 00:44:56,286
It's not deep. It's shallow.

653
00:45:01,979 --> 00:45:03,579
[Post Office]
<i>What's this?</i>

654
00:45:04,669 --> 00:45:07,109
[Oh Jang Soo and Ma Kwang Sook]

655
00:45:09,299 --> 00:45:11,399
I didn't think this day would come.

656
00:45:11,399 --> 00:45:15,349
Our Chief Ma is finally getting married.

657
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:17,529
I'm so moved.

658
00:45:17,529 --> 00:45:19,749
I know, Director.

659
00:45:19,749 --> 00:45:24,369
Chief Ma hit a grand slam in the end.

660
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:26,919
I noticed when he was beating up the robber

661
00:45:26,919 --> 00:45:31,169
that he's not like any other man.

662
00:45:31,169 --> 00:45:35,309
I don't want to brag or anything, but...

663
00:45:35,309 --> 00:45:37,539
he's amazingly strong.

664
00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:39,669
Gosh!

665
00:45:39,669 --> 00:45:42,299
How many babies are you planning to have?

666
00:45:42,299 --> 00:45:44,859
I can have many maternity breaks, right, Director?

667
00:45:44,859 --> 00:45:46,719
I'll let you have them for 10 years.

668
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:49,529
Try having as many as you can.

669
00:45:50,909 --> 00:45:54,039
The venue is the LX Hotel.

670
00:45:54,039 --> 00:45:56,049
Isn't this a really nice hotel?

671
00:45:56,049 --> 00:46:00,719
My mom's dream is for me to have an outdoor wedding at a luxury hotel.

672
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:05,279
She miraculously made a reservation using all the connections she had.

673
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:08,519
I heard they have amazing food, too.

674
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:13,349
I tried their steak. It melts in your mouth.

675
00:46:13,349 --> 00:46:15,939
So, make sure to come.

676
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,569
- Okay.
- Okay.

677
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:19,839
Are you moving in with your in-laws?

678
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,059
Both of them passed. I only have four brothers-in-law.

679
00:46:23,059 --> 00:46:25,429
The oldest and second oldest live in Seoul.

680
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:26,859
The third oldest in the US.

681
00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:31,019
The youngest is a professional soldier. He's in Jinhae.

682
00:46:34,439 --> 00:46:35,739
<i>How are things these days?</i>

683
00:46:35,739 --> 00:46:37,499
You know better.

684
00:46:37,499 --> 00:46:41,649
Both the stock and bond are bad. It's looking hopeless.

685
00:46:41,649 --> 00:46:44,739
You need to figure it out to meet the quota.

686
00:46:44,739 --> 00:46:47,959
If you hold onto cash, based on the interest rates,

687
00:46:47,959 --> 00:46:51,039
the real estate or bond market will come back.

688
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:54,779
I'm just trying to hang in there.

689
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:57,659
Anyway, how are you these days?

690
00:46:57,659 --> 00:46:58,969
Me?

691
00:46:59,969 --> 00:47:03,919
They say the jobless man dies from overworking.

692
00:47:03,919 --> 00:47:05,579
I've been catching up on reading...

693
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:07,329
and seeing friends I didn't get to see.

694
00:47:07,329 --> 00:47:09,189
I'm pretty busy.

695
00:47:10,069 --> 00:47:13,189
Everyone misses you, Team Leader.

696
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:35,629
What? It's so lame. Seriously.

697
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:42,119
What do you think?

698
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:43,679
Seung Ho.

699
00:47:45,149 --> 00:47:47,409
You're out of touch, Mr. Oh.

700
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:49,549
Let's stop.

701
00:47:49,549 --> 00:47:51,199
The climax starts now.

702
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:53,959
It doesn't matter. It doesn't go with our concept.

703
00:47:53,959 --> 00:47:56,929
It's because it's a brand new concept in K-pop.

704
00:47:56,929 --> 00:47:59,559
I guarantee this will be a hit.

705
00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:01,119
It's a concept no one expected.

706
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:04,649
I know. What's the concept, exactly?

707
00:48:06,149 --> 00:48:09,809
I saw a documentary last week. It's called. "Explore the Wild."

708
00:48:09,809 --> 00:48:12,999
They showed the African tribe leaders in love.

709
00:48:12,999 --> 00:48:15,499
- I took ideas from their dances.
- Whatever.

710
00:48:15,499 --> 00:48:18,909
Teach your Zumba students instead.

711
00:48:18,909 --> 00:48:21,369
Gosh, I don't have time for this.

712
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:23,859
- Watch it until the end, Hyung.
- Let go.

713
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,799
The climax starts now, I said.

714
00:48:25,799 --> 00:48:27,549
Jin Yeong!

715
00:48:29,169 --> 00:48:31,489
Wasn't this pretty good?

716
00:48:31,489 --> 00:48:34,699
- Right?
- Mr. Oh, we have an appointment after this.

717
00:48:34,699 --> 00:48:36,069
Let me teach you just this.

718
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:37,659
- We don't have time. Next time.
- Let's go.

719
00:48:37,659 --> 00:48:39,249
- I'm sorry.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

720
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,859
It's okay.

721
00:48:43,669 --> 00:48:45,619
I'll teach you next time.

722
00:48:47,129 --> 00:48:50,079
<i>Congratulations on winning the Best Paper Award</i>

723
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:52,729
from the American Economics Association.

724
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:57,549
It's been nine years since our university has achieved this honor.

725
00:48:57,549 --> 00:48:59,889
Well done, Dr. Oh.

726
00:49:01,459 --> 00:49:05,879
Thank you, sir. This is truly an honor, and I'm deeply grateful.

727
00:49:05,879 --> 00:49:10,039
I'll work hard to continue bringing pride to our institution.

728
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,419
S-S-Sorry.

729
00:49:28,989 --> 00:49:31,479
Yes, sweetie. Yes, yes.

730
00:49:31,479 --> 00:49:33,109
You must be scared.

731
00:49:33,979 --> 00:49:35,969
Yes, yes.

732
00:49:38,429 --> 00:49:40,829
<i>We are men!</i>

733
00:49:40,829 --> 00:49:43,929
<i>- One, two!
- Men of steel!</i>

734
00:49:43,929 --> 00:49:45,619
<i>One, two!</i>

735
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:47,169
It's the perfect weather for training.

736
00:49:47,169 --> 00:49:50,259
<i>- One, two!
- We are one!</i>

737
00:49:50,259 --> 00:49:52,019
<i>One, two!</i>

738
00:50:13,929 --> 00:50:16,339
We should've planned for a traditional wedding.

739
00:50:16,339 --> 00:50:18,459
I wouldn't have had to worry about losing weight.

740
00:50:18,459 --> 00:50:23,159
I managed to make a reservation through Dr. Hwang from Golden Castle.

741
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:24,899
So, be quiet.

742
00:50:25,759 --> 00:50:28,969
<i>Here's the gift box!</i>

743
00:50:28,969 --> 00:50:31,199
Here's the gift box!

744
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:33,469
Here they are. They're here.

745
00:50:34,399 --> 00:50:37,389
Welcome, Brothers-in-law.

746
00:50:37,389 --> 00:50:41,129
Gosh, you say "Brothers-in-law" so easily.

747
00:50:41,129 --> 00:50:43,199
Hello, Mother.

748
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:44,709
Welcome.

749
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,809
<i>Nice to meet you, In-law.</i>

750
00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:49,569
Yes, nice to meet you.

751
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:53,409
The hanbok suits you so well, Kwang Sook.

752
00:50:53,409 --> 00:50:55,099
You look like a fairy.

753
00:50:56,069 --> 00:50:59,209
Gosh, Hyung. You're a fool in love.

754
00:50:59,209 --> 00:51:00,729
Thank you for coming.

755
00:51:00,729 --> 00:51:02,339
Let's go inside now.

756
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:03,859
Hold on.

757
00:51:08,989 --> 00:51:11,559
Break it at once.

758
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:13,369
That's how you chase the bad luck away.

759
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:15,109
Yes, Mother.

760
00:51:26,009 --> 00:51:29,099
Geez, what a weak groom-to-be.

761
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:31,639
Sister-in-law, reconsider this marriage.

762
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:33,279
Seriously.

763
00:51:33,279 --> 00:51:35,149
Do it again. Again, again.

764
00:51:35,149 --> 00:51:36,939
Aim again.

765
00:51:40,799 --> 00:51:42,799
Aim.

766
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:45,239
Attack the target.

767
00:51:45,239 --> 00:51:46,809
Attack!

768
00:51:53,789 --> 00:51:55,569
That's right.

769
00:51:57,079 --> 00:51:58,349
Come inside now.

770
00:51:58,349 --> 00:52:01,439
Okay. Here comes the gift box.

771
00:52:05,459 --> 00:52:09,779
I'll brief you since I have the best personality.

772
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:15,669
Cheon Soo got a suit for the bride.

773
00:52:16,729 --> 00:52:18,379
Gosh.

774
00:52:20,099 --> 00:52:25,399
This cosmetics set has the top idol in the ad. You know, right?

775
00:52:28,999 --> 00:52:32,109
I got it for you myself.

776
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:33,809
Thank you.

777
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:38,939
And this is from the youngest.

778
00:52:38,939 --> 00:52:41,209
It's the most expensive item here.

779
00:52:41,209 --> 00:52:43,429
Gosh, how pretty.

780
00:52:44,599 --> 00:52:48,789
I wanted to buy a new one since mine was getting old.

781
00:52:50,199 --> 00:52:51,709
It's so pretty.

782
00:52:51,709 --> 00:52:53,389
Thank you, Kang Soo.

783
00:52:53,389 --> 00:52:55,579
I'm glad you like it.

784
00:52:55,579 --> 00:52:59,669
It's not a traditional gift box. It's just a bunch of gifts from the brothers-in-law.

785
00:52:59,669 --> 00:53:02,809
That makes it more meaningful.

786
00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:07,539
I'm so lucky to be marrying into your family.

787
00:53:07,539 --> 00:53:09,829
Thank you, guys.

788
00:53:16,229 --> 00:53:17,829
And...

789
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:25,329
We promised not to exchange jewelry.

790
00:53:25,329 --> 00:53:29,869
My late mother received this from her mother.

791
00:53:31,649 --> 00:53:34,089
My goodness.

792
00:53:34,089 --> 00:53:37,849
Can I accept something so precious?

793
00:53:38,849 --> 00:53:40,259
Here.

794
00:53:55,929 --> 00:53:58,389
My goodness.

795
00:53:58,389 --> 00:54:00,229
This is crazy.

796
00:54:01,069 --> 00:54:03,219
It fits my finger perfectly.

797
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:06,119
Sister-in-law,

798
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:10,859
you're meant to be the daughter-in-law of the Eagle Brewery.

799
00:54:10,859 --> 00:54:13,169
Let's applause for that.

800
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:34,079
She begged me for a younger sibling since she was a kid.

801
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:37,799
She has four brothers-in-law now.

802
00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:39,669
You got your wish.

803
00:54:41,669 --> 00:54:46,539
Let's lose the "in-law" part and be siblings.

804
00:54:46,539 --> 00:54:47,899
Okay?

805
00:54:47,899 --> 00:54:49,149
Okay.

806
00:54:49,149 --> 00:54:51,379
- Okay?
- Well, okay.

807
00:54:51,379 --> 00:54:56,919
Think of me as Noona instead of a sister-in-law from now on.

808
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:59,389
- Noona?
- Why? Don't you like it?

809
00:54:59,389 --> 00:55:01,419
No, no. I like it.

810
00:55:01,419 --> 00:55:07,049
I'll treat you casually like siblings from now on, then.

811
00:55:07,049 --> 00:55:09,879
Gosh, I'm in the best mood.

812
00:55:09,879 --> 00:55:14,449
Today is a historic day. Please sing a song for your brothers,

813
00:55:14,449 --> 00:55:16,249
Noona.

814
00:55:16,249 --> 00:55:18,329
Hey.

815
00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:24,699
Here. Sing! Sing!

816
00:55:24,699 --> 00:55:28,289
Sing! Sing!

817
00:55:28,289 --> 00:55:30,829
<i>Sing! Sing!</i>

818
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:32,379
I never say no.

819
00:55:32,379 --> 00:55:34,889
I'll do it if you ask me to.

820
00:55:36,129 --> 00:55:37,789
Join me, Jang Soo.

821
00:55:37,789 --> 00:55:39,779
Well, I...

822
00:55:39,779 --> 00:55:43,489
<i>Join her! Join her!</i>

823
00:55:45,879 --> 00:55:51,469
♫ <i>In fall, in front of the post office</i> ♫

♫ <i>Like the trees standing tall after the snowstorm from last winter</i> ♫

♫ <i>The flowers willfully survived</i> ♫

839
00:57:33,559 --> 00:57:35,529

Kiss?

00:57:53,899 --> 00:57:56,829
No, no. It's this one.

845
00:58:26,919 --> 00:58:28,369
Hyung, it's Beom Soo.

846
00:58:28,369 --> 00:58:31,369
I just arrived because the flight got delayed.

847
00:58:32,579 --> 00:58:36,029
Yes, I think I'll arrive in time for the wedding.

848
00:58:36,029 --> 00:58:38,599
Okay. See you soon.

849
00:58:45,419 --> 00:58:50,749
[LX Hotel]

850
00:58:52,839 --> 00:58:54,839
Welcome, Chairman.

851
00:59:02,089 --> 00:59:03,809
It's been hectic since it's the weekend.

852
00:59:03,809 --> 00:59:06,079
The wedding hall is fully booked, too.

853
00:59:08,929 --> 00:59:10,649
Hello.

854
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:13,389
Se Ri's mother.

855
00:59:13,389 --> 00:59:16,859
Gosh, you recognized me immediately today.

856
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:20,099
I stopped by the aesthetician for skin care.

857
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:21,999
Okay, then...

858
00:59:27,629 --> 00:59:31,799
Does he have a cast on his neck? How stiff.

859
00:59:42,029 --> 00:59:44,989
You look like a movie star, Hyung.

860
00:59:44,989 --> 00:59:46,429
Movie star, my foot.

861
00:59:46,429 --> 00:59:48,819
I'm sweating because it feels so awkward.

862
00:59:48,819 --> 00:59:51,529
Don't feel awkward. It suits you well.

863
00:59:51,529 --> 00:59:52,989
Hyung!

864
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:54,709
Beom Soo!

865
00:59:56,469 --> 00:59:58,339
Things must be nice in the US.

866
00:59:58,339 --> 01:00:01,499
You look nicer than before.

867
01:00:01,499 --> 01:00:03,429
What's this smell?

868
01:00:03,429 --> 01:00:05,219
The American smell!

869
01:00:05,219 --> 01:00:07,189
What are you doing?

870
01:00:07,189 --> 01:00:10,409
Beom Soo, you worked hard.

871
01:00:10,409 --> 01:00:12,659
I missed you, Hyung.

872
01:00:13,869 --> 01:00:18,309
By the way, Cheon Soo's forehead got bigger than the last time.

873
01:00:18,309 --> 01:00:21,379
Gosh, you're criticizing us already.

874
01:00:21,379 --> 01:00:23,989
All of our foreheads are getting bigger.

875
01:00:25,459 --> 01:00:26,639
Long time no see, Kang Soo.

876
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:28,209
Welcome back.

877
01:00:28,209 --> 01:00:30,699
The Five Eagle Brewery Brothers reunited.

878
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:33,489
This is a historic day.

879
01:00:33,489 --> 01:00:35,139
By the way, where's our sister-in-law?

880
01:00:35,139 --> 01:00:37,119
She's in the bridal room.

881
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:38,509
Let's say hello after the ceremony.

882
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:43,009
- We should greet the guests first.
- Yes.

883
01:00:43,009 --> 01:00:44,739
Shall we?

884
01:01:03,749 --> 01:01:06,529
Jang Soo must be getting married.

885
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:14,969
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

886
01:01:14,969 --> 01:01:17,399
Thank you. Thank you.

887
01:01:17,399 --> 01:01:18,999
- Director.
- Yes.

888
01:01:18,999 --> 01:01:20,979
- Thank you.
- You look great.

889
01:01:20,979 --> 01:01:22,979
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

890
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:26,039
Hello. Thank you.

891
01:01:26,039 --> 01:01:29,309
Kwang Sook is getting married. I can't believe this.

892
01:01:30,369 --> 01:01:32,539
Good to see you.

893
01:01:34,259 --> 01:01:35,959
Looks tasty.

894
01:01:40,969 --> 01:01:43,799
Gosh, I feel alive now.

895
01:01:43,799 --> 01:01:46,659
A person needs to eat.

896
01:01:46,659 --> 01:01:48,719
Ms. Ma.

897
01:01:51,979 --> 01:01:56,829
I was so hungry because I starved all day.

898
01:01:56,829 --> 01:02:00,609
You're the most relaxed bride I've seen.

899
01:02:00,699 --> 01:02:03,099
- Let's go to the ceremony hall.
- Okay.

900
01:02:04,289 --> 01:02:05,639
Let's go.

901
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:08,069
Am I finally getting married?

902
01:02:20,849 --> 01:02:23,289
Gosh, silly me.

903
01:02:23,289 --> 01:02:24,659
I forgot the bouquet.

904
01:02:24,659 --> 01:02:26,549
Just one moment.

905
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:16,389
Since I starved all day yesterday to fit in the dress,

906
01:03:16,389 --> 01:03:18,949
I started seeing stars before me.

907
01:03:18,949 --> 01:03:23,869
I'm refueling so I can walk down the aisle.

908
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:02,309
My groom is so nervous.

909
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:04,989
Maybe you should've taken a calming pill.

910
01:04:05,989 --> 01:04:07,689
I'm okay.

911
01:04:07,689 --> 01:04:09,729
- Suck up your tummy.
- Okay.

912
01:04:09,729 --> 01:04:12,079
- Open your eyes wide.
- Okay.

913
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:14,809
Walk down the aisle confidently.

914
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:19,979
You have me by your side, Jang Soo.

915
01:04:19,979 --> 01:04:21,499
Okay?

916
01:04:22,749 --> 01:04:24,219
Okay.

917
01:04:27,309 --> 01:04:28,829
Wow, what a nice day.

918
01:04:28,829 --> 01:04:31,879
<i>The wedding ceremony for Groom Oh Jang Soo and...</i>

919
01:04:31,879 --> 01:04:36,569
<i>Bride Ma Kwang Sook will start now.</i>

920
01:04:47,919 --> 01:04:49,629
Gosh, hey.

921
01:04:49,629 --> 01:04:51,619
It's the tiger's wedding day.

922
01:04:51,619 --> 01:04:54,449
<i>The groom will walk down the aisle now.</i>

923
01:04:57,099 --> 01:04:59,799
<i>Here comes the groom.</i>

924
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:12,659
Congrats!

925
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:29,609
<i>The bride will walk down the aisle now.</i>

926
01:05:40,739 --> 01:05:43,529
<i>- Congratulations!
- Beautiful!</i>

927
01:05:50,879 --> 01:05:53,349
<i>Here comes the bride.</i>

928
01:06:01,469 --> 01:06:04,329
Gosh, what's going on?

929
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:30,109
What happened to the weather all of a sudden?

930
01:06:33,299 --> 01:06:35,929
What the heck is this?

931
01:06:52,529 --> 01:06:55,539
♫ <i>What is happening right now?</i> ♫

932
01:06:55,539 --> 01:06:58,489
♫ <i>Why is this happening?</i> ♫

933
01:06:58,489 --> 01:07:03,079
♫ <i>I changed overnight</i> ♫

934
01:07:04,469 --> 01:07:10,339
♫ <i>I keep mistaking it as a dream again because of your face</i> ♫

935
01:07:10,339 --> 01:07:12,959
♫ <i>You're the one I've been dreaming of all night</i> ♫

936
01:07:12,959 --> 01:07:15,509
♫ <i>Oh, my Gosh</i> ♫

937
01:07:15,509 --> 01:07:17,579
♫ <i>Because the swaying wind felt nice</i> ♫

938
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,979
[For Eagle Brothers]

939
01:07:20,979 --> 01:07:23,689
<i>Cheated? I'm not that kind of a woman.</i>

940
01:07:23,689 --> 01:07:27,829
<i>Don't even say you'd live with her.</i>

941
01:07:27,829 --> 01:07:29,079
<i>- Mom!
- Mother!</i>

942
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:31,039
<i>You're the new student, right?</i>

943
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:34,809
<i>Let me introduce myself. I'm Ji Ok Bun.</i>

944
01:07:34,809 --> 01:07:37,739
<i>By chance, does Kwang Sook have a dark past?</i>

945
01:07:37,739 --> 01:07:39,179
<i>Excuse me!</i>

946
01:07:39,179 --> 01:07:41,119
<i>Does she have a hidden child or...</i>

947
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:43,349
<i>I'm a busy person, too.</i>

948
01:07:43,349 --> 01:07:47,179
<i>So? Are you treating me like a criminal?</i>

949
01:07:47,179 --> 01:07:49,439
<i>Stop talking nonsense and get to work. I'm hanging up.</i>

950
01:07:49,439 --> 01:07:51,689
<i>Busted.</i>
