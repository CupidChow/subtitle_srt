00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:04,480
(Episode 18)

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,440
Goodness me.

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,090
(Purity and Sincerity)

4
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,260
Knock knock.

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,360
Kwang Sook.

6
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,700
(Eagle Brewery)

7
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,040
You're up early today.

8
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,940
I actually stayed up all night.

9
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,410
Why?

10
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:41,550
Time flew...

11
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,880
while working on my presentation
and doing some light reading.

12
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,020
Are you still
having trouble sleeping?

13
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,250
I'm sure it'll get better.

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,320
Sure.

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,160
It'll get better over time,

16
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,090
so don't worry too much.

17
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:55,490
Right.

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,330
By the way,

19
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,770
I'm meeting So Yeon
at the courthouse today.

20
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,240
We're handing in the divorce papers.

21
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,240
Finally,

22
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,710
it's over.

23
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,050
Put on your smartest suit,

24
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,920
wear your best tie,

25
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,980
and sign it...

26
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:22,390
with your seal in style.

27
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:23,990
Sure.

28
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,460
You'll be checking
on the Design Team in the morning...

29
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,130
and meeting with the presidents.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,330
In the evening, the final tasting
will be conducted for the food...

31
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,870
that'll be paired...

32
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,400
with the traditional liquor
at the festival.

33
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,500
It'd be ideal for you...

34
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,210
to try the food yourself
and give your approval.

35
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,880
Okay, I'll do just that.

36
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,210
Make sure CEO Ma Kwang Sook
of Eagle Brewery...

37
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:50,550
will be there too.

38
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,420
CEO Ma Kwang Sook?

39
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,720
It's only right
that she should come.

40
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,890
She is the one who made the liquor.

41
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,030
You're right about that, but...

42
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,330
She has the duty and right...

43
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,530
to taste the food we make...

44
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,130
to see if it goes well
with the liquor she made, right?

45
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,540
I haven't thought of that.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,140
Try contacting her.

47
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,340
Tell her to come...

48
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,540
unless there are
special circumstances.

49
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,440
Now?

50
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,280
Yes.

51
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:35,860
Is there a special reason...

52
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,730
for polishing wheat
to make nuruk, Mr. Go?

53
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,030
The flavor and color of the liquor
improve this way.

54
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,570
I see.

55
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,140
The mung beans are here.

56
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,440
Okay.

57
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,010
What are the mung beans for?

58
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,410
Well...

59
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,350
I saw Jang Soo's work log.

60
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,180
It had a recipe using nuruk
made with mung beans.

61
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,580
So I want to give it a try.

62
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,320
The mung beans
must be quite expensive.

63
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,920
It's the dream liquor
that Jang Soo always wanted to make.

64
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,090
I want to try making it.

65
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,230
What?

66
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:21,010
Hello? Ma Kwang Sook
of Eagle Brewery speaking.

67
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:23,840
Hello. This is
Manager Park Yeong Jun.

68
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,280
I work for Chairman Han Dong Seok.

69
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,480
Hello, Mr. Park.

70
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,880
You must be busy working now,
so I'll keep it short.

71
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,480
At 7 p.m. tonight,

72
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,950
the final tasting will be conducted
for the food...

73
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:35,320
that'll be paired with the liquor
at the festival.

74
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,760
And we'd like you
to attend the event.

75
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,360
Me?

76
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,260
Yes. It's the instruction
from the chairman.

77
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,170
If that's
the chairman's instruction,

78
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,970
I'll be there.

79
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,440
Yes. I'll be there on time.

80
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,240
Okay. I'll report it
to the chairman.

81
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,210
Is she coming?

82
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,420
Yes. She says she will be there...

83
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,620
since it's your instruction.

84
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,060
Gosh.

85
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,260
I bet he'll act all high and mighty
when I get there.

86
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,960
- Who?
- What?

87
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,770
It's nothing.

88
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,710
Thank you all for your hard work.

89
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,680
These are the products
for the SS season.

90
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:37,780
I see. How are things going
with the new team?

91
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,180
As we're launching a new line
targeting the younger generation,

92
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,120
we are looking
for more innovative...

93
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,490
and creative talents.

94
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,190
The whole group
will provide full support,

95
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,390
so please prepare it well.

96
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,930
Let's find new talents...

97
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:54,430
who are unbiased
and open to challenges.

98
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,810
Hello.

99
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,880
- Welcome.
- Hello.

100
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:08,350
These ladies have been making nuruk
for us for 30 years.

101
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,180
Who are you?

102
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,490
She wants to learn to make nuruk,
so we brought her.

103
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,460
Hello.

104
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,730
Instead of the old people...

105
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,260
who don't know
how much longer they will live,

106
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,260
young people should learn
and do the work now.

107
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,770
I'm glad you're here.

108
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,370
I look forward to working with you.

109
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,800
You should tamp it down well.

110
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,060
Look at you. You're so good.

111
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,740
You're doing a great job.

112
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,080
How pretty.

113
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,650
My goodness. It's done.

114
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,880
It's done.

115
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,720
Thank you so much.

116
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,750
- You did a great job.
- You're the best.

117
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,520
- How can she be so good?
- It's all thanks to you.

118
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,590
- Well done.
- You are the best.

119
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,600
The nuruk of Eagle Brewery...

120
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,200
is made by treading,

121
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,910
which is completed solely
by human effort and sincerity...

122
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,540
without the help of machines.

123
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,110
The carefully crafted nuruk...

124
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:22,210
will work its wondrous magic...

125
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,020
with moderate temperature
and humidity...

126
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,320
and the molds that have developed
on the wooden shelves...

127
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,760
that have been passed down
for three generations.

128
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,830
(Silla Brewery)

129
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:47,940
We've planted one of our people
at Eagle Brewery.

130
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,740
Are you sure it will work this time?

131
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,380
We prepared things thoroughly
before sending her in.

132
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,620
Make sure to keep her mouth shut.

133
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,580
I will.

134
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,720
Why go back
when you can take the shortcut?

135
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,760
You will just waste money
and hurt your feet. Right?

136
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,360
Of course.

137
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:16,670
Upload the new files we received
to the website...

138
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:18,170
and notify the students.

139
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,740
Yes, sir.

140
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,510
- Are you going out?
- Yes.

141
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,370
Do you have class today?

142
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,710
No, I don't.

143
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,080
Then why did you come to school?

144
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,680
You're having a seminar today.

145
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,080
I thought you might need some help,
so I came.

146
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,120
You didn't have to do that.

147
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,650
And I have
some accounting statements to enter.

148
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,560
Excuse me.

149
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,030
Hello?

150
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,200
Of course. You should go.

151
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,300
If I leave now,
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

152
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,740
Please just get me
Ha Ni's diaper bag.

153
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,470
Okay.

154
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,580
What's wrong?
Did something happen to Ha Ni?

155
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,210
It was Ha Ni's babysitter.

156
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,780
Her in-law just passed away,
so she needs to head out of town.

157
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,620
(Contacts)

158
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,320
I can take care of her.

159
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,560
Ha Ni likes to be with me.

160
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,360
So it will be fine.

161
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:17,900
I can't do that.

162
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,930
It'll be late at night
when I get back after the seminar.

163
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,630
I'll take her home
and play with her.

164
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,740
Don't worry about it and just go.

165
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,110
I'm home.

166
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,750
You're home, my darling puppy.

167
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,020
What's with the baby?

168
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,990
She's my friend's daughter,
and something urgent came up.

169
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,320
I'll look after her for a bit.

170
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,720
That doesn't matter
even if it was urgent.

171
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,490
Why would you volunteer
to watch someone else's baby?

172
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,000
She should go out of town
for a seminar,

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,030
but the babysitter had
something urgent to take care of.

174
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,930
But you can't just take her home
like this.

175
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,840
Mom, Ha Ni will be shocked.

176
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,540
What if she cries because of you?

177
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:08,010
Hi. How sweet.

178
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,320
You're so adorable.

179
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,250
So you must be Ha Ni.

180
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:17,360
All right. There there.

181
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,590
She's so lovely, isn't she?

182
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,360
They say you never get credit
for babysitting.

183
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:25,330
What if something happens to her...

184
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,930
while you were being so nosy?

185
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,300
Don't worry. I can take care of her.

186
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,410
What's with her?

187
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,180
- Hello?
- Hello, Professor.

188
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,180
I just got home.

189
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,590
I'm playing with Ha Ni now.

190
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,220
Your parents must be worried.

191
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,830
No. My mom likes her too.

192
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,400
She's so fond of babies.

193
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,270
I feel bad
that I keep asking you for a favor.

194
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,500
Please don't say that.

195
00:11:03,570 --> 00:11:06,300
It's a great comfort for me
to spend time with Ha Ni.

196
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,370
Thank you for saying that.

197
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,340
Please don't worry about Ha Ni
and just focus on the seminar.

198
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,050
And drive safely.

199
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,990
How long do you have to babysit her?

200
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,520
The seminar takes place
out of the town.

201
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,020
It will be late at night
when she comes back.

202
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,090
You said
she was your friend's daughter.

203
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,660
Yes.

204
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,430
Which one?

205
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,600
It's not like you know
all of my friends.

206
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,480
- Hi.
- Hello, Ms. Ji.

207
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,740
Welcome back!

208
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,710
- I haven't seen you in so long.
- Where were you?

209
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,150
What's going on?

210
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:51,980
You said you wouldn't come anymore.

211
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,850
I felt slow and under the weather,

212
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,060
so I decided to come back.

213
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,120
- Good.
- I'm glad you did.

214
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,760
It was boring without you.

215
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,990
Yes.

216
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,500
So, to celebrate,

217
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,730
After class, how about we all go...

218
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,430
and eat something nice?

219
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
My gosh.

220
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,600
What's the point
of working out every day...

221
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,740
if you fill your belly
with more than what you sweat off?

222
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:17,610
- Tasty food has zero calories!
- Zero calories.

223
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,850
Hello, everyone. Are you all here?

224
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
Hello.

225
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,410
Mr. Oh.

226
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,150
Ms. Ji decided to come back.

227
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,850
I see.

228
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,120
I'm glad you're back.

229
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,560
But now that Ms. Ji's here,

230
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,230
Ms. Kim isn't.

231
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,930
- What?
- Yes. You're right.

232
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,260
Is Ms. Kim unwell, Mr. Oh?

233
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,530
I don't know. She never said.

234
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,270
Before we start,

235
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,470
how about you warm up
with the person next to you?

236
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,510
- Yes.
- Okay.

237
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,540
She'll be here soon.

238
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,740
What shall we eat after class?

239
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:53,840
What do you want?

240
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,380
I want meat.

241
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,250
The call cannot be connected
and will be transferred...

242
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,820
That's odd.

243
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,620
Seon Ah, it's me.

244
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,130
You're not here,
and I can't reach you.

245
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,400
I'm leaving this
because I'm worried.

246
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,740
Call me as soon as you get this.

247
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,010
Message recorded.

248
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,410
(Zumba Dance Class)

249
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Mom?

250
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:45,330
What is it?

251
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:47,130
What did you hide?

252
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,170
I didn't hide anything.

253
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,670
It's nothing at all.

254
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,180
I'm going to LX Hotel for dinner.

255
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,850
You can eat without me tonight.

256
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,680
Kang Soo has dinner plans,

257
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,380
and Chun Soo's
going to the courthouse.

258
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,690
Okay. Fine.

259
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,120
So...

260
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,460
you'll have dinner at LX Hotel?

261
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,630
I have to help pick what food...

262
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:17,530
to serve with our makgeolli.

263
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,760
They asked me to come and taste it.

264
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,200
Goodness, that sounds lovely.

265
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,770
Can you take me too?

266
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
No.

267
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,770
It's for work.

268
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,610
Mom,

269
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,380
you can stay here.

270
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,350
You always want to tag along.

271
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,180
That brat.

272
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,450
Oh, dear.

273
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,000
Hello, Mr. Park.

274
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,530
Things are going exactly as planned.

275
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,870
Her eldest brother-in-law moved in.

276
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,740
I'll try to make him
take over the brewery.

277
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:03,470
Yes.

278
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,990
The reason...

279
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:20,960
for our breakup...

280
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,430
was that we had
different values and mindsets.

281
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,900
But your sister-in-law
and brothers talked...

282
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:30,270
as if we were splitting up
because I had an affair.

283
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,400
I felt that was unfair.

284
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,340
I want to make that clear.

285
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,980
You know how I can't stand
being treated unfairly.

286
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:39,710
What?

287
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,550
(Court)

288
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,650
You felt wronged?

289
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:45,680
Yes.

290
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,450
I did.

291
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,720
Especially, Heung Soo
and your sister-in-law...

292
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,390
They treated me
like I were a criminal.

293
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,090
No one has ever treated me
like that.

294
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,200
I think we're equally responsible
for the divorce.

295
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,870
It's not right to say
just one person is responsible.

296
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,410
Whatever.

297
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,380
I don't care if you date
or get married.

298
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,380
But...

299
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,550
I'll come after you
if you mistreat Yeoung Ju.

300
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,450
Don't worry.

301
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,250
I'm doing this to be a better mom.

302
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,130
Good, then.

303
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,430
Honey.

304
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,930
I know you have a grudge against me.

305
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,540
Since we're breaking up,

306
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,240
let's root for
and wish each other well.

307
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,050
We once were in love,

308
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:51,520
and we have Yeoung Ju.

309
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,820
Let's remain good friends.

310
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,190
You seem to want that too.

311
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,830
How about...

312
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,900
one last handshake?

313
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,480
What's this?

314
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,460
It's your wedding ring.

315
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,700
Did you have to do this?

316
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,110
Compared to what you did to me,

317
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,840
this is nothing.

318
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,380
Chun Soo.

319
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:56,110
See you in three months.

320
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,200
Like the ring broken in half,

321
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,500
my past...

322
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,170
and the sadness
that had settled within me...

323
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,240
shattered as well.

324
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,960
"I can't let go."

325
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,190
"I can't give up."

326
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:49,500
I've let go of the regrets
I'd been holding on to.

327
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,600
Now,

328
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,940
I'm starting over.

329
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,890
We have a team pruning the trees
as you said.

330
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,260
Shall I look around
before going upstairs?

331
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,260
Yes, sir.

332
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,870
I see you're hard at work.

333
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,070
- Hello.
- Hello, sir.

334
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,170
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

335
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,400
Hello, sir.

336
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,740
Don't rush the work
and end up getting hurt.

337
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,410
Be sure to stay safe and secure.

338
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,940
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

339
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,180
- Yes, sir.
- We'll be careful.

340
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:40,620
Tell them to prune
those trees carefully.

341
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,450
So they don't ruin the guests' view.

342
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,620
Yes, sir.

343
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,720
Oh, dear.

344
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,320
Are you all right, sir?

345
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,430
- Oh, dear.
- My gosh.

346
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,360
Shoot. It's fine.

347
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,560
I'll get you a chair.

348
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,030
I'll have your shoes cleaned
while you sit and wait.

349
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,240
No. You stay and manage the site.

350
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,440
I can walk.

351
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,670
It'll be uncomfortable.

352
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:04,780
Fortunately, my socks are still dry.
It should be okay.

353
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,780
Do your job.

354
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,310
Take care, everyone.

355
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,510
- Yes, sir.
- My gosh.

356
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,550
Do you need any help?

357
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:15,090
No, I'm fine.

358
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,020
(Eagle Brewery)

359
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,660
(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

360
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,060
Hello.

361
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,030
What brings you here, sir?

362
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,900
I was watching a team
tend to the garden and...

363
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,040
Oh, dear.

364
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,540
Why come in person
instead of sending someone?

365
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,280
Everyone else was working.

366
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,710
It wasn't a long walk.

367
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,880
Your shoes were so well-polished...

368
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,950
that the leather
didn't soak up any water.

369
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,190
I'll clean off the mud,
dry the shoes,

370
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,920
and give them another good coat
of wax.

371
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,460
Take all the time you need
to have them back to perfection.

372
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,530
Yes, sir.

373
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,850
I feel energized again.

374
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,090
Knock knock.

375
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,220
It's me.

376
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,960
It's the brewery CEO.

377
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,460
Have you all been well?

378
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,430
It's the same for us, I guess.

379
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,700
I guess you've been busy.
We haven't seen you around.

380
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,830
There was a family matter
that needed my attention,

381
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,170
and I was busy
developing a new product.

382
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,580
This new product just came out,

383
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,040
so try it.

384
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,550
Gosh, look at this.

385
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,520
Goodness, what is this?

386
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,360
Here you go. And you too.

387
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,130
Here you go.

388
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,800
It's good.

389
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,270
It's delicious.

390
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,000
This one's a bit different
from the one before.

391
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,570
You guys know your stuff.

392
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:15,270
This time around, we made a yakju.

393
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,310
It's quite a fancy liquor.

394
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,080
That's why I brought it over
for you ladies to try.

395
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,180
Surely, you're the best.

396
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,920
That's right. We don't usually
get treated this well.

397
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,020
Store it in the fridge...

398
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,990
and enjoy a sip or two
when you feel tired.

399
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,230
- Got it.
- Okay.

400
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,930
Here.

401
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:39,060
Hello.

402
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,070
Hello. You're here.

403
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,270
I'm here to pick up
the chairman's dress shirt.

404
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,340
Sure.

405
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,000
We had it prepared
for you to take upstairs.

406
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,310
Thank you.

407
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,140
See you later.

408
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,880
Will we get his approval
the first time around this time?

409
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,350
What do you mean by that?

410
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,890
The chairman is extremely neat
and particular.

411
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:08,990
Half the laundry we send up
gets sent right back down.

412
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,960
It stresses us out,

413
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,560
but the secretaries
are having a hard time too.

414
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,970
Is the chairman that picky?

415
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,000
- Don't get us started.
- Don't get us started.

416
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,470
I applied more polish than usual...

417
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:24,340
to prevent any moisture
from getting through.

418
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,410
Do you approve?

419
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,510
That's great.

420
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:30,310
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

421
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:32,220
His office doesn't need
any cleaning.

422
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,250
There's not even a speck of dust
on his desk.

423
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:37,520
It's the cleanest place
in the entire hotel.

424
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,830
I'm sure he has his secretaries
to thank for that.

425
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:44,260
No. I asked the secretaries,

426
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,260
and they're not allowed
to touch his office.

427
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:49,470
He sweeps and wipes everything
on his own.

428
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,770
You have no idea
what a neat freak he is.

429
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,370
- Is that true?
- Yes.

430
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,110
What on earth is she doing there?

431
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,480
So what if he's a wealthy chairman?

432
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,780
He's such a neat freak
and too picky all the time.

433
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,850
That's why he's still a widower.

434
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,120
Those around him
have to suffer for no reason.

435
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:17,530
People shouldn't be
such perfectionists.

436
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:19,800
We call him Mr. Picky.

437
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,630
You're right about that.

438
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,330
He's just that fussy
about everything.

439
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,730
Come on.

440
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,500
People badmouth even the king
behind his back,

441
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,570
but try not to think
too badly of him.

442
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,610
He may seem prickly on the outside,

443
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:36,110
but he is a man with a warm heart.

444
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:40,050
Come on. I can vouch for that.

445
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,890
Really?

446
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,020
Yes.

447
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,490
You see,

448
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,590
I've made a few big mistakes
with the chairman,

449
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,360
but he didn't make a fuss about it.

450
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,630
He just let it slide.

451
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:58,130
He's more generous than you'd think.

452
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,270
- Really?
- Really?

453
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,170
He must be charming in a way
that's invisible to us.

454
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,340
Of course, he's charming.

455
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,580
He's as handsome as an actor.

456
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,050
Personally,

457
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,980
I like his gentle but deep gaze.

458
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,260
- As for me...
- Yes?

459
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:19,860
Well,

460
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:23,730
he's the kind of type
I'd never go for.

461
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,030
What?

462
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,840
- As if.
- It's true.

463
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,670
He's not my type at all.

464
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,280
No way. Never.

465
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,740
He's not.

466
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:44,150
He's not.

467
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,880
No way.

468
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,820
Never.

469
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,320
He's not my type at all.

470
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:59,200
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

471
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,230
Unbelievable.

472
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,200
You've got to be kidding me.

473
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,810
It's not like she's my type anyway.

474
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:10,870
Unbelievable.

475
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:16,110
Still, was it necessary
to make an X with her arms?

476
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,810
What a joke.

477
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,960
("Blazing Love Song")

478
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,720
Welcome.

479
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,860
You're here.

480
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,130
Do you even read poems?

481
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,770
Only when things are slow
around here.

482
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,010
Are you coming back
from somewhere nice?

483
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,010
That's a sharp suit.

484
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:54,380
I just came back from submitting
the divorce papers at the court.

485
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,360
I see.

486
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,020
How does it feel?

487
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,900
There are some unpleasant feelings
like I've suffered a loss.

488
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,230
On the other hand,

489
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,670
I feel relieved like I've finished
homework that was due ages ago.

490
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,970
My mind's all over the place.

491
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,480
Of course, you're feeling
all sorts of things.

492
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,480
It was like that for me too.

493
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,420
It's not like I was wishing
for some grand kind of happiness.

494
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,890
Just like everyone else.

495
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,090
All I wanted was to be happy
like everyone else.

496
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:38,060
That's harder than it sounds.

497
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Right?

498
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,370
Absolutely.

499
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,970
It's not easy at all.

500
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,410
Still, you should get back
on your feet.

501
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,970
You have a family to take care of.

502
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,140
- What about you?
- Me?

503
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:56,910
In my case,

504
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,380
my mom passed away
before I started elementary school,

505
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,950
and my dad died last year
from cancer.

506
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,090
My half-siblings all live in the US.

507
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,760
In this vast land of Korea,

508
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,630
I'm all by myself.

509
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,440
I live closer to you now,

510
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,910
so call me
when you need someone to lean on.

511
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:23,270
I'll be there right away.

512
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:26,410
Gosh, it's reassuring to hear that.

513
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,650
You saved my life,

514
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,780
so you deserve special treatment.

515
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:35,790
Thanks.

516
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:45,700
Yes, Professor.

517
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,000
Did you arrive on time?

518
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,770
Yes, I just arrived and am heading
to the conference hall.

519
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,670
Wasn't Ha Ni a nuisance?

520
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,800
Hold on. I'll switch to video.

521
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,770
- Hi.
- She just woke up from her nap...

522
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,480
and is having a snack with me.

523
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,080
"Dad, do well at the seminar."

524
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,590
Ha Ni, have fun with Se Ri...

525
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,890
until I get there to pick you up.
Got it?

526
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,560
- "Sure thing, Dad."
- Okay.

527
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:17,490
You're so cute,

528
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,500
- aren't you?
- Did you answer him?

529
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,500
"Temporarily closed."

530
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,870
What's this?

531
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:31,910
(Temporarily closed)

532
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,510
The phone is turned off.
Transferring to voicemail.

533
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,880
Even her phone is off.

534
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:37,610
What's going on?

535
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,220
Hello.

536
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,930
- I see you called.
- Right.

537
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,130
The unit occupied by Angel Piano.
Can you put it on the market?

538
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,730
But what about Ms. Kim?

539
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,340
She'll move out in a few days.

540
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,940
I don't need to receive a premium,

541
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,610
so look for someone to rent it fast.

542
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,120
(Temporarily closed)

543
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,390
What are you doing here, Mr. Oh?

544
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,230
I can't reach Seon Ah suddenly,

545
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,130
so I'm waiting for her.

546
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,970
Have you contacted
her family or friends?

547
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,580
She never introduced me to them.

548
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,980
Have you been to her house?

549
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,250
I don't know where she lives.

550
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,590
What on earth do you know
about Ms. Kim?

551
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,460
I've been telling you
to find out more...

552
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:55,860
about her the whole time,
but you wouldn't listen.

553
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,360
And now just look at you.

554
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,900
You seem excited.

555
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,570
Waiting for her like this
won't make her show up.

556
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:09,270
Get up.

557
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,740
Do you know what's with Seon Ah?

558
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,350
- No.
- Then...

559
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:20,520
how do you know
if she will show up or not?

560
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,450
Well...

561
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,420
She must have some circumstances
she can't tell you about.

562
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,630
Maybe that's why she closed down
the academy without telling you.

563
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,560
Don't you think so?

564
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,730
(Temporarily closed)

565
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,210
Did you have dinner?

566
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,980
It's late. Of course, I ate.

567
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,980
You're home, Dad.

568
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,480
What?

569
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,850
Who is this baby?

570
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,420
She's the daughter
of her friend from college.

571
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,890
Something urgent came up,

572
00:31:55,890 --> 00:31:58,050
so Se Ri is looking after her.

573
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:01,260
Say hello to Grandpa, Ha Ni.

574
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:03,660
It looks like she's your daughter.

575
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:06,260
Don't be silly.

576
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,430
She's not even married.
How could you make such a joke?

577
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,670
She looks just like Se Ri
when she was young.

578
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,140
Really? Did I look like her
when I was little?

579
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,470
You should check your photos.
You looked exactly like her.

580
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,110
How adorable.

581
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,880
Stop talking nonsense
and go get changed quickly.

582
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,650
Okay.

583
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,350
She's so cute.

584
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,420
Ha Ni, let's go and call your dad.

585
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,190
Hang on.

586
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,890
Is your friend a man, not a woman?

587
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,730
Yes.

588
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,660
Let's go.

589
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,210
Did you get a call
from Chairman Han?

590
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,220
How would he call me
after embarrassing me like that?

591
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,820
Don't let him know
that you're upset.

592
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:07,620
Once Se Ri gets married,

593
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,060
it's just a matter of time...

594
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,590
before we supply makgeolli
to LX Hotel.

595
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:13,830
Do you think...

596
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,400
I'm a pathetic father
who uses his daughter...

597
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,670
to sell his makgeolli?

598
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,540
What?

599
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,970
This is something
I can take care of myself.

600
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,240
What's that supposed to mean?

601
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,480
You stay out of this.

602
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,980
I'll be the only one...

603
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,280
with blood on his hands.

604
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,930
(Jang-Kwang Yakju)

605
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,010
It's time.
Shall we begin, Mr. Chairman?

606
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:01,780
No, we will begin
once CEO Ma Kwang Sook arrives.

607
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,250
Yes, sir.

608
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,690
I'm sorry I'm late.

609
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,570
- You're here.
- Hello.

610
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,140
We will be deciding on the food...

611
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,110
to be paired with the liquor
at the festival.

612
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:32,980
Chairman Han wanted you
to attend the tasting...

613
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:35,710
and give us your opinions,
so we asked you to come.

614
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,450
We have to do that.

615
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:40,620
Our hotel values trust...

616
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,950
with our suppliers.

617
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,420
I see.

618
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,190
Okay.

619
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,130
We will start serving the food now.

620
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:06,580
My goodness. This is a total feast.

621
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,710
We've prepared two main dishes.

622
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,220
First, we have
spicy boneless braised ribs...

623
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,950
and sole meuniere.

624
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,520
The second is spicy tteok galbi...

625
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,790
and braised cod.

626
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,830
All right. Let's drink together.

627
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,170
Okay.

628
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,690
As expected from a brewery CEO,
you drink it vigorously.

629
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,330
You know what?

630
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:02,430
When I see someone
who sips at a drink,

631
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,170
I lose my appetite...

632
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,800
right away.

633
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,580
I like it that the taste
of the liquor is stable.

634
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,450
And the bitter touch
of the finish is attractive.

635
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,820
Thank you.

636
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,790
All right.
Please give your opinion...

637
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:29,130
on which of the two-course meals
will go well with the liquor.

638
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:30,830
Okay.

639
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,550
My gosh.

640
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,820
This is more difficult
than choosing whom I like better...

641
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,750
between my mom and my dad.

642
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,830
The liquor tastes even better...

643
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,760
because the food is so delicious.

644
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,630
- My goodness.
- Awesome.

645
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,090
I think you've had enough.

646
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,590
Why don't you wrap things up?

647
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,230
Don't worry about me and just go.

648
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,260
If I leave the food,
it will be thrown away,

649
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,500
which is a waste.

650
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,170
I apologized last time,

651
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:54,110
but I'd like to offer
my sincere apology again.

652
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,850
I heard it from someone trustworthy
in the industry,

653
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,290
so I believed it without a doubt...

654
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:06,260
I mean, I was being reckless.
I have no excuse.

655
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:11,690
So who on earth is that person
who wagged his tongue...

656
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,030
as cunningly as a snake?

657
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,470
Who in the industry...

658
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:21,100
is so interested in me,
Ma Kwang Sook,

659
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,770
that he goes around
saying ridiculous things like that?

660
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,610
Talking about it
makes me upset again.

661
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,720
Well... I understand...

662
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:37,520
that it was my fault
that I didn't check things properly.

663
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,160
But it was a situation...

664
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,820
that could seem quite suspicious.

665
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,490
"A situation
that could seem suspicious?"

666
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,400
I mean,

667
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,200
you went up to a hotel room
with a man in broad daylight.

668
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,940
Excuse me, Chairman Han.

669
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,710
If I were in your shoes...

670
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:02,510
and saw you going up
to a hotel room...

671
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:05,720
with a woman in broad daylight,

672
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:10,050
I wouldn't just misjudge people
like that.

673
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:14,520
But it's true
that you went on blind dates.

674
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,760
You dated three men in a row
in one place.

675
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,930
How did you know
that I went on blind dates?

676
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,630
I went to Park Hotel
to attend an event,

677
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,570
and I saw you there.

678
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,770
That's just...
Let me tell you what happened.

679
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,780
I don't know why...

680
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,780
I have to keep explaining things
to you like this.

681
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:46,090
You met my youngest brother-in-law.

682
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,920
You mean Lieutenant Oh Kang Soo?

683
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,690
Yes.

684
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:52,500
After he was discharged,

685
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,730
he had no place to stay.

686
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,730
I wanted to bring him to my place,

687
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,900
but my mom was strongly against it.

688
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:02,570
So I made a deal with her
to go on three blind dates.

689
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:06,710
Seriously, I'm not interested
in getting remarried,

690
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:08,340
and I'm busy with work
at the brewery.

691
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:12,310
So I just did it all at once
in one day.

692
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,650
Still, that's just too much.

693
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:19,620
That's not polite
to the other people.

694
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,160
When you were so polite,

695
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,830
why did you...

696
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,270
treat me...

697
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,540
like a gold digger
without any proof?

698
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,910
Now that I'm drunk,

699
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,780
let me speak my mind.

700
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:49,220
You might have the upper hand
as the person I supply goods to,

701
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,750
and this Ma Kwang Sook...

702
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,060
might be a nobody,

703
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,260
but you shouldn't go around...

704
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,360
suspecting others for no reason
and viewing them with prejudice.

705
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:06,340
That's exactly what you call
abuse of power!

706
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:25,250
Taxi.

707
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,290
Oh, my gosh.

708
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,560
No, leave her be.

709
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:35,690
Her brewery supplies our hotel,

710
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,730
and she got drunk doing business.

711
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:39,930
I'll drop her off on the way.

712
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,100
- Take care.
- Yes, sir.

713
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,640
Hello.

714
00:42:53,910 --> 00:42:57,210
To Eagle Brewery, please.

715
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,320
Take her there.

716
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,320
Yes, sir.

717
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,730
I bought it for you, Ha Ni.
What do you think?

718
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,130
Do you like it?

719
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,200
You seem to like it.

720
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,910
Your dad's calling.

721
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,010
Hello, Professor.

722
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:36,280
In five minutes?

723
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:39,010
Okay. I'll come downstairs.

724
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,250
Ha Ni, your dad's here.

725
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,720
Let's go see him.

726
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:47,520
The fruit's nice and sweet.

727
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,030
Is her dad here?

728
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,230
Yes.

729
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:59,840
Ha Ni. Wave goodbye
to Grandma and Grandpa.

730
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:02,340
Goodbye, Ha Ni. Bye-bye.

731
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:04,640
"Bye, Grandpa."

732
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:06,540
That's what you say, Ha Ni.

733
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:09,480
I don't know who her parents are,
but she's adorable.

734
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:13,120
Your mom and dad
must love you so much.

735
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,250
Right?

736
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:18,750
Ha Ni, let's go.
Your dad might be waiting.

737
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,020
Bye-bye.

738
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,390
Take care.

739
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:30,030
She likes Se Ri a lot.

740
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:34,740
Right? It doesn't look like
they met today, does it?

741
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:42,410
- Goodness.
- Ha Ni, go to your dad.

742
00:45:42,410 --> 00:45:45,310
Ha Ni. Did you have fun with Se Ri?

743
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,250
- It was hard work, wasn't it?
- Not at all.

744
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,590
We had so much fun.

745
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:53,860
Didn't we, Ha Ni?

746
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:56,890
Ha Ni, say thank you.

747
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:01,030
Let's go home and go to sleep.

748
00:46:03,470 --> 00:46:04,930
Goodness.

749
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,970
Let's go straight home.

750
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:11,970
Let's get strapped in.

751
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,180
Here you go.

752
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,420
Gosh.

753
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:22,820
It's too late for me
to thank your parents.

754
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,190
I'll thank them for you.

755
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,990
I keep relying on you
whenever something happens.

756
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:31,660
Thanks.

757
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,760
I'm glad I can be of help.

758
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:38,970
You should go. You must be tired.

759
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,300
Okay.

760
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,840
You had a long day too. Sleep well.

761
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:44,340
I will.

762
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:46,540
Ha Ni.

763
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:50,780
Ha Ni.

764
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,950
Dad's tired,
so keep quiet in the back.

765
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,950
Okay?

766
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,290
You should go.

767
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,330
Okay. See you tomorrow on campus.

768
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:07,230
Drive safely.

769
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,230
Ha Ni. Bye.

770
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,250
Mom.

771
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,150
You startled me.

772
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,950
Was that your senior?

773
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,920
He's actually my professor.

774
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:38,060
Your professor?

775
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,970
Why did you lie
and say he was your senior?

776
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:45,070
I didn't lie.

777
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,840
I thought you'd feel pressured
if I told you who she really was.

778
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:51,040
What's your professor called?

779
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:53,980
He's called Oh Beom Soo.

780
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:04,920
Why did you babysit
your professor's daughter?

781
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,760
I told you.

782
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,620
He had to travel for a seminar,

783
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,960
but her usual babysitter
couldn't make it...

784
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,460
Then her mom should take her.

785
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:14,430
Why would you get involved?

786
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:17,100
My professor's a single dad.

787
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,130
A single dad?

788
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,840
She doesn't have a mom?

789
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:24,870
What happened?

790
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,010
How would I know that?

791
00:48:28,310 --> 00:48:29,380
I'm tired.

792
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:33,950
Get out.

793
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,200
Your phone's ringing.

794
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,110
CEO Ma.

795
00:49:00,110 --> 00:49:01,240
Answer your phone.

796
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:07,550
Hello?

797
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,350
Where are you?

798
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,690
Where do you think I am?

799
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:14,560
I'm on my way home in a taxi.

800
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,990
Why do you sound weird?
Are you drunk?

801
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,160
The hotel chairman...

802
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:23,230
bullied me so much
that I got angry...

803
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:24,770
and had a few shots.

804
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:29,600
Who does he think he is?

805
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:32,070
So what if he's a chairman?

806
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:34,710
He spoke ill of me and suspected me.

807
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:35,910
He's a piece of dirt!

808
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,410
The king of bullies!

809
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:44,950
You wait and see, Mom.

810
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,260
I, Ma Kwang Sook,

811
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:51,530
will find ultimate success.

812
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:54,230
Even if he gets down
on his hands and knees...

813
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,400
and begs me to supply makgeolli
to his hotel,

814
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,070
I will never allow my liquor
to be sold there!

815
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:04,070
So what if he's a chairman?

816
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,480
Who does he think he is
treating you like that?

817
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,410
Do you want me
to teach him a lesson?

818
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,310
Bring it.

819
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,350
Forget it.

820
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:16,350
We don't avoid rubbish
because we're scared of it.

821
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:18,890
It's because it's disgusting.

822
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,190
Well said.

823
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,160
What can we do
when we need to make a living?

824
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,230
Take that.

825
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:28,700
Think that you stepped on dung
and forget about it.

826
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:29,770
Take that.

827
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,330
Take that!

828
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:33,500
Good job.

829
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,140
Now, get home safely.

830
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:36,440
Sure.

831
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,960
(Eagle Brewery)

832
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:16,910
You're home, CEO Ma.

833
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,480
Wake up.

834
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:30,830
Hey, you. Ma Kwang Sook.

835
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:34,930
What?

836
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,400
I'm here already.

837
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:45,910
Goodness, are you okay?

838
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,510
- Yes.
- Careful.

839
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,450
This way.

840
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:51,510
Kwang Sook, is that you?

841
00:51:51,510 --> 00:51:53,780
- Goodness me.
- Mom!

842
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:55,580
I knew it.

843
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:59,650
Why did you drink so much?

844
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:01,220
Goodness me.

845
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:04,490
Is it because
that chairman upset you?

846
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:06,530
I was so frustrated...

847
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,630
that I had a glass to drink.

848
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:14,040
I'd gladly break the leg
of that darn chairman.

849
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,040
By the way, who may you be?

850
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,070
Oh, right.

851
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:21,010
I am
Chairman Han Dong Seok's chauffeur.

852
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,150
Why would Chairman Han's chauffeur
be here?

853
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:28,250
Goodness me. Then is this car...

854
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,390
That's right.

855
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:44,570
Goodness, Chairman Han. Hello.

856
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:46,000
Right. Good evening.

857
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,470
I wanted to call...

858
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:50,340
after the porcelain jar incident,

859
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:54,610
but I couldn't because I was worried
you'd get the wrong idea.

860
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:58,250
Your daughter seems quite drunk,
so please take her inside.

861
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,080
You came all the way here,

862
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,150
so why don't you come in
for some tea?

863
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,520
It's already late.

864
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,250
Mr. Kim, let's go.

865
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,320
Yes, sir.

866
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:08,990
- Bye.
- Bye then.

867
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:12,330
(Eagle Brewery)

868
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,300
Are you out of your mind?
Oh, my goodness.

869
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,940
She's lost it. What are you doing?

870
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:23,510
Excuse me.

871
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,240
Here.

872
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,680
Ten dollars is for the fare,

873
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,010
and here's another ten for the tip.

874
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:33,350
Get a grip on yourself.

875
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:36,150
He's not the taxi driver
but Chairman Han.

876
00:53:37,790 --> 00:53:39,550
- Unbelievable.
- Goodness.

877
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:41,460
Good night, then.

878
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:43,790
Just a second!

879
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:47,160
You should give back
the money she gave you.

880
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:48,700
Right.

881
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:51,000
Of course.

882
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,070
Okay, then.

883
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,510
Drive safely.

884
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:59,110
Good night.

885
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,880
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

886
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:04,610
- Let's go.
- Come on.

887
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:05,710
Walk straight!

888
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:08,450
- Come on.
- Let's go.

889
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,420
Shall we go, sir?

890
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,720
What?

891
00:54:13,390 --> 00:54:14,490
Yes, let's go.

892
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:21,330
That mother-daughter duo is no joke.

893
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:25,300
My gosh.

894
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:30,240
Walk properly, will you?

895
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,970
Run and run!

896
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:36,040
Kwang Sook, get a grip on yourself.

897
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,250
Where did she get drunk like this?

898
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:40,850
During a business meal at the hotel.

899
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:42,720
Unbelievable.

900
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,860
What do you say to a beer
to wash it all down?

901
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:48,920
Hey, take her inside.

902
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,920
Sure.

903
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,060
I propose round two!

904
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,160
- Bring me my beer.
- What the...

905
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,660
- Bring me my beer!
- My gosh.

906
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:57,100
- Kwang Sook.
- Right now!

907
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:03,070
My gosh.

908
00:55:04,870 --> 00:55:06,110
Everyone, gather up.

909
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,480
I told you to get me my beer,
so where is it?

910
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,250
Bring me liquor and snacks!

911
00:55:12,250 --> 00:55:14,020
Shut it and go to bed.

912
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,590
Close that mouth!

913
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:25,530
Why are you laughing?

914
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:29,860
Even though she's drunk,
she still listens to you.

915
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,030
As if that's true.

916
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:34,100
She's doing everything
I don't want her to do.

917
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:37,610
How can a CEO of a brewery...

918
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:40,780
get wasted all the time
whenever she has...

919
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,240
a chance to drink?

920
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:46,450
She must be tired
from making nuruk today.

921
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:51,250
Exactly. That's why this brewery...

922
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,150
should be run by you.

923
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:55,260
Sorry?

924
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,360
I know my daughter well.

925
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:59,660
She's not cut out
to be an entrepreneur.

926
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:03,670
Learn a lot so you can take over
since you're the smart one.

927
00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:04,830
Gosh, no.

928
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:08,040
I'd rather be her assistant
who lends her a hand.

929
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,240
But the brewery
has been in the Oh family!

930
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,470
It should be your responsibility.

931
00:56:11,710 --> 00:56:12,870
Who else?

932
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,130
Dad.

933
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:33,930
Have you eaten?

934
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,560
Yes.

935
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,630
Are you all right?

936
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:40,540
Of course. I'm fine.

937
00:56:42,370 --> 00:56:44,840
Thanks to you
bravely telling me about it,

938
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:47,540
I was able to assess the situation
and sort things out.

939
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:50,750
That reminds me. Your mom and I
submitted our divorce papers today.

940
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,980
I know. I talked to Mom.

941
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,080
Yeoung Ju,

942
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:58,650
your mom...

943
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:02,260
may not have been a good wife to me,

944
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,690
but to you,

945
00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:07,700
she is a devoted mother.

946
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:08,700
So...

947
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,730
put your trust in her
and study hard.

948
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:13,470
Also,

949
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,040
know that I'm always on your side,

950
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:17,610
sweetheart.

951
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,110
Sure.

952
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:25,110
We'll talk again soon.

953
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:42,100
Chun Soo.

954
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:44,300
May I come in?

955
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,600
Sure.

956
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,670
Come in.

957
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:59,150
What's that?

958
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,850
I wanted to sleep
in your room tonight.

959
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:04,720
I'm fine,

960
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,150
so don't worry
and sleep comfortably in your room.

961
00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:07,820
It's not that.

962
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,430
I wanted to sleep next to you,
that's all.

963
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,160
Lie down already.

964
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,040
Sure.

965
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:25,140
Let me lie down with my baby brother
for the first time in a while.

966
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:37,420
Lying with you in the same room
reminds me of the old days.

967
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:42,960
The five brothers used to sleep
in the same room often.

968
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:49,460
Do you remember?

969
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,100
In winter, Jang Soo...

970
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,870
would serve dongchimi noodles...

971
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,470
in this huge bowl
for us to enjoy together.

972
00:58:58,740 --> 00:58:59,740
Yes.

973
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:01,410
Of course, I remember that.

974
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:07,220
Dongchimi noodles
always come to mind in winter.

975
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:12,220
I miss Jang Soo.

976
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,460
Tell me about it.

977
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:21,100
For some reason,
I miss him a lot today.

978
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:35,940
Do you think he's watching over us?

979
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:38,780
Of course.

980
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:42,580
"Don't feel intimidated."

981
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:45,290
"I'm up here rooting for you."

982
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,690
That's what he'll be shouting.

983
00:59:53,900 --> 00:59:55,030
You're right.

984
00:59:57,870 --> 00:59:58,930
I am.

985
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,120
I feel like I'll die.

986
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:29,730
What is the matter with you?

987
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,330
Is smelling alcohol here
all day long not enough?

988
01:00:32,770 --> 01:00:36,400
Did you have to go out
and get hammered?

989
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:41,740
I didn't get hammered.

990
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:44,480
I was there on business...

991
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:48,580
Don't you dare call it business.

992
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,150
Do you call...

993
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:52,350
giving Chairman Han
the taxi fare "business?"

994
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:59,860
I gave Chairman Han the taxi fare?
Who? Me?

995
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:03,130
Do you remember coming home
in his car?

996
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,900
I don't believe you.

997
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:12,540
Aren't you too old
to be blacking out from drinking?

998
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,110
That's odd.

999
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:18,910
I swear I got into a taxi
outside the hotel.

1000
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:20,920
Darn you.

1001
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:24,420
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

1002
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,520
Come in.

1003
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:34,960
Good morning, sir.

1004
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,230
I didn't sleep well,

1005
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:42,840
so it's not a good morning for me.

1006
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:49,840
I had a lot to drink last night.

1007
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,780
I hope I didn't say anything
out of line.

1008
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:57,120
It's better if you don't know.

1009
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:04,990
You spoke out of line to me
due to a misunderstanding,

1010
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:08,600
and I was rude to you
because I was drunk.

1011
01:02:12,170 --> 01:02:14,070
Could we call it even?

1012
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:25,050
I'll be careful from now on.

1013
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:30,150
I'm sorry for being a nuisance.

1014
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:35,590
CEO Ma.

1015
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:39,430
You are a nuisance.

1016
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,600
But...

1017
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:49,240
I don't dislike you.

1018
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:41,460
(For Eagle Brothers)

1019
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:44,230
You're doing this
to get somewhere with me.

1020
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:46,960
Aren't you doing this
to win points with my family?

1021
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:49,360
- I am!
- This is madness.

1022
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:52,730
Why don't you take a chance
and change your style?

1023
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:55,940
Have you fallen for someone?

1024
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,670
I'm asking you a question.

1025
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:59,510
Have you fallen for someone?

1026
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:02,380
I think my heart's acting up.

1027
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:05,310
I think it's
an early-stage myocardial infarction.

1028
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:07,950
It has to be serious.

1029
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:09,650
I'm gravely ill.
