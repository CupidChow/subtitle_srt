(Eagle Brewery)

2
00:00:02,910 --> 00:00:04,080
Hold on a second!

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,250
Who are you...

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,880
to paint someone innocent
as a briber?

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,490
Don't you think
you're too stuck-up about things?

6
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:18,059
My personality isn't the issue.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,329
The issue lies with
your attitude and actions.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,690
I'll warn you one last time.

9
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:25,429
Should anything like this
happen again,

10
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:28,170
I'll cancel the contract
with you as a supplier.

11
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,399
What?

12
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:32,140
I warned you loud and clear.

13
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,009
I'll cancel the contract.

14
00:00:43,009 --> 00:00:45,520
(Eagle Brewery)

15
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,520
Look here.

16
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,259
- Step on it, will you?
- Yes, sir.

17
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:56,590
Roll down your window.

18
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,159
Hey, let's talk.

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,570
Hey.

20
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,939
Roll down your window.

21
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,670
But...

22
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,340
Hey, wait!

23
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:09,640
Seriously?

24
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:13,010
Shoot.

25
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,810
That man just now
is the chairman of LX Hotel?

26
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,250
That's what I said.

27
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,579
He seems to know you personally.

28
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,989
We crossed paths a few times,

29
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,819
and I got the contract with LX Hotel
because he introduced...

30
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:25,560
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli to his people.

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,560
I see.

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,790
How did he know
I was your mom though?

33
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,030
The second he saw me,

34
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,359
he said,
"I'm here to see your daughter."

35
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,170
We look alike,
so he probably guessed.

36
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,540
He's a charismatic man.

37
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,040
Maybe it's because
he's the chairman of a luxury hotel,

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,579
but there was a light
shining behind him.

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,040
Darn, that jerk.

40
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,950
- Who?
- Who else?

41
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,680
The chairman of LX Hotel, of course.

42
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,879
Why would you say he's a jerk?

43
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,989
He made me look like a swindler
handing out bribes.

44
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,250
That ticked me off!

45
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:05,930
I apologize, sir.

46
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:08,300
I'll make sure
this doesn't happen again.

47
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,740
Good job today.

48
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,039
Thank you.

49
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,300
Dad.

50
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:18,939
Good night.

51
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,710
Hello, Chairman Han.

52
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,349
Yes, hello.

53
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,979
Well,

54
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:25,949
I went to Jinhae...

55
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:27,520
to give Gyeol some side dishes...

56
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,319
and ran into Bom at the hospital.

57
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,689
You went all the way to Jinhae...

58
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:35,360
to give him side dishes?

59
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:37,460
If your wife were still alive,

60
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,030
she would've visited him
even in Jeju.

61
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,939
I should care for him now
in her place.

62
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:45,639
Right.

63
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,240
You should've told me...

64
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,280
that you were going
to see your brother.

65
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,379
Oh, that.

66
00:02:51,979 --> 00:02:53,879
It was a spontaneous decision.

67
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,979
The brave marine...

68
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:58,219
who protected Bom
from her stalker...

69
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:00,620
was injured while training.

70
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,219
Of course, she should see
how her savior is doing.

71
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,219
She had a stalker?

72
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:08,289
Who?

73
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,129
Goodness.

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,830
Did you say
I shouldn't tell Chairman Han?

75
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,909
You should've told me...

76
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:28,150
if something like that happened.

77
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,319
Why am I hearing about this
so much later...

78
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,780
from someone else?

79
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:34,319
I'm sorry.

80
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:37,990
You're suffering from
insomnia as is,

81
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,030
and I didn't want you to lose sleep
over my matter as well.

82
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,389
It's still wrong.

83
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,229
How could I not know...

84
00:03:44,229 --> 00:03:46,360
about the safety
of my only daughter?

85
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:49,930
Who was the jerk?

86
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,969
What kind of jerk would do
such a thing to my daughter?

87
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:54,870
He was a friend from college.

88
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,939
He's a bit mentally unstable
and prone to paranoia.

89
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,479
His family apologized
and promised to get him treated.

90
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,020
It's under trial now.

91
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:06,520
What if he shows up again?

92
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,189
The police issued
a restraining order,

93
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,590
so you don't have to worry.

94
00:04:11,789 --> 00:04:13,860
Anyway, if anything like that
happens again,

95
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:16,790
you should tell me right away. Okay?

96
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:18,860
Yes, I will.

97
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,000
- Let's drink.
- Hey.

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,269
It's been a long time.

99
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:25,540
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

100
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,970
- Hey.
- I'll be right back.

101
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,639
- Gosh, seriously.
- It's all right.

102
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,379
Who are you waiting for?

103
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,420
Well, Chun Soo.

104
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,790
He told me he'd come,
but is running late.

105
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,519
I should call him
to see where he is now.

106
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:45,759
Don't bother.

107
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:48,290
He'd be too upset
to come to a school reunion.

108
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:49,930
Why would he be?

109
00:04:50,129 --> 00:04:51,160
Did you not hear that?

110
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:52,930
Chun Soo got fired.

111
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:55,069
Come on. That's no big deal.

112
00:04:55,399 --> 00:04:56,970
It's nothing unusual...

113
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,069
- for people of our age.
- Sure.

114
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,810
It's not just that he got fired.

115
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,310
He lost all his money...

116
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,939
while running a business
with an acquaintance.

117
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,509
And now he's just broke
and living in a gosiwon.

118
00:05:07,709 --> 00:05:09,649
Come on. That can't be true.

119
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:12,420
- See? I told you.
- Hey, even if he got fired...

120
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,949
and failed in his business,

121
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,149
he's still the Oh Chun Soo
with a brilliant mind.

122
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,089
How would he live in a gosiwon?

123
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,259
I also found it hard to believe.

124
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,329
But there's someone
who has seen it firsthand.

125
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,459
Then there should be
no money changing hands.

126
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,500
Why? Did Chun Soo try
to borrow money from you?

127
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:30,100
It's not like that.

128
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:32,670
He has never shown up
at the school reunion before.

129
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:33,870
Why would he suddenly want to come?

130
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,610
I bet he's coming to ask us a favor.

131
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,939
- Come on. That's crossing the line.
- I know.

132
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,079
We're meeting again
after a long time.

133
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,680
Let's just say good things.

134
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,420
All right. Let's drink.

135
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,819
- All right. Have a drink.
- Okay.

136
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,819
I guess you're upset...

137
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:50,819
because we're speaking ill
of your first love.

138
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,120
What?

139
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,589
- Stop drinking.
- What?

140
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,759
- Hi, guys.
- Hey. Come here.

141
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,959
- Hi, Chun Soo.
- It's been a long time.

142
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,060
- Hi.
- Hey.

143
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,300
- Come here.
- It's been a while.

144
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,629
- Have you been doing well?
- Yes.

145
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:03,699
- Good to see you again.
- You too.

146
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,870
Hey, how are you?

147
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,670
Hey, long time no see.

148
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:07,709
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

149
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,209
- Why are you so late?
- I'm sorry.

150
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,410
I was out of town,
so it took me some time.

151
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,480
I'm glad you made it.

152
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,709
All right.

153
00:06:15,379 --> 00:06:16,579
The traffic was bad.

154
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:18,220
You must be hungry.

155
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,490
- Eat.
- Okay.

156
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:34,430
You two look good together.

157
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:37,970
Now that you two are
sitting together,

158
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:41,410
you make a cute couple.

159
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,810
- Aren't they a perfect match?
- My gosh.

160
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,110
Hey, you're drunk.

161
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:46,339
- You should stop drinking.
- Why?

162
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:49,379
When else would I get drunk
if not on a day like this?

163
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:52,379
I'm feeling great. Don't ruin it.

164
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:53,550
Let's just finish the food
and leave.

165
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:56,589
I just got here.
Are we leaving already?

166
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:58,360
I'm not feeling well.

167
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,060
Why? Are you sick?

168
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:05,360
- You startled me.
- It's not too late.

169
00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:08,699
Mi Sun, you're
in the middle of a divorce.

170
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:16,470
- You're just talking nonsense.
- She's...

171
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,310
My gosh. You must be really drunk.

172
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,980
I'm fine. Why do you keep saying
I'm drunk?

173
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,180
Mi Sun's husband...

174
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,819
had an affair with his secretary,
so she's getting a divorce.

175
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,319
That's what you told me.
She's being ridiculous.

176
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,759
- She's the one who told me that.
- I didn't mean to tell her.

177
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,189
It just came up.

178
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:36,589
Mi Sun, I'm really sorry.

179
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,399
It's not too late. You two...

180
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,329
should be together.

181
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,870
Chun Soo, you live alone,
and your family is abroad.

182
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,610
Right? You told me that.

183
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,670
What's wrong with you?

184
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:50,339
- What's wrong?
- I'll call a cab.

185
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:51,740
Can you take her home?

186
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,480
Sure. I'll do that.

187
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,750
- Hey, let's go.
- Why?

188
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,550
- I don't want to go.
- Just come.

189
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,480
- She's so drunk.
- Let me be honest!

190
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,649
Your husband's affair would hurt you
if you were younger.

191
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:05,519
But at our age,
shouldn't you be grateful...

192
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,959
that he's walking away on his own?

193
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:10,459
If you're that jealous,
get divorced too.

194
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,300
What?

195
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,740
Don't be so hung up
on your cheating husband...

196
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,769
and just get a divorce like me.

197
00:08:20,769 --> 00:08:23,139
My lawyer is good. Do you want me
to give you the number?

198
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,240
Hey, Mun Mi Sun.

199
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,509
Watch your tongue!

200
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:31,819
- Hey, you crazy brat!
- Hey. Stop it.

201
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:33,250
- Stop her!
- Hey!

202
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,350
- What are you doing?
- Stop it!

203
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,220
- Hey!
- Get off of her!

204
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,059
- Let go of it.
- Don't be like that.

205
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,960
- Hey! You!
- Stop it!

206
00:08:46,899 --> 00:08:48,169
Hey, stop it.

207
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:49,769
Mi Sun, don't do that.

208
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,700
Stop it.

209
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,990
- Here.
- It's okay.

210
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:14,659
It's no big deal.
I don't need a relaxing pill.

211
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,490
Stop acting so cool
and just take it.

212
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:22,330
Let's share it.
You must be in shock now.

213
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,200
I'm fine.

214
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,740
Take this.

215
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:33,340
Go ahead.

216
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,470
It's not like we're schoolchildren.
I can't believe this.

217
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,440
It was
the elementary school reunion.

218
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:03,639
I guess we all went back in time.

219
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,279
I'm sorry I lied.

220
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,350
When I was
in the midst of a divorce lawsuit,

221
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,220
I pretended I was happily married.

222
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,190
You don't have to say that.

223
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,789
What she said is true.

224
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,230
That jerk had an affair
with his young secretary.

225
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,600
He even had a child
without me knowing.

226
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:38,980
I was the fool
for not noticing it for ten years.

227
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,610
How is it your fault?

228
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,379
The one who fooled you is at fault.

229
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,090
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

230
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,470
Can I tell you
something embarrassing too?

231
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,299
Actually,

232
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:07,870
there's something I didn't tell you.

233
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:12,740
I'm unemployed.

234
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:15,309
I got fired.

235
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,019
Why are you laughing?

236
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,889
The guys told me that
before you arrived.

237
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:26,759
What?

238
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,960
Gosh, there are no secrets
in this world.

239
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:38,000
Then we can call it even now.

240
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:39,639
Right?

241
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,440
Sure.

242
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,139
Call it even.

243
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,149
Oh, dear.

244
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,490
(Chairman Jang Je Hyeong
announces his marriage.)

245
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:10,029
Ha Ni, I'm coming.

246
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,539
Are you feeling better
in a fresh diaper?

247
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,740
I'll be right back
with your milk, okay?

248
00:12:19,309 --> 00:12:20,980
All right. That's my girl.

249
00:12:21,549 --> 00:12:22,879
Wait here.

250
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:31,490
I'll be right back.

251
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,799
To be honest,
I don't know if I can raise her.

252
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,070
I'm sick of the burden...

253
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:47,299
that has been laid on me!

254
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,809
Darn it.

255
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,159
I also have mine.

256
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,090
Don't poke your nose in my business.

257
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,090
What do you mean?
You say that like we're strangers.

258
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:10,559
That'd actually be better.

259
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:17,429
Darn it. Seriously...

260
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:31,679
Gosh.

261
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
Darn it.

262
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,190
You're old enough to know better.

263
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:43,659
The only thing you can cook
is the cup noodles?

264
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:45,629
I can cook instant noodles too.

265
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:47,200
As if there's any difference.

266
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,200
Can you even cook rice?

267
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,039
I've never tried cooking rice.

268
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,210
Don't I just put rice and water...

269
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,940
in the rice cooker and press "cook?"

270
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:03,279
My gosh. That darn woman.

271
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,320
Didn't she teach you anything?

272
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,049
I'm home.

273
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,649
Hi, Mom.

274
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:12,490
Good for you.

275
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:14,960
You left to take food
to someone else's son,

276
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,659
so your husband and daughter
are eating cup ramyeon.

277
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,529
How is he someone else's son?

278
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,230
He'll be my son-in-law soon.

279
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,740
Send Se Ri
to cooking class immediately.

280
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:27,870
What?
Why should I take cooking classes?

281
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,509
Will you serve cup ramyeon...

282
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,710
to your future father-in-law
and just say,

283
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:32,840
"Here's some hot water?"

284
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:36,250
Set the table!

285
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,820
He's so annoying.

286
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,720
Why should I learn how to cook?

287
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,190
That's why people mock him
for being lame.

288
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:52,399
Don't mind anything he says.

289
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,200
Why should you
take cooking classes...

290
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:57,970
when soon
you'll be managing LX Hotel?

291
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:01,139
Will you stop
talking about that hotel?

292
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,039
It's stressing me out.

293
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:08,779
Why is my princess
in a foul mood today?

294
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,409
Did something happen on campus?

295
00:15:11,179 --> 00:15:14,590
Hey. Is the new professor
still tormenting you?

296
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,289
No. He's not like that.

297
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:21,860
He's nice.

298
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,000
You said
you got to supply LX Hotel...

299
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,129
because the chairman helped out.

300
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:32,039
And all you gave him to say thanks
was a crate of makgeolli?

301
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:34,370
Wasn't he here...

302
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,840
because he was offended
by the trivial gift?

303
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,710
Didn't you hear what he said?

304
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,980
He doesn't want gifts of any sort.

305
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,320
How could you be that naive
and take his words at face value?

306
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,519
He meant you shouldn't make do
with something small.

307
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,289
Stop talking nonsense, Mom.

308
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:53,320
Go to your room and sleep.

309
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:55,389
I have to make a delivery
at the crack of dawn.

310
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,470
Give and take
is the basic rule of business.

311
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,970
You'll never find someone
who doesn't like freebies.

312
00:16:07,669 --> 00:16:09,169
You don't know anything.

313
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:15,809
How is a crate of makgeolli a bribe?

314
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,250
He's so weird.

315
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,070
Hi, Gyeol.

316
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,870
You're worried about Bom, right?

317
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:42,710
Sorry, Dad.

318
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:45,509
I can't do anything
about a past incident,

319
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,580
but from now on,
don't even dream of keeping secrets.

320
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:51,009
Discuss everything with me.

321
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,019
I kept it from you
so you wouldn't worry.

322
00:16:53,419 --> 00:16:54,750
I shouldn't have.

323
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,490
One more thing.

324
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,120
What's your relationship with Se Ri?

325
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,159
What?

326
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,059
If there's nothing between you two,

327
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:05,500
her mother would have no reason
to bring you food.

328
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,029
Jinhae's not exactly close to Seoul.

329
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,630
I was going to tell you
after I got discharged.

330
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:12,839
Dad.

331
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,539
I want to marry Se Ri.

332
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,880
You don't object, do you?

333
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,779
I've known Se Ri
since she was little,

334
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:25,619
and our families are friends.

335
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,250
Why would I object?

336
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,890
Okay.

337
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,960
Let's discuss the details in person.

338
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Bye.

339
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,900
Why do the kids...

340
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:41,930
have so many secrets?

341
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,779
What's wrong with the wine?

342
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:01,819
Did all that makgeolli...

343
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,960
change my taste buds or something?

344
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,109
The store at the crossroads wants...

345
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:29,410
five more boxes.

346
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:32,349
Shouldn't we hire someone
to handle the deliveries?

347
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,319
Why should we hire someone...

348
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:36,849
when the three of us
can take turns going out?

349
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,720
I want a subordinate
to boss about too.

350
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,390
Just you wait.

351
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:44,130
If sales go up a bit more,
I'll hire someone...

352
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,930
and promote you to section chief.
No, department head.

353
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,240
You look very pleased.

354
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:54,099
Hey.

355
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,339
Hello?

356
00:18:55,339 --> 00:18:58,410
Hello. I'm Kim Sang Yi
with KBC Morning News.

357
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:01,009
"KBC Morning News?"

358
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:04,450
I got your number from LX Hotel.

359
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,880
I'd like to interview you, Ms. Ma.

360
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,450
You want to interview me?

361
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:16,829
I did as you told
and looked into Eagle Brewery...

362
00:19:16,829 --> 00:19:18,599
in terms of their assets
and financial status.

363
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:19,930
And?

364
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,200
After the last CEO's sudden death,

365
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,900
they released a new product,

366
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,240
and it's a fact that they had
some financial troubles.

367
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:30,009
But I don't believe
there's anything to worry about.

368
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,180
As of right now,

369
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,210
there are no concerns?

370
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,250
That's right.

371
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,920
There is one thing, sir.

372
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,220
The rumor that Ms. Ma...

373
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,220
took a huge gamble
to take over the brewery...

374
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,190
against the wishes
of her brothers-in-law.

375
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:48,160
That was true.

376
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:52,660
There was disorder and strife
within the family, then.

377
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,799
I can't say for sure
if the strife was due to...

378
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,769
the brothers-in-law owning a stake,

379
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,369
but right now,
none of the former CEO's brothers...

380
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:03,009
have a say
in the brewery's operations.

381
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,640
- Good job.
- Yes, sir.

382
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,980
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

383
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:17,349
What Mr. Dokgo said
doesn't seem to be entirely false.

384
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,990
He's been feeling discomfort
in the ears.

385
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,900
He had a severe case
of middle ear inflammation as a kid.

386
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,630
The doctor says
it could be an aftereffect of that.

387
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:30,970
If he had that problem,

388
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,599
he should've come to us.

389
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:35,609
He struggled with it on his own.

390
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,440
He should quit...

391
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,640
if diving could cause
loss of hearing.

392
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,950
I've been thinking.

393
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,079
Kang Soo will stay with me
when he moves back to Seoul.

394
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:47,220
Aren't you bringing your wife back
from the US?

395
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,190
She'll understand.

396
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:52,019
We all know what your wife's like.

397
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,059
Do you want to torture a sick kid?

398
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,660
Yes. Kang Soo can stay with me.

399
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,299
We shared a room as kids anyway.

400
00:20:58,359 --> 00:20:59,660
Forget it.

401
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,829
You must be exhausted
from all the teaching and childcare.

402
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:04,299
You both can forget it.

403
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,970
I'm single.
Kang Soo can stay with me.

404
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
You?

405
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,910
Yes. He has a pretty face,
and he's fit too.

406
00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:15,980
I should help him debut.

407
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,250
Will you be serious? That's stupid.

408
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,720
Why is that stupid?

409
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:21,990
I was in the entertainment industry.

410
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,049
I'll use all my experience...

411
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,990
to make Kang Soo a star.

412
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:27,960
I'll look after him.

413
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,829
What he wants is most important.

414
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:34,599
Let's hear what his plan is...

415
00:21:34,599 --> 00:21:36,230
and meet again to discuss.

416
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,500
Okay.

417
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,769
He said he'd been thinking about it
for a while.

418
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,069
He must have some kind of idea.

419
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:45,410
Oh, dear.

420
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:55,250
Hello, Professor.

421
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:57,390
Hi. I heard from the TA.

422
00:21:57,390 --> 00:21:58,460
I look forward to your help.

423
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,859
Did I pass, then?

424
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:02,329
Don't be silly.

425
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,230
I'll be in your debt.

426
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,099
What do you need my help with?

427
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:09,630
Looking up the material I need
will be your main job.

428
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:11,700
Searching for
and printing research papers,

429
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,740
and borrowing books
from the library.

430
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:16,109
Okay. I'm good at that.

431
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,210
I hope we get along.

432
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,309
Yes, sir.

433
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,019
Hello? Ms. Kim, it's me.

434
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,500
Welcome.

435
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:41,200
Here.

436
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:44,269
Gosh. You got me hallabong.

437
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:46,640
It's a bribe from me to you...

438
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,839
before my first lesson.

439
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:49,440
Come on in.

440
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,410
Here. Please try one.

441
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,079
Sure.

442
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,490
Sour flavors don't seem
to agree with you.

443
00:23:06,759 --> 00:23:08,990
I'm afraid so.
I must look like a fool.

444
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:10,859
Actually, I find it cute.

445
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:14,900
I mean...

446
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,470
I know this is a boring question,

447
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:24,569
but why haven't you married
when you come from a good family...

448
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,240
and are a beauty yourself?

449
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,009
Well,

450
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:32,519
it's because I haven't met someone
who's my destiny.

451
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:36,319
What about you?
Why are you still single?

452
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:41,859
My biggest issue is
that I'm not financially stable yet.

453
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:44,460
That's ridiculous.

454
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,359
When you meet someone
who's your destiny,

455
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,900
financial problems
won't be an issue.

456
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:52,869
The one who's better off
can support the other.

457
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,210
Please have another.

458
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:00,609
I see you still have some left.

459
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:08,750
(Angel Piano)

460
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,789
Whoever it is sucks.

461
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:19,029
My gosh.

462
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:20,799
What...

463
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:24,869
Goodness.

464
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,500
- Not like that.
- No?

465
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,869
Play it with just this hand.

466
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:29,470
What are those two doing?

467
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:31,809
It's still too bright outside
to be glued to each other.

468
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:32,839
Shouldn't they move together?

469
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,410
- Gosh, no.
- No?

470
00:24:34,609 --> 00:24:35,750
- Mr. Oh!
- What?

471
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,480
- I can't do it.
- Mr. Oh, come on.

472
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,990
Try it again.

473
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,289
Oh, well.

474
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,029
I told you before that I was taking
lessons from Ms. Kim.

475
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:52,599
This is my first lesson.

476
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,730
What brings you by unannounced?

477
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,529
I doubt you're here
for a lesson yourself.

478
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:02,670
I'm too busy to take piano lessons.

479
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:05,809
I came by to say this for sure...

480
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,450
before you moved
your academy elsewhere.

481
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:10,710
Let me see.

482
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,980
The soundproof rooms...

483
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,680
should be returned
to their original state.

484
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,420
Return the partition walls
to their original state too.

485
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,759
Ms. Ji,
didn't I talk to you about this?

486
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:25,230
You two are the same class members.
Please be considerate to each other.

487
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:27,359
You can't force her
to leave like this.

488
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,970
Stay out of it, Mr. Oh!

489
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:32,170
It's not because
Ms. Kim has nowhere to go.

490
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:34,769
She grew attached
to the kids in this neighborhood...

491
00:25:35,069 --> 00:25:36,769
and doesn't want to part ways.

492
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,170
Mr. Oh.

493
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,710
I'm all right,
so please don't get worked up.

494
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,880
We should talk alone.

495
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,119
I'll say this again.

496
00:25:53,259 --> 00:25:56,730
This is a business deal
between me and Ms. Kim,

497
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,759
so stay out of it.

498
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,799
Her landlord ego is
through the roof.

499
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:14,480
Darn.

500
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:17,250
I'm annoyed and stressed out as is,

501
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,079
but you're making me see red.

502
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:23,490
My gosh, that tone...

503
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,589
You sound the sweetest
in Mr. Oh's presence,

504
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:31,900
but you switched up your tone
now that we're alone.

505
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:33,299
That's why...

506
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,700
I warned you.

507
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:39,400
Study more before you come at me,
you callow cow.

508
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,539
Why you...

509
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,140
Who exactly are you?

510
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,849
How many masks do you have on?

511
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,049
What's it to you?

512
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,220
Whether I wear 10 or 100 masks
is none of your business.

513
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,849
I suggest you worry about
your own life instead.

514
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:01,059
- What?
- I say this loud and clear.

515
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,390
I won't leave this neighborhood.

516
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,700
Holding out won't do you any good.

517
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,200
We'll see...

518
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,569
who ends up losing more.

519
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:18,140
Why that...

520
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,839
Who on earth is she really?

521
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,779
I'll be the one...

522
00:27:24,549 --> 00:27:26,480
to unmask that witch.

523
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:31,490
(Eagle Brewery)

524
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,990
I came up with the proposal,

525
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,559
but I thought
you should go over it...

526
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,400
before I handed it in
to their head office.

527
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:41,799
Goodness me.

528
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:46,839
Great job, Chun Soo.

529
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:50,809
Please go over the main points...

530
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:52,910
and share any good ideas you have.

531
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:54,940
I'll read it as quickly as possible.

532
00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:00,849
By the way, I might be on the news.

533
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,450
The news?

534
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,619
A KBC reporter called
and asked for an interview...

535
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:07,420
about our makgeolli being supplied
to LX Hotel.

536
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,329
It'll be filmed
at the brewery tomorrow.

537
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,500
That's great.

538
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,529
I can't believe
Eagle Brewery will be on the news.

539
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:17,470
You're amazing.

540
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:20,640
It's all thanks to Jang Soo.

541
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:30,009
To celebrate Kang Soo's discharge
from the hospital...

542
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,509
and my appearance on the news,

543
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,480
let's all go to Jinhae...

544
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,519
and party.

545
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:43,759
What is it?

546
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,099
Is something up?

547
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:49,430
Once Kang Soo gets discharged,

548
00:28:50,529 --> 00:28:52,170
we'll have to bring him to Seoul.

549
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Why?

550
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,470
It seems
he'll have to leave the service.

551
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,980
But I heard
he was recovering just fine.

552
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,809
Did his case worsen?

553
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:05,720
As a kid, he had a severe case
of middle ear inflammation.

554
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:08,619
Constant deep-water training
in the Marines...

555
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,750
led to an ear disorder.

556
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,720
But Kang Soo never said anything.

557
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,289
Things are already hectic for you
with the brewery.

558
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,200
He probably didn't want
to worry you.

559
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,230
Is it serious?

560
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,099
The doctor said...

561
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:27,740
he could lose his hearing
if he continues diving deep.

562
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,509
So following this injury,
he won't extend his enlistment...

563
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:33,640
and will choose to be discharged.

564
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:39,819
That poor thing.

565
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:45,019
Welcome.

566
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:48,890
Hey, you're here.

567
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,990
I just dropped by
after visiting my sister-in-law.

568
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:53,230
Did you get to rest well last night?

569
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,900
The embarrassment kept me up.

570
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,670
What?

571
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,839
I was embarrassed
for making a fool of myself.

572
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:06,079
Didn't we agree
to call it even last night?

573
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,980
I slept like a baby
thinking that was our agreement.

574
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:13,650
- Coffee for a hangover cure?
- Sounds good.

575
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,720
Catch.

576
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,960
How's the lawsuit going?

577
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,930
I was told
not to save money on lawyers,

578
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,769
so I hired one
with a good reputation.

579
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,369
I'm getting what I paid for.

580
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,769
I might become rich
once I receive the alimony.

581
00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:38,410
Right.

582
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:41,339
Time will solve it for you,
so don't stress yourself out.

583
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,579
That I should.

584
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,150
By the way,

585
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,380
would you like to take these?

586
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:49,849
What are they?

587
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,960
They just passed
the expiration date and...

588
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,960
(Waste)

589
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:57,329
I always take them home too.
Don't if it feels iffy.

590
00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:00,430
Why would I think that?
I'd actually be grateful.

591
00:31:03,099 --> 00:31:04,700
They just passed
the expiration date?

592
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:05,839
Yes.

593
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,740
These look delicious.

594
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:17,410
Don't skip meals
just because you live alone...

595
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,480
and make sure to eat well.

596
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:22,450
Those are enough.

597
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,920
I'm going to the US in a few days.

598
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:26,660
Is that so?

599
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:28,859
Your family will be so happy.

600
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:29,960
Right.

601
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,660
I think I'll have my daughter
go to a boarding school...

602
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,430
and come back with my wife.

603
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,599
Goodness.

604
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:39,099
You're finally done
being a husband who lives alone.

605
00:31:39,099 --> 00:31:40,200
Congratulations.

606
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,369
- Thanks.
- Right.

607
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,440
Eat well until you leave,

608
00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:47,710
- and have a safe trip.
- Thanks.

609
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,779
I'll probably see you
when you get back.

610
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,680
I guess.

611
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,250
Be well until I get back.

612
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,829
What's the occasion?

613
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:05,400
I didn't expect...

614
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,559
a scrooge like you
to take us out to a top-class hotel.

615
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,930
You were on my case
about only asking you for food,

616
00:32:11,829 --> 00:32:13,970
so I'm treating you
to get on your good side.

617
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:17,309
Why? We can leave
if you're not satisfied.

618
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:20,480
Why wouldn't I be satisfied?
I love it, of course.

619
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:25,250
This hotel will soon be Se Ri's.

620
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:26,680
Mom, please.

621
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,819
Someone will hear you.

622
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,190
Please don't say things like that.

623
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,490
So what if people hear me?

624
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:36,490
You'll soon be the daughter-in-law
of the hotel's chairman.

625
00:32:37,329 --> 00:32:39,660
I couldn't care less
about the hotel.

626
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,700
When will you grow up?

627
00:32:44,069 --> 00:32:45,940
Teach her how to be a good wife,
will you?

628
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,170
Why should I do that...

629
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,210
when the hotel has a restaurant,
a laundry service,

630
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,240
and cleaners?

631
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,779
There's nothing that isn't here.

632
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,740
Se Ri.

633
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,180
You will live...

634
00:32:57,049 --> 00:32:59,380
without getting a drop of water
on your hands.

635
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,920
It's enough for me
to have a hard time...

636
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,450
doing household chores.

637
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:03,549
Okay?

638
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,690
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

639
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:15,670
You came with all your family today.

640
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:19,339
Yes. We're dining out together
in a while.

641
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,839
I'm glad you're here.

642
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,410
Maybe it's because
it's been a while,

643
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,609
but you look even prettier.

644
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,140
Pardon?

645
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:29,809
Thank you.

646
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,920
You should visit my place sometime.

647
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,680
I hope to see you more often.

648
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,319
Yes, I will.

649
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:43,759
Chairman Piccoli has arrived.

650
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:47,660
Please excuse me.
I have an appointment.

651
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,809
He'd give us the cold shoulder.
What's gotten into him?

652
00:33:56,809 --> 00:33:58,140
He came over to talk to us?

653
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,380
I guess
he heard something from Gyeol.

654
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,480
I bet that's what it is.

655
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,449
My goodness.

656
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:14,320
I'll take your recommendation
for a drink.

657
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,789
A Korean liquor, please.

658
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:18,630
Shall we start with a drink...

659
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,900
that our hotel has just launched...

660
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:24,170
with our makgeolli,
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

661
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,300
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli? A new drink?

662
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:28,969
I'm looking forward to it.

663
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,110
Get him Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

664
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,289
- Please enjoy it.
- Thank you.

665
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,829
My gosh. Hey.

666
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:52,030
(Gyeol)

667
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,900
What are you doing?
Hurry and answer the phone.

668
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,670
Hi, Gyeol.

669
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,599
I'm having dinner
with Mom and Dad at LX Hotel.

670
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,070
What?

671
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,110
Hang on.

672
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,809
He wants to talk to you, Dad.

673
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:10,809
Me?

674
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:17,320
Hi. It's been a while.

675
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:20,289
Yes. I'm always healthy.

676
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:24,429
Actually, I just met your dad
and talked to him.

677
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,400
All right. After you finish
your military service next month,

678
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,099
we should work out
together sometime. Okay.

679
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:34,340
Take good care of your health.
All right.

680
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:38,739
Gyeol.

681
00:35:40,409 --> 00:35:42,510
Yes. Enjoy your dinner.

682
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,780
Bye.

683
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,519
Chairman Han taught him well
at home.

684
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:53,190
He's polite and respectful
to his elders.

685
00:35:53,789 --> 00:35:57,559
That's why I have my eye on him
as a potential son-in-law.

686
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,690
I chose him.

687
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:01,860
You do have an eye for men.

688
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:06,900
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

689
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:12,309
Are you done?

690
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,880
I just lost my appetite.

691
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,010
Why?

692
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,949
I made myself clear
so that he could understand.

693
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:19,579
What on earth is he thinking?

694
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:22,550
What do you mean?

695
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:25,250
Just finish your food
so that we can leave.

696
00:36:29,059 --> 00:36:30,329
- Do you want me to go first?
- No.

697
00:36:30,329 --> 00:36:32,900
- Let's hurry and eat.
- Okay. We will hurry.

698
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,139
I'm home.

699
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:43,409
Thank you for your hard work,
CEO Ma.

700
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,539
What are you doing still up?

701
00:36:48,909 --> 00:36:51,150
People from the broadcasting station
are coming tomorrow.

702
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:55,280
It's not like you're the one
being interviewed.

703
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:57,619
I'm the CEO's mom,
so I should look nice.

704
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,360
By the way, Mom,

705
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:05,159
isn't this house too big
for just the two of us?

706
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,699
We have many extra rooms
we don't use.

707
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:11,230
Do you want your old mom
to run a boarding house or what?

708
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,570
That's not what I'm saying.

709
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,239
When I'm at work,

710
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:17,440
you must be bored alone
at home all day.

711
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:20,880
It would be nice
if you had someone...

712
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,679
to keep you company.

713
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:24,750
Right?

714
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,650
I'm glad you brought it up.

715
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,519
You have to be successful...

716
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:32,320
and send me back to Golden Castle.

717
00:37:37,329 --> 00:37:38,630
As I told you last time,

718
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,760
the news about our hotel's service
of traditional liquor...

719
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,030
will be
on the KBC morning news tomorrow.

720
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:46,039
I had an interview yesterday.

721
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:47,469
And today, CEO Ma Kwang Sook...

722
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:49,909
of Eagle Brewery
is having an interview.

723
00:37:49,909 --> 00:37:52,309
We're on the news as a first mover?

724
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:53,809
That's a lot of pressure.

725
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:56,849
About the CEO of the brewery...

726
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,619
I hope she won't say anything stupid
out of the blue.

727
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,719
In particular, with balanced acidity
and rich bubbles,

728
00:38:03,789 --> 00:38:06,690
we aim for a sophisticated
and refreshing aftertaste.

729
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,590
I think that's why...

730
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:12,329
LX Hotel chose our liquor.

731
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:15,429
Our CEO has such a way with words.

732
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,500
It's not just that
she's a good speaker.

733
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,800
She takes after me,
so she has a small face,

734
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,909
which makes her
look better on screen.

735
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:25,440
You are taking your first step...

736
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,309
with the first makgeolli
at a luxury hotel.

737
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,110
I wonder what your future plans are.

738
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,550
This isn't just about the taste
of the liquor.

739
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:35,849
We will continue to collaborate
with LX Hotel...

740
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:37,590
to make the best liquor...

741
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:40,119
and offer our customers
emotional satisfaction...

742
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:42,190
through good design and packaging.

743
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,860
Thank you.

744
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,559
Okay. Thank you for your hard work.

745
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:49,269
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

746
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:51,599
You didn't seem nervous at all.
You did a great job.

747
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:52,840
Thank you.

748
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,500
The interview will be
on tomorrow's morning news.

749
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,940
- Okay.
- Thank you.

750
00:38:56,969 --> 00:38:58,239
Thank you.

751
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:02,710
I was so nervous.

752
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,980
I'm not sure
if I did well as I practiced.

753
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,920
I think you're gifted
in broadcasting.

754
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,980
You did a lot better
than when you practiced.

755
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:11,550
I can't believe
my daughter will be on the news.

756
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,889
It's such an honor
to our family, CEO Ma.

757
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,760
Welcome.

758
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:27,199
Hey. Did your mom
allow you to get a perm?

759
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:28,539
Yes.

760
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:31,610
That's great. Congratulations.

761
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:33,840
I told her to go to a hair salon
in the neighborhood,

762
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,579
but she insisted on coming here.

763
00:39:35,909 --> 00:39:37,780
I want to look just like you.

764
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,250
I love your hairstyle.

765
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,320
Okay. I'll make you
look the same as me.

766
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:43,719
Have a seat here.

767
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,159
Would you like some tea?

768
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:49,789
I'm fine. Where's the restroom?

769
00:39:53,429 --> 00:39:54,900
Is your name Eun Seo?

770
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,070
Yes.

771
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,869
What grade are you in?

772
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,070
I'm in fifth grade.

773
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:01,239
Do you have a boyfriend?

774
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:03,570
I got dumped a few days ago.

775
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,739
So I'm getting a perm
to make myself feel better.

776
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,150
My gosh. Why did you get dumped...

777
00:40:11,449 --> 00:40:14,250
when you were so pretty and lovely?

778
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,449
He says I'm not his type.

779
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:20,489
He likes a girl
who is smart and a model student.

780
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:23,960
Does your mom know
that you got dumped?

781
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,860
My mom isn't interested in me.

782
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,699
Come on. That can't be true.

783
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,400
I'm sure she's just busy with work.

784
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,869
I can't even call her Mom
when people are around.

785
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:39,409
What? What do you mean?

786
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:45,349
Anyway, my mom likes the piano
more than she likes me.

787
00:40:45,349 --> 00:40:47,849
I see. Does your mom play the piano?

788
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:49,250
She's a piano instructor.

789
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,559
Is your mom a schoolteacher?

790
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:53,619
Close enough.

791
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,889
Eun Seo, stop talking to her.

792
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:58,590
You don't want to bother her
at work.

793
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:12,880
(Oh Beom Soo, Out of Office)

794
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,579
Isn't he here yet?

795
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:49,210
Hello.

796
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,380
(Professor's Office)

797
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,380
Beom Soo.

798
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,159
It's been a while.

799
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,039
Jong Tae told me
that you were teaching here.

800
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,610
What brings you here?
You didn't even call me.

801
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,280
If I had called you,

802
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,449
you wouldn't have wanted to see me.

803
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:37,829
Hey, it's Ha Ni.

804
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,500
She's adorable.

805
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:51,539
Is this his older brother?

806
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,650
Oh, no. What the heck?

807
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:10,630
Silly me.

808
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,400
I have a lecture.
You have three minutes.

809
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,170
Did you see the news?

810
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:23,469
It's the hottest topic right now.

811
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:26,110
I wanted to tell you
before it got out.

812
00:43:28,309 --> 00:43:29,409
I just didn't have...

813
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,280
the courage.

814
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,949
I didn't cheat on you.

815
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:38,389
I wanted to tell you that myself.

816
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:40,420
You didn't have to bother.

817
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:43,360
Our families are friends.
I've known him since we were young.

818
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:47,030
We met in the US a few times
when I interpreted for him.

819
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:50,230
We met again over here
to discuss family matters,

820
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,469
and it led to this.

821
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:54,900
Believe me.

822
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,639
What changes if I believe you?

823
00:43:56,639 --> 00:43:57,710
I don't want...

824
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,940
Ha Ni to be ashamed of me.

825
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,179
You did the shameful stuff already.

826
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,250
Why are you doing this now?

827
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,320
Has she grown a lot?

828
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:16,659
My darling baby.

829
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:18,289
Is she doing well?

830
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,760
- Where is she?
- Why do you want to know?

831
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:23,670
This isn't easy to say,

832
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:27,039
but the chairman knows my situation.

833
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,869
He said I can bring Ha Ni.

834
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:31,469
His children are grown...

835
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:32,940
Don't be ridiculous!

836
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,480
I was just asking
about your circumstances.

837
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:39,110
It's not easy
for a man to raise a baby alone.

838
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,480
There'll be a lot to do...

839
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,219
The moment
you packed your stuff and left,

840
00:44:43,219 --> 00:44:44,619
I told you clearly...

841
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:47,789
that it would be over
if you walked out the door.

842
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:50,230
You chased money and happiness.

843
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:52,760
I won't criticize you for that,
but...

844
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,860
don't you dare mention Ha Ni again.

845
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,269
She's my daughter
and has nothing to do with you.

846
00:45:00,369 --> 00:45:02,039
- Beom Soo.
- Don't say my name.

847
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:05,909
Why are you being so cold?

848
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:07,010
Na Young Eun.

849
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:10,050
Ha Ni's the one thing I have left.

850
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:13,880
How can I be nice to the person
who wants to take her from me?

851
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,219
I'll raise her just fine
without a mom.

852
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:19,590
Focus and care about yourself.

853
00:45:20,289 --> 00:45:21,489
As you always did.

854
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:23,329
I'm not trying to take her from you.

855
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:27,030
You and Ha Ni
have always been a part of me.

856
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,329
It's almost time for my lecture.

857
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:31,269
I need you to leave.

858
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,650
I'll ask you one last thing.

859
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,250
Why did you come back?

860
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,949
You wanted to settle in the US.

861
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:50,989
You left without even turning back.

862
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,219
Why do you want to know that now?

863
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,559
Are you sure you didn't come back
to Korea for me?

864
00:45:56,329 --> 00:45:57,590
So we could start over?

865
00:45:58,690 --> 00:45:59,900
Quit the nonsense and get out.

866
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,000
If I ask for forgiveness,

867
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,769
can you take me back?

868
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,469
I'm barely able to think of you
without hating you.

869
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,110
Don't make me hate you again.

870
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,949
Now leave.

871
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,679
What did I just see?

872
00:46:57,750 --> 00:46:59,050
The weak point of economics...

873
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,789
is that it hasn't focused much
on studying the human mind...

874
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:02,889
beyond numbers.

875
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,800
When facing a crisis,
the human mind...

876
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,360
does not act rationally.

877
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:11,099
It can be quite fickle.

878
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:15,900
Each time, the economy moved
in a direction different from...

879
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,510
what numbers-based studies suggested
and in a drastic manner,

880
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:19,780
causing another crisis.

881
00:47:20,510 --> 00:47:21,809
Let's go back to the slides.

882
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,809
"If economics
fails to read the human mind,"

883
00:47:25,809 --> 00:47:28,519
"policies could be
set up to be inefficient."

884
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,619
Who'd have imagined
that our professor...

885
00:47:31,789 --> 00:47:33,389
kept that kind of secret?

886
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:35,489
Reducing taxes...

887
00:47:35,489 --> 00:47:37,059
or handing out more subsidies...

888
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:39,730
won't be enough to do
what humans want.

889
00:47:40,099 --> 00:47:41,460
I feel so sorry for him.

890
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,630
Here's another example.

891
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,309
(Angel Piano)

892
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,909
Hey. It's the kid from earlier.

893
00:47:57,809 --> 00:47:59,619
My mom isn't interested in me.

894
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:02,150
Come on. That can't be true.

895
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,219
I can't even call her Mom
when people are around.

896
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,119
What? What do you mean?

897
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:10,630
I...

898
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:14,599
Anyway, my mom likes the piano
more than she likes me.

899
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:16,969
Wait.

900
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:20,170
That little girl is...

901
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,550
I got it.

902
00:48:35,849 --> 00:48:36,920
Hang on.

903
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:40,119
I need to catch her red-handed.

904
00:48:43,389 --> 00:48:46,699
(Start with the basics,
Beyer for Children)

905
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,829
<i>Oh, my darling, Ms. Kim</i>

906
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:59,440
(Dancing Prince)

907
00:49:00,909 --> 00:49:02,940
Why is this woman calling again?

908
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,119
Hello?

909
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,690
Spare me some time.

910
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,829
I have something to tell you.

911
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,489
What's it about?

912
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,699
I'll tell you in person.

913
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:23,699
We meet for class tomorrow.

914
00:49:23,699 --> 00:49:25,099
After Zumba class...

915
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:26,369
It'll be too late then.

916
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:29,070
Right now.

917
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,739
Right now?

918
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,679
Over here, Mr. Oh.

919
00:49:45,619 --> 00:49:48,159
Why did you suddenly want to see me?

920
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,530
Try not to get the wrong idea.

921
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:55,730
I will...

922
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,530
reveal the truth pretty soon,

923
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:04,039
but I'm giving you a heads-up
so you don't get hurt.

924
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:09,210
Ms. Kim.

925
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:11,610
She's fishy.

926
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:13,619
You need to be careful.

927
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,519
If she asks you for a loan,

928
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,320
you must never lend her any money.

929
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,119
- And...
- Will you stop it?

930
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:26,500
Stop what?

931
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:30,030
Stop badmouthing Ms. Kim.

932
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:31,929
I can't stand it.

933
00:50:34,269 --> 00:50:35,570
I'm not badmouthing her.

934
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:38,309
I'm sharing a fact.

935
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:41,579
Ms. Kim never says anything bad
about you.

936
00:50:41,610 --> 00:50:42,880
Why are you...

937
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,949
so insistent on slandering her?

938
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:48,519
Ms. Kim...

939
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,050
isn't the person you think she is.

940
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,260
Why don't you see that?

941
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,929
When it comes to women,
there's more than what you see.

942
00:50:58,590 --> 00:51:02,000
Some women don't put makeup
on just their faces.

943
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,429
They put makeup on their hearts too.

944
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:08,139
Ms. Kim's like that,
and you should see it.

945
00:51:11,710 --> 00:51:12,710
I have...

946
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:16,510
feelings for her.

947
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,449
So don't badmouth...

948
00:51:21,719 --> 00:51:23,820
the woman I like
in my presence anymore.

949
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:25,590
It's hard to put up with.

950
00:51:25,789 --> 00:51:27,559
When I asked you last time,

951
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,989
you said you weren't flirting
or anything.

952
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:33,429
I didn't know how I felt back then.

953
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:34,829
But I do now.

954
00:51:35,329 --> 00:51:37,969
Ms. Kim and I have a thing going on.

955
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:39,840
You can't!

956
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,070
I won't accept it.

957
00:51:43,139 --> 00:51:46,039
What right do you have
to accept it or not?

958
00:51:47,239 --> 00:51:49,110
Stay out of my personal life
from now on.

959
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,579
I'm not meddling
in your personal life.

960
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,949
I'm trying to save you
from being deceived...

961
00:51:53,949 --> 00:51:56,920
by a fake and suspicious woman
like Ms. Kim.

962
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,920
I'm doing this out of concern.

963
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,920
I don't want to hear any more
of this.

964
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,730
I'll request this one last time.

965
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,929
Stay out of my relationship...

966
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:09,460
with Ms. Kim.

967
00:52:13,639 --> 00:52:15,599
You can't leave like this.

968
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,469
Please hear me out.

969
00:52:22,409 --> 00:52:25,579
Darn it. I need to move faster.

970
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:28,420
This is serious.

971
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:37,429
(Eagle Brewery)

972
00:52:43,699 --> 00:52:45,329
Eating in this big house...

973
00:52:45,429 --> 00:52:48,039
with just you by my side...

974
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:50,409
leaves me with no appetite.

975
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:53,440
For a pleasant dinner,

976
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,940
there should be more people
at the table.

977
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:57,079
Right?

978
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,650
Why are you looking at me like that?

979
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:08,659
You've been constantly saying...

980
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:11,860
how lonely you are,
and I find that suspicious.

981
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,530
I bet you're seeing someone!

982
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:17,269
What nonsense are you talking about?

983
00:53:17,269 --> 00:53:18,969
Why would I be seeing someone?

984
00:53:18,969 --> 00:53:20,500
As if you have to ask.

985
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,369
You should remarry
while you're still young.

986
00:53:23,369 --> 00:53:26,239
Not that again. Stop it with that.

987
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:34,750
Don't you think it'd be nice...

988
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:38,219
to have a handsome and sweet son?

989
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:41,719
A son-in-law is the same as a son.

990
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:46,090
Forget I said anything.

991
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:57,840
(Chun Soo)

992
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:03,409
Hey, Chun Soo.

993
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:05,309
How are you feeling?

994
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,679
I'm fine except
that I can't use my left arm.

995
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:09,119
Don't worry.

996
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:12,590
I'll be heading to you
with Heung Soo and Beom Soo.

997
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:14,989
As if you need to say that.

998
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:16,960
That's the least we can do...

999
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,230
when our baby brother
is leaving the service.

1000
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,730
Of course, we should comfort...

1001
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:23,730
We should be there
to congratulate you.

1002
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:27,170
Sure. I'll see you tomorrow.

1003
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:29,369
(Eagle Brewery)

1004
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:35,210
Come on, guys.
The news just came on.

1005
00:54:35,309 --> 00:54:36,710
- Already?
- The news?

1006
00:54:36,909 --> 00:54:38,809
Go on and hit record.

1007
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:40,320
- Hurry.
- Hurry.

1008
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,820
Vertical farming...

1009
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:43,989
that isn't affected by the elements
is garnering attention.

1010
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,690
I'm busy with today's deliveries.

1011
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:46,989
When will it be on?

1012
00:54:46,989 --> 00:54:48,690
Just give it a minute.

1013
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:50,360
It'll be on as soon as
they're done with the headlines.

1014
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:52,559
I can't believe
my daughter will be on the news.

1015
00:54:53,159 --> 00:54:54,730
What a great honor in the family.

1016
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:58,500
Anyway, the chairman of LX Hotel
is our savior.

1017
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:00,639
How could we ever repay him?

1018
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:03,340
One should speak the truth
even with a crooked mouth.

1019
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:06,510
It's our late boss
who paved the way.

1020
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,949
He's the reason my daughter
is working her butt off as a widow.

1021
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:14,179
I thought you said
this was an honor in the family.

1022
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,090
Stop it, Mom.

1023
00:55:18,989 --> 00:55:20,590
According to the National Institute
of Fisheries Science,

1024
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,789
what was discovered
along the eastern coast...

1025
00:55:33,699 --> 00:55:36,239
- We deliver this week's trend.
- Come in.

1026
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,039
This is Weekly Trend.

1027
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,010
- Did you sleep well?
- Good morning.

1028
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,650
Did you manage to get some sleep
last night?

1029
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,719
Somewhat. Did you sleep well?

1030
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:49,119
Of course, I did.

1031
00:55:49,949 --> 00:55:52,719
Are you watching TV first thing
in the morning?

1032
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:54,820
Is there something important
you're trying to catch?

1033
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:56,320
Yes, here it is.

1034
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,329
That is not the same
for the traditional liquor market.

1035
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,829
The transformation of makgeolli.
Here is Reporter Kim Sang Yi.

1036
00:56:03,699 --> 00:56:05,429
A top-class hotel restaurant
in Seoul.

1037
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,639
Makgeolli has been listed
on the menu.

1038
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,170
It's the first time since the hotel
opened its doors in 1978.

1039
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:14,909
With more and more guests
taking a liking to Korean culture,

1040
00:56:14,909 --> 00:56:17,809
they have been asking
for traditional liquor.

1041
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,219
That is how we came
to serve makgeolli.

1042
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,079
The makgeolli served
at this hotel...

1043
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,289
retails for over ten dollars
per bottle.

1044
00:56:25,320 --> 00:56:28,460
A premium strategy that emphasizes
craftsmanship has proven successful.

1045
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:32,329
We do not compromise and stick to
the traditional way of brewing.

1046
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,400
Makgeolli is an honest liquor.

1047
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:38,369
Rice harvested from healthy land,

1048
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,869
clear water, and our special nuruk.

1049
00:56:41,469 --> 00:56:44,710
We bring out the best flavors
with those three ingredients.

1050
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,239
That's what defines our makgeolli.

1051
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:49,079
Finding a new way to bring back
our traditional liquor...

1052
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:50,079
is also something to note.

1053
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,210
I'm impressed.

1054
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:54,519
I didn't know
makgeolli was served at our hotel.

1055
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,119
I should try it.

1056
00:56:56,219 --> 00:56:58,489
It's not bad.
Actually, it's quite good.

1057
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:01,519
The CEO of the brewery is a beauty.

1058
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:02,760
She has a way with words too.

1059
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:07,960
Shouldn't an aspiring artist
like yourself have better taste?

1060
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:10,059
Sorry?

1061
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:12,800
As if anyone would say
she's a beauty.

1062
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:15,570
But she's beautiful.

1063
00:57:17,139 --> 00:57:20,679
Your mother is someone
you'd call a beauty.

1064
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:24,210
She's nothing
compared to your mother.

1065
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,789
Why is he getting worked up
over something trivial?

and traditional nuruk)

00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,039
My friends at Golden Castle
saw the news...

1070
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:53,239
and are taking me out to lunch
to congratulate me.

1071
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:55,510
My gosh.

1072
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:57,480
They say everyone
has some sort of special talent,

1073
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,880
and you made it on the news.

1074
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,179
I'm proud of you.

1075
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:03,849
You should pay for the coffee.

1076
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:08,820
Compliments lead to
even nicer things.

1077
00:58:09,159 --> 00:58:10,389
Thanks, CEO Ma.

1078
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:16,230
I'm sorry, Mom.

1079
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,869
What are you saying that
out of the blue?

1080
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:22,070
I'm sorry about everything.

1081
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:24,469
I'm sorry, Mom.

1082
00:58:26,409 --> 00:58:27,639
Is something up?

1083
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:30,710
Why won't you answer me?

1084
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:32,710
Are you going to do something
behind my back?

1085
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:34,980
Of course not.

1086
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:38,750
Are you off to make a delivery?

1087
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:41,090
Yes, and after that...

1088
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,559
I'm heading outside the city.

1089
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:44,659
Where?

1090
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:49,500
To meet with a partner company.

1091
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:53,869
Victory!

1092
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:55,139
Victory.

1093
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:00,280
Company executive officer
of the 21st Navy SEAL team,

1094
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,039
Lieutenant Oh Kang Soo,

1095
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:04,150
will be discharged from service...

1096
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:06,809
as of March 21, 2025,
and join the reserve forces.

1097
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:08,719
I hereby report.

1098
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:10,650
Victory.

1099
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:12,320
Victory.

1100
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:15,159
- At ease.
- At ease.

1101
00:59:20,829 --> 00:59:22,260
You served your country well.

1102
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:25,269
We wish to keep serving with you,

1103
00:59:25,769 --> 00:59:28,170
but we only approved your discharge
considering your physical health.

1104
00:59:28,769 --> 00:59:31,309
With the diligence and leadership
you demonstrated in the Marines,

1105
00:59:31,309 --> 00:59:34,210
continue to bring honor to the UDT
even as a civilian.

1106
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:35,809
I wish you well.

1107
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:37,679
That is all.

1108
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:40,010
I will keep that in mind.

1109
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,119
Victory!

1110
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:43,820
Victory.

1111
00:59:45,619 --> 00:59:48,559
(For the country and our people)

1112
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:54,500
(The country, the spirit
of the people, and the sea)

1113
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,699
(Nothing is impossible, UDT)

1114
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,579
- Victory.
- Victory.

1115
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:19,019
(Brave heart, unwavering mind)

1116
01:00:23,989 --> 01:00:25,929
Lieutenant Oh Kang Soo,

1117
01:00:25,929 --> 01:00:28,699
I hereby report
that I was released from service.

1118
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:31,130
Victory!

1119
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:32,630
- Victory.
- Victory.

1120
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:46,679
I'm proud of you, baby brother.

1121
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:52,389
- I'll take that.
- Sure.

1122
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:55,389
Kang Soo.

1123
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:57,260
You did great.

1124
01:00:57,929 --> 01:01:00,559
You're done with the hardship
and will now welcome happiness.

1125
01:01:01,329 --> 01:01:03,300
I have grand plans for you,

1126
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,230
so don't worry about anything. Okay?

1127
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:10,969
Have you eaten?

1128
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:14,639
Yes, I ate with the members
of my unit.

1129
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:17,409
Come to Seoul with us.

1130
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,320
(Eagle Brewery)

1131
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:40,329
(Eagle Brewery)

1132
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:54,380
What's this?

1133
01:01:54,679 --> 01:01:55,880
Am I the odd one out?

1134
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,190
No.

1135
01:01:57,619 --> 01:01:59,949
We thought you'd be busy
with the brewery.

1136
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:02,019
We agreed
that I'd be your big sister.

1137
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,559
- Don't do this.
- Sorry.

1138
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:06,559
We were going to come
straight to you.

1139
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:10,469
Lieutenant Oh Kang Soo.

1140
01:02:10,570 --> 01:02:13,199
I hereby report that
I've been discharged from service.

1141
01:02:13,670 --> 01:02:16,170
Victory!

1142
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:21,940
Victory.

1143
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:25,679
Lieutenant Oh Kang Soo.

1144
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:28,579
You are to get into
your sister-in-law's truck.

1145
01:02:30,179 --> 01:02:31,190
Get to it.

1146
01:02:33,019 --> 01:02:34,019
What?

1147
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:43,800
Lieutenant Oh Kang Soo
will return...

1148
01:02:44,199 --> 01:02:46,199
to Eagle Brewery
with his sister-in-law.

1149
01:02:46,869 --> 01:02:47,940
Do you understand?

1150
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:49,739
(Return to Eagle Brewery)

1151
01:02:50,639 --> 01:02:51,670
- What?
- What?

1152
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:41,159
(For Eagle Brothers)

1153
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:44,090
Did her mother agree to this?

1154
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:45,889
There's no way she'd agree to it.

1155
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:47,800
Let it go just this once.

1156
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:51,070
I promise to do
as you say from now on.

1157
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:52,369
What's the occasion?

1158
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:53,670
Incheon International Airport?

1159
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:56,099
Why is that woman
taking over the brewery?

1160
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:58,070
You gave the brewery to a woman...

1161
01:03:58,070 --> 01:03:59,840
he was married to for just ten days?

1162
01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:02,079
My mom did something terrible.

1163
01:04:02,179 --> 01:04:03,179
Something terrible?

1164
01:04:03,179 --> 01:04:04,849
What is this?

1165
01:04:04,949 --> 01:04:06,150
It's for you.

1166
01:04:06,579 --> 01:04:07,679
For me?
