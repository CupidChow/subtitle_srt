00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:03,980
(Episode 30)

2
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:08,950
And you've been...

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,320
so good to me,
which I don't even deserve.

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,860
But no matter
how much I think about it,

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,800
I don't think I can do that.

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,770
You don't think you can do that?

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,200
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,240
So are you...

9
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,210
rejecting my offer...

10
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,880
to be my girlfriend?

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,250
Yes.

12
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,660
As we've been
through a lot of things together,

13
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,700
I thought
you'd feel the same way as me,

14
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,070
but I guess I was just mistaken.

15
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,140
I also...

16
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,350
like you as a person, but...

17
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,320
But not in a romantic way?

18
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,190
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,290
Okay.

20
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,300
It's not like everyone feels
the same way I do.

21
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:35,330
I don't want to blame you.

22
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,310
CEO Ma.

23
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,910
I'm not...

24
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:51,680
used to being rejected.

25
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,620
I guess I need...

26
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,490
some time alone
to emotionally isolate myself.

27
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,600
Would you leave before me?

28
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,330
I'll stay here for a while.

29
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,640
Okay.

30
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,610
Then I'll go first.

31
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,730
I can't believe...

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,640
this is happening in my life.

33
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,180
Yes, sir.

34
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,550
Can you get me the wine
I brought earlier?

35
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,650
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,960
Fill the glass.

37
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,930
Yes, sir.

38
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,140
You asked me to fit you
for a new suit in such a short time.

39
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,940
You must have an important event.

40
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,380
It's something special
that means a lot to me.

41
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,850
I wanted to wear a new suit.

42
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,950
You didn't give us
much time this time.

43
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:42,820
Do you have an important meeting?

44
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:44,960
It's a very important meeting,

45
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,160
and I wanted to wear a pair
I'd never worn before.

46
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,130
It has been so long
since you came by.

47
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,070
I'm shopping for a gift.

48
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,430
I'll take this one.

49
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,310
I did things that were pointless.

50
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,090
Would you like another glass, sir?

51
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,900
No, I'm fine.

52
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,640
You're home.

53
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,410
I'm tired, so I'm going to bed.
Don't bother me.

54
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,570
What about dinner, sir?

55
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,110
I don't want to eat.

56
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,550
He was in a good mood this morning.

57
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,620
He said he'd have
an important meeting.

58
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,220
I guess things didn't go well.

59
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,160
I've never imagined
that I'd be hurt like this...

60
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,470
in my life.

61
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,040
It's so unrealistic.

62
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,690
Heung Soo, when are you
going to open your store?

63
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,460
The place is currently
under renovation.

64
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,060
I'll start as soon as it's over.

65
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,090
I see.

66
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,330
Things are going faster
than I thought.

67
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,230
Are you confident?

68
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,600
I was worried at first,

69
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,040
but Ok Bun has
such a good business sense,

70
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,670
so I won't have to worry.

71
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:18,040
Heung Soo, keep in mind
that listening to Ms. Ji...

72
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:20,240
will only do you good.

73
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,850
You must like Ok Bun a lot,
Ms. Gong.

74
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:27,220
She's wealthy,

75
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,820
pretty, and has a good personality.

76
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,690
What's there not to like about her?

77
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,230
She's rich, but she's really frugal.

78
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,960
She only drinks instant coffee,

79
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,600
and she's not interested
in brand-name products at all.

80
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,200
Oh, right. She even buys
her clothes at the market.

81
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,270
My goodness.

82
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,200
There are a lot of good things
about her.

83
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,210
Right.
I found out something recently.

84
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,540
She's also a talented hairdresser.

85
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,640
She was the grand prize winner
of the Seoul Mayor's Cup...

86
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,380
K-Beauty Art Contest.

87
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:00,350
By the way, you've been
bragging a lot about her.

88
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,320
Gosh, no. Despite all that,

89
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,920
she's not my type.

90
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,060
What?

91
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,090
Well...

92
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:17,540
By the way, Kwang Sook,
you're not eating at all.

93
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,510
I just have a little indigestion.

94
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,980
Then you should take some pills.

95
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,010
Heung Soo, go to a drugstore
and buy some digestive medicine.

96
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,020
Okay.

97
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,120
No. I have some medicine in my room.

98
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,750
I'll be fine if I take it.

99
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,260
I'll be in my room.

100
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,790
- Okay.
- Enjoy your meal.

101
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,100
Oh, dear.

102
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,740
She's been so busy
with the brewery...

103
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:55,840
that she's not feeling well.

104
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,040
You're right.

105
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,650
Even a machine would break down
after working like that.

106
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,680
Let's eat.

107
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,810
Okay.

108
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,480
CEO Ma.

109
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,550
I'm not used...

110
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,590
to being rejected.

111
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,960
I guess I need...

112
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,030
some time to be alone
to emotionally isolate myself.

113
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,370
I'll stay here for a while.

114
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,640
He seemed quite shocked.

115
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,170
What do I do?

116
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,120
You don't look too well.

117
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,630
I always assumed I'd end up...

118
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,230
marrying Se Ri,

119
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,570
so I was stressed out at first.

120
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,100
I'm getting over it now.

121
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,340
That's good to hear.

122
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,840
I still think of her
as a little sister,

123
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,580
and that's why I want her
to be happy.

124
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,850
I've known Se Ri for a long time,
and I know her well.

125
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,520
If she's this firm about something,

126
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,090
it means she's serious.

127
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,090
How does your brother feel?

128
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,760
Does he like Se Ri too?

129
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,530
He was a civil servant
before he got into teaching,

130
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,300
so he has a strong moral compass.

131
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,370
And he's a single dad too.

132
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,910
I think he's finding it hard
to accept Se Ri's advances.

133
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,980
That's totally understandable.

134
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,380
But Se Ri...

135
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:17,420
took the plunge, risking everything.

136
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,120
Don't you think your brother
should try a bit harder?

137
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,250
It's not right
to let Se Ri suffer alone.

138
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,590
He seems to like her
quite a bit too.

139
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:30,590
He'll make up his mind soon.

140
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,300
Okay, good. He should.

141
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,330
But...

142
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,970
I'm not sure...

143
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,810
how Se Ri's parents will react.

144
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,870
It'll be tough.

145
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,840
Your brother will have to be
very prepared.

146
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,320
Thank you for being honest with me.

147
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:59,420
I think I explained my position.

148
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,860
Talk it out with your brother.

149
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,630
Then...

150
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,600
does this mean
you're rooting for him and Se Ri?

151
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,000
Does it?

152
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:27,550
I called you for dinner many times,
and you're still here?

153
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,520
Have you decided
not to speak with me?

154
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,360
I know you're embarrassed
and flustered...

155
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,030
that I interrupted your lecture.

156
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,030
But I can do...

157
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,400
way worse than that
if it's to protect my daughter.

158
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,610
What could be worse than that?

159
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,880
You barged into my lecture hall.

160
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,010
Isn't that the worst?

161
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,950
Do you have something worse
up your sleeve?

162
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,120
I'll do anything
if you'll just come to your senses.

163
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,020
So don't even try to fight me...

164
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,560
over this issue.

165
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,930
If you don't want to eat,
you can starve.

166
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,310
What about Se Ri?

167
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,280
She's not hungry.

168
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,550
Is her mind still wandering?

169
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,150
No.

170
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:40,460
I think I should meet her professor.

171
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,790
You?

172
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,100
I should meet him
and scare him senseless...

173
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,900
so he doesn't get any ideas.

174
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,500
What's the guy's name?

175
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Goodness.

176
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,000
Don't do anything
that could make things worse.

177
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,470
I went to see him already.

178
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,140
You went to Se Ri's campus?

179
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,540
I gave him a good, stern warning,

180
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,050
so don't make yourself look bad
by getting involved.

181
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,520
Honey!

182
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,750
You startled me.

183
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,720
That's disgusting.

184
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,090
You have the table manners
of a servant.

185
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,830
It's a habit, that's all.

186
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,200
Oh, my gosh.

187
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,400
Can't you act classy
like a chairman would?

188
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,870
Why do you act like a lowlife?

189
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,810
What about yourself?

190
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,010
You're not classy either,

191
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:32,410
so don't nag.

192
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,310
You're way worse than me sometimes.

193
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,080
As if I am.

194
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,650
Eat with class.

195
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,580
No, thanks.

196
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,320
Ha Ni. Are you in a good mood
now that you had a bath?

197
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,830
Let's have one last bottle...

198
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,230
and then go to sleep, okay?

199
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,870
Beom Soo, can I come in?

200
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,170
Yes, come in.

201
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,370
Ha Ni, your uncle's here.

202
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,070
Ha Ni's still up?

203
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,840
Were you waiting for me?

204
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,480
You're home late.

205
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,710
Yes. I met Bom's brother.

206
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,150
Se Ri's ex-fiance.

207
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,690
Did I tell you?

208
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,190
When I was in the Navy,

209
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,620
Bom's brother
treated my ear infection.

210
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,830
He's a naval surgeon?

211
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,760
He was, but he's a civilian now.

212
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,500
Are you Lieutenant Oh's family?

213
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,770
- Yes.
- Yes, we are.

214
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,540
I'm naval surgeon Han Gyeol.

215
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,740
Professor.

216
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,310
Hello. I'm Han Gyeol.

217
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,380
I wondered why he looked familiar
when we met on campus.

218
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,380
I remember meeting him
outside the OR...

219
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,050
after your accident.

220
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,720
He says he respects
Se Ri's decision.

221
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,590
And he asked me to tell you
not to worry about or mind him.

222
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:01,430
I asked to see him...

223
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,630
to hear how he felt about Se Ri.

224
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,770
Why did you do something
I never asked?

225
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,810
As you can tell,

226
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:12,080
Se Ri is serious about you.

227
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,380
That's why her fiance stepped back.

228
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,980
Even so, there's nothing I can do.

229
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,620
You like her too.

230
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,960
Shouldn't you tell her
how you really feel?

231
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,460
I have to make Ha Ni a bottle.

232
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,240
Ha Ni.

233
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,480
Shall I take a video of you?

234
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:46,940
Let's see.

235
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,670
Ha Ni.

236
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,870
Ha Ni. Do you remember Se Ri?

237
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,200
Say hi to her.

238
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,410
Hello, Se Ri.

239
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,840
Ha Ni.

240
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,950
It's good to see you.

241
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:23,680
It's been a while.

242
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,450
Hi, Se Ri.

243
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,220
I know.

244
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,690
Ha Ni, it's milk time.

245
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,500
What are you filming?

246
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,760
Ha Ni. She's so cute.

247
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:42,830
Say something to the camera.

248
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,340
My daughter has to eat.
Put that away.

249
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:48,270
Yes, Ha Ni. Let's eat.
Uncle's bothering you, isn't he?

250
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:49,570
Here.

251
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,040
Say something to Ha Ni.

252
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,210
Professor.

253
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,510
Why should I say something?

254
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,980
What? Shall I say something?

255
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,820
I love you.

256
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,460
Ha Ni.

257
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:07,890
Professor.

258
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,670
It's 8 dollars and 60 cents.

259
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,410
You have been charged.
Remove your card.

260
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:27,440
Here you go.

261
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,010
We have lots of events.

262
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,250
Do come by often.

263
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,920
Okay. Take care.

264
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,550
Thank you. Bye.

265
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,260
- See you again.
- Bye.

266
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,730
This won't do.

267
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,070
I should hire you part-time,
Chun Soo.

268
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:50,000
No, thank you.

269
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,440
Go to the back room
and take a break.

270
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,070
You had a long day.

271
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,670
I'm fine.

272
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,510
I rest when there are no customers.

273
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:01,580
You had the longer day
at the brewery.

274
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,050
What?

275
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,380
It's physically taxing,
but I'm more at ease,

276
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,220
so it's bearable.

277
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,450
The brewery's back on track,

278
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,360
and I'm back with you.

279
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,130
I'm thankful for everything.

280
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,960
So am I.

281
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
Why?

282
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,370
It's Yeoung Ju's call.

283
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,210
I want to take it.

284
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,580
Sure. No worries.

285
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:43,950
Hi, Yeoung Ju.

286
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,160
Dad's fine.

287
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,930
Are you well?

288
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,530
Why are you home alone? Where's Mom?

289
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,900
Were you scared?

290
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,240
Okay.

291
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,040
Don't forget to lock up
before heading to school.

292
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,310
- What is it?
- Hey.

293
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,750
Is something up?

294
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,120
Her mom went on vacation
without her.

295
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,060
She went to bed alone in the house.

296
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,630
She's a big girl now,
so it's no big deal.

297
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,500
I told her she had a responsibility
to our daughter.

298
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,240
Where on earth did she even go?

299
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,350
Sorry about that.

300
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:46,550
You dote on your daughter,
don't you?

301
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,020
Maybe it's because she moved
to the US as a child,

302
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,990
but I still see her
as a little girl.

303
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:55,790
Of course.

304
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,630
That's understandable.

305
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,400
I don't have a child of my own,

306
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,030
but it's nice to see dads...

307
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,300
who have a close bond
with their daughters.

308
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,210
(Pot Number 4)

309
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,750
As we've been
through a lot of things together,

310
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:23,090
I thought
you'd feel the same way as me,

311
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,890
but I guess I was just mistaken.

312
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,710
But no matter
how much I think about it,

313
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,650
I don't think I can do that.

314
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,860
LX Hotel is a lifesaver.

315
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,190
I bet it wasn't easy...

316
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,530
to reorder our product
when others are still hesitant.

317
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,200
I was planning to visit
the chairman soon...

318
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,070
to thank him formally.

319
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,600
Of course. That you should.

320
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,240
- Look at you.
- No way.

321
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,910
You look incredible, Heung Soo.

322
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,410
Oh, this?

323
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,810
It feels strange wearing a suit
for the first time in ages.

324
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,950
The head office is holding
a training session.

325
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,850
That sleek suit...

326
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,090
makes you look like the boss
for sure.

327
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,590
My gosh. As if.

328
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,120
I'm just a figurehead.

329
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,260
Why you...

330
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,960
You were working at the snack bar.
You should be grateful now then.

331
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,160
Don't complain about it.

332
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,860
That's cruel, Chun Soo.

333
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,100
You really know how to hit
where it hurts.

334
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,470
Unbelievable.

335
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,100
Hi.

336
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:47,300
Heung Soo,
I can drop you off on the way.

337
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,010
- Hop in.
- Thanks.

338
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:52,080
Boss, what's in that shopping bag?

339
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,210
What?

340
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,680
Oh, this?

341
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,780
It's not mine.

342
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,720
- Shall we?
- Sure.

343
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,020
I'll get going.

344
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,830
Chun Soo...

345
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,400
is now the vice-CEO
of Eagle Brewery,

346
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,770
and he and Mi Sun...

347
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:20,340
are finally getting all lovey-dovey.

348
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,170
Now that Beom Soo has moved in
with Ha Ni,

349
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,940
taking care of her
has gotten easier for him.

350
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,950
Meanwhile, our baby brother
got a job at a major company.

351
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:31,850
Even though I'm just a figurehead,

352
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,050
people are now calling me
the boss man.

353
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,520
We owe it all to you, Kwang Sook.

354
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:43,860
All your hard work finally paid off,
that's all.

355
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,360
No way.

356
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,430
If you hadn't been the one
holding us together,

357
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,770
we brothers would've all gone
our separate ways.

358
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,540
It was your kindness...

359
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,210
that brought us this far.

360
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,980
Hearing you praise me...

361
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:03,350
is making my day.

362
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,420
I'll remember what you did for us...

363
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,920
for the rest of my life.

364
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,520
It might sound cheesy,

365
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,920
but I really wanted to say that.

366
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,730
Thank you.

367
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,700
Hearing you say that...

368
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,570
reassures me
that I made the right choices,

369
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:28,770
and that's comforting.

370
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,710
So are you rejecting my offer...

371
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,440
to be my girlfriend?

372
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,510
Yes.

373
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,090
Was that comforting?

374
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,290
If that's what you need,

375
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:47,360
I'll flatter you with sweet words...

376
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,460
anytime, anywhere.

377
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,030
Hold on.

378
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,730
So you're saying
it was just flattery all along?

379
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,570
Oh, no. That slipped out.

380
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,970
I was just joking.

(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

382
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,560
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

383
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,660
Come in.

384
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:33,370
CEO Ma Kwang Sook of Eagle Brewery
is here.

385
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,040
What does she want?

386
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,640
I'm not sure,
but she has something to say.

387
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:44,080
Let her in.

388
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,450
Yes, sir.

389
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,090
What is this about?

390
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,530
Should I stay standing
while we talk?

391
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,700
Can't you see I'm busy?

392
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,300
Just say what you came to say
and go.

393
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,710
I feel bad...

394
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,840
about how we parted ways yesterday.

395
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,350
Chairman Han,

396
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,780
I've come to learn how generous...

397
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,950
and warmhearted you are.

398
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,750
Everything we went through...

399
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,720
brought me closer to you.

400
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,990
I was incredibly lucky...

401
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,300
to meet someone like you.

402
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,070
It was a blessing.

403
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,340
I mean that.

404
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,570
However,

405
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,410
it hasn't been long
since I lost my husband,

406
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,550
and I have a family to look after.

407
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,380
Also,

408
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,480
in many ways, I fall short...

409
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,220
as your partner.

410
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,460
It's nothing I haven't heard before.

411
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,590
Can't...

412
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,600
we...

413
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,930
just be friends?

414
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,000
CEO Ma.

415
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:20,040
You're more selfish than I realized.

416
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,510
Sorry?

417
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,550
You don't want to date me,

418
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,520
but you're afraid
of losing something...

419
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,880
if we cut ties.

420
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,050
So, the best you could come up with
was suggesting we just be friends?

421
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:35,460
Why would you put it that way?

422
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,290
I don't make friends with women.

423
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,430
I'm not interested in being friends
with you.

424
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:46,100
To me, you're already someone
I see romantically,

425
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,270
so just being friends
is no longer an option for me.

426
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,840
If you're done, please leave.

427
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,110
I have a lot of papers to sign.

428
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,420
I thought I should return...

429
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,390
the dress you gave me yesterday.

430
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,760
Is this really necessary?

431
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,690
- Sorry?
- CEO Ma.

432
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:13,200
Did you ever think about
how happy and thoughtful I was...

433
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,860
when I picked that out for you?

434
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,540
What gives you the right
to dismiss all of that?

435
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,770
I didn't mean it that way.

436
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,610
Since I turned you down,

437
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:28,380
it just didn't feel right
accepting your gift.

438
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,850
Since the gift was already given,

439
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:32,180
you can either get a refund
or throw it out,

440
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,420
whichever you prefer.

441
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:39,860
If you're done, please leave.

442
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,360
Sure.

443
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,700
I'll get going, then.

444
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,700
I understand that he's upset,

445
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,870
but did he have to yell
at me like that?

446
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,610
Did I call you out
when you were busy?

447
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,550
It's lunchtime anyway.

448
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,280
You're here because of Se Ri, right?

449
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,520
Now she wouldn't even talk to me
or look me in the eye.

450
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,050
It's so frustrating.

451
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,560
So I wanted to talk about it
with you...

452
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,290
and get some advice.

453
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,760
Okay.

454
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,580
Did you go to the logistics center?

455
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:11,080
Yes. I checked
the packaging process...

456
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,520
and the defect rate
of tag attachment.

457
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,950
Who is he?

458
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:20,860
Oh, right.
I told you about him earlier.

459
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,060
He's the lieutenant
who saved me in Jinhae.

460
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,530
Hello, ma'am.

461
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,670
I'm Oh Kang Soo.

462
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,400
She's Se Ri's mother.

463
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,140
Hello.

464
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,370
Nice to meet you.

465
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,780
Yes.

466
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:46,020
Now?

467
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,650
Okay.

468
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,890
I'm sorry,

469
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,690
but my boss wants me
to come back to the office...

470
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,860
because we have some samples
to work on.

471
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,460
I see.

472
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:58,460
Don't worry about me
and get back to work.

473
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,630
I'm so sorry.

474
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,400
I'll call you.

475
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,030
I'll get going then.

476
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,140
Wait.

477
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,040
I want to have some tea.

478
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,510
Can you join me
if you have some time?

479
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,170
Are you in good health?

480
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,240
You got injured while training.

481
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,210
Don't you suffer
from any aftereffects?

482
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,250
How do you know I was injured?

483
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,980
Lieutenant Oh Kang Soo?

484
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,150
He's bleeding excessively...

485
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,290
and is unconscious.

486
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,220
The day you were taken
to the hospital by ambulance,

487
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,260
I was there.

488
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,190
I went to Jinhae to meet Gyeol.

489
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,400
I see.

490
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,300
You were covered in blood.

491
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,740
When I saw you being carried
to the emergency room on a gurney,

492
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,910
I was so shocked.

493
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,610
It broke my heart.

494
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,480
Well... Even though I’m older,
it was my first time...

495
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,250
I'd ever seen
such an emergency situation.

496
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,420
I was really surprised.

497
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,060
I understand.

498
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,530
Fortunately, the surgery went well,

499
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,830
and I received good treatment,
so I have no problem.

500
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,130
That's great.

501
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,740
I'm glad to hear that.

502
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,470
Thank you for worrying about me.

503
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:57,880
I should go back to the office now.

504
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,880
What?

505
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,520
Oh, right. Silly me.

506
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,320
Sure.

507
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,960
We should get going.

508
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,160
Okay.

509
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,130
All right.

510
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,740
I'll get going then.

511
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,440
Hold on.

512
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,040
Do you have a business card?

513
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,980
My business card?

514
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,580
Wait.

515
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:37,350
(Intern Oh Kang Soo)

516
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,040
Thank you.

517
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,410
Pardon?

518
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,420
For working with Bom,

519
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,720
who is like my daughter.

520
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,520
It'll be a great help to Bom.

521
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,860
No. I still have a lot to learn.

522
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,570
I hope you will do well at work.

523
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,870
Stay healthy.

524
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,110
Okay. Thank you.

525
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,940
Have some coffee, Professor.

526
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,780
Thanks.

527
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,150
By the way,

528
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:12,750
about TA Dokgo Se Ri...

529
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,290
I heard her mother barged
into your class...

530
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,520
and dragged her out.

531
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,260
So?

532
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,490
So it happened...

533
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,630
because she was living with a man
her parents didn't approve of.

534
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,300
Did you know about that?

535
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,740
Who on earth said
such a ridiculous thing?

536
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,500
There's a rumor that she's pregnant.

537
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,910
There are rumors
going around the school.

538
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,440
That's not true.

539
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,210
Stop spreading ridiculous rumors.

540
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:43,880
Yes, sir.

541
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,920
I should go
to the department office.

542
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:54,920
You know what?

543
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,160
I can't help but worry about you.

544
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,030
I...

545
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,000
I'm in love with you.

546
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,300
I'm a professor,
and you are my student.

547
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,670
How could a student
have feelings for her professor?

548
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,110
Is having feelings for you
really such a terrible thing?

549
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:14,010
When I imagine a future with you,

550
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:17,150
I feel excited and happy.

551
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,350
And it gives me the courage
that I can overcome any hardships.

552
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,220
Isn't that what matters?

553
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,570
Yes, Professor.

554
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,580
Are you ill?

555
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:47,480
No, I'm not.

556
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,910
Then why didn't you come to school?

557
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,880
Because of my mom,

558
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,420
you must've been
shocked and embarrassed.

559
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,550
I feel really bad.

560
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:02,060
I didn't have the courage
to see your face again.

561
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,830
It's not your fault,
so you don't have to be like that.

562
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,330
Don't worry about it.

563
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,130
What if my mom shows up again?

564
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,300
If it happens again,

565
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,240
I won't just watch you
get dragged away, doing nothing.

566
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,110
So don't worry about it
and come to school.

567
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,710
If you keep avoiding things
like this,

568
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,780
there may be false rumors
around you.

569
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,920
Okay. I'll do as you say.

570
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:30,690
All right. I'll see you at school.

571
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,260
Yes, Professor.

572
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,840
What are you doing?

573
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,880
I'm hungry, so I'm eating ramyeon.

574
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,250
I guess you're feeling better.

575
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,490
After skipping meals for long,
you're finally eating ramyeon.

576
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,650
(Intern Oh Kang Soo)

577
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,830
If I get Kang Soo to marry Bom...

578
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,200
and make him
the son-in-law of LX Group,

579
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,730
I'll be making up for the time...

580
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,070
I couldn't be there as his mom.

581
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,420
I get that you're competitors,

582
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,730
but how could they do
something so nasty?

583
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:19,560
It's fortunate that the culprit
was caught and the truth came out.

584
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,500
I saw on the news...

585
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,330
that Silla Brewery's sales dropped,
and so did their stock price.

586
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,640
They had it coming.

587
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:29,170
It must've been hard on you.

588
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,940
You managed pretty well, though.

589
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,280
I owe it to your support.

590
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,210
It was a risk for us...

591
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,480
to start restocking
and serving your makgeolli.

592
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,490
Our chairman was so insistent,

593
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:46,320
the purchase department
didn't challenge him.

594
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,560
Our chairman's
way more loyal than he looks.

595
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,990
Yes, he is.

596
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:55,560
I was so moved
by the way he handled things.

597
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,820
I delivered a shipment of makgeolli,

598
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,320
and as I hadn't been by in a while,
I stopped to chat...

599
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,520
with the chef and the manager.

600
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,400
They both told me that...

601
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,640
it would've been unlikely
for them to restock...

602
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,070
our makgeolli
if it hadn't been for you.

603
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,280
I don't know...

604
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,310
how to express my gratitude.

605
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,820
Let's skip the formalities.

606
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:24,420
It's not just a formality.
I mean it.

607
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,430
Thank you very much
for letting us...

608
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,660
supply you again.

609
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:36,200
I agreed to restock the product
because it's worth it.

610
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,330
You don't have to thank me.

611
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:45,270
If you have some free time,
can we have...

612
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,040
some tea...

613
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,680
I have no reason
to drink tea with you.

614
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,020
What?

615
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,250
Why would a hotel chairman...

616
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,850
drink tea with a brewery CEO?

617
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:01,390
I get that you're angry
about yesterday...

618
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:03,760
From now on,
contact the purchase department...

619
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:05,760
or the food and beverage team
directly.

620
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:08,860
This is my floor.

621
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,270
Why...

622
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,740
He's too harsh.

623
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,680
Excuse me, ma'am.

624
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,320
Young lady?

625
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:33,290
Me?

626
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:37,360
I believe
it's somewhere around here.

627
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:40,160
Where can I find Eagle Brewery?

628
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,400
Eagle Brewery?

629
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,100
What business do you have there?

630
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,740
I'm visiting my brother.

631
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,270
Your brother?

632
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,050
Thank you.

633
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:03,490
Enjoy your chat over some tea.

634
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:06,060
Thank you, madam.

635
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,500
What are you doing here
out of the blue?

636
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,040
I attended
my husband's family event...

637
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,370
and dropped by to say something.

638
00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:25,840
You could say it over the phone.

639
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,180
This is an in-person topic.

640
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,420
What's this?

641
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,920
The woman you'll go
on a blind date with.

642
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:38,920
A blind date?

643
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:48,130
She's my husband's cousin
on his older brother's side.

644
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:52,170
She's five years younger than you,

645
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:56,440
and she's sweet.
She's just your type.

646
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,770
Hi.

647
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,570
Did the training go well?

648
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:25,730
Yes.

649
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,140
Gosh.

650
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:32,740
Are these all yours?

651
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:35,910
Yes.

652
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:39,920
I heard you were well-off,
and it was no joke.

653
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,590
I see you had
a pretty successful life so far.

654
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,190
It's as I told you.

655
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:52,290
Even when I'm shampooing
a client's hair,

656
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,500
I wonder where they itch...

657
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,570
and what to do about it.

658
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,430
Yes.

659
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,310
Earning the money
that's in someone else's pocket...

660
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,510
is not easy at all.

661
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:09,450
You must always study and research.

662
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:12,820
Okay.

663
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,480
I taught you Zumba,

664
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,050
but you can teach me about life.

665
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:23,490
They just finished the interior.

666
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:24,860
Let's check out the store.

667
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:25,930
Okay.

668
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:41,780
Ta-da.

669
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,050
Gosh.

670
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,320
What do you think? Do you like it?

671
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:49,420
Of course, I like it.

672
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:50,820
I like it,

673
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,390
but I'm worried
whether I can do this.

674
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,060
You can't be so weak.

675
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:59,930
I invested a fortune.

676
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,070
Are you taking
my investment lightly?

677
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:05,730
No, sorry.

678
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:11,840
Do as you were taught
and make me a toast,

679
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,980
Manager Oh.

680
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,150
Okay. Coming right up, Ms. Investor.

681
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:20,550
Here you go.

682
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,770
How is it?

683
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,070
What?

684
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:46,740
Does it taste weird?

685
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:51,650
It's crazy good.

686
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:56,120
You must've practiced a lot,
Manager Oh.

687
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:57,990
I practiced a lot at home...

688
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:59,890
so you wouldn't chew me out.

689
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,890
It's good.

690
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,290
Drink this too.

691
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:12,270
Our table at the restaurant
won't be ready for 30 minutes.

692
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,540
There's time for a cup of tea.

693
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,840
Forget that we'll soon be related
by marriage.

694
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,580
Let's talk freely...

695
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:23,110
as two grown men
and share our thoughts...

696
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:24,150
over a drink.

697
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,920
I'm grateful to you
for so many things.

698
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:35,460
You would've been upset and hurt
by Se Ri's immature antics,

699
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,430
but you hid that...

700
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,000
and made the call, so thank you.

701
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:44,670
I believe you misunderstood
my intention.

702
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:46,540
What?

703
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:50,110
Se Ri and I decided not to marry.

704
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:53,340
What does that mean?

705
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:55,940
My wife said...

706
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:58,380
you two were getting married
in September as planned...

707
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,380
Is that not the case?

708
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:04,790
No,

709
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,020
it's not.

710
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,580
Goodness me.

711
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,050
Are you back home already?

712
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:32,380
Where's Se Ri? Get her down here.

713
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,520
She just left for a walk.

714
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,520
What's wrong?

715
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:39,120
What's that jerk's name?

716
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,020
Who?

717
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,020
Who else?

718
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,790
The professor
that's been dating Se Ri!

719
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:47,160
I handled it on my end,
so you don't have to worry.

720
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:51,370
By "handling it,"
do you mean calling off the wedding?

721
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:54,900
I'm on my way back
from meeting Gyeol.

722
00:48:55,470 --> 00:48:56,740
Don't even think about
wiggling your way out of this.

723
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,780
Gyeol clearly told me...

724
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:03,350
that he and Se Ri agreed
to call off the wedding.

725
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,520
You knew, didn't you?

726
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,880
And yet you've been fooling me.

727
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,420
I didn't lie to you. Honey...

728
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,390
Give me the professor's name
and number!

729
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:15,690
I'll take him down and make sure
he doesn't get back up.

730
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:19,760
Tell me who he is right now.

731
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,200
You said you met him.

732
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:26,230
Tell me right now!

733
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,970
He's someone you also know.

734
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:33,510
He's someone I know?

735
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,010
That's right.

736
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:39,550
Who?

737
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,650
Tell me!

738
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,850
It's Beom Soo.

739
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,020
Beom Soo?

740
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:51,530
That's right. Oh Beom Soo.

741
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,730
Who's Oh Beom Soo?

742
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:58,530
From Eagle Brewery?

743
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:00,870
Yes.

744
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:05,870
What the...

745
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,510
This must be karma, honey.

746
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:11,010
That jerk! I'll just...

747
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:12,210
Honey!

748
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:14,320
- Let go of me!
- Honey!

749
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,950
Honey, please calm down.

750
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:18,750
How dare he go after my daughter?

751
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:20,690
I won't let him get away with this!

752
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:23,490
Getting worked up won't help us.

753
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:26,060
The milk has already been spilled,

754
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:28,900
so we need
to handle this matter calmly.

755
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,130
What nonsense are you yapping about?

756
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:32,730
- Get out of my way!
- My goodness!

757
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:35,170
Honey, please!

758
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,670
Oh, no.

759
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:44,810
You, Oh Beom Soo!

760
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,180
Get out here, you punk.

761
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,550
Hey!

762
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,690
Hey, Beom Soo.

763
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,560
Get out here
while I'm asking nicely.

764
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:01,300
You jerk.

765
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,730
I'll wait here until you come out!

766
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:05,670
Or maybe I'll barge in!

767
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:06,970
What am I hearing?

768
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:08,500
Who's here this late at night?

769
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,040
I'll see who it is.

770
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:12,070
I'll go with you, Chun Soo.

771
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:14,110
Get out here!

772
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,180
Oh Beom Soo, you jerk.

773
00:51:19,250 --> 00:51:20,380
What's going on?

774
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,050
Oh Beom Soo!

775
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:24,750
Get out here, you jerk.

776
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,390
Who...

777
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:31,230
Hang on.

778
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:33,900
That's our former brewery manager.

779
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,030
What are you doing here?

780
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:37,500
I'm glad I ran into you.

781
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:40,170
Give me Beom Soo's home address
this second.

782
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,400
Why are you looking for him?

783
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,510
Stop yapping and give it to me!

784
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,410
There he is.

785
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:52,080
They say you run into your enemies
at the worst possible time.

786
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,850
You were actually here.

787
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,720
Why are you here?

788
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:59,820
How dare you go after my daughter?

789
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:01,660
What the...

790
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,330
What do you think you're doing?

791
00:52:03,330 --> 00:52:04,590
- Let go!
- What was that?

792
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:05,690
Let go of me!

793
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,500
Let go, you jerks! Darn you.

794
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,970
- What...
- My goodness.

795
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:12,230
Hey.

796
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,100
Why are you here at this late hour?

797
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,740
To come after our brewery again?

798
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,340
Your brewery, my foot.

799
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,740
That jerk destroyed
my daughter's future.

800
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,780
What...

801
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:26,950
I bet you approached my daughter
on purpose.

802
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:29,480
You seduced her...

803
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,350
just to get back at me, didn't you?

804
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,390
Darn you.

805
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:33,420
Are you crazy?

806
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,390
Hey, don't grab his collar!

807
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,730
Kwang Sook, step aside.
You'll get hurt.

808
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:38,130
Darn you.

809
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:39,290
- Enough!
- Calm down.

810
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,060
My daughter...

811
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:44,930
canceled her wedding because of you.

812
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:47,670
You're a homewrecker!

813
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,770
What is he talking about?

814
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:54,680
Some professor you are.

815
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,780
You seduced a young student...

816
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,510
and ruined her future.

817
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:02,150
You've got no right
to be called a professor!

818
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:04,020
How dare you make
such wild accusations?

819
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,420
Shut that mouth!

820
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:07,990
Stay out of it.

821
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:10,160
By the looks of it, you may be off.

822
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,290
- Stay out of it.
- Darn.

823
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:13,430
You wait and see.

824
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:15,860
I'll see to it
that you lose your job.

825
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,830
I'll come for your head,

826
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:19,970
so just wait and see, you jerk.

827
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:21,340
Honey, that's enough!

828
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,180
Let's go home, honey.

829
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:33,950
Please let go of him.
I'll take him home.

830
00:53:33,950 --> 00:53:34,980
Darn it.

831
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,290
Ms. Jang?

832
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:43,390
It's been a while.

833
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,510
I'm sorry for the commotion.

834
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,210
We'll get going.

835
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:00,610
Honey, let's go.

836
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,440
Darn.

837
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,650
I'm way too angry to just walk away.

838
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,250
- No!
- Watch out.

839
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:19,890
Are you all right?

840
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:28,170
Oh Beom Soo, hear me loud and clear.

841
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:31,370
You'll pay
for going after my daughter.

842
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,740
I'll end you.

843
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,020
I'm so sorry about this.

844
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,060
What on earth just happened?

845
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:51,890
How is it that this family
can't have a single day...

846
00:54:51,890 --> 00:54:53,630
of peace and quiet?

847
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,200
Beom Soo.

848
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,610
Is what he said true?

849
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,520
Let me get this straight.

850
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,180
Dokgo Tak's daughter...

851
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:17,990
is one of your students,

852
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,920
and she broke off her engagement
to be with you?

853
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,840
Beom Soo, wait.

854
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:49,580
Let's not do this out here
and take it inside.

855
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,030
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

856
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:40,770
At 10 a.m., the signing ceremony...

857
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:42,400
between Eagle Brewery
and Saman Mart...

858
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,140
will take place
in the small conference room.

859
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:48,040
Will you be attending as well?

860
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:51,210
I don't think my presence
is required.

861
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,820
Understood, sir.

862
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:34,320
You may sit over here.

863
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,540
We're starting with 300 boxes
of Jang-Kwang Yakju every month,

864
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,100
but I expect the number
to increase to 500 boxes...

865
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:51,940
by the end of this year.

866
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,640
We'll be ready
to handle the additional order.

867
00:57:56,610 --> 00:58:00,950
This year, we'll see
how well your yakju sells...

868
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:04,050
as we build up a refrigerated fleet
before importing your makgeolli.

869
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,290
Fermented rice wines...

870
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:08,660
require special facilities
that take time to set up,

871
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:11,060
but I don't think
that should be a problem.

872
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,060
We've never exported
unrefined makgeolli,

873
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,760
but we'll do some research
and prepare.

874
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,500
Okay.

875
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:20,340
Shall we begin, then?

876
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:21,740
Yes.

877
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:45,490
Are you ready? One, two, three.

878
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,670
Good job.

879
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:52,600
- Well done.
- Thank you.

880
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,940
I agreed to meet Chairman Han
for tea after this.

881
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:00,580
You should join us.

882
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:02,780
Me too?

883
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:07,020
This deal wouldn't have happened
without him.

884
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:09,680
Shouldn't you thank him at least?

885
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:12,790
Go ahead, CEO Ma.

886
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:14,520
I'll wait in the lobby.

887
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,290
Let's go.

888
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:19,060
Shall we?

889
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,870
The chairman will come
as soon as he's free.

890
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,180
Okay.

891
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:38,780
I need to take this.

892
00:59:38,850 --> 00:59:39,850
Sure.

893
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,100
What's this?

894
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,070
What's what?

895
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,610
What are you doing in my office
without an appointment?

896
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:07,480
Saman Mart's CEO brought me here...

897
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,610
to thank you for brokering our deal,

898
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,580
but he just left to take a call.

899
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,320
That's why I was alone.

900
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:19,650
Chairman Han.

901
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:25,430
What did I do that was so wrong?

902
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,230
If you say you like me,

903
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,700
should I just accept it
and date you?

904
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,340
- What?
- I asked you...

905
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:37,010
to give me a month
to think about it.

906
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:39,370
You practically forced me
to think...

907
01:00:39,470 --> 01:00:41,210
over just ten days.

908
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,110
So for ten days,

909
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:46,680
I thought about it so much.
I felt like my head would explode.

910
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,080
That time,

911
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:51,890
those ten days...

912
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:54,920
might have been long enough for you,

913
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:58,460
but on top of your demand,
I had a mountain of problems...

914
01:00:58,460 --> 01:00:59,790
I had to solve...

915
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:02,530
just to keep my brewery going.

916
01:01:02,730 --> 01:01:04,730
I barely had any time.

917
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:08,370
So what? What is your point?

918
01:01:09,070 --> 01:01:11,710
I didn't have enough time
to determine how I felt,

919
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,980
so I rejected you
because I was uncertain.

920
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,110
Isn't it childish...

921
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:18,450
to get ticked off
and stress me out like this?

922
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,820
Who's ticked off? Me?

923
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,890
Yes, you.

924
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:27,260
Do you think my feelings for you...

925
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:29,790
were just some childish stunt?

926
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:32,060
What you're doing...

927
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,100
seems childish to me.

928
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,270
Don't call an ordinary man childish.

929
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:42,200
I bet no one ever said no
or rejected you...

930
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:44,070
in your life.

931
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:47,640
You're the first.

932
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:51,080
You got angry
because you didn't get your way,

933
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:53,820
and you don't care
how anyone else feels, do you?

934
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:55,980
Are you lecturing me?

935
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:58,450
I'm telling you
how you made me feel recently.

936
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,590
Okay, whatever.

937
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:06,130
I hope you get your way
and live happily...

938
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:07,500
with your brothers-in-law...

939
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,930
and stir makgeolli
for the rest of your life.

940
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:13,130
Are you cursing me?

941
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,500
How is that a curse?

942
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:16,770
Isn't that the life you want?

943
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:18,710
Yes.

944
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,880
I was...

945
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,450
so confused about what I wanted.

946
01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:28,020
Hearing what you just said
cleared my mind.

947
01:02:29,450 --> 01:02:30,650
From now on,

948
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,150
I'll do as you said.

949
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:36,790
I'll live happily
with my brothers-in-law forever...

950
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,930
and make and stir makgeolli.

951
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:42,100
What?

952
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:44,630
I got worried,

953
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:48,400
felt butterflies, and wondered...

954
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:50,970
for no reason.

955
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,610
Thank you for the nice memories.

956
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:51,200
(For Eagle Brothers)

957
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:54,370
She has a dreadful-looking face.

958
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,070
She's not for you.

959
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:58,370
- What?
- You know what your dad's like.

960
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,340
You can't beat him.

961
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,040
This is the worst.

962
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:04,980
I never even dreamed
of this happening.

963
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:07,180
Give me your home address.

964
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:09,820
I should've figured out
how she really felt.

965
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:11,690
I was too rash.

966
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,060
You were struggling,

967
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,460
and I get all that now.

968
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:19,730
You just have to watch what I do
from now on.
