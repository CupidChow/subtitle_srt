00:00:02,188 --> 00:00:03,948
(Episode 42)

2
00:00:04,008 --> 00:00:06,078
What do you think you are doing?

3
00:00:06,577 --> 00:00:10,047
Honey, aren't you supposed to be in the Philippines now?

4
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,217
While I was on a business trip,

5
00:00:12,617 --> 00:00:16,017
you called this brat over to our house without telling me?

6
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,487
It's not like that, honey.

7
00:00:17,487 --> 00:00:18,657
You...

8
00:00:24,387 --> 00:00:25,397
What are you doing?

9
00:00:26,697 --> 00:00:28,427
Don't lay a hand on my mother.

10
00:00:41,137 --> 00:00:42,677
She did nothing wrong.

11
00:00:43,547 --> 00:00:45,847
I came to see her one last time.

12
00:00:53,157 --> 00:00:55,657
You begged me to keep your secret.

13
00:00:56,827 --> 00:00:58,557
It looks like the secret's out.

14
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:04,227
Are you pleased to meet your birth mom?

15
00:01:07,497 --> 00:01:10,737
Were you overjoyed to be reunited with the son you abandoned?

16
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,837
So much so that you cooked him a feast?

17
00:01:17,547 --> 00:01:18,947
I should go.

18
00:01:22,487 --> 00:01:24,447
- Kang Soo. - Don't you move an inch.

19
00:01:26,017 --> 00:01:27,587
If you go after him,

20
00:01:28,417 --> 00:01:29,987
our marriage is over.

21
00:01:59,757 --> 00:02:00,887
Kang Soo.

22
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:07,227
Today is your birthday.

23
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:11,497
I wanted to...

24
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:15,737
make you seaweed soup on your birthday for once.

25
00:02:15,737 --> 00:02:17,337
That's why I invited you.

26
00:02:26,317 --> 00:02:28,247
I'm so sorry.

27
00:02:30,847 --> 00:02:33,817
I wouldn't dare ask for your forgiveness.

28
00:02:35,927 --> 00:02:38,027
I had no choice back then.

29
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:44,067
I left the orphanage at age 18...

30
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:46,197
and was forced to make a living.

31
00:02:48,267 --> 00:02:50,437
I got pregnant when I was far too young.

32
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:54,537
Three days before you were born,

33
00:02:57,247 --> 00:03:00,517
your dad got into an accident at a construction site.

34
00:03:01,977 --> 00:03:03,087
He died.

35
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,657
I was penniless,

36
00:03:07,057 --> 00:03:08,617
and I had no one to turn to.

37
00:03:10,127 --> 00:03:12,127
I didn't think I could raise you.

38
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:20,297
Then I found myself thinking and hoping...

39
00:03:22,907 --> 00:03:24,307
that you at least...

40
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:27,437
should grow up with a happy, warm family.

41
00:03:29,807 --> 00:03:31,977
The couple who owned Eagle Brewery...

42
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:34,017
had a reputation for being genuinely good people,

43
00:03:35,517 --> 00:03:37,947
and they already had four sons.

44
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,217
So you left me outside the brewery?

45
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,257
I didn't just leave you there.

46
00:03:48,257 --> 00:03:50,067
I got a job there as a bookkeeper.

47
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:53,767
Mr. Oh's wife was ill,

48
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,437
so when no one was looking,

49
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,667
I breastfed you in secret.

50
00:03:59,877 --> 00:04:01,337
I changed your diapers too.

51
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:04,877
When you cried,

52
00:04:05,747 --> 00:04:07,817
I sang you a lullaby.

53
00:04:12,217 --> 00:04:15,657
I raised you myself until you turned three.

54
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,557
But in the end,

55
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:21,227
you left me on my own.

56
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:24,997
And you even stole from my family.

57
00:04:31,907 --> 00:04:33,137
Mr. Oh...

58
00:04:35,507 --> 00:04:37,407
found out I was your birth mom.

59
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:41,977
I couldn't handle the truth, so I had to leave.

60
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,817
I wasn't in my right mind.

61
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:50,727
I regretted leaving you...

62
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:54,597
every single day after that.

63
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:01,537
I'm so sorry.

64
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:07,537
Were you never going to tell me?

65
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:13,877
I wanted you to tell me first, Mom.

66
00:05:16,887 --> 00:05:19,957
I believed that not telling you was for your own good.

67
00:05:22,017 --> 00:05:24,187
You were only looking out for yourself and your family.

68
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:25,527
Kang Soo.

69
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:27,727
I should go.

70
00:05:50,947 --> 00:05:54,257
You broke the promise you made to me.

71
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,727
Did you lie about the business trip...

72
00:05:59,957 --> 00:06:02,797
to test me to see if I'd keep the promise?

73
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:06,637
You'll pay dearly for going against your word.

74
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,477
Let's get divorced.

75
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:22,147
You can't see reason now that you've found your son?

76
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:25,247
You keep asking for a divorce.

77
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:26,557
This is it for us.

78
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:29,027
Let's end things here.

79
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:32,757
You have no right to say such things.

80
00:06:33,597 --> 00:06:35,097
I decide when we will end it.

81
00:07:48,237 --> 00:07:51,567
So, is Se Ri my little sister?

82
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:56,947
Kang Soo already knew?

83
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,447
No.

84
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:01,777
He didn't tell me anything about it.

85
00:08:02,517 --> 00:08:04,917
I need you to take good care of him.

86
00:08:06,557 --> 00:08:08,457
I don't want him to be hurt.

87
00:08:10,087 --> 00:08:11,227
Okay.

88
00:08:12,757 --> 00:08:13,857
I'm home.

89
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:26,677
Kang Soo.

90
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:37,487
Are you all right?

91
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:44,127
Why did you not say anything when you knew everything?

92
00:08:45,427 --> 00:08:46,827
You should've told me.

93
00:08:48,827 --> 00:08:50,527
I thought it'd be better for everyone...

94
00:08:50,527 --> 00:08:52,167
if I pretended not to know.

95
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:55,797
But when I saw Se Ri's father...

96
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:57,907
walk all over my mother,

97
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,407
I couldn't help it. My blood boiled in that moment.

98
00:09:12,557 --> 00:09:14,917
It must've been hard for you to endure everything all alone.

99
00:09:19,357 --> 00:09:20,627
I'm sorry, Kang Soo.

100
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,227
Yes.

101
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,727
My mother-in-law is home.

102
00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:02,967
Gyeol and Bom must be happy to see her.

103
00:10:05,107 --> 00:10:07,677
She absolutely adores her grandchildren,

104
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:10,947
and they love her just as much.

105
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:14,377
They lost their mom at a young age,

106
00:10:14,717 --> 00:10:17,417
so they must be exceptionally close to their grandmother.

107
00:10:19,387 --> 00:10:20,457
I guess that's true.

108
00:10:21,257 --> 00:10:22,387
I'm indebted to my mother-in-law...

109
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:25,187
in many ways.

110
00:10:29,627 --> 00:10:32,397
You know, Dad can be very picky and cautious.

111
00:10:32,897 --> 00:10:34,197
But after he met her,

112
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:37,137
he became more cheerful and energetic.

113
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:38,507
So I think it's a good thing.

114
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:41,237
I also didn't like her so much at first,

115
00:10:41,377 --> 00:10:44,547
but once I got to know her, I realized she was...

116
00:10:44,547 --> 00:10:47,017
a straightforward, unpretentious, and genuinely innocent person.

117
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:49,417
Is that right?

118
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:54,217
Everyone says she's nice, so why don't I like her that much?

119
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:58,557
It's natural that you are not happy about this.

120
00:10:58,887 --> 00:11:00,227
I mean, you are Mom's mom.

121
00:11:01,057 --> 00:11:04,727
But it's been 15 years since Mom passed away.

122
00:11:05,797 --> 00:11:07,737
Dad has been really lonely the whole time.

123
00:11:08,037 --> 00:11:09,307
Please try to like her.

124
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:12,307
We can't just be emotional.

125
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:14,777
We must be careful before we decide anything.

126
00:11:15,237 --> 00:11:16,847
If we take in the wrong person,

127
00:11:16,847 --> 00:11:19,207
it will ruin both the company and our family.

128
00:11:23,187 --> 00:11:26,157
My gosh. You poor things.

129
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:32,757
Kwang Sook.

130
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,827
Why are you still up?

131
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:38,967
- Let's sit. - Okay.

132
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:44,667
You are going to the courthouse tomorrow, right?

133
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:46,477
Yes.

134
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:49,137
If she doesn't show up again, it'll be withdrawn automatically.

135
00:11:49,137 --> 00:11:50,207
I'm worried.

136
00:11:51,677 --> 00:11:53,477
She can be really impulsive.

137
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:58,287
We are off to a good start with the export of Jang-Kwang yakju,

138
00:11:58,447 --> 00:12:01,687
and the wholesalers are starting to place orders again.

139
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:05,487
So, try to persuade her. Tell her we'll find a way...

140
00:12:06,197 --> 00:12:07,597
to cover Yeoung Ju's tuition fees.

141
00:12:08,657 --> 00:12:10,827
We only just managed to overcome that difficult situation.

142
00:12:11,327 --> 00:12:13,267
How could I possibly spend that precious money?

143
00:12:14,197 --> 00:12:15,767
I don't want to accept any more favors from you.

144
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:19,037
You are not accepting a favor from me.

145
00:12:19,907 --> 00:12:21,477
When things were tough at the brewery,

146
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:24,177
you and your brothers all stepped up to help me.

147
00:12:25,347 --> 00:12:28,447
It's not a favor to help each other as a family.

148
00:12:30,087 --> 00:12:31,517
Still, that's just not right.

149
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,887
Don't say such a thing again even if it's a joke.

150
00:12:34,187 --> 00:12:35,557
It really upsets me.

151
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,957
Just have a good talk with So Yeon...

152
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:42,897
and make sure to complete the legal process...

153
00:12:42,897 --> 00:12:44,267
with her tomorrow.

154
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:46,797
Though Mi Sun isn't saying anything,

155
00:12:46,837 --> 00:12:48,297
she must be really frustrated.

156
00:13:09,117 --> 00:13:10,127
Hello?

157
00:13:10,787 --> 00:13:13,527
We are going to the courthouse tomorrow. You know that, right?

158
00:13:15,957 --> 00:13:17,327
All you can...

159
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:19,197
think about now...

160
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:22,167
is breaking up with me, right?

161
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:27,477
If we don't show up tomorrow, things will get complicated.

162
00:13:27,477 --> 00:13:28,707
We have to go.

163
00:13:28,937 --> 00:13:31,147
You don't care about your daughter who just entered college.

164
00:13:31,347 --> 00:13:32,817
All you can think about is...

165
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:34,577
how to break up with me and start over with that woman...

166
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:35,977
from the convenience store, right?

167
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:40,117
And do you call yourself a dad?

168
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:43,757
Our divorce has nothing to do with Yeoung Ju.

169
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:45,557
Stop trying to get her involved.

170
00:13:47,097 --> 00:13:49,427
Come to the brewery. I have something to tell you.

171
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:51,327
I'll be waiting.

172
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:08,077
(Eagle Brewery)

173
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,387
Chun Soo.

174
00:14:21,057 --> 00:14:22,127
Hey, Mi Sun.

175
00:14:24,627 --> 00:14:26,127
What are you doing here? You didn't even call me.

176
00:14:26,637 --> 00:14:28,597
I had something to say.

177
00:14:28,937 --> 00:14:29,967
Are you busy?

178
00:14:30,267 --> 00:14:31,607
No. I'm free.

179
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:34,137
Sit.

180
00:14:41,817 --> 00:14:44,017
Is it something serious?

181
00:14:45,347 --> 00:14:47,587
It's nothing serious.

182
00:14:49,787 --> 00:14:52,657
I wasn't sure if it was something I could do,

183
00:14:52,657 --> 00:14:54,357
so I hesitated a little.

184
00:14:56,567 --> 00:15:00,067
But I hope you'll accept it as a kind gesture.

185
00:15:00,897 --> 00:15:04,107
What is it? Why are you hesitating to say it?

186
00:15:16,617 --> 00:15:17,617
Here.

187
00:15:22,457 --> 00:15:23,457
What is this?

188
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:26,187
It's for Yeoung Ju's tuition.

189
00:15:27,597 --> 00:15:29,427
I thought I could...

190
00:15:29,797 --> 00:15:32,067
help you with it at least once.

191
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:34,867
Mi Sun.

192
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,137
Even someone with little knowledge like me...

193
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:41,077
knows that college tuition in the US is expensive.

194
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,377
I think it might be too much for you to handle on your own.

195
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:47,947
You are hurting my pride.

196
00:15:48,717 --> 00:15:50,647
What are you talking about?

197
00:15:51,987 --> 00:15:54,917
Some people give scholarships to students they don't even know.

198
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:59,997
More importantly, she is your daughter.

199
00:16:00,697 --> 00:16:02,797
That means she also means a lot to me.

200
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:06,397
I'm sorry,

201
00:16:08,237 --> 00:16:09,267
but I'll just appreciate the gesture.

202
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,437
I really appreciate it.

203
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:13,037
Chun Soo.

204
00:16:13,377 --> 00:16:14,477
Mi Sun.

205
00:16:14,977 --> 00:16:16,947
If you're going to be like this too, I'll really be upset.

206
00:16:17,507 --> 00:16:19,047
If I take this money,

207
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:23,317
it'll make me look incompetent and helpless.

208
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,747
I can't take that.

209
00:16:26,387 --> 00:16:28,057
That's not what I'm saying.

210
00:16:29,517 --> 00:16:31,757
You seem so stressed out.

211
00:16:32,587 --> 00:16:34,557
I thought I should do something,

212
00:16:34,557 --> 00:16:36,727
so I came here to make myself feel better.

213
00:16:42,397 --> 00:16:43,407
I'm sorry.

214
00:16:44,507 --> 00:16:46,267
I won't offer if you're not willing.

215
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:52,047
But I'm really worried about you.

216
00:16:53,417 --> 00:16:54,417
I know.

217
00:16:55,477 --> 00:16:56,987
I know how you feel.

218
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:08,897
Thank you.

219
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,037
And I'm sorry, Mi Sun.

220
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:51,167
You both...

221
00:17:52,107 --> 00:17:54,407
care about each other so much.

222
00:17:55,637 --> 00:17:57,477
I can't stand this tearjerker.

223
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:00,347
Let's go.

224
00:18:00,847 --> 00:18:02,317
Hotel room, my foot.

225
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:04,547
- Honey. - Don't call me like that.

226
00:18:05,017 --> 00:18:06,957
I want to stop being your wife.

227
00:18:08,357 --> 00:18:09,957
What are you doing?

228
00:18:09,987 --> 00:18:11,087
To be honest,

229
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:14,027
I can't stand being in a closed space with you.

230
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:17,267
The sound of your breathing. Your smell.

231
00:18:18,027 --> 00:18:19,127
I don't like it.

232
00:18:19,327 --> 00:18:20,537
Honey.

233
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,367
I doubt you've been able to shower properly where you live,

234
00:18:25,107 --> 00:18:26,677
so take a bath.

235
00:18:26,937 --> 00:18:30,507
You smell like that dingy place you're staying in.

236
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:44,457
I give up.

237
00:18:47,297 --> 00:18:51,697
(Eagle Brewery)

238
00:19:01,603 --> 00:19:03,043
It's not like that, honey.

239
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:04,043
You...

240
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:07,983
What are you doing?

241
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:10,313
Don't lay a hand on my mother.

242
00:19:16,953 --> 00:19:18,253
I'm home.

243
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:20,693
Welcome home, sweetie.

244
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:24,533
Mom. Were you crying?

245
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,803
No. Why?

246
00:19:27,133 --> 00:19:28,973
Your eyes are puffy.

247
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:31,033
No. Why would I cry?

248
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:32,803
I dozed off for a bit.

249
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:35,473
Is everything okay?

250
00:19:37,613 --> 00:19:38,643
Yes.

251
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:41,183
What about Dad? Did he make it to the Philippines safely?

252
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,713
What? Oh, yes.

253
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:48,423
- Se Ri. - Yes?

254
00:19:56,293 --> 00:19:59,463
Do you know I cherish you...

255
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:03,833
more than life itself?

256
00:20:06,403 --> 00:20:07,803
Whatever happens,

257
00:20:08,773 --> 00:20:11,443
please trust and believe...

258
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:15,313
the fact that I love you, okay?

259
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,783
Why would you say that?

260
00:20:22,393 --> 00:20:23,523
I'm tired.

261
00:20:24,393 --> 00:20:26,063
I should go to bed.

262
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:28,993
Let's talk another time.

263
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:45,143
Let's get divorced.

264
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:47,143
This is it for us.

265
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:49,483
Let's end things here.

266
00:20:53,983 --> 00:20:55,593
Why would I do as she wants?

267
00:20:56,493 --> 00:20:57,653
Never.

268
00:20:58,553 --> 00:20:59,693
Not while I live.

269
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:01,323
Darn it.

270
00:21:11,173 --> 00:21:13,573
Let's take a break, everyone. Take a breather.

271
00:21:14,173 --> 00:21:15,173
Listen up.

272
00:21:15,843 --> 00:21:16,843
Say hi.

273
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:20,083
They're a filming team from KBC.

274
00:21:20,343 --> 00:21:22,783
They want to shoot a documentary...

275
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:24,653
about our preparations for the event.

276
00:21:25,553 --> 00:21:27,083
- Nice. - Oh, my.

277
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,123
No way.

278
00:21:28,283 --> 00:21:30,923
Hello. I'm Nam Gi Poong, the director.

279
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,563
Hello.

280
00:21:33,563 --> 00:21:34,863
I hope we work together well.

281
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:39,833
Okay.

282
00:21:39,963 --> 00:21:41,933
You seem to be on the older side,

283
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,833
but I watched you dance,

284
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,773
and you were incredible.

285
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:48,443
I am pretty old,

286
00:21:48,913 --> 00:21:51,213
but I can perform as well as anyone.

287
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,943
When you dance on stage, it's not about how cool you are.

288
00:21:54,943 --> 00:21:57,253
What comes across is how serious and sincere you are.

289
00:21:57,253 --> 00:21:59,983
My gosh. That's an amazing quote.

290
00:22:34,123 --> 00:22:36,623
Ok Bun. You did great today.

291
00:22:37,153 --> 00:22:39,963
Come on. I didn't do much.

292
00:22:39,963 --> 00:22:41,263
You did all the work.

293
00:22:41,623 --> 00:22:43,193
No, don't say that.

294
00:22:43,893 --> 00:22:46,063
You watched the sandwich shop for me...

295
00:22:46,063 --> 00:22:48,033
and doubled as my manager and fan club president.

296
00:22:48,763 --> 00:22:50,673
You played multiple roles today.

297
00:22:52,503 --> 00:22:54,443
I did it because I wanted to.

298
00:22:55,603 --> 00:22:59,113
You must be tired. Go home and rest up.

299
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:00,483
Okay.

300
00:23:00,913 --> 00:23:03,113
Sleep well yourself.

301
00:23:03,213 --> 00:23:04,213
I will.

302
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:08,053
Hey.

303
00:23:08,853 --> 00:23:09,953
- It's blood. - What?

304
00:23:10,023 --> 00:23:11,893
- What? - Your nose is bleeding.

305
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:13,663
My nose?

306
00:23:33,283 --> 00:23:34,283
Ok Bun.

307
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:36,553
Yes?

308
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:40,153
It might be because I lost some blood,

309
00:23:41,683 --> 00:23:44,223
but my legs are shaking, and I'm in a daze.

310
00:23:46,323 --> 00:23:47,623
I can't make it home.

311
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:52,603
I think I need to rest here until I feel stable.

312
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:57,573
That...

313
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:00,873
would be best, wouldn't it?

314
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:20,393
(G Hair Salon)

315
00:24:47,783 --> 00:24:48,883
You can...

316
00:24:50,253 --> 00:24:52,323
run away like last time if you want to.

317
00:24:53,293 --> 00:24:55,023
I won't try to stop you.

318
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:57,693
Why would you...

319
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:01,603
say something like that to ruin...

320
00:25:02,473 --> 00:25:04,103
the romantic mood?

321
00:25:10,213 --> 00:25:11,473
I won't run away.

322
00:25:12,373 --> 00:25:14,713
I'll make the bed, cook breakfast,

323
00:25:15,643 --> 00:25:17,283
and eat with you before I leave.

324
00:25:20,483 --> 00:25:21,523
Thanks...

325
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:22,923
for not bailing.

326
00:25:26,723 --> 00:25:27,823
I promise you this.

327
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:30,733
From now on, I'll never bail on you.

328
00:25:32,903 --> 00:25:34,403
It's as Kwang Sook said.

329
00:25:35,063 --> 00:25:36,503
This is a one-way street, and I'm not turning back.

330
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:41,843
Heung Soo, you've matured.

331
00:25:46,643 --> 00:25:47,813
- It's a nosebleed. - What?

332
00:25:47,813 --> 00:25:49,783
- You're bleeding. - Again?

333
00:25:49,783 --> 00:25:52,313
You're bleeding from both nostrils this time!

334
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:54,623
Bleeding from both my nostrils?

335
00:25:54,783 --> 00:25:56,393
Darn, this is so embarrassing.

336
00:25:56,923 --> 00:25:58,953
What's there to be embarrassed about?

337
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:03,763
Should a woman be this shameless?

338
00:26:03,833 --> 00:26:04,933
We're past the point in our relationship...

339
00:26:04,933 --> 00:26:05,933
where we get embarrassed.

340
00:26:09,933 --> 00:26:11,573
You have another thing coming!

341
00:26:15,543 --> 00:26:16,673
- Wait. - Be still!

342
00:26:20,513 --> 00:26:21,543
Goodness.

343
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,713
You're up early, Mother.

344
00:26:23,813 --> 00:26:24,853
Right.

345
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:26,923
I wouldn't say I got up early.

346
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,453
It's more like I stayed up all night.

347
00:26:32,353 --> 00:26:34,123
It must be the jet lag.

348
00:26:34,323 --> 00:26:35,933
It wasn't just that.

349
00:26:36,793 --> 00:26:38,533
Thinking about one thing after another...

350
00:26:38,533 --> 00:26:39,763
kept me up until sunrise.

351
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,833
Why? Is something on your mind?

352
00:26:43,803 --> 00:26:44,803
Just so you know,

353
00:26:45,973 --> 00:26:49,373
I won't make you stay single,

354
00:26:49,513 --> 00:26:51,813
thinking only of my late daughter.

355
00:26:52,373 --> 00:26:54,443
I'm not close-minded like that.

356
00:26:54,683 --> 00:26:57,713
Of course, Mother. I know that better than anyone.

357
00:26:58,113 --> 00:27:00,723
But because you're not an average man,

358
00:27:01,483 --> 00:27:03,793
you should be more cautious.

359
00:27:05,223 --> 00:27:07,123
What do you mean by that?

360
00:27:07,723 --> 00:27:10,463
Choose wisely, keeping in mind how it'll impact...

361
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:12,603
both the company and the children.

362
00:27:13,803 --> 00:27:15,533
Don't make a rash decision...

363
00:27:15,763 --> 00:27:18,003
solely based on your emotions.

364
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:19,903
I chose her...

365
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:22,913
only after considerable deliberation and caution.

366
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:24,743
Is that so?

367
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:28,343
Why is it that I can't seem to trust you on that?

368
00:27:29,553 --> 00:27:31,283
This probably comes from...

369
00:27:31,283 --> 00:27:32,883
the first impression she made...

370
00:27:33,353 --> 00:27:35,483
when you saw her in the elevator.

371
00:27:36,223 --> 00:27:37,623
When you meet her in person,

372
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:41,193
you'll realize her good qualities outweigh everything else.

373
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,733
Really? Are you sure about that?

374
00:27:45,863 --> 00:27:48,263
I'll arrange a gathering sometime later,

375
00:27:48,263 --> 00:27:50,503
so you can see what she's like in person.

376
00:27:56,513 --> 00:27:57,743
Good morning!

377
00:27:58,713 --> 00:28:00,213
All right.

378
00:28:02,783 --> 00:28:04,213
One, two, three...

379
00:28:04,613 --> 00:28:05,913
One's missing.

380
00:28:06,683 --> 00:28:08,083
I don't see Heung Soo.

381
00:28:08,483 --> 00:28:09,893
He didn't come home last night.

382
00:28:10,023 --> 00:28:11,023
What?

383
00:28:11,353 --> 00:28:12,523
Did he not come home?

384
00:28:12,793 --> 00:28:15,363
He's been practicing his dancing until late at night.

385
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:17,033
He must've crashed at the practice studio.

386
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,903
No, not at the practice studio.

387
00:28:19,933 --> 00:28:21,933
I'm sure he was with the salon owner.

388
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,943
I'd be grateful for that.

389
00:28:27,703 --> 00:28:29,473
Exactly. It's a good thing.

390
00:28:30,473 --> 00:28:32,813
It deserves more than just a simple "Thank you."

391
00:28:35,643 --> 00:28:37,283
I'd say, "Thank you very much."

392
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:41,623
Chun Soo.

393
00:28:45,753 --> 00:28:47,523
Why is she here, crashing our morning?

394
00:28:51,093 --> 00:28:52,433
Why are you here this early?

395
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:53,863
Get up if you're done with breakfast.

396
00:28:56,873 --> 00:28:58,103
You wanted to go to the courthouse.

397
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:00,643
What?

398
00:29:08,013 --> 00:29:09,213
What happened to you?

399
00:29:11,213 --> 00:29:12,253
What do you mean?

400
00:29:12,683 --> 00:29:14,683
You totally blew me off when I said I wanted to talk...

401
00:29:14,683 --> 00:29:15,823
to you last night.

402
00:29:16,693 --> 00:29:18,053
So, why the sudden change of heart?

403
00:29:19,663 --> 00:29:21,393
Can you at least hide your joy?

404
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,593
Keep a poker face.

405
00:29:23,793 --> 00:29:24,993
If you rub me the wrong way,

406
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:27,963
I might run off on the way there.

407
00:29:28,563 --> 00:29:29,573
What?

408
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,143
I brought your underwear.

409
00:29:41,243 --> 00:29:42,853
Pull it together and get up.

410
00:29:47,823 --> 00:29:48,853
I didn't...

411
00:29:50,193 --> 00:29:51,623
I didn't ask for such things.

412
00:29:53,663 --> 00:29:54,663
Darn.

413
00:29:55,323 --> 00:29:57,333
I brought the underwear since I was on my way here.

414
00:29:59,163 --> 00:30:00,533
Anyway, I'll get straight to the point.

415
00:30:03,503 --> 00:30:04,503
I want a divorce.

416
00:30:05,533 --> 00:30:06,743
Says who?

417
00:30:06,743 --> 00:30:07,803
Me.

418
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:12,443
If you won't agree to it, I'll take legal action.

419
00:30:14,143 --> 00:30:16,083
It's always the guilty ones who bark louder.

420
00:30:16,853 --> 00:30:19,383
How can you be so shameless to demand a divorce?

421
00:30:19,383 --> 00:30:20,653
Enough is enough.

422
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:24,153
I can't live like this anymore.

423
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:28,063
You finally want to live freely. Is that it?

424
00:30:29,563 --> 00:30:30,693
I'll find the right time...

425
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:34,063
to tell Se Ri and ask for her forgiveness.

426
00:30:34,363 --> 00:30:35,433
Don't you dare.

427
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:37,003
I'll take it out on your son.

428
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:39,203
Don't you dare lay a hand on my son.

429
00:30:39,443 --> 00:30:40,473
If you do,

430
00:30:41,103 --> 00:30:43,673
you'll pay for it 10 or 20 times over.

431
00:30:47,683 --> 00:30:49,783
Did you get up on the wrong side of the bed today?

432
00:30:52,613 --> 00:30:53,753
Take the call.

433
00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:56,293
And don't forget my warning.

434
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:04,763
What the...

435
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,173
Hello?

436
00:31:10,803 --> 00:31:14,043
Why couldn't I reach you all day yesterday?

437
00:31:14,343 --> 00:31:15,873
I booked my flight...

438
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:16,943
but had to cancel...

439
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:18,213
because I couldn't get in touch with you.

440
00:31:18,873 --> 00:31:19,913
Forget it!

441
00:31:20,883 --> 00:31:21,913
Shoot.

442
00:31:23,113 --> 00:31:24,113
Darn!

443
00:31:29,953 --> 00:31:31,023
Hello?

444
00:31:31,393 --> 00:31:32,723
Bom, it's been a while.

445
00:31:33,423 --> 00:31:34,923
Have you been well, Ms. Jang?

446
00:31:35,823 --> 00:31:37,563
I hope you've been well.

447
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:39,063
Of course.

448
00:31:40,103 --> 00:31:42,363
I called to ask you something.

449
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:47,103
Did Mr. Oh Kang Soo show up at work today?

450
00:31:48,003 --> 00:31:49,003
Sorry?

451
00:31:49,673 --> 00:31:52,473
Yes, a while ago. Should I put him on?

452
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:54,183
No, that isn't necessary.

453
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:57,383
I'm glad to know he showed up for work.

454
00:31:58,553 --> 00:32:00,923
We'll talk again sometime later, okay?

455
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:02,783
Sure.

456
00:32:06,763 --> 00:32:07,793
What was that about?

457
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:15,633
Thanks.

458
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:19,803
Did something happen with Se Ri's mom?

459
00:32:21,903 --> 00:32:22,913
Why are you asking?

460
00:32:23,813 --> 00:32:25,273
She called just now,

461
00:32:25,273 --> 00:32:28,913
wondering if you made it to work.

462
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:48,233
Se Ri, have a seat.

463
00:33:00,283 --> 00:33:01,413
I've decided...

464
00:33:02,543 --> 00:33:05,053
to give you my blessing.

465
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:09,623
You can date...

466
00:33:11,253 --> 00:33:12,423
Professor Oh.

467
00:33:12,923 --> 00:33:13,993
Mom.

468
00:33:14,593 --> 00:33:16,963
I'm sorry I made things harder on you,

469
00:33:17,863 --> 00:33:19,493
my daughter.

470
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:22,103
Do you mean that?

471
00:33:22,363 --> 00:33:24,003
Of course, I do.

472
00:33:26,103 --> 00:33:28,503
All this time,

473
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:30,543
I've been treating you like a child.

474
00:33:31,413 --> 00:33:32,873
But I've come to see...

475
00:33:33,143 --> 00:33:35,883
that you're more mature and considerate than I am...

476
00:33:36,653 --> 00:33:38,613
in some ways.

477
00:33:43,623 --> 00:33:45,023
Because of that,

478
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:48,963
I'm going to trust your decision.

479
00:33:51,293 --> 00:33:52,393
Mom...

480
00:33:53,203 --> 00:33:57,303
Even if I'm not by your side,

481
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:00,973
I find comfort in knowing that Professor Oh...

482
00:34:02,503 --> 00:34:03,913
will be there for you.

483
00:34:04,913 --> 00:34:06,313
What do you mean by that?

484
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,713
Why won't you be by my side?

485
00:34:10,353 --> 00:34:11,983
I'm not getting any younger.

486
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,283
It's not like I can stay in your life forever.

487
00:34:14,983 --> 00:34:15,983
You can.

488
00:34:18,093 --> 00:34:20,263
- What? - Don't grow old, Mom.

489
00:34:21,723 --> 00:34:23,493
Looking just like this,

490
00:34:23,593 --> 00:34:26,263
you'll be in my life forever. Got it?

491
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:28,503
Sure.

492
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:33,903
I'd love that too.

493
00:34:51,493 --> 00:34:52,493
Hey, Se Ri.

494
00:34:53,393 --> 00:34:54,763
I have good news.

495
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,093
Good news?

496
00:34:56,893 --> 00:34:59,833
My mom gave us her blessing.

497
00:35:02,103 --> 00:35:03,503
What do you mean by that?

498
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,303
She's letting us date.

499
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,043
What's with that reaction?

500
00:35:17,683 --> 00:35:19,483
Am I the only one who's happy about it?

501
00:35:20,523 --> 00:35:22,123
It's not like that.

502
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,923
It is so sudden that I'm a little confused.

503
00:35:26,963 --> 00:35:29,263
I'm also taken aback here.

504
00:35:30,163 --> 00:35:32,633
I knew she was softening up,

505
00:35:32,633 --> 00:35:35,303
but I didn't know she'd change her mind this quickly.

506
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:39,433
I feel like I'm dreaming now.

507
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:43,073
I know.

508
00:35:54,123 --> 00:35:55,253
Welcome.

509
00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:59,253
Hey, Chun Soo.

510
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:08,303
You seem to be in a good mood.

511
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:09,973
Is something good happening?

512
00:36:12,933 --> 00:36:14,573
I'm on my way back from the courthouse.

513
00:36:15,503 --> 00:36:16,773
So Yeon and I...

514
00:36:17,743 --> 00:36:18,913
have finished up...

515
00:36:21,443 --> 00:36:22,583
the legal procedures.

516
00:36:27,553 --> 00:36:28,783
Really?

517
00:36:35,923 --> 00:36:37,833
I'm here to tell you first.

518
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:54,313
It must've been very stressful for you,

519
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:57,213
but you've put up with everything without complaining.

520
00:36:59,683 --> 00:37:00,723
Thank you.

521
00:37:13,403 --> 00:37:15,203
I promise I'll make it up to you.

522
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:33,483
Yes.

523
00:37:34,423 --> 00:37:36,223
We got the divorce certificate from the court...

524
00:37:36,223 --> 00:37:38,593
and submitted it to the town office today.

525
00:37:38,593 --> 00:37:39,693
Are you happy now?

526
00:37:41,663 --> 00:37:42,693
You brat.

527
00:37:43,793 --> 00:37:45,863
Do you not worry about your mom at all?

528
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,303
You always take your dad's side.

529
00:37:48,563 --> 00:37:49,733
Okay.

530
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:52,473
I'll catch the night flight and go back.

531
00:37:52,473 --> 00:37:54,003
Stop nagging me, okay?

532
00:37:54,803 --> 00:37:55,903
I'm hanging up.

533
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,409
(Eagle Brewery)

534
00:38:40,924 --> 00:38:41,924
Kwang Sook.

535
00:38:44,954 --> 00:38:45,964
You're here.

536
00:38:47,894 --> 00:38:50,834
You heard from Chun Soo, right?

537
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,774
Thank you for making...

538
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,144
such a difficult decision.

539
00:39:03,544 --> 00:39:07,484
I'm not sure if this is something I should be thanked for.

540
00:39:13,824 --> 00:39:16,924
I'm no longer part of this family,

541
00:39:17,654 --> 00:39:20,294
but I thought I should say goodbye, so I stopped by.

542
00:39:23,394 --> 00:39:24,464
Are you...

543
00:39:25,434 --> 00:39:26,634
going back to the US?

544
00:39:27,604 --> 00:39:29,904
Yes. I'll be flying out tonight.

545
00:39:33,544 --> 00:39:36,144
Stay healthy anyway.

546
00:39:36,944 --> 00:39:39,514
Forget all about being scammed...

547
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:41,644
and start fresh.

548
00:39:43,154 --> 00:39:44,484
You have Yeoung Ju with you.

549
00:39:50,854 --> 00:39:53,394
I don't know if I have the right to say this,

550
00:39:54,194 --> 00:39:55,794
but please take good care of Chun Soo.

551
00:39:58,864 --> 00:40:00,504
He's far from being harsh,

552
00:40:00,904 --> 00:40:03,104
so he needs his family to help him.

553
00:40:04,904 --> 00:40:06,174
Don't worry about him.

554
00:40:07,704 --> 00:40:08,704
And...

555
00:40:09,814 --> 00:40:11,114
about Yeoung Ju's tuition.

556
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:15,614
As I promised, I will try my best...

557
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:17,854
to help you with that.

558
00:40:24,324 --> 00:40:25,454
Thank you.

559
00:40:32,434 --> 00:40:33,734
Take good care of Yeoung Ju.

560
00:40:36,404 --> 00:40:38,034
This is your problem.

561
00:40:38,634 --> 00:40:39,644
What?

562
00:40:39,644 --> 00:40:41,774
Why would you even ask me to take care of my own daughter?

563
00:40:41,874 --> 00:40:43,544
It's not like Yeoung Ju is a burden to me.

564
00:40:44,014 --> 00:40:46,684
You are finding fault with me again.

565
00:40:47,914 --> 00:40:50,014
I only said it because I feel bad I can't be there for her.

566
00:40:50,654 --> 00:40:52,184
Why would you feel bad?

567
00:40:53,624 --> 00:40:55,554
You've done more than enough.

568
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,194
I mean it.

569
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:03,894
You've done...

570
00:41:05,434 --> 00:41:06,604
everything you could.

571
00:41:12,274 --> 00:41:13,904
Thank you for realizing it after all this time.

572
00:41:17,444 --> 00:41:18,674
Take good care of your health.

573
00:41:20,114 --> 00:41:21,744
You take care too.

574
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,354
Now that you abandoned your wife who gave birth to your child,

575
00:41:26,154 --> 00:41:28,054
I believe you can be more spiteful too.

576
00:41:29,554 --> 00:41:31,154
Don't let others steal from you.

577
00:41:31,624 --> 00:41:34,564
Make sure to be more spiteful and line your own pocket.

578
00:41:37,094 --> 00:41:40,734
It sounds like a request and a complaint at the same time.

579
00:41:43,274 --> 00:41:44,534
It's both.

580
00:41:48,904 --> 00:41:50,044
Okay.

581
00:41:57,714 --> 00:41:59,384
And about the convenience store lady.

582
00:42:09,024 --> 00:42:10,564
She's perfect for you.

583
00:42:13,004 --> 00:42:15,364
She seems nice but spiteful at the same time.

584
00:42:16,074 --> 00:42:18,604
She seems weak, but she's actually tough.

585
00:42:19,034 --> 00:42:22,274
You should've met a woman like her sooner.

586
00:42:27,914 --> 00:42:29,384
And I hope you will find someone nice too.

587
00:42:31,114 --> 00:42:32,954
Don't fall for a fraud again.

588
00:42:56,474 --> 00:42:57,714
I hope to hear...

589
00:42:59,114 --> 00:43:00,744
only good news from Yeoung Ju.

590
00:43:03,284 --> 00:43:04,384
Goodbye,

591
00:43:06,824 --> 00:43:07,854
So Yeon.

592
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:14,224
Take care.

593
00:43:29,914 --> 00:43:30,974
The taxi is here.

594
00:43:30,974 --> 00:43:32,074
Okay.

595
00:44:05,444 --> 00:44:07,244
You've been through a lot because of me,

596
00:44:09,184 --> 00:44:10,414
Chun Soo.

(Eagle Brewery)

599
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:38,974
Did the Vice-CEO's wife return to the US for good?

600
00:44:39,074 --> 00:44:41,514
Yes. They finalized the legal stuff,

601
00:44:41,514 --> 00:44:43,014
so she's leaving today.

602
00:44:43,454 --> 00:44:45,984
It's as if I got a rotten tooth pulled.

(Samhan Mart CEO Kim Sam Han)

604
00:44:54,664 --> 00:44:55,924
Hello, Mr. Kim.

605
00:44:55,964 --> 00:44:58,134
I called with some good news.

606
00:44:59,304 --> 00:45:00,734
Good news?

607
00:45:01,264 --> 00:45:03,434
It looks like Jang-Kwang yakju will be huge.

608
00:45:03,804 --> 00:45:06,744
Word must have gotten out. We're getting a good response.

609
00:45:07,874 --> 00:45:08,874
Are you, really?

610
00:45:10,714 --> 00:45:11,774
Yes.

611
00:45:11,974 --> 00:45:14,344
We can double the export shipment.

612
00:45:16,954 --> 00:45:17,984
Yes.

613
00:45:18,414 --> 00:45:20,224
Okay. Thank you.

614
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:25,294
What was that about?

615
00:45:25,794 --> 00:45:29,434
Jang-Kwang yakju must be doing well in the US.

616
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:32,064
They want us to send twice as much.

617
00:45:32,194 --> 00:45:33,304
Already?

618
00:45:34,304 --> 00:45:35,764
Word must have gotten out.

619
00:45:35,904 --> 00:45:37,574
Eagle Brewery's products...

620
00:45:37,574 --> 00:45:39,974
are going global at last.

621
00:45:40,474 --> 00:45:41,474
That's great.

622
00:45:41,474 --> 00:45:43,944
That's right. We can only go up.

(Silla Brewery)

624
00:45:48,584 --> 00:45:49,584
Sir.

625
00:45:49,884 --> 00:45:52,254
The employees are saying it's too risky...

626
00:45:52,414 --> 00:45:54,284
to go all in on a premium makgeolli.

627
00:45:54,884 --> 00:45:57,824
Goodness. They can't even do as they're told,

628
00:45:57,824 --> 00:45:59,724
and they think they can talk? Give me a break.

629
00:46:01,324 --> 00:46:03,694
The major shareholders will push back too.

630
00:46:04,064 --> 00:46:05,334
That's why...

631
00:46:05,534 --> 00:46:08,534
we must get started before they find out.

632
00:46:08,834 --> 00:46:10,374
I'll take full responsibility.

633
00:46:10,404 --> 00:46:13,604
Proceed as discreetly as possible. You got that?

634
00:46:14,504 --> 00:46:15,944
Yes, sir.

Just you wait.

637
00:46:25,714 --> 00:46:29,154
I'll crush the eagles just like this.

638
00:46:30,294 --> 00:46:31,394
Boom.

639
00:46:37,664 --> 00:46:38,734
Hello.

640
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:42,164
You're back. It's nice to see you so often.

641
00:46:42,434 --> 00:46:44,274
Yes. Today, I'm here...

642
00:46:44,274 --> 00:46:46,204
to check things out and buy a gift.

643
00:46:47,244 --> 00:46:50,274
I'm shopping for someone with a good eye for fashion.

644
00:46:50,644 --> 00:46:51,974
I need to choose well.

645
00:46:57,954 --> 00:46:59,584
This is fine as it is,

646
00:46:59,584 --> 00:47:01,784
but it would look nicer with a bag.

647
00:47:10,234 --> 00:47:11,264
That's perfect.

648
00:47:14,904 --> 00:47:16,704
How was this design received?

649
00:47:16,704 --> 00:47:19,134
Women like this design these days.

650
00:47:19,944 --> 00:47:22,674
What kind of style does the person you're shopping for like?

651
00:47:23,014 --> 00:47:24,114
Well,

652
00:47:24,844 --> 00:47:27,514
she dresses as flashily as young people do these days.

653
00:47:27,614 --> 00:47:28,944
She likes dresses too.

654
00:47:33,324 --> 00:47:35,154
How about this, then?

655
00:47:35,484 --> 00:47:38,194
It has a bright pattern, but the material's light,

656
00:47:38,194 --> 00:47:39,694
so it's perfect for the current weather.

657
00:47:40,694 --> 00:47:43,594
I like it. Can you gift-wrap that for me?

658
00:47:50,074 --> 00:47:53,474
Why would you carry something this heavy yourself?

659
00:47:53,474 --> 00:47:55,204
You should've called me.

660
00:47:55,344 --> 00:47:58,044
I can handle this kind of weight. It's not too heavy.

661
00:48:02,044 --> 00:48:03,814
Why is it just you two?

662
00:48:04,484 --> 00:48:05,984
Come and have some watermelon.

663
00:48:05,984 --> 00:48:06,984
Come along.

664
00:48:25,004 --> 00:48:26,004
It's so cold that my teeth hurt.

665
00:48:26,174 --> 00:48:27,774
Give me that slice.

666
00:48:29,004 --> 00:48:31,074
I'll blow it warm for you.

667
00:48:31,544 --> 00:48:32,574
Leave it.

668
00:48:34,814 --> 00:48:36,584
What are you two doing?

669
00:48:37,384 --> 00:48:39,184
It looks like you're dating.

670
00:48:42,024 --> 00:48:44,054
There's no way you could be a couple...

671
00:48:44,324 --> 00:48:45,824
with your age difference.

672
00:48:49,964 --> 00:48:51,064
Kim.

673
00:48:53,164 --> 00:48:54,634
Do you know my exact age?

674
00:48:55,834 --> 00:48:58,934
I don't know exactly, but aren't you and Mr. Go...

675
00:48:59,204 --> 00:49:00,974
about ten years apart?

676
00:49:01,344 --> 00:49:02,404
What?

677
00:49:03,344 --> 00:49:05,614
You fool! What's wrong with your eyes?

678
00:49:05,614 --> 00:49:09,614
She could pass for someone ten years my junior.

679
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:11,814
There's no way she'd be ten years older!

680
00:49:12,384 --> 00:49:14,254
Did you have a heat stroke?

681
00:49:14,424 --> 00:49:15,984
She looks way older than you.

682
00:49:16,324 --> 00:49:17,324
Darn you.

683
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:20,864
Kim.

684
00:49:21,364 --> 00:49:23,964
Don't ever think of having watermelon again.

685
00:49:25,764 --> 00:49:27,164
Mrs. Gong.

686
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:34,404
Wait! You can't walk off during a watermelon break.

687
00:49:36,074 --> 00:49:39,374
Do you think I'm in the mood for watermelon?

688
00:49:40,414 --> 00:49:42,244
I'll come back looking ten years younger.

689
00:49:43,284 --> 00:49:44,354
Just you wait.

00:50:01,704 --> 00:50:03,004
Welcome.

692
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:05,634
Did you hear from the secretaries' office?

693
00:50:05,934 --> 00:50:08,574
Chairman Han said he'd call his secretary.

694
00:50:09,244 --> 00:50:10,314
Just a moment, please.

695
00:50:12,614 --> 00:50:15,044
Are you Madam Gong Ju Sil?

696
00:50:15,044 --> 00:50:16,454
Yes, that's me.

697
00:50:16,854 --> 00:50:20,524
The chairman's secretary told us to take extra good care of you.

698
00:50:20,924 --> 00:50:23,254
If you sit and wait, someone will come for you.

699
00:50:23,594 --> 00:50:24,594
Okay.

700
00:50:32,734 --> 00:50:34,764
Excuse me.

701
00:50:38,604 --> 00:50:41,444
You must come here often.

702
00:50:42,904 --> 00:50:44,014
No.

703
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:46,174
This is my first visit.

704
00:50:46,884 --> 00:50:48,784
Chairman Han said...

705
00:50:49,044 --> 00:50:52,154
"Mother, you should take better care of yourself."

706
00:50:53,084 --> 00:50:54,684
But I was busy with my business,

707
00:50:54,884 --> 00:50:56,184
so I didn't have the time.

708
00:50:56,954 --> 00:50:58,424
Chairman Han...

709
00:50:59,054 --> 00:51:02,164
as in Chairman Han Dong Seok?

710
00:51:06,734 --> 00:51:08,204
Do you know Chairman Han?

711
00:51:10,674 --> 00:51:11,704
Yes.

712
00:51:11,904 --> 00:51:13,974
- My gosh. - Our families are close.

713
00:51:13,974 --> 00:51:15,604
Oh, is that so?

714
00:51:15,744 --> 00:51:18,874
Then we might meet every now and then.

715
00:51:19,114 --> 00:51:20,484
It looks like...

716
00:51:20,944 --> 00:51:23,314
Chairman Han calls you "Mother."

717
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,654
His birth mother...

718
00:51:25,854 --> 00:51:27,854
passed away a long time ago.

719
00:51:29,794 --> 00:51:31,354
My daughter is...

720
00:51:32,224 --> 00:51:33,294
Chairman Han's...

721
00:51:34,994 --> 00:51:36,224
fiancee.

722
00:51:41,664 --> 00:51:42,704
I see.

723
00:51:43,304 --> 00:51:45,074
Then are you...

724
00:51:45,704 --> 00:51:48,544
the brewery CEO's mother?

725
00:51:49,914 --> 00:51:52,844
Goodness. How do you know that?

726
00:51:54,284 --> 00:51:57,514
Chairman Han told me briefly a few days ago.

727
00:52:00,024 --> 00:52:02,154
Oh, I see.

728
00:52:02,424 --> 00:52:06,124
You must be really close with Chairman Han.

729
00:52:07,964 --> 00:52:11,134
Yes. You could say so.

730
00:52:11,664 --> 00:52:12,794
Isn't he...

731
00:52:13,164 --> 00:52:16,064
so manly and incredible?

732
00:52:16,434 --> 00:52:19,374
He's the best son-in-law material in the whole country.

733
00:52:20,004 --> 00:52:21,044
He is.

734
00:52:21,774 --> 00:52:24,344
He has a great personality, and he's charismatic too.

735
00:52:24,514 --> 00:52:26,044
And most importantly,

736
00:52:26,274 --> 00:52:29,284
he'll even pretend to roll over and die for my daughter.

737
00:52:30,384 --> 00:52:33,284
He must have a side I didn't know about.

738
00:52:33,424 --> 00:52:34,824
There's a reason they say...

739
00:52:34,824 --> 00:52:37,124
if a man loves his wife enough,

740
00:52:37,394 --> 00:52:39,454
he'll even bow to her family's garden post.

741
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:42,564
He wants to marry my daughter so much...

742
00:52:42,894 --> 00:52:45,534
that he practically took all four...

743
00:52:45,664 --> 00:52:48,164
of her brothers-in-law under his wing.

744
00:52:48,564 --> 00:52:49,774
Her brothers-in-law?

745
00:52:50,074 --> 00:52:51,074
Yes.

746
00:52:51,074 --> 00:52:53,404
He made one an outside director.

747
00:52:53,674 --> 00:52:55,804
Another got a job at LX Fashion.

748
00:52:55,874 --> 00:52:58,144
Yet another is running a sandwich shop,

749
00:52:58,444 --> 00:53:00,344
and he supplies snacks...

750
00:53:00,584 --> 00:53:02,914
to the hotel staff twice a week.

751
00:53:03,554 --> 00:53:04,654
Chairman Han...

752
00:53:05,414 --> 00:53:06,984
arranged for the order.

753
00:53:08,624 --> 00:53:11,624
I see he is extra considerate.

754
00:53:12,154 --> 00:53:14,894
Madam Gong Ju Sil. Please come with me.

755
00:53:17,334 --> 00:53:19,134
I hope to see you again.

756
00:53:20,434 --> 00:53:21,504
I'm coming.

757
00:53:32,814 --> 00:53:35,184
I just spoke with my friend.

758
00:53:35,184 --> 00:53:37,884
He thinks Jang-Kwang yakju is going to be a hit.

759
00:53:37,884 --> 00:53:39,184
He's really excited.

760
00:53:40,354 --> 00:53:42,624
I owe it all to you, sir.

761
00:53:44,894 --> 00:53:45,924
Goodness.

762
00:53:46,254 --> 00:53:48,094
You went back to saying "sir?"

763
00:53:50,264 --> 00:53:52,294
We need to be careful at the hotel,

764
00:53:52,664 --> 00:53:54,434
so I'll call you that when I'm here.

765
00:53:56,364 --> 00:53:57,404
Come in.

766
00:54:02,574 --> 00:54:04,844
It's time for your marketing meeting.

767
00:54:05,114 --> 00:54:07,044
Oh, okay.

768
00:54:10,954 --> 00:54:13,454
I have to get back to the brewery.

769
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:14,754
I'll let you work.

770
00:54:15,224 --> 00:54:16,854
I'll call you later, then.

771
00:54:29,204 --> 00:54:30,374
Hello.

772
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:34,904
Ms. Sweetie, is it?

773
00:54:37,544 --> 00:54:38,574
Yes, ma'am.

774
00:54:39,674 --> 00:54:42,214
I take it you were with Chairman Han.

775
00:54:42,214 --> 00:54:43,514
After making my deliveries,

776
00:54:43,514 --> 00:54:46,114
I stopped by to see him.

777
00:54:47,224 --> 00:54:49,284
I was about to get some tea.

778
00:54:50,054 --> 00:54:51,224
Would you like to join me?

779
00:54:57,594 --> 00:54:59,594
Chairman Han told me a bit about you.

780
00:55:00,204 --> 00:55:03,704
You lost your husband just ten days after marrying him.

781
00:55:07,644 --> 00:55:08,644
That's right.

782
00:55:09,074 --> 00:55:10,144
Oh, dear.

783
00:55:11,744 --> 00:55:13,644
It must've been devastating.

784
00:55:15,214 --> 00:55:16,284
At first,

785
00:55:17,354 --> 00:55:19,354
it really took a toll on me.

786
00:55:22,384 --> 00:55:24,194
The dead may feel wronged,

787
00:55:24,594 --> 00:55:26,764
but the living learn to move forward.

788
00:55:27,894 --> 00:55:31,064
Isn't that why you're considering marrying Chairman Han?

789
00:55:32,734 --> 00:55:33,764
Sorry?

790
00:55:33,764 --> 00:55:35,764
I heard you ran a brewery.

791
00:55:35,934 --> 00:55:38,234
I, for one, have never been a fan of makgeolli.

792
00:55:38,804 --> 00:55:42,304
The sweet and tart taste doesn't quite agree with me.

793
00:55:44,574 --> 00:55:48,514
Our makgeolli is strongly carbonated and gently acidic,

794
00:55:48,514 --> 00:55:50,284
which gives it a refreshing taste.

795
00:55:51,084 --> 00:55:54,484
It's often called the Dal Perignon of makgeolli.

796
00:55:55,684 --> 00:55:59,154
Makgeolli can't be anything but that. Don't be ridiculous.

797
00:55:59,154 --> 00:56:02,024
Our makgeolli tastes nothing like...

798
00:56:02,024 --> 00:56:04,064
your typical store-bought makgeolli.

799
00:56:05,034 --> 00:56:07,904
Would you care to try a sip?

800
00:56:09,234 --> 00:56:10,934
Are you really that confident in your product?

801
00:56:11,704 --> 00:56:12,774
Yes.

802
00:56:13,104 --> 00:56:16,914
I take pride in our makgeolli being Korea's finest.

803
00:56:21,844 --> 00:56:23,984
(Jang-Kwang Makgeolli)

804
00:56:33,024 --> 00:56:34,894
- Allow me. - Sure.

805
00:56:37,434 --> 00:56:39,634
Allow me to pour you a drink.

806
00:56:40,364 --> 00:56:41,464
Forget it.

807
00:56:41,904 --> 00:56:44,604
We're not close enough to actually drink together,

808
00:56:44,604 --> 00:56:45,874
so I'll pour my own glass.

809
00:56:58,984 --> 00:57:01,284
Wait, you shouldn't shake it like that.

810
00:57:03,394 --> 00:57:05,294
- Oh, no. - My gosh!

811
00:57:07,164 --> 00:57:09,994
Are you all right? My goodness!

812
00:57:10,664 --> 00:57:12,464
- Wait. - What on earth...

813
00:57:15,464 --> 00:57:16,664
I'm so sorry.

814
00:57:18,674 --> 00:57:19,674
I'm sorry.

815
00:57:24,714 --> 00:57:27,244
Our makgeolli is highly carbonated and...

816
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:28,744
I'm sorry.

817
00:57:29,514 --> 00:57:31,314
You're just telling me that now?

818
00:57:32,284 --> 00:57:34,484
You should have told me before I opened the bottle.

819
00:57:38,594 --> 00:57:40,424
I'm truly sorry.

820
00:57:46,234 --> 00:57:47,464
I'm sorry.

821
00:57:54,274 --> 00:57:56,104
She already hates me as it is,

822
00:57:58,074 --> 00:57:59,414
and now I'm completely in the doghouse.

823
00:58:03,554 --> 00:58:04,654
I see you're home.

824
00:58:05,484 --> 00:58:07,524
Kwang Sook told me what happened.

825
00:58:07,524 --> 00:58:09,854
I heard there was an embarrassing incident.

826
00:58:10,494 --> 00:58:12,794
I didn't expect it, which made it all the more embarrassing.

827
00:58:13,664 --> 00:58:15,494
She's not very composed.

828
00:58:16,294 --> 00:58:19,094
I'm sure she was just nervous,

829
00:58:19,094 --> 00:58:20,204
unlike how she usually is.

830
00:58:20,604 --> 00:58:23,704
Anyway, due to the big commotion earlier today,

831
00:58:23,804 --> 00:58:25,334
we couldn't talk properly.

832
00:58:26,034 --> 00:58:27,574
Can you give me her number?

833
00:58:28,244 --> 00:58:29,804
Are you going to meet her again?

834
00:58:30,274 --> 00:58:31,274
Yes.

835
00:58:31,844 --> 00:58:34,014
I'd like to have an in-depth conversation with her.

836
00:58:35,084 --> 00:58:37,154
Why? Are you against it?

837
00:58:38,954 --> 00:58:40,424
Gosh, no.

838
00:58:41,324 --> 00:58:45,054
How about this? Maybe we can all get together.

839
00:58:45,224 --> 00:58:47,664
I'll make a proper introduction.

840
00:58:48,064 --> 00:58:50,134
And take time off your busy schedule?

841
00:58:50,864 --> 00:58:52,664
It's not like we're complete strangers.

842
00:58:53,564 --> 00:58:56,434
Still, my being there...

843
00:58:56,434 --> 00:58:58,504
will help her relax...

844
00:58:58,504 --> 00:59:02,304
and make it easier for you to talk to her.

845
00:59:03,304 --> 00:59:06,574
Fine. Do as you please.

846
00:59:14,784 --> 00:59:18,394
You've met her before, but let me properly introduce her.

847
00:59:18,894 --> 00:59:21,624
This is the CEO of Eagle Brewery,

848
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:23,124
Ma Kwang Sook.

849
00:59:25,994 --> 00:59:28,764
Hello, ma'am. I'm Ma Kwang Sook.

850
00:59:29,264 --> 00:59:31,734
I'm a great pleasure to see you again.

851
00:59:32,634 --> 00:59:36,444
The last time we met, I caused you a lot of trouble.

852
00:59:36,974 --> 00:59:38,214
Stop. That's okay.

853
00:59:39,044 --> 00:59:40,484
Let bygones be bygones.

854
00:59:41,644 --> 00:59:42,714
You should sit.

855
00:59:43,014 --> 00:59:44,784
Sure. Go ahead.

856
00:59:52,554 --> 00:59:54,564
And this is...

857
00:59:54,564 --> 00:59:57,664
Ms. Park Jung Soo, my mother-in-law.

858
00:59:57,964 --> 00:59:59,994
I was planning to introduce you to her...

859
00:59:59,994 --> 01:00:02,634
if we ever traveled to the US.

860
01:00:02,634 --> 01:00:04,674
She happened to be in town,

861
01:00:04,674 --> 01:00:06,834
so I arranged this dinner for us.

862
01:00:08,304 --> 01:00:11,874
It's a pleasure to meet you once again.

863
01:00:14,684 --> 01:00:16,584
Isn't it tiring to manage a brewery?

864
01:00:18,454 --> 01:00:19,954
The work is tough,

865
01:00:20,354 --> 01:00:22,484
but thanks to my brothers' help,

866
01:00:22,624 --> 01:00:24,424
it's been enjoyable.

867
01:00:26,024 --> 01:00:27,394
Your brothers, as in...

868
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:29,894
I didn't get a chance to tell you,

869
01:00:30,664 --> 01:00:32,164
but she's talking...

870
01:00:32,164 --> 01:00:34,004
about her late husband's younger brothers.

871
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,334
How many are there?

872
01:00:37,174 --> 01:00:38,374
Four in total.

873
01:00:42,604 --> 01:00:43,774
That's more than a few.

874
01:00:44,714 --> 01:00:46,874
Do they all work at the brewery?

875
01:00:47,814 --> 01:00:49,114
Not really.

876
01:00:51,314 --> 01:00:52,514
I'd prefer to hear this...

877
01:00:53,354 --> 01:00:55,984
from CEO Ma rather than from you.

878
01:00:57,594 --> 01:00:59,324
Oh, of course.

879
01:01:00,424 --> 01:01:01,424
Right.

880
01:01:02,224 --> 01:01:03,864
The eldest brother-in-law...

881
01:01:03,864 --> 01:01:06,764
is both my colleague and the brewery's vice-CEO.

882
01:01:07,234 --> 01:01:09,064
The other three brothers...

883
01:01:09,064 --> 01:01:12,004
are building their own careers in different fields.

884
01:01:12,534 --> 01:01:13,944
One works as a college professor,

885
01:01:13,944 --> 01:01:16,374
another is in the F and B industry, and...

886
01:01:16,374 --> 01:01:18,874
I'd rather you not say anything.

887
01:01:22,244 --> 01:01:23,244
Right.

888
01:01:29,654 --> 01:01:33,124
Please excuse me for a moment. I need to take this important call.

889
01:01:33,124 --> 01:01:34,124
Go ahead.

890
01:01:51,544 --> 01:01:55,044
I'm not going to object to you two dating.

891
01:01:57,614 --> 01:01:58,814
Thank you.

892
01:01:59,614 --> 01:02:00,654
However,

893
01:02:03,124 --> 01:02:04,654
I'm against the two of you marrying.

894
01:02:06,654 --> 01:02:07,664
Sorry?

895
01:02:08,194 --> 01:02:09,994
Being the pure soul he is,

896
01:02:09,994 --> 01:02:11,634
Dong Seok won't consider other matters.

897
01:02:12,194 --> 01:02:15,104
But I must, since I'm the children's grandmother.

898
01:02:16,904 --> 01:02:18,674
CEO Ma Kwang Sook, was it?

899
01:02:21,574 --> 01:02:22,574
Yes.

900
01:02:22,774 --> 01:02:23,844
You see,

901
01:02:24,744 --> 01:02:28,314
I don't see you as someone who can replace my daughter.

902
01:02:30,584 --> 01:02:32,514
While her position has much to offer,

903
01:02:33,184 --> 01:02:35,324
it also demands responsibilities of equal weight.

904
01:02:35,784 --> 01:02:38,324
It does not suit you at all.

905
01:02:41,894 --> 01:02:43,494
Right, we'll do that. Sure.

906
01:02:45,664 --> 01:02:47,164
What I said...

907
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:50,004
will be kept between us for now.

908
01:02:51,404 --> 01:02:52,904
Anyway, since we're here,

909
01:02:53,234 --> 01:02:55,974
we might as well share a meal before we part ways.

910
01:03:45,024 --> 01:03:47,624
(For Eagle Brothers)

911
01:03:47,864 --> 01:03:49,624
You've got to be kidding me.

912
01:03:49,964 --> 01:03:51,494
An ex-mother-in-law...

913
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,534
has no business getting involved in her son-in-law's marriage.

914
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:58,404
It's Chun Soo. He's marrying Mi Sun.

915
01:03:58,474 --> 01:04:00,074
Everyone, applaud!

916
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:05,374
How dare she play house, pretending to be my baby's mom?

917
01:04:06,644 --> 01:04:08,714
If you don't have any other plans, come home early today.

918
01:04:08,784 --> 01:04:10,984
