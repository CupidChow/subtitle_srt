What? Are you saying that
because you aren't giving birth?

184
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:09,440
I'd give birth to them instead of you if I could.

185
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,880
Gosh, I'm having twins at my age.

186
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,440
This is like a full-course marathon.

187
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:19,220
I'll stand with you at the starting line

188
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,100
and cross the finish line with you, too.

189
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,270
Don't worry about anything.

190
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:26,650
It's not as easy as it sounds, Mr. Han.

191
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,940
The doctor told us...

192
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,130
that you're in an ideal condition.

193
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:36,190
We can finish the race safely. Don't worry.

194
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:49,730
Are you happy about something, sir?

195
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,210
We were just at the hospital.

196
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,510
We're having twins.

197
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,420
Twins?

198
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,050
Do you want to see the photo?

199
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,290
Here's plum blossom tea, sir.

200
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:15,480
Ms. Yun, Ms. Ma is pregnant with twins.

201
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:18,910
Wow. Daebak.

202
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,020
Daebak, right?

203
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,400
Wow. You sure are on another level, Chairman.

204
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,300
The male employees are impressed with you.

205
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,080
They're calling you a role model.

206
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,770
Gosh. Role model, my foot.

207
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,250
Hyungnim must've been so happy.

208
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,590
Yes. His smile is this big.

209
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,620
He must be thrilled to have twins.

210
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,540
I know.

211
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,530
Ms. Ma...

212
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,800
Gosh, my head.

213
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,910
Let me make things clear now.

214
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:07,120
Mrs. Gong and I cannot break up.

215
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,270
I don't know what my mom said to seduce you,

216
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,070
but I'm against it.

217
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,210
I'm Mrs. Gong Joo Sil's daughter.

218
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,440
I know her personality better than anyone.

219
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,640
The day I break up with Mrs. Gong

220
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,410
will be the day I cut ties with Eagle Brewery.

221
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:30,690
Pardon?

222
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:36,640
That means I'm prepared
for the worst-case scenario.

223
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,690
So cool.

224
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,500
All right, then.

225
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,780
I'll stop by the workroom.

226
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,620
Gosh, my head.

227
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:02,280
I can't stress out.

228
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:10,660
What is it now?

229
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,650
Let me warn you.

230
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,130
If you speak poorly of me to Mr. Go,

231
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,590
it won't be good.

232
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,080
Did he already tell you about it?

233
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,650
Let me make this clear.

234
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,860
Don't pressure Mr. Go.

235
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,830
Mom, will you really be responsible for him?

236
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,270
You can't break up because of
personality differences and whatnot.

237
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,870
I won't let the innocent Manager Go get hurt.

238
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,660
Okay, you brat.

239
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,690
Your manager won't get hurt.

240
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,170
Don't worry about it.

241
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,590
When will you have the wedding, then?

242
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,150
Why would we have a wedding?

243
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:53,070
You said you'd be responsible until the end.

244
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,070
You should get married, then.

245
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:57,600
Why are you so uptight?

246
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,850
Why would we get married at our age?

247
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:03,270
Will you only date and not get married?

248
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,170
We agreed to date freely and

249
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:10,120
move in together when we get older.

250
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,090
What are you, the new generation?

251
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:17,030
You know I'm a trendy person.

252
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,490
Whatever. Whatever. Okay.

253
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:24,140
I'll hang up.

254
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,860
Gosh, seriously.

255
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:38,460
Yes, this is Eagle Brewery.

256
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,980
Hello, I'm Director Yu Geon Ha from the 2025 APEC

257
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,240
Summit Meeting committee.

258
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,320
Yes.

259
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,450
The thing is, as the APEC dinner drink,

260
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,560
Jangkwang WIne was nominated.

261
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,270
We'll be visiting the brewery for inspection soon.

262
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,940
Pardon?

263
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,870
Jangkwang Wine was nominated
as the APEC Summit Meeting's dinner drink?

264
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,650
Breaking news! Breaking news!

265
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,110
Don't run. Relax. Relax.

266
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,260
Gosh. Right, right.

267
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:08,570
I have amazing news.

268
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,460
What is it, Ms. Ma?

269
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,060
Jangkwang Wine might become
the APEC Summit Meeting's dinner drink.

270
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,290
A-APEC...

271
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,210
- What?
- What?

272
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,530
I just got a call.

273
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,850
We're apparently one of the nominees.

274
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,670
The preparation committee
will visit our brewery soon.

275
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:26,430
- Wow, daebak!
- Daebak!

276
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,720
Ms. Ma!

277
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,140
The defendant admits to all charges

278
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,350
and he wrote a statement to express regrets

279
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,340
for his actions sincerely.

280
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:09,120
The fact that the victim submitted
a petition for his pardon

281
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,310
provides a good reason to lessen his sentence.

282
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:25,210
But his crime betrayed consumers'
trust in everyday beverages.

283
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,680
Its social impact can't be overlooked.

284
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,200
Therefore, the court announces
Defendant Dokgo Tak

285
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,450
to one year in jail.

286
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,620
The attorney gave me this note
written by Mr. Dokgo

287
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,910
in a hurry before being sent to jail.

288
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:58,200
I'll read it.

289
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:07,060
"A year isn't a long time.

290
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:12,350
I'll think positive thoughts while
I'm in here and come back.

291
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,730
Don't worry so much.

292
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:20,370
Don't neglect your everyday life because I'm gone.

293
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:25,040
I hope you're healthy and happy."

294
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:48,770
Yes.

295
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,100
Cry all you want.

296
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,550
I'll wait until you're done.

297
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,110
Honey.

298
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:20,030
I'm sorry, Honey.

299
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,760
Kang Soo.

300
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,660
I'm calling because

301
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,780
I got worried after getting a call from Beom Soo.

302
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,430
I see.

303
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,250
You need to be strong at times like this.

304
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:52,670
Don't be weak for Se Ri's sake.

305
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,720
You need to hang in there

306
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,260
for Se Ri to be strong without wavering, too.

307
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,870
And...

308
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:09,740
call me anytime if you need my help.

309
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,570
I'll come to see you.

310
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,760
Okay. I will.

311
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:18,890
Thank you.

312
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:25,080
Thank you, my son.

313
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,350
Did you talk to your mother?

314
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,900
Yes.

315
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,170
She must be having a hard time.

316
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:11,130
You're in pain as you watch
Mother and Se Ri suffering.

317
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,500
But...

318
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,750
But I...

319
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,190
find it most painful to see you...

320
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:24,410
struggling by your side.

321
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,970
Bom.

322
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:30,730
I didn't come here to say this. I'm sorry.

323
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,110
Thank you.

324
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,710
I won't give you a hard time from now on.

325
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,750
Kang Soo.

326
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,700
Could I see the lookbook PDF again, Kang Soo?

327
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,800
I didn't know you were here, too, Bom.

328
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,880
Yes. I was looking for fabric documents, too.

329
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,460
I saved it on the server. Let me show you now.

330
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,880
Are you okay?

331
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,800
Yes. I'm okay.

332
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:27,280
It's peak hour soon. What's this about?

333
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,560
Don't worry about the shop

334
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,570
because I asked the manager to take care of it.

335
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,930
What do you think of this building, Oppa?

336
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,580
It's nice. The location is good, too.

337
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:44,830
What do you think about opening
a dance academy here?

338
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:46,180
Who?

339
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,940
Who do you think?

340
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,270
You, of course.

341
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,110
Nonsense.

342
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,030
Why is that nonsense?

343
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,810
I told you.

344
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:58,480
I'll stop being the celebrity, Oh Heung Soo

345
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,430
and go back to being an
everyday man, Oh Heung Soo.

346
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:06,180
I'm not telling you to go back
to the celebrity, Oh Heung Soo.

347
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,880
I'm telling you to keep living
as a dance lover, Oh Heung Soo.

348
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,330
Forget it. I'm sick of dancing now.

349
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,100
If you're sick of it,

350
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,140
why do you do steps like this while making toasts?

351
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,170
It's because my body remembers it.

352
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:26,000
That's what I'm saying.

353
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,870
Your body remembers it.

354
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,240
Why do you keep trying to erase it with your head?

355
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,930
Gosh, I don't know.

356
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,400
How could you say that after...

357
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,440
seeing the fans at the fan meeting?

358
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:48,210
You bring joy to their everyday life.

359
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,780
So, let me run the shop with the manager.

360
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:01,180
You should live your dream, okay?

361
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,930
Living my dream is nice,

362
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:13,270

00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,620
The late owner was gracious to me,

545
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:49,150
but you're left with nothing but hard feelings.

546
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,340
I did something unspeakable.

547
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:59,350
Everything is because of
my lack of virtue and fault.

548
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:06,400
I'm too ashamed to ask you to forgive me.

549
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:11,000
But I hope you accept my apology.

550
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,850
We've already forgotten.

551
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,800
Yes.

552
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:27,650
We decided to forget everything
when we wrote the petition.

553
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:31,730
So, be at peace now.

554
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:39,810
You helped him get out in good health like this.

555
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:43,670
We'll forever be grateful.

556
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:51,400
Beom Soo worked very hard.

557
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,910
You can't be...

558
00:41:56,910 --> 00:42:02,720
still opposing their relationship, right?

559
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,110
Of course not.

560
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:09,220
I asked Beom Soo to care
for Se Ri a long time ago.

561
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,570
Ms. Ji, you came.

562
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:17,860
Yes, yes.

563
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,070
Are you here to collect kitty party money?

564
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:22,840
Don't call her Ms. Ji. Call her Hanbang's Mom.

565
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,280
Hey, I'm here.

566
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,120
Gosh, you sell toasts and tteokbokki.

567
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,030
You're the most successful one in the market.

568
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:34,330
Why won't you make a kitty party deposit?

569
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:37,160
I asked you a long time ago, but you went AWOL.

570
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,680
I'm very busy, as you know.

571
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,460
Just one second.

572
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,780
Let me try.

573
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:49,800
Yes. I made the deposit.

574
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,170
Okay.

575
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,960
By the way,

576
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:02,090
the sauce tastes a bit sweet today.

577
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:04,500
Don't eat it, then.

578
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,590
You complain while enjoying it.

579
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:13,210
I'll have tteokbokki, soondae, and fritters to go.

580
00:43:13,210 --> 00:43:15,460
- Okay.
- How much will that be?

581
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,320
12,000 won.

582
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:19,340
Make it 10,000 won.

583
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,090
Gosh, no. I'll make no money, then.

584
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:24,130
Gosh, give me a party leader discount.

585
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:26,710
Why should you only give celebrities a discount?

586
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:30,800
Seriously. You're such a penny pincher.

587
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,280
Okay. I'll wrap it for you.

588
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:39,000
- There. Thank you.
- Thank you.

589
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,820
[Dancing Prince]

590
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:53,390
Dad is busy working.

591
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:54,920
You need to say,

592
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:00,330
"Dad, eat the snacks and cheer up." Okay?

593
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:05,190
- You improved a lot.
- It's because you taught me well.

594
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,240
How about me? How about me?

595
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,470
Practice the turn a bit more afterward.

596
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:11,890
Thank you.

597
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:15,730
Hanbang's dad!

598
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:17,670
Hey, you came.

599
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:19,780
Let's say fighting and leave.

600
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:20,930
One, two, three.

601
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:22,580
Fighting!

602
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,860
Thank you.

603
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,400
Ta-da.

604
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:36,920
Wow...

605
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:40,930
I made myself clear.

606
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:44,620
You can't have female members in their 20s.

607
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:47,490
Stop being so silly.

608
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:49,920
I can't be so picky right now.

609
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,380
I should be grateful for any new members.

610
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:58,110
Do you want to be tricked
by a woman like Ms. Kim again?

611
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:02,100
That was before I got married.

612
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:06,690
I can't watch you 24/7.

613
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:09,620
You make me too nervous.

614
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:13,070
Hey, hey. I'm afraid Hanbang would hear you.

615
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:17,340
If you go further, you'd be considered
delusional jealousy.

616
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:18,550
What did you say?

617
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,500
Why did you tell me to open
a dance academy if you'd be like this?

618
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:26,430
It's because I didn't want you
to give up on your dream.

619
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:28,810
You had faith in me before I started.

620
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,810
Please keep that faith until the end.

621
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:33,340
Don't be unreasonable like that.

622
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,710
And...

623
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:48,050
my standards became very high in a year.

624
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,050
Now that I live with you,

625
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:57,410
I don't even notice other women.

626
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,990
Do you mean it?

627
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:05,080
Of course.

628
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,420
So, don't worry about silly things

629
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:10,030
and only focus on Hanbang.

630
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:14,610
Come on and eat.

631
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:20,840
Daddy's eating soondae.

632
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:34,640
Dad is back...

633
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,580
and he made up with your family.

634
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:44,060
It feels like everything is finally back to normal.

635
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,270
Is it our turn, then?

636
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,400
We should go back where we belong, too.

637
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:59,490
Where do we belong?

638
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:01,830
You, me, and Ha Ni.

639
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:04,610
The place where we can be together.

640
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:10,320
Let us get married.

641
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:18,010
I've been waiting.

642
00:47:18,010 --> 00:47:20,760
I wondered when you'd say that.

643
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,270
I'm sorry for making you wait so long.

644
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:28,940
I'll be by your side for a long time from now on.

645
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:34,840
Thank you for enduring a difficult time.

646
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:40,730
Thank you for always being by my side.

647
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:22,820
The twins must've woken up.

648
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,050
Go back to sleep, Honey.

649
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:26,890
I'll make the formula.

650
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:29,510
Okay. Thank you.

651
00:48:30,330 --> 00:48:34,160
Yes, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry.

652
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:53,180
Where did the spoon go?

653
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:56,500
Geez.

654
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:11,180
Okay, okay! Dad will be right back.

655
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:13,290
Seriously.

656
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:19,700
It's okay. It's okay. Yes.

657
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,150
Are you that hungry?

658
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:23,240
I'm here. I'm here.

659
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,170
Honey, what happened to your face?

660
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,600
I sneezed, and the powder got on my face.

661
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,300
You look like a snowman.
Come here. I'll clean it for you.

662
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,400
No. Let me feed this to our babies first.

663
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,210
So cute.

664
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,470
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

665
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:09,600
I dozed off. Gosh.

666
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:15,480
You're a good eater.

667
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,980
Wow, it's already been 100 days.

668
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,770
Time really flies.

669
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:32,280
I know.

670
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,560
Ha Ni. Gosh.

671
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:37,700
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo...

672
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,550
Long time no see, guys.

673
00:50:39,550 --> 00:50:41,590
- You came.
- You came.

674
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,220
- Hello. Say hello.
- Hello.

675
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,060
So cute.

676
00:50:47,930 --> 00:50:50,710
Wow, you're all dressed up.

677
00:50:50,710 --> 00:50:54,250
You must've dressed up for the twins' 100th day.

678
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:56,050
It's not that.

679
00:50:56,050 --> 00:50:58,210
We're going on a trip.

680
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,720
- A trip?
- A trip?

681
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,000
Yeah.

682
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,630
What trip?

683
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:08,040
Mr. Go and I are going on a cruise.

684
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,160
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

685
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,200
Don't you know it's the twins' 100th day today?

686
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,580
Of course, I know.

687
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,280
Mr. Go.

688
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:26,370
It's half don* each, one don in total.
(Precious metal weight unit)

689
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:28,680
How could you skip your
grandchildren's 100th day party

690
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,510
and go on a trip instead?

691
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:33,610
They have a whole future ahead of them.

692
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:36,140
They will have hundreds more parties,

693
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:39,650
but we don't have many days ahead of us.

694
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:42,980
While we're healthy, free, and financially stable,

695
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:45,410
we need to go somewhere.

696
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:49,480
We'll make sure to attend
their first birthday party.

697
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,050
Mr. Go, let's go.

698
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:54,840
Have a pleasant time.

699
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,000
Bye.

700
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,860
Seriously. How could they do this?

701
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,160
Why? It's nice to see.

702
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:04,290
I'm jealous.

703
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:07,010
They're so cool.

704
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:08,790
Gosh, seriously.

705
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:13,130
Ha Ni, what's wrong with your grandma?

706
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:15,800
Wow.

707
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:25,890
We'll be right back.

708
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:27,140
See you.

709
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:28,740
What about my food?

710
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,810
You and your food.

711
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:34,800
I prepared something simple.

712
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,360
Simple won't cut it.

713
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,710
I ate prison food for a year.

714
00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:43,390
Come with us and have a meal, then.

715
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:46,350
Why would I go there?

716
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:48,680
No one would want to see me.

717
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,330
You made up with the brewery family last time.

718
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:55,570
It's okay. You go without me.

719
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:00,480
We'll discuss Beom Soo and Se Ri's wedding, too.

720
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,880
Whatever.

721
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:04,340
We'll be back, Dad.

722
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,030
You know, Kang Soo...

723
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:12,590
Tell him to come by for a meal.

724
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:14,640
Tell him I'm inviting him.

725
00:53:20,270 --> 00:53:22,140
Okay.

726
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,790
Thank you, Honey.

727
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:40,850
[Happy 100th day]

728
00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:47,100
Okay, today is a very special day.

729
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,680
Our lovely twins, Han Byeol and Han Bit

730
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:54,440
came to this world 100 days ago.

731
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,810
Let's applaud and congratulate them. Applaud!

732
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,700
Applaud.

733
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:05,030
Thank you so much for coming when you're busy.

734
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:06,850
The twins' dad...

735
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:10,260
and the man all middle-aged men are jealous of.

736
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:14,870
But he has huge dark circles
because he's tired from child-rearing.

737
00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:18,710
Let's hear from Mr. Han Dong Seok.

738
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,640
At first,

739
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:26,870
I thought it was impossible.

740
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:31,040
At our age? And twins on top of that?

741
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,620
I was cautious every day...

742
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:40,160
and I was worried that my wife
and the infants in the womb

743
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,500
might not be able to overcome

744
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:48,840
the critical time, to be honest.

745
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:54,440
But the two babies made it
to their 100th day in good health.

746
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:59,790
And because our family is here
to congratulate us with smiles...

747
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:09,400
Don't cry!

748
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,830
Don't cry! Don't cry!

749
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:14,460
I'm really...

750
00:55:15,370 --> 00:55:18,460
moved and grateful.

751
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:24,420
I'd like to express my gratitude to

752
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:28,180
my dear Gyeol and Bom.

753
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:34,880
I sincerely thank all of you here
for your warm support and love.

754
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,330
And...

755
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:42,890
because you endured with faith,

756
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:45,760
we were able to have this day.

757
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,800
Thank you...

758
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,670
and I love you, Kwang Sook.

759
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,940
My husband also agreed

760
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,700
to let Professor Oh and Se Ri get married.

761
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:20,470
He made a major decision.

762
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:22,360
That's wonderful.

763
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,820
Both Ha Ni and...

764
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:26,800
Professor Oh have been through a lot.

765
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,180
It'd be nice if they had the wedding soon.

766
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:36,490
How about the last Saturday of next month?

767
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:39,320
That soon?

768
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:42,120
I think they can have

769
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,530
a small wedding with just family and friends.

770
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:47,690
Let's not make a fuss.

771
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:50,090
Sounds good.

772
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:53,190
I'm on board.

773
00:56:59,330 --> 00:57:00,850
Long time no see.

774
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,970
I'm glad you two look happy.

775
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:07,160
If you didn't tell me where Se Ri was that time,

776
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,790
we might've never met again.

777
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:13,500
I'm always grateful for that.

778
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,500
Thank you, Oppa.

779
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,280
Thank you for the acknowledgement.

780
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,860
- Let's drink.
- Sounds good.

781
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,780
Okay. Don't worry about child rearing tonight

782
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,470
and we'll take it to the end, Hyungnim.

783
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:28,380
Sounds good.

784
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,070
Don't overdo it.

785
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:33,580
Hey. When else would he overdo it, then?

786
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,770
Are we out of makgeolli?

787
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:38,500
Let me bring some.

788
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,480
Thank you, Honey.

789
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:44,900
Tae Yang is a pretty name.
Why keep calling him Hanbang?

790
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,150
It's just a habit.

791
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:49,030
I won't let you off the hook tonight.

792
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:52,020
Let's drink until the end and die gloriously.

793
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,220
Okay. Let's take it all the way.

794
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,290
For the twins' health!

795
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:58,070
For their health!

796
00:57:58,070 --> 00:58:00,210
Drink with us, too.

797
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:02,760
Cheers.

798
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:06,200
Cheers.

799
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:23,390
Shouldn't we tell them that we're dating, too?

800
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:28,240
Dad is so exhausted from caring for the twins.

801
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,870
I don't know how to bring it up.

802
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,300
I'll get going now.

803
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,240
I'll walk you to the car.

804
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:41,280
It's okay. Don't trouble yourself.

805
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:44,030
Treat me casually.

806
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:46,360
We'll become a family soon.

807
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,220
I envy my brothers now that
I see them settled down.

808
00:58:53,010 --> 00:58:56,560
I want to start a family soon, too.

809
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,840
Me, too.

810
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:03,550
Seeing my parents happy raising the twins

811
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:06,360
makes me want to get married and have babies soon.

812
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,480
What are they talking about?

813
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,030
Should we...

814
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:15,710
be courageous, too, then?

815
00:59:21,770 --> 00:59:25,470
Kang Soo and Bom.

816
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:27,560
Are you two...

817
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:29,300
dating?

818
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,020
Yes.

819
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:39,310
What?

820
00:59:39,970 --> 00:59:41,870
Since when?

821
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,220
It's been about a year.

822
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:46,770
What?

823
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:51,300
My gosh. How could this be?

824
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:56,400
You're lying!

825
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,550
No, no! I'm serious! I'm serious!

826
01:00:02,790 --> 01:00:05,300
Look at this. Look at this.

827
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:08,070
No, seriously...

828
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:10,960
- I'm telling you.
- We can't take your word for it.

829
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,750
I'm not kidding.

830
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:15,540
Bring makgeolli. Let me...

831
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:20,250
Dong Seok would be shocked

832
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,870
if he found out.

833
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,790
I've never heard that!

834
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:30,840
There's never a dull moment in our house.

835
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:34,740
Hey, come on.

836
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,930
I said I'm not lying!

837
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,500
Testing. Testing. Eagle Brewery family members,

838
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,930
please line up here.

839
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:53,270
Please stand side by side with each other.

840
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:56,200
We haven't sobered up yet.
Why are we exercising so early?

841
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,170
I know. Let's skip on a day like this.

842
01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:00,720
They don't even do this in the military.

843
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,750
Heung Soo, shouldn't you give me a pass today?

844
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:06,900
No one gets to skip the family exercise.

845
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:10,340
Stop complaining and stand straight, twins' dad.

846
01:01:11,590 --> 01:01:14,650
The Eagle family will start...

847
01:01:14,650 --> 01:01:18,170
the national exercise now!

848
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:34,230
National exercise, start!

849
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:37,390
One, two, three, four,

850
01:01:37,390 --> 01:01:41,110

Now we have become the Eagle Corps.

859
01:02:26,990 --> 01:02:30,210
We endured each crisis together

860
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:33,430
and we became stronger

861
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,960

862
01:02:41,310 --> 01:02:43,900
