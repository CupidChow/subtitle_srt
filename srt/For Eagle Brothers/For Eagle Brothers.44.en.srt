1
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:02,829
I'm home.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,529
"Ungrateful" isn't the word I should be called.

3
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:07,028
That label should be for you,

4
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:10,169
since you gave birth to a son 30 years ago and lied about it.

5
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:15,379
I owe Eagle Brewery nothing.

6
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:17,038
The money I took?

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,008
I deserved every penny for the work I put in when I was young.

8
00:00:20,009 --> 00:00:21,449
But that's all in the past.

9
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:25,489
Why are you so determined to ruin Eagle Brewery now?

10
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:27,449
Is it because of my son, Kang Soo?

11
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:30,488
Or is it to get back at Beom Soo for winning Se Ri's heart?

12
00:00:30,489 --> 00:00:31,719
Both.

13
00:00:32,089 --> 00:00:34,059
I hate everyone in that family.

14
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:35,559
They get on my nerves.

15
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:40,569
What did I just hear?

16
00:00:49,339 --> 00:00:50,378
Se Ri...

17
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:51,939
Who's your son?

18
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:55,209
Se Ri...

19
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,819
Did I hear that correctly?

20
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:02,559
You just said Lieutenant Oh was your son. Didn't you?

21
00:01:14,429 --> 00:01:15,439
Yes.

22
00:01:16,639 --> 00:01:17,739
It's true.

23
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,279
How could that even be?

24
00:01:26,949 --> 00:01:30,879
Your mom had Kang Soo before she married me.

25
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:32,748
She was unable to keep him,

26
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:35,219
so she left him outside Eagle Brewery.

27
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:36,659
What?

28
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:39,429
Mom!

29
00:01:43,499 --> 00:01:44,759
I'm sorry, Se Ri.

30
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:52,039
Does Lieutenant Oh know?

31
00:01:54,339 --> 00:01:57,839
Kang Soo knows, and so does that punk, Beom Soo.

32
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:01,448
That's why I said you couldn't be with him.

33
00:02:01,449 --> 00:02:02,849
Break up right away.

34
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:06,649
Mom, how could you?

35
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,619
Are you the mom I knew?

36
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:18,299
I'm sorry, my darling puppy.

37
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,369
I did something terrible.

38
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:33,509
Se Ri.

39
00:02:42,089 --> 00:02:44,289
The whole house is a mess.

40
00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:16,089
Se Ri.

41
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:18,459
Professor.

42
00:03:20,589 --> 00:03:21,689
It's shocking, isn't it?

43
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:25,299
You knew it all along.

44
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:27,329
Why didn't you tell me?

45
00:03:28,469 --> 00:03:29,799
Because it would hurt you.

46
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:33,338
I never wanted you to find out.

47
00:03:33,339 --> 00:03:34,609
How could you?

48
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:37,408
If my mom had done such a terrible thing,

49
00:03:37,409 --> 00:03:38,808
I deserve to know.

50
00:03:38,809 --> 00:03:40,908
Your mother had circumstances of her own.

51
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:42,819
No matter the circumstances,

52
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:45,749
no one should abandon their child.

53
00:03:47,349 --> 00:03:48,959
I can't accept it.

54
00:03:58,329 --> 00:03:59,729
My whole life,

55
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:03,499
I had everything I wanted and needed, and I was happy.

56
00:04:05,369 --> 00:04:09,009
All that was built on top of Lieutenant Oh's misfortune,

57
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:11,739
and it breaks my heart.

58
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,819
The more I think about it, the worse I feel for him.

59
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,019
I feel so sorry for him.

60
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:22,119
I feel guilty too.

61
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:27,529
All that did happen,

62
00:04:28,429 --> 00:04:30,399
but Kang Soo wasn't as unhappy...

63
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:32,299
as you may think.

64
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:36,668
He was always in someone's arms,

65
00:04:36,669 --> 00:04:39,038
and he was so loved by his whole family...

66
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,709
that someone always rushed to him before he even cried.

67
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:44,509
So don't feel too bad.

68
00:04:46,209 --> 00:04:49,149
When did Lieutenant Oh find out?

69
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:51,879
Pretty recently.

70
00:04:52,489 --> 00:04:54,089
And he struggled a great deal.

71
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:03,929
Do you want to talk to him?

72
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:07,169
Next time.

73
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:10,499
I'm not mentally prepared.

74
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,049
Kang Soo.

75
00:05:24,619 --> 00:05:25,719
What about Se Ri?

76
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:28,119
I took her home.

77
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:31,719
I hoped she'd never find out.

78
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:34,529
She was shocked, wasn't she?

79
00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:37,359
She said she felt guilty and cried a lot.

80
00:05:38,229 --> 00:05:39,829
She doesn't have to.

81
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:42,639
I should've talked to her.

82
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:44,869
I asked her if she wanted to see you,

83
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:48,239
but she said next time, when she's mentally prepared.

84
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:52,309
You can comfort her for me.

85
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,649
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,319
For what?

87
00:05:59,849 --> 00:06:01,949
I'm no help at all.

88
00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:04,719
I feel bad.

89
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:06,489
Don't.

90
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:09,129
I've come to terms with it.

91
00:06:10,459 --> 00:06:13,429
Come to think of it, it is sad that I was abandoned,

92
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:15,799
but it's not something to be all resentful about.

93
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:19,169
As our parent's youngest son...

94
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,109
and my brothers' little brother, I have led a happy life.

95
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:27,309
I won't resent her anymore.

96
00:06:42,799 --> 00:06:43,829
What...

97
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:46,029
Where are my pills?

98
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:50,339
I'm sure I put them in my purse.

99
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:52,809
What...

100
00:06:56,109 --> 00:06:59,079
Where did they go?

101
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,489
Where on earth did I drop it?

102
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,159
Are you looking for something, Mother?

103
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,329
What? Well...

104
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:21,329
I lost one of my earrings.

105
00:07:21,499 --> 00:07:23,899
I don't know where I dropped it.

106
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:28,239
Oh, well...

107
00:07:31,739 --> 00:07:33,409
- Did you lose something? - What?

108
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:35,279
What is it? I'll look for it with you.

109
00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:37,419
What? Well...

110
00:07:37,549 --> 00:07:40,289
It's nothing important. I don't mind losing it.

111
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:42,119
Forget about it.

112
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:53,099
Grandma was really upset when you didn't keep your promise.

113
00:07:54,029 --> 00:07:57,199
So what was it that she wanted to tell us?

114
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,739
I'm not sure.

115
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:02,139
It seemed like something serious, though.

116
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:07,649
All right. You guys can go to your rooms.

117
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,949
- Okay. Good night. - Good night.

118
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:12,119
- Good night. - All right.

119
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:30,339
Hello?

120
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:32,709
How is the burn?

121
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,208
If the pain is bad, you should go to the doctor.

122
00:08:36,209 --> 00:08:37,239
Call me, okay?

123
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,449
The doctor said it would be okay.

124
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:43,549
You don't have to worry.

125
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:44,849
My gosh.

126
00:08:45,249 --> 00:08:48,019
Thank goodness it happened while we were talking on the phone.

127
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:50,959
What if it happened while you were alone?

128
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,289
I know.

129
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:56,729
Seriously, I don't even want to think about it.

130
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,229
Like I said before,

131
00:09:03,739 --> 00:09:05,839
I feel so bad watching you struggle alone.

132
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:07,639
I want you...

133
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:09,639
to come to me now.

134
00:09:24,289 --> 00:09:25,359
What's wrong?

135
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:27,759
Kwang Sook?

136
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:28,959
Well...

137
00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:31,299
I'm already feeling vulnerable because I got hurt.

138
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:33,869
Why would you say such a thing?

139
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,399
I feel like crying.

140
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:48,609
Seriously, I want to quit everything and go to you.

141
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:55,189
Hello?

142
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:58,159
The call got disconnected.

143
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:04,999
(Eagle Brewery)

144
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:22,619
Yes. Hello?

145
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:24,919
Come to the front of the brewery.

146
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:28,719
What?

147
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:31,359
Are you at the brewery now?

148
00:10:51,479 --> 00:10:53,849
What brings you here at this hour?

149
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:56,918
You said you wanted...

150
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,579
to quit everything and come to me.

151
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:01,989
You can't drive with your injured hand,

152
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:03,359
so I came here.

153
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,559
What?

154
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,829
That's not what I meant.

155
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:10,799
I know.

156
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:13,969
I wanted to see you, so I just used it as an excuse.

157
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:23,379
Did your mother-in-law say anything about me?

158
00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:27,109
No. Why?

159
00:11:28,449 --> 00:11:29,719
Did something happen?

160
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:34,519
Actually, earlier today,

161
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,159
she came to the brewery.

162
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:40,929
She did? Why?

163
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:42,729
I guess...

164
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:46,199
she was curious about what the brewery looked like,

165
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,029
so she came by to take a look.

166
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:52,869
Did she say anything that hurt your feelings?

167
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:57,179
No. She just looked around the brewery,

168
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,179
had some coffee, and left.

169
00:12:02,449 --> 00:12:03,679
If she ever says...

170
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:07,049
or does anything that offends you, tell me right away.

171
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:11,089
I'll tell her not to do that.

172
00:12:12,619 --> 00:12:13,989
You don't have to do that.

173
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:16,959
She will go back to the US soon.

174
00:12:17,559 --> 00:12:19,129
While she's staying,

175
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,869
you should make her feel comfortable.

176
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,679
She seems to have changed a lot...

177
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:32,409
since I saw her a year ago.

178
00:12:34,809 --> 00:12:35,879
She seems...

179
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:38,379
somewhat impatient...

180
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:41,949
and really angry.

181
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:47,959
She wasn't like that before.

182
00:13:07,209 --> 00:13:09,849
(Eagle Brewery)

183
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:47,689
My goodness.

184
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:50,389
I guess I fell asleep.

185
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:52,059
You're up.

186
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:00,669
I suddenly felt really drowsy after taking the pills for the burn.

187
00:14:02,469 --> 00:14:03,568
I'm sorry.

188
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:06,269
Don't be. I'm glad you got some sleep.

189
00:14:07,169 --> 00:14:10,079
I also dozed off for a bit while watching you sleep.

190
00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:14,709
Isn't it too late?

191
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:17,248
It's okay. There's no one to greet me at home.

192
00:14:17,249 --> 00:14:18,619
I can go home late.

193
00:14:20,349 --> 00:14:23,259
You should sleep comfortably at home.

194
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:25,059
I'm sorry.

195
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:27,529
Why are you sorry?

196
00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:29,999
It was nice sleeping next to you.

197
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:38,239
Seeing how...

198
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:41,839
we don't want to go home like this,

199
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,139
I think it's time for us to get married.

200
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:49,679
Aren't you...

201
00:14:51,179 --> 00:14:52,819
feeling the same way as I do, Kwang Sook?

202
00:15:13,969 --> 00:15:16,639
(Eagle Brewery)

203
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:20,149
Thank you.

204
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:39,869
You're still up.

205
00:15:41,169 --> 00:15:44,339
How can I go to bed when my family isn't home?

206
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:47,939
Are you talking about me?

207
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,269
Sure.

208
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:51,909
Is there anyone else I should expect at this late hour?

209
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:56,719
How did you know I went out?

210
00:15:57,379 --> 00:15:59,079
When you get older like me,

211
00:15:59,119 --> 00:16:01,189
you become more sensitive and wake up easily.

212
00:16:01,749 --> 00:16:04,019
I heard the door a while ago, so I came out...

213
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,119
and saw you going out.

214
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:08,529
Since I woke up in the evening...

215
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:09,859
and couldn't go back to sleep,

216
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:12,329
I sat out here to think about things.

217
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:15,928
I'm not a child.

218
00:16:15,929 --> 00:16:18,539
Why didn't you go back to bed?

219
00:16:19,469 --> 00:16:21,539
If you went out this late,

220
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:23,909
you must've gone to see that woman.

221
00:16:25,939 --> 00:16:27,049
Yes.

222
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:31,349
Aren't you a bit too well-known to be out doing that?

223
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:33,718
Don't you know the personal affairs of a major company's chairman...

224
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:36,019
can lead to owner risk?

225
00:16:38,189 --> 00:16:40,289
I can handle that myself.

226
00:16:40,929 --> 00:16:42,659
Your children are still single,

227
00:16:43,229 --> 00:16:46,259
and you're a chairman, so act with decorum.

228
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:50,469
Good night.

229
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:56,939
I think I'm a little too old to be scolded.

230
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,509
What did you just say to me?

231
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:03,819
Sleep well.

232
00:17:26,669 --> 00:17:27,769
Look over there.

233
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:30,179
Say, "Ah."

234
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,979
- "Ah." - "Ah."

235
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:43,889
What? Is there something on my face?

236
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:45,589
No.

237
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:47,729
Today's breakfast is lovely.

238
00:17:52,329 --> 00:17:54,098
How's your wound?

239
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:55,369
Did it ache last night?

240
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:58,668
It's fine.

241
00:17:58,669 --> 00:18:00,538
Fortunately for me, the doctor said...

242
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,609
it would heal in a week or so.

243
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,739
I'm glad it wasn't serious. It could've been really bad.

244
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:07,909
I don't even want to think about that.

245
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:11,279
Are you possessed by a workaholic ghost?

246
00:18:11,379 --> 00:18:14,049
I knew you'd pay the price one day.

247
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:16,989
We'll replace the steam pipes today.

248
00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:19,289
Thanks.

249
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:22,829
Heung Soo, don't you film today?

250
00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:24,429
Yes.

251
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:27,329
It would be nice if we could all go to cheer for you.

252
00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:30,338
I can't dance around family. It's too much pressure.

253
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:31,969
Won't Ok Bun be there?

254
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:35,069
She's the first-ever president of my fan club.

255
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:41,479
Can I be excused?

256
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:43,349
I have an early morning meeting.

257
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:47,618
I should get going too.

258
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:48,789
Thanks for the breakfast.

259
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:55,329
I think those two are acting fishy.

260
00:18:56,659 --> 00:18:57,729
- How so? - How so?

261
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,828
They're always whispering...

262
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:02,368
as if there's a secret...

263
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:04,199
they can't share with anyone else.

264
00:19:13,949 --> 00:19:14,979
What is it?

265
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:17,579
I thought about it, and I'd like to talk to Se Ri.

266
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:21,888
I want to tell her to try to understand her mother.

267
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:23,319
That would make me feel better.

268
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,559
Okay. I'll talk to her about it.

269
00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:40,809
Have breakfast.

270
00:19:41,009 --> 00:19:43,279
I'm not hungry. Please leave.

271
00:19:49,609 --> 00:19:51,878
Hear me out instead of being so angry.

272
00:19:51,879 --> 00:19:54,319
I don't want to talk about anything right now.

273
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:56,659
Can't you leave me alone?

274
00:19:57,219 --> 00:19:59,619
I know you're shocked and disappointed.

275
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:02,429
Give me a chance to explain.

276
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:10,799
You had a baby and left it outside a brewery.

277
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:14,709
Then you stole from the very brewery that raised him so well.

278
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:17,378
You should have a conscience.

279
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:19,309
How could you do such a thing?

280
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:22,008
Back then, my situation...

281
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:25,119
I couldn't understand Ha Ni's mom who abandoned Ha Ni and left.

282
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:28,489
But what you did was far worse than what she did.

283
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:31,589
I'll never understand.

284
00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:47,209
What did she say?

285
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:49,409
She won't eat.

286
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:53,749
I bet she won't feel like eating anything right now.

287
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:58,518
How can you eat so well when your daughter...

288
00:20:58,519 --> 00:20:59,988
is unable to?

289
00:20:59,989 --> 00:21:02,818
I'm about to go to work, which is like a battlefield.

290
00:21:02,819 --> 00:21:05,459
I must eat as best I can to fight and win.

291
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:10,999
Sure. Eat all you want.

292
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:13,398
It's for the best.

293
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:14,598
Let's use this...

294
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:17,538
to make sure Beom Soo and Se Ri break up for good.

295
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:19,069
Put an end to it.

296
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,739
How can you say that right now?

297
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:24,609
Se Ri's in such shock.

298
00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:26,909
You can't tell her to leave Beom Soo too.

299
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:28,748
If you do,

300
00:21:28,749 --> 00:21:31,119
she'll run away again and never come back.

301
00:21:32,119 --> 00:21:33,719
Children who leave their parents...

302
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:36,419
are as good as gone.

303
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:41,629
We don't deserve to be parents.

304
00:21:42,689 --> 00:21:43,899
Don't try to...

305
00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:46,769
make me look as bad as you.

306
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:49,569
Unlike you, I never abandoned a child.

307
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:51,268
What?

308
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:53,908
All I'm guilty of is working my socks off...

309
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:56,568
to support my family and provide a good life.

310
00:21:56,569 --> 00:22:00,079
I'm not ashamed of anything, and I can face Se Ri proudly.

311
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:06,949
I lost my appetite.

312
00:22:19,247 --> 00:22:21,306
This coming Saturday afternoon,

313
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:24,146
a meeting with the senior management of the US Hotel Association...

314
00:22:24,147 --> 00:22:25,517
was scheduled suddenly.

315
00:22:26,447 --> 00:22:27,647
This Saturday?

316
00:22:29,317 --> 00:22:30,417
Oh, dear.

317
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:33,487
I can't miss that meeting, can I?

318
00:22:33,927 --> 00:22:37,096
No. Given the nature of the meeting,

319
00:22:37,097 --> 00:22:39,427
I think you should be there.

320
00:22:40,597 --> 00:22:43,367
Okay. I'll adjust my schedule.

321
00:22:51,507 --> 00:22:54,777
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

322
00:23:02,957 --> 00:23:04,087
Hello, sir.

323
00:23:05,887 --> 00:23:08,596
A work meeting was suddenly scheduled...

324
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:11,627
for this Saturday, so I can't come to the housewarming.

325
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,236
To make up for that, how about we have dinner...

326
00:23:15,237 --> 00:23:17,296
with your fiancee and Kwang Sook today?

327
00:23:17,297 --> 00:23:18,907
Are you free?

328
00:23:19,107 --> 00:23:21,607
Yes. We don't have anything planned.

329
00:23:22,877 --> 00:23:24,637
Oh, just a moment.

330
00:23:25,407 --> 00:23:27,407
Are you free this evening?

331
00:23:28,247 --> 00:23:31,447
Chairman Han wants to have dinner with us and Mi Sun.

332
00:23:33,317 --> 00:23:34,847
Sure. That sounds good.

333
00:23:36,087 --> 00:23:38,987
Sir. Kwang Sook's up for it too.

334
00:23:39,827 --> 00:23:41,486
Okay, that works out.

335
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:44,127
Come to the first-floor restaurant this evening.

336
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:51,907
I looked everywhere, and I can't find a pill bottle.

337
00:23:52,367 --> 00:23:54,607
Where on earth did I leave it, then?

338
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,907
Did I leave it at the spa?

339
00:23:59,177 --> 00:24:01,247
What are the pills for?

340
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,217
Are they important?

341
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:07,417
They're not important. They're supplements.

342
00:24:09,387 --> 00:24:10,417
Oh, dear.

343
00:24:16,127 --> 00:24:17,557
Hello, ma'am.

344
00:24:17,697 --> 00:24:18,727
Hello.

345
00:24:18,797 --> 00:24:20,796
I think I dropped my pill bottle here...

346
00:24:20,797 --> 00:24:23,036
when I came for a massage yesterday.

347
00:24:23,037 --> 00:24:24,537
Did you see it?

348
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:28,337
We didn't find any lost belongings.

349
00:24:28,937 --> 00:24:29,976
Give me a moment.

350
00:24:29,977 --> 00:24:32,107
Let me go and ask the manager.

351
00:24:32,207 --> 00:24:33,207
Okay.

352
00:24:39,047 --> 00:24:40,187
Goodness.

353
00:24:41,087 --> 00:24:42,357
Hello.

354
00:24:42,717 --> 00:24:44,886
Yes, hello.

355
00:24:44,887 --> 00:24:46,557
Are you here for a massage?

356
00:24:47,187 --> 00:24:50,297
No. I left something here.

357
00:24:50,997 --> 00:24:52,367
I came back for it.

358
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:57,537
Ma'am. We don't seem to have it.

359
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:01,007
Perhaps, you lost it somewhere else?

360
00:25:01,337 --> 00:25:02,407
Did I?

361
00:25:05,407 --> 00:25:06,547
Okay, then.

362
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:10,446
Since we've met again,

363
00:25:10,447 --> 00:25:11,947
we should at least grab some tea together.

364
00:25:13,317 --> 00:25:14,947
But... Hold on.

365
00:25:15,917 --> 00:25:18,216
You're a close relative of Chairman Han's,

366
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,687
so I should go the extra mile.

367
00:25:19,757 --> 00:25:20,886
We should be friends.

368
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:24,057
Wait. Being friends with you is the last thing I want.

369
00:25:24,497 --> 00:25:26,727
- Sorry? - I live in the US.

370
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,667
I'll be leaving in a few days.

371
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:32,007
I see. You must be a relative who lives in the US.

372
00:25:32,937 --> 00:25:35,207
Still, what's the harm in being friends?

373
00:25:35,877 --> 00:25:36,907
Goodness.

374
00:25:38,477 --> 00:25:39,677
Mother?

375
00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,347
- Dong Seok. - Dong Seok.

376
00:25:59,967 --> 00:26:01,527
I expected someone your age...

377
00:26:01,697 --> 00:26:04,497
to act more maturely. What's your problem?

378
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:05,907
I'm not acting my age?

379
00:26:06,507 --> 00:26:08,507
There's no reason for me to be accused of that.

380
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,236
You hid who you really were...

381
00:26:10,237 --> 00:26:12,746
and approached me on purpose just to snoop.

382
00:26:12,747 --> 00:26:14,877
How have I been snooping?

383
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:16,516
You lied about being...

384
00:26:16,517 --> 00:26:17,717
a close relative of Chairman Han's...

385
00:26:17,747 --> 00:26:21,146
and asked about my daughter and her brothers-in-law.

386
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:22,687
I never asked.

387
00:26:23,157 --> 00:26:24,757
You started bragging first.

388
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:26,486
- What? - Hold on.

389
00:26:26,487 --> 00:26:28,356
Why don't you both try to calm down?

390
00:26:28,357 --> 00:26:30,497
- Could you, if you were me? - Could you, if you were me?

391
00:26:31,397 --> 00:26:34,597
It seems there's been a misunderstanding.

392
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:35,797
- Maybe you could clear the air. - Maybe you could clear the air.

393
00:26:35,867 --> 00:26:37,567
- This was no misunderstanding! - This was no misunderstanding!

394
00:26:49,117 --> 00:26:50,617
That sneaky cow.

395
00:26:53,787 --> 00:26:55,146
She lied about being...

396
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,387
a close relative of Chairman Han's...

397
00:26:56,517 --> 00:26:58,686
and dug up everything she could on you...

398
00:26:58,687 --> 00:27:00,327
and your brothers-in-law.

399
00:27:00,487 --> 00:27:03,627
As if there's anything to find out about me or the brothers.

400
00:27:03,857 --> 00:27:05,427
Your brothers-in-law.

401
00:27:05,597 --> 00:27:07,266
About one being an outside director, one getting a job,

402
00:27:07,267 --> 00:27:08,497
and one running a sandwich shop.

403
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,167
I told her all about them!

404
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:13,567
It's not like you made any of it up.

405
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:16,507
Why did that woman even come to Korea?

406
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:20,007
Is she here on a mission...

407
00:27:20,407 --> 00:27:22,007
to break you two apart?

408
00:27:24,117 --> 00:27:25,447
She looked at me...

409
00:27:26,447 --> 00:27:28,487
like I was beneath her.

410
00:27:28,717 --> 00:27:30,756
The arrogance!

411
00:27:30,757 --> 00:27:32,227
Her arrogance was sky-high.

412
00:27:33,587 --> 00:27:34,757
She's so annoying.

413
00:27:35,657 --> 00:27:36,727
My gosh.

414
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:41,627
A mother-daughter grifting duo?

415
00:27:41,797 --> 00:27:42,867
That's right.

416
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:45,067
While in the lobby,

417
00:27:45,237 --> 00:27:47,007
I overheard the middle-aged man behind me...

418
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,337
telling his friends about them.

419
00:27:51,907 --> 00:27:53,247
Apparently,

420
00:27:53,647 --> 00:27:55,677
the brewery CEO was dating...

421
00:27:56,277 --> 00:27:57,947
both of you.

422
00:27:59,387 --> 00:28:02,117
Hold on. That middle-aged man.

423
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:05,587
By any chance, was he tall with a mustache and beard?

424
00:28:05,757 --> 00:28:08,527
Well, yes, I think he had a beard.

425
00:28:10,557 --> 00:28:13,427
I actually know him pretty well.

426
00:28:14,167 --> 00:28:16,966
He had a blind date with CEO Ma that didn't go well,

427
00:28:16,967 --> 00:28:19,166
and he's been bitter about it ever since.

428
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:22,037
I can guarantee he made it up.

429
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:23,877
What?

430
00:28:42,927 --> 00:28:43,957
Hello?

431
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:47,497
My mother-in-law just left the office to head home.

432
00:28:48,997 --> 00:28:51,997
I've been stuck with my mom hearing her complaints...

433
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:53,637
and just got free.

434
00:28:54,407 --> 00:28:55,437
Unbelievable.

435
00:28:55,937 --> 00:28:58,107
What are the odds they'd cross paths like that?

436
00:28:58,637 --> 00:28:59,707
Tell me about it.

437
00:29:00,277 --> 00:29:01,546
How could they have met...

438
00:29:01,547 --> 00:29:04,047
at that exact time and place...

439
00:29:04,677 --> 00:29:06,717
to cause trouble for us?

440
00:29:08,517 --> 00:29:11,757
They're both about as stubborn as it gets.

441
00:29:14,387 --> 00:29:15,527
Exhausting, aren't they?

442
00:29:22,397 --> 00:29:24,797
(Waiting Room 1)

443
00:29:29,907 --> 00:29:30,977
Heung Soo.

444
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:34,107
Hey.

445
00:29:36,977 --> 00:29:38,577
Open up.

446
00:29:39,687 --> 00:29:41,117
Make sure to chew.

447
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:46,657
I can't stop thinking about the move I got wrong during rehearsal.

448
00:29:47,227 --> 00:29:48,427
What if I mess up again?

449
00:29:49,527 --> 00:29:52,327
Dancers, please head up to the stage.

450
00:29:55,697 --> 00:29:57,367
- See you up there. - Sure.

451
00:29:59,007 --> 00:30:00,037
I'll get going.

452
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:02,737
Heung Soo.

453
00:30:11,877 --> 00:30:13,287
No matter what anyone says,

454
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:16,157
you're the best dancer in Korea.

455
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:19,587
So don't be intimidated,

456
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:22,627
and crush the stage.

457
00:30:23,457 --> 00:30:24,497
Got it?

458
00:30:46,247 --> 00:30:52,587
The mist under the light

459
00:30:55,187 --> 00:31:02,367
Wraps around my rumpled figure

460
00:31:27,687 --> 00:31:31,856
Milky-white cigarette smoke, flashy clothes

461
00:31:31,857 --> 00:31:34,967
I catch your reflection in the mirror

462
00:31:35,737 --> 00:31:39,707
Since my life changed, I don't look the same anymore

463
00:31:41,137 --> 00:31:42,167
Heung Soo.

464
00:31:44,177 --> 00:31:45,706
You're still the best.

465
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:49,577
In the heat of the couples' passion

466
00:31:49,647 --> 00:31:52,277
To me, you're still the brightest star.

467
00:31:54,617 --> 00:31:56,287
Hey, Mr. Oh.

468
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,486
I got here a bit too early.

469
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:01,526
I decided...

470
00:32:01,527 --> 00:32:03,357
to look around the market before we start.

471
00:32:03,397 --> 00:32:04,527
Who was that?

472
00:32:04,557 --> 00:32:07,366
He teaches Zumba at our community center.

473
00:32:07,367 --> 00:32:09,296
He's an incredible dancer.

474
00:32:09,297 --> 00:32:10,937
Isn't he a looker too?

475
00:32:14,337 --> 00:32:15,537
Thanks, little lady.

476
00:32:15,907 --> 00:32:17,977
You're new to the class, right?

477
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:20,807
I'm Ji Ok Bun.

478
00:32:20,907 --> 00:32:23,816
"K-beauty pioneer G Hair Salon."

479
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:25,117
"Designer Ji Ok Bun."

480
00:32:25,747 --> 00:32:26,947
I said no!

481
00:32:29,357 --> 00:32:31,117
Why are you doing this to me?

482
00:32:31,857 --> 00:32:33,227
Why on earth?

483
00:32:36,157 --> 00:32:39,027
If you so much as touch my darling,

484
00:32:39,097 --> 00:32:41,427
I'll kill you myself!

485
00:32:50,337 --> 00:32:51,407
My gosh!

486
00:32:56,277 --> 00:32:58,517
This is our first day as a couple.

487
00:33:01,887 --> 00:33:03,557
The doctor who owns the vet...

488
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,327
is the youngest son of Sangjin Group's CEO?

489
00:33:07,127 --> 00:33:08,187
But...

490
00:33:11,127 --> 00:33:12,727
You are too good...

491
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:14,597
for a guy like me, Ok Bun.

492
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,137
Leave me, Ok Bun!

493
00:33:25,577 --> 00:33:26,607
I promise you this.

494
00:33:27,347 --> 00:33:29,617
From now on, I'll never bail on you.

495
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:32,217
Heung Soo, you've matured.

496
00:33:34,617 --> 00:33:36,187
You have another thing coming!

497
00:33:59,377 --> 00:34:02,616
Cut. Good job, everyone.

498
00:34:02,617 --> 00:34:04,416
Good job, guys. We're done filming.

499
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,947
- Good job. - Thanks.

500
00:34:16,397 --> 00:34:18,127
Heung Soo, I know that wasn't easy.

501
00:34:18,697 --> 00:34:21,467
You were definitely the star of the show.

502
00:34:25,867 --> 00:34:26,967
Thanks, Ok Bun.

503
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,317
I prepared this for today.

504
00:34:59,337 --> 00:35:00,537
Heung Soo...

505
00:35:02,167 --> 00:35:03,237
Will you accept this?

506
00:35:52,087 --> 00:35:55,327
I'll live happily the way I have lived so far.

507
00:35:56,857 --> 00:35:58,257
So don't worry about me.

508
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:02,737
Kang Soo.

509
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:05,267
Goodbye.

510
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:35,367
How are you feeling?

511
00:36:35,897 --> 00:36:38,236
After taking a walk outside in the fresh air,

512
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,437
are you feeling better?

513
00:36:41,267 --> 00:36:42,307
Yes.

514
00:36:44,507 --> 00:36:47,477
I spoke to your mom before I went to pick you up.

515
00:36:48,847 --> 00:36:50,177
She seems to be having a hard time.

516
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:57,117
She has always been the best mom for me.

517
00:36:58,157 --> 00:36:59,787
But she abandoned her own son,

518
00:37:00,827 --> 00:37:04,057
and she stole money from the people who were raising her son.

519
00:37:08,197 --> 00:37:10,697
What kind of life has Mom lived?

520
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,667
She doesn't seem like my mom I have known.

521
00:37:17,077 --> 00:37:18,807
I just don't understand her.

522
00:37:27,187 --> 00:37:28,886
You know your mom was raised...

523
00:37:28,887 --> 00:37:30,817
in an orphanage when she was little, right?

524
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:33,327
Yes.

525
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:35,656
After she grew up and left the orphanage,

526
00:37:35,657 --> 00:37:37,257
she met Kang Soo's father.

527
00:37:38,397 --> 00:37:40,127
And three days before Kang Soo was born,

528
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:42,796
his father passed away...

529
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:44,297
in an accident at a construction site.

530
00:37:47,237 --> 00:37:49,506
She was too afraid to raise Kang Soo all alone...

531
00:37:49,507 --> 00:37:50,777
as a single mother,

532
00:37:51,677 --> 00:37:53,546
so she believed it would be better for Kang Soo...

533
00:37:53,547 --> 00:37:55,307
to leave him with my parents,

534
00:37:55,977 --> 00:37:58,417
who were known to be happily married with many children.

535
00:38:02,957 --> 00:38:05,017
And that's why she got a job at the brewery.

536
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,426
When my mom was ill,

537
00:38:07,427 --> 00:38:09,857
your mom raised Kang Soo until he was three years old.

538
00:38:13,597 --> 00:38:15,827
At a much younger age than you are now,

539
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:19,737
she believed it was the best choice for him.

540
00:38:31,747 --> 00:38:33,817
Mom did something she should never have done...

541
00:38:34,287 --> 00:38:36,487
to you and your family.

542
00:38:39,287 --> 00:38:41,457
I feel so ashamed...

543
00:38:42,757 --> 00:38:45,357
that I don't think I can stay with you any longer.

544
00:38:50,437 --> 00:38:53,167
I really like you.

545
00:38:54,407 --> 00:38:57,407
But I can't be this shameless.

546
00:38:59,277 --> 00:39:01,547
I feel bad that I like you.

547
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,757
I felt the same way at first.

548
00:39:12,487 --> 00:39:14,556
That's why I tried to be more careful...

549
00:39:14,557 --> 00:39:16,197
and push you away.

550
00:39:17,597 --> 00:39:18,627
But, Se Ri,

551
00:39:20,427 --> 00:39:23,097
the past is not something we chose to happen.

552
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:28,337
Trying to take responsibility for things we didn't even choose...

553
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:30,177
is just ridiculous.

554
00:39:35,007 --> 00:39:36,816
We may feel bad for Kang Soo,

555
00:39:36,817 --> 00:39:39,517
and we may seem selfish to our families,

556
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:42,317
but I don't want to give up on you.

557
00:39:44,587 --> 00:39:45,857
I will never let you go.

558
00:39:55,197 --> 00:39:57,937
Let's not run away from this.

559
00:40:12,931 --> 00:40:14,891
(Eagle Brewery)

560
00:40:18,674 --> 00:40:19,674
My gosh.

561
00:40:26,044 --> 00:40:27,174
What is this?

562
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:30,044
Did someone drop this?

563
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,214
Knock, knock.

564
00:40:35,054 --> 00:40:37,823
Someone dropped this on the couch.

565
00:40:37,824 --> 00:40:39,353
Who was it?

566
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:41,024
That's not mine.

567
00:40:41,864 --> 00:40:43,794
- No one? It's not yours? - No.

568
00:40:44,464 --> 00:40:46,034
What is it? It looks like a pill bottle.

569
00:40:47,734 --> 00:40:48,764
A pill bottle?

570
00:40:50,664 --> 00:40:51,974
It says here.

571
00:40:52,374 --> 00:40:53,704
"Park Jung Soo."

572
00:40:54,734 --> 00:40:56,104
Park Jung Soo.

573
00:40:57,144 --> 00:40:59,343
And this is Ms. Park Jung Soo,

574
00:40:59,344 --> 00:41:01,544
my mother-in-law.

575
00:41:10,424 --> 00:41:13,793
The call cannot be connected and will be transferred to voicemail.

576
00:41:13,794 --> 00:41:14,894
Is he in a meeting?

577
00:41:20,194 --> 00:41:21,334
Are you going out?

578
00:41:22,004 --> 00:41:24,204
I'll go to the hospital to have my dressing changed.

579
00:41:24,934 --> 00:41:26,033
I'll see you later.

580
00:41:26,034 --> 00:41:28,874
You didn't forget about the dinner with Mr. Han tonight, did you?

581
00:41:29,274 --> 00:41:32,074
Of course not. I'll be back soon.

582
00:41:32,944 --> 00:41:34,873
(Saelo Surgery Hospital)

583
00:41:34,874 --> 00:41:36,114
Ms. Ma Kwang Sook.

584
00:41:36,914 --> 00:41:37,914
Yes.

585
00:41:46,154 --> 00:41:47,823
The weeping from the burn has decreased significantly,

586
00:41:47,824 --> 00:41:49,723
and the redness is subsiding too.

587
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:50,864
It's gotten a lot better.

588
00:41:51,464 --> 00:41:53,534
Okay. Thank you.

589
00:41:53,934 --> 00:41:56,103
By next week, we should be able to remove the dressing...

590
00:41:56,104 --> 00:41:58,134
and switch to open-air treatment.

591
00:41:58,674 --> 00:41:59,674
Okay.

592
00:42:00,274 --> 00:42:01,804
Oh, right. Doctor.

593
00:42:03,704 --> 00:42:04,804
I was wondering...

594
00:42:05,874 --> 00:42:09,144
if you could tell me what these pills are for.

595
00:42:12,484 --> 00:42:14,484
These are for Alzheimer's disease.

596
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,784
Alzheimer's?

597
00:42:18,894 --> 00:42:19,994
You mean, dementia?

598
00:42:23,924 --> 00:42:26,634
I think someone's at the door.

599
00:42:27,894 --> 00:42:30,364
Oh, right. The housekeeper went grocery shopping.

600
00:42:35,544 --> 00:42:37,804
What brings that brat here?

601
00:42:41,444 --> 00:42:42,614
What's the matter?

602
00:42:42,784 --> 00:42:45,554
I'm here to give you something.

603
00:42:49,524 --> 00:42:50,984
Hello.

604
00:42:54,094 --> 00:42:55,294
What brings you here?

605
00:42:56,394 --> 00:42:59,194
When you visited my office,

606
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:01,594
you left this.

607
00:43:04,004 --> 00:43:05,004
Well...

608
00:43:05,634 --> 00:43:08,074
Why was it in your office?

609
00:43:09,304 --> 00:43:11,373
I just found it.

610
00:43:11,374 --> 00:43:14,974
I thought you might have to take it on time,

611
00:43:15,344 --> 00:43:17,244
so I brought it right away.

612
00:43:18,014 --> 00:43:19,653
It's nothing special.

613
00:43:19,654 --> 00:43:21,014
They're just vitamins.

614
00:43:22,584 --> 00:43:23,984
Vitamins?

615
00:43:24,124 --> 00:43:25,124
Why?

616
00:43:25,724 --> 00:43:28,024
Do you think I have some kind of fatal disease?

617
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,624
No, it's not like that.

618
00:43:31,694 --> 00:43:33,294
If you're done, you may leave.

619
00:43:33,664 --> 00:43:35,034
Thank you anyway.

620
00:43:36,264 --> 00:43:37,364
By the way...

621
00:43:39,574 --> 00:43:40,674
What?

622
00:43:42,174 --> 00:43:43,304
I'm sorry,

623
00:43:44,674 --> 00:43:48,544
but I think I have to tell you this.

624
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,114
I got scalded yesterday,

625
00:43:54,414 --> 00:43:56,784
so I went to the doctor to get my burn dressed.

626
00:43:57,684 --> 00:44:01,254
I asked the doctor about this pill bottle.

627
00:44:01,994 --> 00:44:03,024
And?

628
00:44:03,664 --> 00:44:06,393
She said it was what doctors in the US...

629
00:44:06,394 --> 00:44:09,204
prescribe to people with Alzheimer's disease.

630
00:44:10,034 --> 00:44:11,164
So what?

631
00:44:11,734 --> 00:44:13,304
Do you think...

632
00:44:13,774 --> 00:44:15,944
I'm even more of a pushover now that you know what I have?

633
00:44:16,504 --> 00:44:18,844
No, it's not that.

634
00:44:18,974 --> 00:44:21,744
It's in the early stages, and I'm perfectly fine.

635
00:44:22,444 --> 00:44:24,713
I'm objecting to your marriage because I want to...

636
00:44:24,714 --> 00:44:26,154
sort everything out while I'm still fine.

637
00:44:27,884 --> 00:44:31,154
I lack in many ways compared to your daughter.

638
00:44:32,124 --> 00:44:34,894
I see why you oppose, but...

639
00:44:34,994 --> 00:44:36,064
Anyway, thank you...

640
00:44:36,324 --> 00:44:38,734
for coming all the way to return my pills.

641
00:44:39,394 --> 00:44:40,634
Not at all.

642
00:44:41,034 --> 00:44:42,664
You can skip taking vitamins,

643
00:44:42,804 --> 00:44:46,474
but medication like that should be taken regularly.

644
00:44:47,074 --> 00:44:49,374
Goodbye, then.

645
00:44:52,044 --> 00:44:54,914
Can I ask you to do something for me?

646
00:44:56,844 --> 00:44:59,114
Yes, of course.

647
00:44:59,754 --> 00:45:00,954
About my pills.

648
00:45:02,124 --> 00:45:05,024
Don't tell the chairman or my grandchildren.

649
00:45:06,294 --> 00:45:07,694
I'll tell them myself...

650
00:45:08,094 --> 00:45:09,524
when the time is right.

651
00:45:10,464 --> 00:45:13,194
You should do that. Don't worry.

652
00:45:13,764 --> 00:45:16,904
If it hadn't been for the details on the bottle,

653
00:45:17,334 --> 00:45:20,474
I wouldn't have known you had Alzheimer's.

654
00:45:22,044 --> 00:45:23,774
You're still healthy and well.

655
00:45:24,244 --> 00:45:26,614
Don't mind it or worry too much.

656
00:45:28,584 --> 00:45:31,414
Others might not notice, but I'm well aware.

657
00:45:33,554 --> 00:45:36,054
My life is slowly being wiped away,

658
00:45:37,354 --> 00:45:39,124
one particle at a time.

659
00:45:40,794 --> 00:45:43,064
That's why I feel anxious.

660
00:45:45,694 --> 00:45:47,494
If I treated you harshly,

661
00:45:48,364 --> 00:45:51,604
it was because of my circumstances, so I hope you understand.

662
00:45:52,634 --> 00:45:55,744
I do. Don't worry.

663
00:45:56,744 --> 00:45:59,214
Goodbye, then.

664
00:46:01,344 --> 00:46:03,114
Oh, and...

665
00:46:04,244 --> 00:46:08,284
I'll keep this a secret of my own.

666
00:46:23,904 --> 00:46:27,304
She's still so young and pretty.

667
00:46:32,514 --> 00:46:33,974
What a shame.

668
00:46:40,584 --> 00:46:42,554
Hello, it's me.

669
00:46:43,584 --> 00:46:46,193
I was in a meeting, so my phone was on silent.

670
00:46:46,194 --> 00:46:48,494
That's why I didn't pick up. I see you called.

671
00:46:51,224 --> 00:46:52,234
Yes.

672
00:46:53,064 --> 00:46:54,934
Why? Is something wrong?

673
00:46:57,134 --> 00:46:58,164
No.

674
00:46:59,334 --> 00:47:00,404
I just...

675
00:47:01,234 --> 00:47:04,074
I just called to hear your voice.

676
00:47:07,214 --> 00:47:09,244
If we miss out on the premium market,

677
00:47:09,484 --> 00:47:12,054
our cheaper products will lose footing as well.

678
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:14,914
What do we have that Eagle Brewery doesn't?

679
00:47:15,084 --> 00:47:16,954
We have more funds and a distribution network.

680
00:47:17,284 --> 00:47:18,853
We'll make a premium product...

681
00:47:18,854 --> 00:47:20,453
that's cheaper than Eagle Brewery's stuff...

682
00:47:20,454 --> 00:47:22,193
and promote it aggressively.

683
00:47:22,194 --> 00:47:24,924
We need to secure a piece of the market.

684
00:47:24,994 --> 00:47:28,804
Our cash flow has worsened because sales have dropped.

685
00:47:29,664 --> 00:47:31,504
Spending all we have...

686
00:47:31,664 --> 00:47:33,033
is too much of a risk.

687
00:47:33,034 --> 00:47:35,374
Our shareholders are complaining.

688
00:47:35,444 --> 00:47:37,173
Why would they complain...

689
00:47:37,174 --> 00:47:38,443
when we worked so hard...

690
00:47:38,444 --> 00:47:40,474
to make them rich so far?

691
00:47:41,444 --> 00:47:42,484
Darn it.

692
00:47:43,214 --> 00:47:45,714
Tell them to sit back, wait, and enjoy the spoils.

693
00:48:04,004 --> 00:48:06,474
You had a baby and left it outside a brewery.

694
00:48:06,974 --> 00:48:10,374
Then you stole from the very brewery that raised him so well.

695
00:48:10,544 --> 00:48:12,113
You should have a conscience.

696
00:48:12,114 --> 00:48:13,744
How could you do such a thing?

697
00:48:27,554 --> 00:48:28,823
A housewife...

698
00:48:28,824 --> 00:48:31,064
is getting drunk when her husband just got home.

699
00:48:32,234 --> 00:48:33,764
What a mess.

700
00:48:42,144 --> 00:48:43,204
Where are you going?

701
00:48:44,774 --> 00:48:46,113
To Eagle Brewery.

702
00:48:46,114 --> 00:48:47,174
What for?

703
00:48:47,974 --> 00:48:50,144
I'll kneel and beg for forgiveness.

704
00:48:51,284 --> 00:48:52,354
What?

705
00:48:52,414 --> 00:48:53,784
I'll confess to leaving Kang Soo...

706
00:48:53,984 --> 00:48:56,084
and stealing from them...

707
00:48:56,154 --> 00:48:57,654
and ask them to forgive me.

708
00:48:57,724 --> 00:48:59,894
That's what I must do, for the kids.

709
00:49:00,454 --> 00:49:02,424
Who says you can ask for forgiveness?

710
00:49:02,694 --> 00:49:04,294
Don't do it if you don't want to.

711
00:49:04,864 --> 00:49:05,894
I'll do it.

712
00:49:06,134 --> 00:49:08,704
If I don't do it, you can't either.

713
00:49:10,604 --> 00:49:12,673
I lost my wife and my daughter...

714
00:49:12,674 --> 00:49:14,504
to that darn brewery.

715
00:49:15,004 --> 00:49:16,604
Kang Soo took you from me,

716
00:49:16,644 --> 00:49:18,244
and Beom Soo took Se Ri.

717
00:49:18,404 --> 00:49:20,144
I'm left with no one.

718
00:49:20,274 --> 00:49:22,184
Don't be stupid!

719
00:49:22,384 --> 00:49:24,984
That's why I swear...

720
00:49:25,784 --> 00:49:28,854
I will swallow up Eagle Brewery.

721
00:49:29,524 --> 00:49:33,654
I'll be sure to chew them up nicely so nothing is left.

722
00:49:34,754 --> 00:49:35,794
Wait and see.

723
00:49:53,814 --> 00:49:55,014
You're still here?

724
00:49:55,544 --> 00:49:57,314
Yes. You can get going.

725
00:50:02,454 --> 00:50:03,524
Here.

726
00:50:10,524 --> 00:50:12,564
I never took it off...

727
00:50:12,664 --> 00:50:14,364
since you gave it to me.

728
00:50:15,134 --> 00:50:18,064
And most of my worries and fears have gone away.

729
00:50:21,774 --> 00:50:23,204
I want to give it back.

730
00:50:23,874 --> 00:50:26,774
You look like you're going through a lot.

731
00:50:30,314 --> 00:50:31,384
Thank you.

732
00:50:33,054 --> 00:50:36,784
That thing will eat up your worries and fears.

733
00:50:46,564 --> 00:50:48,364
Good job to us both.

734
00:50:48,634 --> 00:50:50,204
Cheers.

735
00:50:58,544 --> 00:51:00,144
To be honest,

736
00:51:00,874 --> 00:51:02,214
you were the best today.

737
00:51:03,084 --> 00:51:04,114
No.

738
00:51:04,744 --> 00:51:05,914
That's an exaggeration.

739
00:51:06,484 --> 00:51:08,014
It was all about Jin Young.

740
00:51:08,314 --> 00:51:09,324
No way.

741
00:51:09,584 --> 00:51:11,924
Whatever people say, you're the person...

742
00:51:12,294 --> 00:51:13,324
who owned it today.

743
00:51:14,124 --> 00:51:16,264
And the second best...

744
00:51:17,894 --> 00:51:19,364
was me?

745
00:51:23,604 --> 00:51:26,574
It's a 14k ring because I'm not that rich,

746
00:51:26,674 --> 00:51:29,274
but I need you to know that my love for you...

747
00:51:29,374 --> 00:51:30,474
is as pure as 24k gold.

748
00:51:34,514 --> 00:51:36,544
The more I look at it, the more I like it.

749
00:51:36,984 --> 00:51:38,414
It's my style.

750
00:51:43,754 --> 00:51:44,984
Thank you, Ok Bun.

751
00:51:47,854 --> 00:51:49,624
I was a nobody,

752
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:53,634
but you always treated me like I was a star.

753
00:51:55,134 --> 00:51:56,604
For your sake,

754
00:51:56,734 --> 00:51:59,304
I wish I had become more famous before I retired.

755
00:52:01,904 --> 00:52:02,974
I'm sorry.

756
00:52:06,114 --> 00:52:07,114
Heung Soo.

757
00:52:08,114 --> 00:52:09,644
As I said before,

758
00:52:10,314 --> 00:52:13,014
you'll always be a superstar to me.

759
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:16,424
So don't be so faint-hearted.

760
00:52:23,294 --> 00:52:25,964
Who knew Jin Young's 35th-anniversary show...

761
00:52:26,364 --> 00:52:27,934
would be my retirement soiree?

762
00:52:30,234 --> 00:52:31,664
It feels a bit bitter,

763
00:52:32,374 --> 00:52:33,634
but I feel lighter too.

764
00:52:37,444 --> 00:52:39,514
How about another shot to celebrate?

765
00:52:40,414 --> 00:52:41,474
Sure.

766
00:52:42,514 --> 00:52:44,814
- Cheers. - Cheers.

(Eagle Brewery)

768
00:52:52,224 --> 00:52:53,423
- My gosh. - What?

769
00:52:53,424 --> 00:52:54,724
Hello.

770
00:52:55,254 --> 00:52:57,624
Oh, hello, madam.

771
00:52:57,764 --> 00:52:59,864
My goodness. Why would you call me that?

772
00:53:00,164 --> 00:53:01,893
I'm not that old.

773
00:53:01,894 --> 00:53:03,404
Okay, sure.

774
00:53:03,664 --> 00:53:04,664
Mr. Go...

775
00:53:06,104 --> 00:53:07,474
Are you here to see the brewery manager?

776
00:53:07,774 --> 00:53:08,774
Yes.

777
00:53:09,474 --> 00:53:10,804
He's in, isn't he?

778
00:53:12,204 --> 00:53:13,214
Yes.

779
00:53:14,414 --> 00:53:16,744
(Eagle Brewery)

780
00:53:18,514 --> 00:53:19,554
What's going on?

781
00:53:27,594 --> 00:53:29,324
- Mr. Go. - Yes?

782
00:53:29,424 --> 00:53:30,424
You have a visitor.

783
00:53:30,794 --> 00:53:32,894
- A visitor? - Yes. Your sister.

784
00:53:33,094 --> 00:53:34,164
What?

785
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:37,134
What is she doing here out of the blue?

786
00:53:37,334 --> 00:53:38,834
My gosh. Hang on.

787
00:53:42,004 --> 00:53:43,074
Oh, dear.

788
00:53:49,114 --> 00:53:51,084
How could you?

789
00:53:51,184 --> 00:53:52,214
Soo Dong.

790
00:53:52,454 --> 00:53:55,154
Let's go somewhere quiet so we can talk.

791
00:53:56,284 --> 00:53:59,423
Why won't you go on the blind date?

792
00:53:59,424 --> 00:54:00,424
Be quiet.

793
00:54:01,624 --> 00:54:04,364
What do you mean he won't go on a blind date?

794
00:54:04,864 --> 00:54:07,233
I thought he dated her for over a month.

795
00:54:07,234 --> 00:54:08,834
He didn't. Actually...

796
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:11,663
How could he date the woman for a month...

797
00:54:11,664 --> 00:54:14,304
when he didn't even go on the blind date?

798
00:54:14,604 --> 00:54:15,943
Do you have any idea...

799
00:54:15,944 --> 00:54:18,244
what awkward position you've put me in, Ja Dong?

800
00:54:27,684 --> 00:54:30,254
Here's to your new beginning.

801
00:54:31,024 --> 00:54:32,084
Congratulations.

802
00:54:32,454 --> 00:54:34,594
- Thank you. - Thank you.

803
00:54:37,124 --> 00:54:38,294
I know you're busy,

804
00:54:39,594 --> 00:54:41,534
so I really appreciate you making time for this.

805
00:54:42,294 --> 00:54:43,704
I'm truly grateful.

806
00:54:44,964 --> 00:54:47,403
By the way, I booked you a two-night stay in the suite...

807
00:54:47,404 --> 00:54:49,374
at the LX Hotel in Busan.

808
00:54:49,774 --> 00:54:51,944
I hope you have an amazing honeymoon.

809
00:54:52,574 --> 00:54:53,614
Goodness.

810
00:54:54,044 --> 00:54:56,244
That really wasn't necessary.

811
00:54:57,214 --> 00:54:58,214
Thank you.

812
00:54:58,215 --> 00:54:59,913
I've never had the chance to stay...

813
00:54:59,914 --> 00:55:01,984
in a suite at a five-star hotel before.

814
00:55:02,084 --> 00:55:04,324
Thanks to you, I'll be enjoying a bit of luxury.

815
00:55:04,724 --> 00:55:07,053
I put in a word ahead to make sure your stay is comfortable.

816
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,093
If you need anything,

817
00:55:09,094 --> 00:55:10,724
just let the front desk know.

818
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:13,564
I already feel guilty enough for getting married first,

819
00:55:14,034 --> 00:55:15,594
but you've given us such a precious gift.

820
00:55:16,364 --> 00:55:17,834
Thank you as well, Kwang Sook.

821
00:55:19,574 --> 00:55:22,773
Just seeing how happy you two are...

822
00:55:22,774 --> 00:55:24,204
brings a smile to my face.

823
00:55:26,914 --> 00:55:28,344
What are you talking about?

824
00:55:28,714 --> 00:55:30,984
We should be following in their footsteps soon.

825
00:55:31,584 --> 00:55:33,814
I don't have that much patience.

826
00:55:37,184 --> 00:55:38,184
Well,

827
00:55:39,124 --> 00:55:42,124
I want to get married only after I've received...

828
00:55:42,724 --> 00:55:43,824
everyone's blessings.

829
00:55:46,964 --> 00:55:50,334
Is there anyone who's against the two of you getting married?

830
00:55:52,204 --> 00:55:53,234
Well...

831
00:55:55,904 --> 00:55:58,344
I'm just saying. That's all.

832
00:55:59,574 --> 00:56:00,674
By the way,

833
00:56:01,314 --> 00:56:04,114
there's something we'd like to ask you.

834
00:56:19,264 --> 00:56:20,364
(Marriage Registration)

835
00:56:21,694 --> 00:56:23,533
It's our marriage registration.

836
00:56:23,534 --> 00:56:25,433
Chun Soo insisted...

837
00:56:25,434 --> 00:56:28,234
that we get your signatures as witnesses.

838
00:56:33,674 --> 00:56:37,144
Goodness, you're entrusting us with something this important?

839
00:56:37,544 --> 00:56:38,784
It's such an honor.

840
00:56:40,214 --> 00:56:41,214
I know.

841
00:56:41,384 --> 00:56:43,024
We're registering our marriage tomorrow...

842
00:56:43,724 --> 00:56:45,484
and heading straight to our honeymoon.

843
00:56:52,734 --> 00:56:53,864
All right.

844
00:57:08,374 --> 00:57:10,444
Vice-CEO Oh and his wife...

845
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:12,884
make a lovely couple.

846
00:57:14,384 --> 00:57:17,153
They both have big hearts...

847
00:57:17,154 --> 00:57:18,324
and are very understanding.

848
00:57:19,524 --> 00:57:20,654
I'm sure they'll have a happy marriage.

849
00:57:21,894 --> 00:57:22,924
Next,

850
00:57:24,064 --> 00:57:25,364
it's our turn.

851
00:57:28,594 --> 00:57:30,604
What is it? Why isn't there an answer?

852
00:57:33,804 --> 00:57:35,474
I said it before,

853
00:57:36,174 --> 00:57:38,943
but I want to start this new life...

854
00:57:38,944 --> 00:57:41,774
with everyone's blessing.

855
00:57:45,514 --> 00:57:46,514
Is this...

856
00:57:47,814 --> 00:57:49,754
about my mother-in-law?

857
00:57:56,764 --> 00:58:00,894
Try not to take my mother-in-law's words to heart.

858
00:58:02,494 --> 00:58:03,864
Her clock stopped...

859
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,374
around the time her daughter passed away.

860
00:58:08,634 --> 00:58:09,744
And she wants me...

861
00:58:10,404 --> 00:58:12,674
to be stuck in that same moment with her.

862
00:58:15,374 --> 00:58:18,984
She isn't being harsh because she dislikes you.

863
00:58:20,684 --> 00:58:23,983
She's being unreasonable because she can't accept the idea...

864
00:58:23,984 --> 00:58:25,724
of someone replacing her daughter.

865
00:58:27,654 --> 00:58:28,954
Don't let it bother you.

866
00:58:29,694 --> 00:58:31,364
If she keeps acting like this,

867
00:58:34,064 --> 00:58:37,364
I'll have to say some unpleasant things myself.

868
00:58:40,404 --> 00:58:41,634
Don't do that.

869
00:58:42,774 --> 00:58:44,273
I feel bad for her,

870
00:58:44,274 --> 00:58:46,574
and she deserves to be treated with kindness.

871
00:58:49,014 --> 00:58:52,344
You feel bad for my mother-in-law?

872
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,154
Why?

873
00:58:58,784 --> 00:58:59,954
She...

874
00:59:00,724 --> 00:59:04,764
She lost her daughter all those years ago.

875
00:59:19,144 --> 00:59:20,344
To the right?

876
00:59:21,674 --> 00:59:23,483
Heung Soo, it's too far to the left.

877
00:59:23,484 --> 00:59:24,713
To the right. More to your side.

878
00:59:24,714 --> 00:59:25,714
- Here? - Yes.

879
00:59:25,844 --> 00:59:28,113
- Kang Soo, lower it on your side. - Okay.

880
00:59:28,114 --> 00:59:29,483
Heung Soo, hold it a bit higher.

881
00:59:29,484 --> 00:59:31,384
- Just a little more. - Only a little.

882
00:59:32,624 --> 00:59:33,624
Goodness.

883
00:59:35,854 --> 00:59:38,563
Don't burn them like last time, trying to get that smoky flavor.

884
00:59:38,564 --> 00:59:39,834
Cook them properly.

885
00:59:39,964 --> 00:59:42,364
Mi Sun hates burned jeon.

886
00:59:43,464 --> 00:59:44,534
Got it, Kwang Sook.

887
00:59:47,304 --> 00:59:50,474
By the way, what's that ring on your finger?

888
00:59:51,574 --> 00:59:53,174
Was that from Heung Soo?

889
00:59:55,874 --> 00:59:56,944
Yes.

890
00:59:57,944 --> 01:00:00,083
He put it on my finger...

891
01:00:00,084 --> 01:00:01,854
after filming wrapped up.

892
01:00:02,954 --> 01:00:05,583
Ma Kwang Sook, pull yourself together.

893
01:00:05,584 --> 01:00:06,753
At this rate,

894
01:00:06,754 --> 01:00:08,424
you'll be the last one to get married.

895
01:00:09,054 --> 01:00:11,523
Who cares if I get married first or last?

896
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:12,894
As if that matters.

897
01:00:14,564 --> 01:00:17,563
By the way, who are you packing those for?

898
01:00:17,564 --> 01:00:18,604
What?

899
01:00:19,474 --> 01:00:20,574
It's a secret.

900
01:00:21,204 --> 01:00:23,403
You and your secrets.

901
01:00:23,404 --> 01:00:25,203
I'll be back before the newlyweds arrive,

902
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:26,274
so don't worry.

903
01:00:28,974 --> 01:00:30,184
Hello.

904
01:00:31,184 --> 01:00:32,444
Yes, hello.

905
01:00:33,414 --> 01:00:34,614
Who's here?

906
01:00:35,614 --> 01:00:37,284
The brewery CEO.

907
01:00:37,824 --> 01:00:39,184
Why is she here again?

908
01:00:40,354 --> 01:00:42,924
Has she been coming by often when I wasn't around?

909
01:00:43,094 --> 01:00:44,194
Gosh, no.

910
01:00:48,194 --> 01:00:49,704
Hello, ma'am.

911
01:00:51,764 --> 01:00:54,334
- Have you been well? - Yes, of course.

912
01:00:55,434 --> 01:00:56,904
What brings you by this time?

913
01:00:57,104 --> 01:01:00,713
My family is having a feast at home today,

914
01:01:00,714 --> 01:01:02,713
so we've been cooking.

915
01:01:02,714 --> 01:01:05,144
I brought you some to try.

916
01:01:07,014 --> 01:01:08,014
Oh, my.

917
01:01:08,714 --> 01:01:10,284
How sweet of you.

918
01:01:11,024 --> 01:01:12,124
I hate to say it,

919
01:01:12,654 --> 01:01:14,394
but Chairman Han went to the office.

920
01:01:15,624 --> 01:01:16,894
Yes, I know.

921
01:01:17,064 --> 01:01:18,494
Please take it to the kitchen.

922
01:01:18,794 --> 01:01:19,794
Sure.

923
01:01:24,964 --> 01:01:25,964
Ma'am,

924
01:01:27,034 --> 01:01:29,704
could we sit down for a moment?

925
01:01:29,974 --> 01:01:31,074
Whatever.

926
01:01:40,684 --> 01:01:41,784
I've been...

927
01:01:43,454 --> 01:01:46,124
thinking about it a lot these past few days.

928
01:01:47,724 --> 01:01:48,924
Before it's too late,

929
01:01:49,894 --> 01:01:52,894
maybe you should tell the chairman...

930
01:01:53,164 --> 01:01:55,264
about your health.

931
01:01:55,934 --> 01:01:56,934
Why's that?

932
01:01:57,704 --> 01:02:01,404
Have you been itching to tell him my secret?

933
01:02:02,034 --> 01:02:03,174
It's not that.

934
01:02:03,944 --> 01:02:05,374
I'm worried. That's all.

935
01:02:07,214 --> 01:02:09,244
You've got some nerve worrying about me.

936
01:02:10,484 --> 01:02:11,484
Then,

937
01:02:12,184 --> 01:02:14,753
if anything happens,

938
01:02:14,754 --> 01:02:16,483
please feel free to call me.

939
01:02:16,484 --> 01:02:18,223
I'll help you in any way I can.

940
01:02:18,224 --> 01:02:21,354
Don't treat me like a patient. I'm still clear-headed and capable.

941
01:02:22,754 --> 01:02:24,294
That's not what I meant.

942
01:02:25,764 --> 01:02:28,434
I just want to be there for you.

943
01:02:28,964 --> 01:02:31,304
Who are you to be someone who supports me?

944
01:02:32,264 --> 01:02:33,904
Do I look that vulnerable to you?

945
01:02:34,574 --> 01:02:35,634
I know...

946
01:02:37,404 --> 01:02:39,004
I have many shortcomings,

947
01:02:43,014 --> 01:02:46,254
but I'll be like a daughter to you.

948
01:02:47,014 --> 01:02:49,484
You'll be my what?

949
01:02:49,754 --> 01:02:50,784
I'll be...

950
01:02:51,624 --> 01:02:53,294
like a daughter to you.

951
01:03:41,504 --> 01:03:44,004
(For Eagle Brothers)

952
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,613
Knowing Kang Soo is your own mother's son,

953
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:48,713
how can you want to date his brother?

954
01:03:48,714 --> 01:03:52,214
Maybe you should reconsider your relationship with Se Ri.

955
01:03:52,584 --> 01:03:54,314
Are you sure you can handle all this?

956
01:03:54,354 --> 01:03:57,783
How about we play just three rounds of Go-Stop?

957
01:03:57,784 --> 01:03:58,854
We'll play what?

958
01:03:58,984 --> 01:04:01,924
Why are you trying so hard to get on my good side?

959
01:04:02,554 --> 01:04:05,094
Is it so you can marry Dong Seok?

960
01:04:05,594 --> 01:04:07,634
It's a photo of her when she was young.

961
01:04:07,734 --> 01:04:10,804
Who's the man next to her?
