00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,080
(Episode 2)

2
00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:20,829
Where am I?

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,760
That's right.

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,800
I got married.

5
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:31,739
Hold on.

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,570
Where did the newlywed groom go...

7
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,740
leaving his bride all alone?

8
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:39,009
Honey.

9
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:41,250
Honey-bunny?

10
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,619
There's your morning kiss.

11
00:00:53,659 --> 00:00:55,329
I didn't shave, so I have stubble.

12
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,130
That makes you sexier.

13
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,770
It's not like I can walk around
with my eyes closed.

14
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,569
Jealousy is for losers, Mr. Go.

15
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,239
As if kissing is a new concept.

16
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:12,540
Anyway, Boss,

17
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:16,150
it seems like Kim
made a mess of things.

18
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:17,920
You should come with me.

19
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:27,989
(Eagle Brewery)

20
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,659
(Pot Number 4)

21
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,040
What did I say about
sterilizing the clay pots properly?

22
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,439
I did it properly!

23
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:44,640
Then how do you explain
this foul taste?

24
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,680
You take all the credit
when things go well,

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,109
but I get all the blame
when they go wrong.

26
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:50,819
Why you...

27
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:51,980
That's enough.

28
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,219
He must be just as upset.

29
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,659
We'll just have to make
another batch.

30
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:00,930
You're throwing out
this precious drink?

31
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,030
Boss.

32
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,060
Considering the trend
in the long run,

33
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,730
we need to switch to koji.

34
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
This isn't the first time...

35
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,030
we messed up a batch
due to various bacteria.

36
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,340
With koji starter,

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,509
we can't produce...

38
00:02:13,509 --> 00:02:15,870
the unique taste and aroma
of Eagle Makgeolli.

39
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,879
We all know the benefits
of traditional nuruk.

40
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,210
However, quality control
is always a challenge.

41
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:22,710
This naive way of thinking...

42
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,020
is why you're always in the red.

43
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,099
Nuruk is the seed
of makgeolli making.

44
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,400
Planting a different seed...

45
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,169
will only give us
a different product.

46
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,409
Fusion methods may be the trend,

47
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:51,580
but I wish
to continue the tradition...

48
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,750
that was passed down
from my grandfather...

49
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,349
to my father.

50
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,479
I don't want any shortcuts.

51
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,389
That's true craftsmanship.

52
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:07,789
I never knew you could be
this stubborn about something.

53
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,699
Are you disappointed?

54
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,330
Disappointed?

55
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,199
I realized once again
that I chose the right man...

56
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:16,569
to marry.

57
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,310
You're honest to a fault,
upstanding,

58
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:23,370
and meticulous in your work.

59
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,680
Up close, you were
more charming than I thought.

60
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:31,979
I definitely chose
the right man for a husband.

61
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,949
Ma Kwang Sook, you lucky girl!

62
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,280
Aren't you cooking?

63
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:06,250
It won't kill you
to skip one breakfast.

64
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,849
- What?
- Grab a bowl...

65
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:10,289
of seolleongtang near the company.

66
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,529
Come on.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,160
I lifted the suspension
on your credit card.

68
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,470
What's bothering you
that has you sulking for days?

69
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,709
Jang Soo got married.

70
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,269
Who?

71
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:31,610
The eldest son at Eagle Brewery,

72
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,079
Oh Jang Soo.

73
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:38,220
I went to the spa
at Bom's father's hotel...

74
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,220
and stumbled upon him
in the hotel lobby.

75
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,790
All five brothers were there.

76
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,360
I guess he married late.

77
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,459
He has a business to run...

78
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:49,029
and brothers to take care of.

79
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:50,860
I doubt he had time for romance.

80
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,629
Are you the spokesperson
of that family or what?

81
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,199
Don't give me nonsense
first thing in the morning...

82
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,470
and cook my meal.

83
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:00,100
Again, again, and again.
You and your darn meals!

84
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,810
- What?
- Don't you feel bad?

85
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:07,050
- About what?
- I know it happened long ago but...

86
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,980
Forget it.

87
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,319
Darn. You and that temper of yours.

88
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,509
Your breakfast is ready.

89
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:43,310
I'm to have cup ramyeon
for breakfast?

90
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,180
That's the only thing I can prepare.

91
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,490
Forget it.

92
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,620
Anyway, take this...

93
00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:54,829
to your mom.

94
00:05:56,829 --> 00:05:59,259
Hold on. It's your black card.

95
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:01,170
There's no limit on that,

96
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,199
so tell her to buy
whatever she wants.

97
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,540
Really?

98
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:07,410
Dad!

99
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,139
Thanks.

100
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:16,610
Mom!

101
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:18,920
Mom.

102
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,790
Why? What now?

103
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,019
Ta-da.

104
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,629
Dad gave it to me.

105
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:29,589
You can buy whatever you want.

106
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,699
Really? It's a black card.

107
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:34,730
Se Ri, get ready to go out.

108
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,569
I thought you were sick.

109
00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:38,870
My sickness can be cured
by spending money.

110
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,870
Let's go!

111
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,170
Okay.

112
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,050
Victory.

113
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,819
Victory. Have a seat.

114
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:52,019
Sure.

115
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,889
I heard you had
middle ear inflammation as a child.

116
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:00,360
Yes, a few times.

117
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,759
This could be an aftermath of that.

118
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,060
The test results
from Capital Hospital are the same.

119
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,300
Your hearing issue is worsening...

120
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,829
due to repeated diver training.

121
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,240
If you're not careful about this,

122
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,839
you might lose your hearing
down the road.

123
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,540
Is it that bad?

124
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,649
You're not in the worst stage,

125
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,279
but you should avoid
intense diving activities.

126
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,220
I don't have that kind of luxury.

127
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,199
How about you take
an administrative position?

128
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:41,730
That isn't something
I've considered.

129
00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:44,040
Then take your time considering it.

130
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,040
Watching your own health...

131
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,009
is just as important
as serving your country.

132
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,310
Sure. I hear you.

133
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:54,680
I've written you a prescription,
so pick up your meds.

134
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,850
Thank you.

135
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,550
Victory.

136
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,649
Victory.

137
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:11,899
Hey, Bom.

138
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:15,899
I'm working on the operation...

139
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:18,069
to get Chairman Han Dong Seok
a girlfriend.

140
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:21,139
Of course.

141
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,670
The professor also knows
that Dad is quite grumpy.

142
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:27,910
Dad is here.

143
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,279
I'll keep you updated.

144
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,419
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey.

145
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:43,559
Thank you for coming
despite your busy schedule.

146
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,700
You don't need to thank me.

147
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:48,529
Going around to look at paintings
is also part of my job.

148
00:08:50,429 --> 00:08:53,769
Dad selected the paintings
hanging in the hotel.

149
00:08:54,669 --> 00:08:56,840
You must have
a deep knowledge of art.

150
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,539
I don't have much knowledge,
but I do respect art.

151
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,850
Art is like a jewel
that decorates our everyday lives.

152
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,980
What a poetic expression.

153
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:10,860
In order to provide customers
with emotional satisfaction,

154
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,830
it is difficult to run a hotel
without the sensibility of a poet.

155
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,029
I do like paintings, but I guess...

156
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,269
looking at paintings is part
of management.

157
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,500
I'm nervous to explain the works
to someone like you.

158
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:26,799
Please don't explain.

159
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Pardon?

160
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,379
I judge only with my own eyes.

161
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,289
Bom, your father is so good
at drawing the line.

162
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,960
He's not the type of person
who's easy to get close to,

163
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,059
but once you get to know him,
he has many interesting parts.

164
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:48,789
And he's cute.

165
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,159
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,830
Don't be. I don't like guys
who are easy to get.

167
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,210
Are you still nervous
about meeting my mom?

168
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,990
To be honest,

169
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,720
for someone perfect like Mother,

170
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:20,320
a son-in-law like me isn't
even close to being good enough.

171
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:23,860
Did Mom say something to you?

172
00:10:24,529 --> 00:10:25,830
It's not like that.

173
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,159
I'm not as rich...

174
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:30,370
or well-educated as others.

175
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,269
A guilty conscience
needs no accuser.

176
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,139
I agree.

177
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:38,509
It's true
that you did something wrong.

178
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:42,279
Because you stole
Ma Kwang Sook's heart.

179
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,080
You're a big thief.

180
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,320
My goodness.

181
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,889
Let's go.

182
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:03,399
Is it you, Kwang Sook?

183
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:05,940
Coming.

184
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,539
My goodness.

185
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,580
Are you all dressed up
to hit on someone again?

186
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,549
Who are you?

187
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:19,120
I apologize for the late greetings.

188
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,950
Let me introduce myself.

189
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:24,259
I'm Dr. Oh In Seok's wife.

190
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,389
I'm Dr. Lee Yong Ho's wife.

191
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:31,700
And I'm
Director Kim Cheol Su's wife.

192
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,169
What brings you here?

193
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:37,440
What do you think?
Why do you think we're here?

194
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,740
You know we're not here
to have a talk over some coffee.

195
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,509
Do you have any clue?

196
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,980
Why are you being so scary?

197
00:11:47,779 --> 00:11:51,179
Are you scared?
That means you did something awful.

198
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:54,049
I did something awful?
What did I do?

199
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:56,190
I see. You want to play innocent.

200
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,090
You tricked our husbands...

201
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,690
into going on a trip
to Jeju Island with you.

202
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:02,429
It's not a trip.

203
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,730
Good shot. We're going to play golf.

204
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,129
Are you kidding me?

205
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,870
Why are you yelling?
How uncivilized.

206
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,940
Just go out
and ask people on the street.

207
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,970
Between the woman
who asks someone else's husband...

208
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,870
to go on a trip with her...

209
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,309
and the wife
who tries to stop her husband...

210
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:17,580
from having an affair,
who's the uncivilized one?

211
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,139
An affair? That's ridiculous.

212
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,679
I'm not that kind of woman.

213
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:24,220
Then what kind of woman are you?

214
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,779
Be honest.

215
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:28,220
You moved into Golden Castle
with the intention...

216
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,889
of seducing a rich man, right?

217
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:31,159
What do you think I am?

218
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:32,490
Get out of my house now!

219
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,330
It's you who should move out...

220
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,029
- of Golden Castle.
- My gosh.

221
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,860
Before you get kicked out...

222
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,759
after being humiliated,

223
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:41,529
- My goodness.
- you'd better...

224
00:12:41,529 --> 00:12:43,669
let yourself out.

225
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,539
Why would I get kicked out?

226
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,169
What did I do wrong?

227
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,409
You failed to control your husbands,

228
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:52,080
but why are you taking it out on me?

229
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,610
We failed to control our husbands?

230
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:57,549
Just because you have a mouth
doesn't mean you can say nonsense.

231
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,120
Did you just hit me?

232
00:13:03,389 --> 00:13:04,559
Hey!

233
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,559
Have you lost your mind?

234
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:08,159
- Let go.
- Are you out of your mind?

235
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,690
- You brat!
- Why are you being like this?

236
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,799
- Let's talk it out.
- Let go!

237
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,529
- Hey!
- Talking doesn't work for her.

238
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:14,769
- You have to move out!
- My goodness.

239
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,740
- Hey! How dare you...
- Will you please stop it?

240
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,100
- Mom!
- Mother!

241
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,409
You saw the faces
of those darn ladies, right?

242
00:13:28,009 --> 00:13:30,919
Their faces are all square and flat
like slices of bread.

243
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,480
They were doctors
and hospital directors,

244
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,950
so I thought they were married
to someone gorgeous,

245
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,049
but that wasn't the case.

246
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,289
Why did you plan to go to
Jeju Island with their husbands?

247
00:13:40,289 --> 00:13:42,830
We are just soulmates.

248
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,600
Half of the people
in the retirement home are women.

249
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,259
Why do you have to be soulmates
with men?

250
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:52,500
I'm destined never to be soulmates
with women.

251
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,740
What are you talking about?

252
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,809
Since I'm so beautiful
and have outstanding looks,

253
00:13:56,809 --> 00:13:58,610
women look bad
whenever I'm around them.

254
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,409
That's why they're
instinctively wary of me.

255
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,049
They must feel uncomfortable to be
around someone like me.

256
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,850
That's enough.

257
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:09,649
You might end up getting kicked out.

258
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,090
Hey, even if I get kicked out,

259
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,919
I won't move in with you,
so you don't have to worry.

260
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,090
- Mother.
- Hey.

261
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,759
You must be shocked. Take this.

262
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,799
Gosh, thank you.

263
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:28,210
I've been thinking about this
for a while.

264
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:30,840
How about living with us...

265
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,039
- Jang Soo.
- Jang Soo.

266
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,649
After seeing you have a hard time
with my own eyes,

267
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:37,049
how would I sit still
and do nothing?

268
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,519
Please move in with us.

269
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:39,879
- That's ridiculous!
- That's ridiculous!

270
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,690
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

271
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:49,190
Jang Soo got married.

272
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,889
- Who?
- The eldest son at Eagle Brewery,

273
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,759
Oh Jang Soo.

274
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:03,110
I'm home, sir.

275
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:04,940
Hey, you're back, Jang Soo.

276
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:08,110
Let me help you.

277
00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:10,909
- You should go in and study.
- I'll do it.

278
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,450
My gosh.

279
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,090
All right. Go like this.

280
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,799
(Credit card purchase,
5,540 dollars)

281
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:33,600
She was dying this morning,
but she must be feeling better.

282
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,039
Splurging is the only thing
she's good at.

283
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,240
Then again,

284
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,480
if she couldn't have this fun,
she wouldn't be with me.

285
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,750
Gosh.

286
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:55,460
All right.

287
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,929
Isn't this place nice?

288
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:03,269
This cafe is
really popular these days.

289
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,100
They must've spent a lot of money
on the interior design.

290
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,309
Money doesn't lie, after all.

291
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:11,779
My goodness.

292
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,409
Look at that.

293
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:17,080
What? They are Bom and Chairman Han.

294
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,120
Who is that lady?

295
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,720
What? It looks like a date.

296
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,419
Thank you for visiting...

297
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,460
and even purchasing the painting.

298
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,299
It's about Bom.

299
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:33,159
Of course, I should buy one.

300
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:35,769
Dad.

301
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,899
I feel like I burdened you,
which is embarrassing.

302
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,169
It wasn't a burden.

303
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,139
I had a great time
admiring good artworks.

304
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,450
Would you like the painting
to be delivered to the hotel?

305
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:51,480
I will think about it a little more
before hanging it at the hotel.

306
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,350
Well... He means...

307
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,120
it should go well
with the existing paintings.

308
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:02,190
Aren't I right?

309
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:08,029
When I look at Bom,

310
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,069
I regret not getting married
and having...

311
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:12,240
a sweet daughter like her.

312
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,200
That's not...

313
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,210
an easy thing to do.

314
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:18,579
Pardon?

315
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,079
Having a pretty daughter like Bom...

316
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,009
is a difficult thing to do.

317
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,119
Her mom was very beautiful.

318
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,089
Oh, well...

319
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,359
What a lame joke.

320
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,160
That's not funny, Dad.

321
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,559
You have a unique sense of humor.

322
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,380
Please excuse me for a second.

323
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,480
Sure. Go ahead.

324
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:02,319
What a small world.

325
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:04,150
I can't believe we met out here.

326
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,259
Me neither. I was so surprised.

327
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,329
Who was the other lady?

328
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,789
She's my professor.

329
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,799
She's exhibiting her works nearby,

330
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:13,859
so I brought my father.

331
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
It didn't look like
he just came to look at art.

332
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,200
It looked more like a blind date.

333
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,740
It was.

334
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,369
My professor's still single.

335
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:26,109
I brought my dad over
so he could meet her.

336
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,380
Will your professor
become your stepmom?

337
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:31,009
That would be crazy.

338
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,420
She can't be your stepmom.

339
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,329
You never know
how things will pan out.

340
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:44,700
Did your brother agree to...

341
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,259
setting your father up?

342
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:49,200
Yes. He has high hopes too.

343
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:54,039
You're a set of spoiled siblings.

344
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:56,210
You know so little
of the outside world.

345
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,079
Pardon?

346
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
What?

347
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:01,579
We can discuss that later.

348
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,920
Do you think
their date will go well?

349
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:10,049
My dad can be brutally direct.

350
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,420
My professor didn't seem pleased.

351
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,759
I see.

352
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,269
We parted
without eating with your mother,

353
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,009
and I feel bad.

354
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,609
No one would feel like
enjoying a meal...

355
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:33,210
after a fight like that.

356
00:19:35,609 --> 00:19:36,809
Jang Soo.

357
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:40,849
I'm grateful
that you care about my mom,

358
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,450
but don't be quick to offer...

359
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,819
that she can live with us.

360
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,720
That's no easy feat.

361
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,859
Nothing's too hard
if a child wants...

362
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:51,500
to look after a parent.

363
00:19:52,529 --> 00:19:54,130
We must do what we can.

364
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:57,500
That would make
both Mom and me uncomfortable.

365
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,910
My mom's still young and healthy.

366
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:08,150
Later on.
We can consider it much later.

367
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,950
Shall we have lunch with Chun Soo?

368
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:16,819
He works near here.

369
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,619
Shall we do that?

370
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,890
I can't seem to get through.

371
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,099
Can you call Head of Investments
Oh Chun Soo for me?

372
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,799
I'm his older brother,

373
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,529
and I'd like to ask him to lunch.

374
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:33,440
Mr. Oh Chun Soo?

375
00:20:35,009 --> 00:20:36,569
We don't have anyone by that name.

376
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,109
Did he move to another branch?

377
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,109
Give me a moment.
I'll check our database.

378
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:45,450
Oh Chun Soo,
Head of Investments, right?

379
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:46,450
Yes.

380
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,690
It says he resigned.

381
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,789
- He resigned?
- He resigned?

382
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,259
Aren't you Mr. Oh's brother?

383
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,890
I am, yes.

384
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,430
It has been almost two years.

385
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:00,559
The company
struggled a great deal...

386
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,930
over miss-selling funds,

387
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,099
and our branch
happened to sell the most.

388
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:06,500
The head office
blamed the branches...

389
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,839
to avoid responsibility,

390
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:08,940
and that's how...

391
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,940
Mr. Oh ended up resigning.

392
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,980
I had...

393
00:21:13,579 --> 00:21:14,849
no idea at all.

394
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:18,150
It wasn't
Mr. Oh's sole responsibility.

395
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,450
He took the blame
to save the rest of us.

396
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,390
I guess he didn't tell you
in case you'd worry too much.

397
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,190
He suffered alone for two years?

398
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,160
(Areum Gosiwon)

399
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,539
Jang Soo. What's up?

400
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,210
Nothing.

401
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:18,910
I just called to hear your voice.

402
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,710
Did you have lunch?

403
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,309
Yes.

404
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,779
I just finished.

405
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,779
Are you free this evening?

406
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:30,390
Let's have dinner.

407
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,089
Sorry.

408
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,789
I have a team dinner,
so I'm not free.

409
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,099
Is something wrong?

410
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,029
Of course not.

411
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,339
We haven't met
since I got back from my honeymoon.

412
00:22:46,569 --> 00:22:49,910
I was hoping
the three of us could eat out.

413
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,180
I have plans, so today won't work.

414
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,380
Sorry.

415
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,750
If you're busy, that's fine.

416
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:58,180
Then I'll see you on Sunday.

417
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,619
See you at Beom Soo's housewarming.

418
00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:01,279
Yes, sure.

419
00:23:01,819 --> 00:23:02,819
Chun Soo.

420
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,359
I'm not much of a big brother,

421
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,559
but I'll always be there for you.

422
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:11,730
Don't forget that.

423
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,730
Okay?

424
00:23:15,069 --> 00:23:16,529
You're being weird.

425
00:23:17,369 --> 00:23:18,769
Is something wrong?

426
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:20,269
I said no.

427
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:23,740
Okay then. See you on Sunday.

428
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,549
To think he suffered on his own,

429
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,259
unable to even tell me...

430
00:23:41,789 --> 00:23:43,130
My heart breaks.

431
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:46,660
Chun Soo's a smart guy.

432
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:49,329
He'll have a plan of his own.

433
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:52,069
He already has enough
on his plate...

434
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,970
with his wife and kid living abroad.

435
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,470
He's a competent man.

436
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:00,680
He can start over.

437
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,890
Ms. Ji.
The perm came out nicely today.

438
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,690
Yes, thanks.

439
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:20,529
Hey.

440
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,000
I asked you to send
the lodge money already.

441
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,470
Why haven't you yet?

442
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,700
I was so busy that I forgot.

443
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,210
- Hang on.
- Goodness.

444
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:34,279
I just sent it. Check your account.

445
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,119
Be sure to send it on time.

446
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,220
Don't make me come here.

447
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,890
This is the only way...

448
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:45,589
I get to see you, isn't it?

449
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:50,589
Gosh. The broth is lovely.

450
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,230
By the way,

451
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,569
dishware seller Ms. Kim
spent her money...

452
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:57,569
to get her eyelids fixed.

453
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,440
What will you spend yours on?

454
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:01,940
It's your turn next month.

455
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:05,109
I have lots of things to do.
It's the money I don't have.

456
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:08,180
You're very right.

457
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:11,880
Hey, Mr. Oh.

458
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:16,390
I got here a bit too early.

459
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,549
I decided...

460
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,089
to look around the market
before we start.

461
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,930
I'm glad you did.

462
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:28,869
I don't like to eat too much
before a class.

463
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:35,470
But for your sake,
shall I have a snack?

464
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,539
Yes.

465
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,559
- Thanks.
- Sure.

466
00:25:57,559 --> 00:25:59,259
- Don't be late for the class.
- I won't.

467
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,930
- See you later, Mr. Oh.
- Bye.

468
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,210
"Mr. Oh?"

469
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,380
Who was that?

470
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:14,740
He teaches Zumba...

471
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,279
at our community center.

472
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:18,250
He's an incredible dancer.

473
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,019
Isn't he a looker too?

474
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:22,950
I'm pretty sure it was him.

475
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,289
His moves are so powerful...

476
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:25,819
that your belly pouch vanishes.

477
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:26,859
I started a month ago,

478
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:28,259
and I lost 4kg already.

479
00:26:28,859 --> 00:26:30,660
What's his name?

480
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,400
It's Oh Heung Soo.

481
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,900
It's him.

482
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:40,069
What? What is?

483
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:43,640
No. You don't need to know.

484
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,710
What time does the class start?

485
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:52,549
Hello, everyone. Let's get started.

486
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:54,519
Zumba is exciting.

487
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:56,390
- Say what to stress?
- Bye!

488
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,190
- Say what to belly fat?
- Bye!

489
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,190
Zumba!

490
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,359
- Let's Zumba!
- Let's Zumba!

491
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:02,490
- Zumba.
- Zumba.

492
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,190
Let's go!

493
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:08,599
Today, we won't stop
until we burn 1,000 calories.

494
00:27:08,769 --> 00:27:10,230
We start with the V-step.

495
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,670
One, two, three, four. V-step.

496
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,009
V-step. Good.

497
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:16,940
To the side.

498
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:21,109
Tap, tap, up, down, up, down.

499
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:24,049
Tap, tap, up, down, up, and down.

500
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:27,220
Tap, tap, up, down, up, down.

501
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:29,250
Nice!

502
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,890
Hey. Out of the way.

503
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,789
Move.

504
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,460
Round and round.

505
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,329
Round and round.

506
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,170
Bring it in twice.

507
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,839
We now only have to mix
the kimchi seasoning.

508
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:50,940
Let me show you
how easily it can be done.

509
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,440
Place the seasoning like this...

510
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,980
and rub against the cabbage.

511
00:27:58,079 --> 00:27:59,819
(Mom)

512
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,720
Have you eaten?

513
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,059
Well...

514
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:11,160
I didn't have an appetite,
so I got myself some coffee.

515
00:28:12,099 --> 00:28:13,130
What are you up to?

516
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,400
I'm making kimchi.

517
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,970
You're making kimchi?

518
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,170
I never did it myself before,

519
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,869
but I can do anything if I try.

520
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,339
I'm going to make tasty kimchi...

521
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:22,539
and share it
with my brothers-in-law.

522
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:25,009
Who made you Wife of the Year?

523
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,779
You're now caring for
your brothers-in-law.

524
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:28,950
I should do that much
as their sister-in-law.

525
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,750
How did you stay single for so long
when marriage makes you this happy?

526
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,089
If I had known,
I would've married sooner.

527
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,960
Watch your words.

528
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,990
They could backfire on you.

529
00:28:42,059 --> 00:28:43,829
Take your own advice...

530
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,700
and don't flirt with the guys there.

531
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,329
How dare you talk to me like that?

532
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,829
I have way better things to do...

533
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:51,799
than throwing myself
at those old guys.

534
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,700
Your son-in-law
was deeply shocked earlier.

535
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,140
I broke a sweat talking him out
of having you move in with us.

536
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,240
Did he mean that?

537
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:05,180
What if he did?
Would you move in with us?

538
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:07,220
Are you insane?

539
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,019
I have too much going for me
to tiptoe around my son-in-law.

540
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:12,619
As if he'd ever
make you feel uncomfortable.

541
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,119
Hasn't he already proved that?

542
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,289
You never miss a chance
to sing your husband's praises.

543
00:29:16,289 --> 00:29:17,960
It makes my ears bleed.

544
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,200
I'm hanging up.

545
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,099
I'll bring some kimchi over
if it turns out nicely.

546
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,569
She's sulking again.

547
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:33,880
No way.

548
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:36,150
That tastes incredible.

549
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,509
My gosh.

550
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:39,980
I must've been born
to be a housewife.

551
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,549
Goodness.

552
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:43,920
It's so good.

553
00:29:53,529 --> 00:29:56,400
(Eagle Brewery)

554
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:06,079
(Eagle Brewery)

555
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,579
(Korean Traditional Business)

556
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,519
(Beom Soo)

557
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,529
(Eldest brother)

558
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,470
Hey, Jang Soo.

559
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:40,240
- Are you home?
- Yes.

560
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,480
You don't sound like
your usual self.

561
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,210
Is something up?

562
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,750
It's nothing big,

563
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:48,990
but are you free this afternoon?

564
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:50,420
Goodness.

565
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,589
I have plans
with the foundation director...

566
00:30:52,589 --> 00:30:53,890
and can't move around.

567
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,190
Why? Is it urgent?

568
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:58,289
Not really.

569
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,029
Sure.

570
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:02,099
I'll see you on Sunday
at the housewarming party.

571
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,500
Sure, Jang Soo.

572
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,190
Why are you doing this?

573
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,250
Don't stop me.

574
00:31:24,619 --> 00:31:25,720
I'm going back to Korea.

575
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,420
What about Ha Ni, then?

576
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:31,690
Ha Ni's better off with you
since you're more responsible.

577
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,500
To be honest,
I don't know if I can raise her.

578
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,730
I'm sick of the burden...

579
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:38,500
that has been laid on me!

580
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,240
Are you going to be this way?

581
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,210
Don't yell.

582
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:45,240
I wouldn't want
to escape this life...

583
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,309
if you were successful
and earned well.

584
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:49,109
What?

585
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,210
You must think...

586
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:54,250
that finally being a professor
makes up for everything.

587
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,490
No, nothing has changed.

588
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,819
I gave up my studies to support you,

589
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:02,460
and my life only involves
taking care of our baby.

590
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,029
I'm the only one who sacrificed.

591
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:07,799
Just me.

592
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:11,769
Fine. Return to school
next semester.

593
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,740
I'll look after Ha Ni.

594
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,569
I'm done with this crappy life.

595
00:32:16,569 --> 00:32:18,710
Being angry doesn't mean
you can say whatever you want.

596
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:21,339
Even those who had lower grades
and were uglier than me...

597
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,650
met wealthy men...

598
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,480
and are living in luxury.

599
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,119
Fine.

600
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:30,289
I'll quit my position
at the university...

601
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:32,859
and find a better-paying job. Okay?

602
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:34,420
That won't change anything.

603
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:36,730
I don't want to waste...

604
00:32:37,089 --> 00:32:40,299
the rest of my life
shackled to our baby!

605
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,170
A waste of your life?

606
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,339
Are you saying being with Ha Ni
and me is a waste of your life?

607
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:50,339
Na Young Eun, answer me!

608
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,779
Let me go.

609
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,079
Please let me go!

610
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:11,130
If you walk out that door,

611
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,130
you'll never be allowed back in.

612
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:16,130
Do as you wish.

613
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:35,690
How's Ha Ni?

614
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,920
- She just fell asleep.
- I see.

615
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,160
I was actually going
to take her to you.

616
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,630
When I live so close by?

617
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:46,259
I'll carry her home,
so don't worry and head out.

618
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,799
Thank you.

619
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,569
I thought Bom was a smart one,

620
00:33:53,569 --> 00:33:56,269
but her actions today
proved me wrong.

621
00:33:56,269 --> 00:33:58,839
- How clueless of her.
- Why's that?

622
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:01,480
How could she even consider setting
her dad up on a blind date?

623
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,410
Unbelievable.

624
00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:06,779
Bom set her father up
on a blind date?

625
00:34:07,619 --> 00:34:08,650
With whom?

626
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,250
Bom's professor.

627
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,960
She went the extra mile
for her lonely father.

628
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,989
How sweet of her.

629
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,929
Everything's so simple with you.

630
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,829
Once Se Ri marries into that family,

631
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,530
she'll gain a mother-in-law
that she never had before,

632
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:22,400
and her inheritance
will be cut in half.

633
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,900
Mom, you sound so materialistic.

634
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:28,699
In this day and age,
being generous and elegant...

635
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:31,610
will only lead to
getting stabbed in the back.

636
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:40,320
Anyway, it's better to eliminate
any possible threats.

637
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,190
We must stop Chairman Han
from remarrying.

638
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,019
We can't have someone else
take what's ours.

639
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:48,489
No way. Of course not!

640
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:58,230
Professor Kim's a sweet lady.

641
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,199
Ever since my first day on campus,
she's taken care of me...

642
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:02,840
like her own daughter.

643
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,539
By purchasing that painting,

644
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:06,880
I showed my appreciation enough.

645
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,880
But I need a mom.

646
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,050
Like Se Ri,

647
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,480
I want to go shopping with her,
eat nice things,

648
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,949
and go on vacations.

649
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,750
That's the life I want.

650
00:35:18,489 --> 00:35:20,090
Then get married.

651
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,030
Get married first.
Then go shopping, eat nice things,

652
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,960
and go on vacations
with your mother-in-law.

653
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,059
Dad, please.

654
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:28,730
I'll say this loud and clear.

655
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:32,099
I can't marry someone
just because you want a mother.

656
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:34,199
It's not because I need a mom.

657
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,869
You're lonely too.

658
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:38,440
The loneliness I feel...

659
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,309
can't be comforted by anyone
but your late mother.

660
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:43,909
So enough of this nonsense.

661
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:51,090
You're only wearing yourself out.

662
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:54,960
But Professor Kim is a sweetheart.

663
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:57,059
No woman could ever fill the void...

664
00:35:57,059 --> 00:36:00,699
your late mother left behind.

665
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,739
(1 unread message)

666
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:10,769
I'm outside your house.
I'll wait until you come out.

667
00:36:30,059 --> 00:36:31,860
Hey, Mr. Lee. What's the occasion?

668
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,659
I called because I felt bad
about what happened earlier today.

669
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,500
Earlier today?

670
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:39,340
Your older brother
came by the office...

671
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,239
at lunchtime.

672
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,010
Didn't he tell you?

673
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:00,719
Chun Soo.

674
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,119
Kwang Sook.

675
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:05,630
Are you on your way home?

676
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,800
I was making kimchi,
and I ran out of sugar.

677
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,130
I went to a convenience store.

678
00:37:11,969 --> 00:37:13,940
I'll give you some,
so make sure to take it with you.

679
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,610
Thank you.

680
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,679
Did Jang Soo tell you?

681
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,050
Come on.
Things like that can happen...

682
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,719
in the workplace.

683
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:29,119
As someone who has worked
as a postal worker for a long time,

684
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:31,949
I totally understand. I really do.

685
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:35,360
As long as you didn't leave
the company for something bad,

686
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,360
you can always start over again.

687
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:40,630
It's no big deal, Chun Soo.

688
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,099
Thank you.

689
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:46,269
Your brother is waiting for you
with bated breath.

690
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:47,940
Let's go in.

691
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,170
No, it's okay.

692
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,110
Come on. Let's just go.

693
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,380
Now.

694
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,239
- But...
- Hey.

695
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:55,710
Go ahead in.

696
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,429
At first,

697
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,630
I waited for things to get better.

698
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:17,230
As time went on,

699
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,469
I felt like I had to come up with
something nice...

700
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:20,840
before telling you.

701
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:24,340
I didn't mean to lie,

702
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,739
but I missed my chance to tell you.

703
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,780
I'm sorry.

704
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,380
Why are you sorry?

705
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:33,119
You're the one who's upset.

706
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:36,889
And you must've been more worried
than I was.

707
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,159
Does your wife know?

708
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,429
Not yet.

709
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:51,599
She doesn't know.

710
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:55,639
It's not just about my wife.
I don't want to worry...

711
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:57,510
my daughter who is studying abroad.

712
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,239
Move in with us.

713
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:04,579
Stay here with us.

714
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:06,079
Jang Soo.

715
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,550
That's my idea.

716
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:11,119
Kwang Sook.

717
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,960
Stay with us
until your wife comes back.

718
00:39:14,789 --> 00:39:17,190
Don't you feel lonely to be alone
in the big house?

719
00:39:17,929 --> 00:39:19,429
It will be a lot better...

720
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,530
to have someone
to eat with and talk to.

721
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:23,500
I appreciate your gesture,

722
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,530
but I'm comfortable at my place.

723
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:27,639
Why would I live with you
when you just got married?

724
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:30,469
Why? Are you afraid
you'll be jealous...

725
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:31,809
watching us being all lovey-dovey?

726
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:35,809
Well... What are you talking about?

727
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,480
Don't be prude.

728
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,550
It's not like
Jang Soo is living alone.

729
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,889
Why are you so worried
when I'm here for you?

730
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:48,690
Let's have fun
living together, okay?

731
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:51,329
Thank you for saying that.

732
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:54,360
But I feel comfortable
living alone for now.

733
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,329
If you change your mind,
let me know.

734
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,170
We will always welcome you.

735
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:03,940
Thanks, Jang Soo.

736
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,079
Thank you, Kwang Sook.

739
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:43,079
Look who's here.

740
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:45,510
It's Oh Chun Soo.

741
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,519
His face and the way he walks
are all the same as before.

742
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,559
He hasn't changed at all.

743
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,369
Welcome.

744
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:10,710

00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:25,289

who can do anything, is here!)

(Dancing Prince)

748
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,969
Are you watching Dancing Prince?

749
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,969
Yes! This is for the subscribers
of Dancing Prince.

750
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:44,340
He's the originator
of Korean hip-hop.

751
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,079
It was "You in Vague Memory"
by Hyun Jin Young.

752
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:47,610
Good. We are getting
a lot of comments.

753
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:48,739
That's what I did.

754
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,750
My goodness. Hang on!

755
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:55,420
Sol Yi's Mom sent a donation.

756
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,650
(1 dollar has been donated.)

757
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:59,559
Yes! A dollar...

758
00:42:00,489 --> 00:42:01,989
Thank you!

759
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,929
A dollar...

760
00:42:04,429 --> 00:42:06,360
The next song is...

761
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,760
"Eve's Warning" by Park Mi Kyung!

762
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,880
If you're not careful about this,

763
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,320
you might lose your hearing
down the road.

764
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,190
Is it that bad?

765
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,860
You're not in the worst stage,

766
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,630
but you should avoid
intense diving activities.

767
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:53,079
(Pot Number)

768
00:43:05,389 --> 00:43:06,760
What are you doing here?

769
00:43:09,159 --> 00:43:10,690
Listening to the alcohol ripening,

770
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:12,929
I was organizing my thoughts.

771
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,269
Listening to the alcohol ripening?

772
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,199
Come here.

773
00:43:21,869 --> 00:43:22,940
Sit.

774
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:27,010
Close your eyes
and listen carefully.

775
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:39,389
What?

776
00:43:40,489 --> 00:43:41,789
It sounds like rain.

777
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:44,960
Right.

778
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:47,559
That's the sound
of alcohol ripening.

779
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,369
My gosh.

780
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:52,230
How interesting.

781
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:02,440
By the way, I smell apples.

782
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,179
My gosh, you're unbelievable.

783
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:10,449
Well-fermented makgeolli
has an apple-like aroma.

784
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:11,889
My goodness.

785
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:17,690
I'm enjoying the scent of apples...

786
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:20,530
and the sound of rain.

787
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,469
I feel like I'm in paradise.

788
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:30,239
This is why you make makgeolli.

789
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,010
Do you want to make one yourself?

790
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:40,320
Me?

791
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:43,190
How many times should I wash this?

792
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:44,650
A hundred times.

793
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:49,320
You're kidding, right?

794
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:55,730
Okay.

795
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:58,369
Let's do it together.

796
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,340
Just as each household has
different tastes...

797
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,610
of sauces and kimchi,

798
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,639
Eagle Brewery has
its own unique makgeolli flavor.

799
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:11,349
We pursue
a natural taste of liquor...

800
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:13,079
without any additives.

801
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,519
Natural is the best.

802
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,260
Our makgeolli is made
with natural bedrock water...

803
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,059
that has been used
since my grandfather's time.

804
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:24,659
It is really refreshing.

805
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:25,690
Yes.

806
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,699
And we only use
the highest-quality Gyeonggi rice.

807
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:48,949
And you should take good care of it.

808
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:50,889
You have to look at it...

809
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:53,289
and monitor it often,
just like caring for a newborn baby.

810
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,340
By the way, Jang Soo.

811
00:46:13,909 --> 00:46:15,480
Become delicious.

812
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:17,880
What should we name this makgeolli?

813
00:46:18,349 --> 00:46:19,380
I don't know.

814
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,650
How about Jang-Kwang liquor?

815
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,449
Jang-Kwang liquor?

816
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,889
Liquor made by Jang Soo
and Kwang Sook.

817
00:46:26,889 --> 00:46:28,420
Jang-Kwang liquor.

818
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:29,690
That sounds nice.

819
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:33,500
Jang-Kwang liquor. This is amazing.

820
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:42,800

822
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:50,349
I love how easy it is to get to work
thanks to my hubby.

823
00:46:51,079 --> 00:46:52,650
I'm glad I got married.

824
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:56,590
I'll come by later to pick you up.

825
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,989
You don't have to when you're busy.

826
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:00,559
It's a short bus ride.

827
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:02,389
I want to drive you.

828
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,989
Okay then.

829
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,199
If it's my husband's wish,
I'm forced to grant it.

830
00:47:09,699 --> 00:47:11,030
See you at 6 p.m. sharp.

831
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:13,869
Wait.

832
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:18,840
You may get out now.

833
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,239
Thank you.

834
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,409
Honey.

835
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,219
I have to go to Ganghwa Island.

836
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,949
Why go to Ganghwa Island?

837
00:47:30,289 --> 00:47:33,219
There's a festival to celebrate
the opening of a new sashimi center.

838
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,289
They ordered 100 crates.

839
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,590
My mom's fortune teller said...

840
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,630
she saw bunches of money
hanging from me.

841
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,199
That must be true.

842
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,869
You're getting lots of orders
since you married me.

843
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:48,269
You're right.
You'll make me rich in no time.

844
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:52,469
On the way there,

845
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:54,980
I'll meet with Beom Soo
and talk to him.

846
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:58,880
We should do something
about Chun Soo.

847
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,550
When you go to see Beom Soo,

848
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:04,250
take some kimchi that I made.

849
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,460
It's on the second shelf
in the fridge.

850
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:08,619
Okay.

851
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:11,989
I hope he likes my kimchi.

852
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,699
My brothers aren't picky.
They'll eat anything.

853
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:16,130
Don't worry too much.

854
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,599
Wait. Are you saying...

855
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,239
my kimchi doesn't taste great?

856
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:23,539
No.

857
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:26,480
It's not that.

858
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:32,510
You're cutest when you're flustered.

859
00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:36,449
I was kidding. It was a joke.

860
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:40,889
Go on inside.
You might be late for work.

861
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:47,329
We were stuck together for ten days.

862
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:50,869
It feels weird to say goodbye.

863
00:48:51,469 --> 00:48:52,570
It does.

864
00:48:53,699 --> 00:48:55,099
I'm not used to it either.

865
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:00,210
Even if you miss me, bear with it...

866
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:01,780
and work hard.

867
00:49:02,809 --> 00:49:04,280
And eat a good lunch.

868
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:06,719
- Yes, ma'am.
- See you later.

Goodness.

Everything's stacked already?

873
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,239
Yes. We're done.

874
00:49:36,809 --> 00:49:38,150
Shall we have a coffee?

875
00:49:38,309 --> 00:49:40,449
I'll drop by Beom Soo's
on the way...

876
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:42,179
to give him this.

877
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,750
I see you're busy.

878
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:47,860
- Drive safely.
- I will.

00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:14,980
Oh, dear.

883
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,250
You just woke up?

884
00:50:18,349 --> 00:50:20,119
Don't cry.

886

You will be charged.

887

Is he not home?

888
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,599
Should I leave it with security?

889
00:50:33,539 --> 00:50:34,699
Isn't that Beom Soo?

890

892
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,880
Kwang Sook told me
to bring you some kimchi,

893
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,309
and I had something
to discuss with you.

894
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,550
So I dropped by on a makgeolli run.

895
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:51,849
So...

896
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,519
whose baby is that?

897
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,329
It's mine.

898
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:01,800
What?

899
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:05,199
It's whose baby?

900
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:09,670
She's mine.

901
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,909
So what?

902
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:20,349
Without a word to me,
you got married...

903
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,119
and had the baby?

904
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,519
There was no wedding ceremony.

905
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:25,690
We'd put that off
until I got my degree...

906
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:27,320
- and we'd settled down.
- But what?

907
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,559
You got your degree
and settled down.

908
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:31,329
Why did you break up?

909
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,900
So much happened at the same time.

910
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:36,670
We couldn't handle it.

911
00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:38,969
You should've told me anyway.

912
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:45,809
Where's the mom?

913
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:47,710
We haven't talked since.

914
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:51,780
I can't believe a mom
could leave her newborn,

915
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:54,480
and I can't believe
you decided to raise the baby alone.

916
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:57,190
You're my own brother,
and I'm lost for words.

917
00:51:58,619 --> 00:51:59,989
I'm sorry, Jang Soo.

918
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,260
They say professors have
flexible schedules,

919
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:05,760
but that doesn't mean
you can raise a baby alone.

920
00:52:06,699 --> 00:52:09,130
A superior from my previous job...

921
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:10,900
is retired and lives in this area.

922
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:12,869
- His wife...
- She'll babysit?

923
00:52:13,239 --> 00:52:14,239
Yes.

924
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:16,909
We're done talking. Move in with me.

925
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:19,110
I can't do that.

926
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,710
Why not?

927
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,039
You've been married
for just ten days.

928
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,909
I can't move in with a newborn.

929
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:27,019
If I explain the situation,
your sister-in-law...

930
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,449
will welcome you wholeheartedly.

931
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:29,820
It's not right.

932
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:32,420
Don't complain. Do as I say.

933
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,789
Jang Soo.

934
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:37,559
Chun Soo and then you too.

935
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,699
How could you
deceive me so completely?

936
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:43,369
I might not be as educated as you,

937
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,099
but I'm your older brother.

938
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,199
How could you do this to me?

939
00:52:52,739 --> 00:52:55,539
Hey, Ha Ni. You woke up?

940
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:59,010
No, it's okay.

941
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:00,920
Daddy's here.

942
00:53:01,079 --> 00:53:03,320
Ha Ni. I know.

943
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,150
It's okay.

944
00:53:06,789 --> 00:53:07,860
It's your uncle.

945
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,519
Say hi.

00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:17,030

948
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,409
Hey.

949
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:26,170
You're new to the class, right?

950
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:28,980
Yes. Allow me to officially
introduce myself.

951
00:53:32,579 --> 00:53:34,980
I'm Ji Ok Bun.

952
00:53:38,289 --> 00:53:39,420

955
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:46,059
You're a hairstylist.

956
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,260
Yes.

957
00:53:48,329 --> 00:53:51,000
Come by one day.
I'll treat you well.

958
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:54,699
My specialty is cutting men's hair.

959
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:56,809
I see.

960
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:59,010
I'll drop by if I'm free.

961
00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:00,739
By the way,

962
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,679
I have a reservation-only system.

963
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:07,519
Please make an appointment
for a certain date and time.

964
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:08,719
Okay.

965
00:54:11,389 --> 00:54:12,550
Right now?

966
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:15,659
Right now.

967
00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:19,460
I have such a packed schedule.

968
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,630
I need to see when I'm free.

969
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,260
Right now.

970
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,530
Right now?

971
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:26,570
Okay, then.

972
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,539
Let's see.

973
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:31,510
Excuse me.

974
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:33,710
Hello, Jang Soo.

975
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:35,480
Are you hiding something
from me too?

976
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,210
Why would you suddenly ask me that?

977
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,219
Are you keeping secrets from me too?

978
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:43,989
Do you think I'm the type to lie?

979
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:46,219
Did someone lie to you?

980
00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:48,159
Whatever. Let's talk another time.

981
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,159
You can't just bring it up
and not say anything.

982
00:54:51,289 --> 00:54:53,960
Does Kwang Sook have
a crippling past?

983
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:55,860
Maybe she had a child
out of wedlock or...

984
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,699
Cut it out and get back to work.

985
00:54:57,769 --> 00:54:58,769
I'm hanging up.

986
00:55:03,909 --> 00:55:05,039
Hello?

987
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:07,409
What was that about?

988
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:10,210
When are you free?

989
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:13,780
Do I have to make an appointment?

990
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,619
Right now.

991
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:20,389
How about a light lunch
of janchi guksu, Ms. Ma?

992
00:55:20,389 --> 00:55:22,090
That sounds great.

993
00:55:22,289 --> 00:55:23,460
Let's go.

994
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:25,329
Hang on.

995
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:27,429
It's the wedding dress shop.

996
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:30,869
Hello. What's the occasion?

997
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:33,329
I called because there's a problem.

998
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:35,369
What problem?

999
00:55:35,369 --> 00:55:38,940
I waited to call to avoid
disrupting your honeymoon.

1000
00:55:39,269 --> 00:55:41,110
Your dress was damaged.

1001
00:55:41,309 --> 00:55:43,139
The dress was damaged?

1002
00:55:43,449 --> 00:55:45,280
The tail hem was torn.

1003
00:55:46,650 --> 00:55:47,750
What?

1004
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,119
Sorry.

1005
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:57,989
How much will the repair cost?

1006
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:00,760
Did you say 2,000 dollars?

1007
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:05,699
I get it for now.
I'll call you back.

1008
00:56:10,369 --> 00:56:12,769
I'm sorry,
but have lunch without me.

1009
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,510
I need to be somewhere urgent.

1010
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:15,710
- Ms. Ma?
- Ms. Ma!

1011
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:22,480
Thank you.

1012
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:28,289
I was hoping to watch
your security footage.

1013
00:56:28,289 --> 00:56:30,059
What is this regarding?

1014
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:32,860
On the Saturday before last,

1015
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,829
I got married at this hotel.

1016
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:36,500
Right, I see.

1017
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,829
This middle-aged man stepped on...

1018
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:41,369
my wedding dress
in front of the elevator.

1019
00:56:41,369 --> 00:56:43,539
I think that's when it got torn.

1020
00:56:44,139 --> 00:56:47,710
It's urgent that I track him down.

1021
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:51,809
Hold on. Stop!

1022
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:54,750
That's right. It's him.

1023
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,090
Isn't that our chairman?

1024
00:56:57,550 --> 00:56:58,690
I think so.

1025
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:00,619
Do you know him?

1026
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:04,989
No, I don't.

1027
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,500
Get me a copy of that footage.

1028
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:14,239
You're busted.

1029
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:24,679
Hold on.
Where can I find this guy though?

1030
00:57:25,349 --> 00:57:27,050
Should I contact the police?

1031
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,829
My gosh.

1032
00:57:38,159 --> 00:57:39,730
He's here once again.

1033
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,139
I'm sure you remember me.

1034
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:54,309
On the Saturday before last,

1035
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:56,480
we met in the elevator.

1036
00:57:58,579 --> 00:58:01,019
You must have the wrong person.

1037
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:04,750
What do you mean,
"the wrong person?"

1038
00:58:04,889 --> 00:58:06,190
You're definitely him.

1039
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,659
Do you really not remember me?

1040
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,429
You do remember me,

1041
00:58:11,429 --> 00:58:12,760
but you're feigning ignorance...

1042
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,699
because you know
you're guilty of something.

1043
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,070
I don't quite follow.

1044
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,599
On the Saturday before last,
about 10 minutes to 12 p.m.,

1045
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:23,570
we met in the elevator.

1046
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:27,679
You stepped on the tail of my dress.

1047
00:58:40,289 --> 00:58:41,460
The gimbap lady.

1048
00:58:43,159 --> 00:58:45,030
That's right. The gimbap lady.

1049
00:58:47,059 --> 00:58:48,099
You remember now.

1050
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:51,070
I guess I somewhat recall you.

1051
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:53,469
Right here,

1052
00:58:53,469 --> 00:58:55,199
you stepped on my dress,

1053
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:57,739
and the hem got torn.

1054
00:58:57,739 --> 00:58:59,440
I don't remember that.

1055
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,139
Come on. I know that you do.

1056
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:05,050
Anyway, I was charged
2,000 dollars for damages.

1057
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:07,250
That's 2,000.

1058
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:11,150
So?

1059
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:13,860
"So?" You need to pay for it.

1060
00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:16,760
I never did such a thing.

1061
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,559
No, no.

1062
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:23,360
That's not how
a gentleman should act.

1063
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:24,829
I have footage...

1064
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,039
of you committing the crime
in my hand.

1065
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:29,469
Committing a crime?

1066
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:34,809
Are you accusing me of a crime?

1068
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:44,949
Press one for voicemail...

1069
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:48,289
and press two
to leave a contact number.

1070
00:59:50,489 --> 00:59:53,360
You must be in training
since you didn't pick up.

1071
00:59:55,659 --> 00:59:56,900
I hope you haven't forgotten...

1072
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,030
that we're gathering on Sunday
at Beom Soo's.

1073
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,139
My baby brother,

1074
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:06,269
I should be looking out
for you more.

1075
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:09,210
I'm sorry about that.

1076
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:13,250
See you on Sunday.

1077
01:00:14,619 --> 01:00:15,920
Your message has been recorded.

1078
01:00:22,889 --> 01:00:23,989
Seriously?

(Eagle Brewery)

1081
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:21,019
I can't believe
you followed me all the way here.

1082
01:01:22,449 --> 01:01:24,789
I'm just as busy.

1083
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:28,860
Check the footage
and pay for the damages.

1084
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:36,800
If you were innocent,
you wouldn't avoid me, mister!

1085
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:41,400
Stop calling me mister, will you?

1086
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:48,010
I don't know your name
or anything else about you,

1087
01:01:48,010 --> 01:01:49,139
so what should I call you?

1088
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:50,409
Is there anything better
than "mister?"

1089
01:01:50,409 --> 01:01:51,449
Look here,

1090
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:53,309
lady.

1091
01:01:53,449 --> 01:01:54,519
Yes?

1092
01:01:56,019 --> 01:01:57,289
Hand that flash drive over.

1093
01:01:57,289 --> 01:01:58,719
I'll check the footage
and contact you.

1094
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:01,289
Are you kidding me?

1095
01:02:01,989 --> 01:02:03,829
As if I could trust you.

1096
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:05,989
- What?
- You tore my dress...

1097
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:07,829
and then feigned ignorance.

1098
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:11,130
How can I trust
that you'd actually call me?

1099
01:02:18,269 --> 01:02:19,570
Yes, hello?

1100
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:23,010
Are you Oh Jang Soo's next of kin?

1101
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:26,510
Yes, I'm his wife.

1102
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:28,550
What is this about?

1103
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:36,590
Where?

1104
01:02:58,179 --> 01:02:59,280
That woman...

1105
01:03:01,150 --> 01:03:02,320
What's with her?

1106
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:19,099
(Operating Room)

1107
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:40,019
Chun Soo...

1108
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:42,789
Kwang Sook.

1109
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:45,989
What about Jang Soo?

1110
01:03:48,429 --> 01:03:50,199
He was just taken in for surgery.

1111
01:03:53,469 --> 01:03:54,840
It's not bad, is it?

1112
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:57,170
He'll be okay after the surgery.

1113
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,820

1114
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:14,260
Victory.

1115
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:16,119
Victory.

1116
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:17,559
Your eldest brother
was in a car accident...

1117
01:04:17,559 --> 01:04:18,590
and is in critical condition.

1118
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:20,900
- What?
- You couldn't be reached,

1119
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:23,159
so your second brother
called the administration office.

1120
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:29,039
(Emergency Room)

1121
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:33,309
Beom Soo!

1122
01:04:34,010 --> 01:04:35,280
Heung Soo.

(Surgery Waiting Room)

1124
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:50,960
- Chun Soo.
- Hey.

1125
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,360
Kwang Sook.

1126
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:54,630
Is he still in surgery?

1127
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,230
He was just taken in,

1128
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:57,570
but I think it'll take a while.

1129
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:05,510
He'll be all right, Kwang Sook.

1130
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,809
He'll be okay, right?

1131
01:05:11,849 --> 01:05:13,309
Nothing will happen.

1132
01:05:17,789 --> 01:05:19,119

(Surgery Waiting Room)

1134
01:05:29,329 --> 01:05:30,360
Is the surgery...

1135
01:05:31,769 --> 01:05:33,329
over already?

1136
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:46,150
I'm sorry, but Mr. Oh Jang Soo...

1137
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:49,880
didn't make it.

1138
01:06:07,269 --> 01:06:09,670
(Surgery Waiting Room)

1139
01:06:43,639 --> 01:06:44,710
Jang Soo.

1140
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:49,480
Jang Soo.

1141
01:06:58,489 --> 01:07:00,250
Kwang Sook!

for his special appearance.)

(For Eagle Brothers)

1144
01:07:50,469 --> 01:07:51,869
Get a grip, you brat.

1145
01:07:51,869 --> 01:07:53,210
You'll live as a widow...

1146
01:07:53,309 --> 01:07:56,739
and rot away in this house
for the rest of your life?

1147
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,849
Don't you know you can't take back
a card you played?

1148
01:07:59,010 --> 01:08:01,219
I'm not the one who's rude. You are.

1149
01:08:01,219 --> 01:08:02,550
Will you stop it?

1150
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,349
I'll say it clearly...

1151
01:08:04,449 --> 01:08:06,190
right into your ear.

1152
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:08,590
That I love you...

1153
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:10,590
so very much.

1154
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:12,159
What's this?

1155
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:13,659
This is what's right for you.

1156
01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:16,100
It'll only become harder to leave.

1157
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:17,300
Pack your things.
