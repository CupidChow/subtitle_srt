1
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:03,510
(Episode 16)

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:06,850
Look here, Ms. Ma.

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,980
He is...

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,160
Are you kidding me, Ms. Ma?

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,960
All that laughing
brought tears to my eyes.

6
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:26,560
How is this something
to laugh about?

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,670
I guess it's not,

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:31,900
but it's so ridiculous
that I can't help it.

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,140
He was...

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,950
the postmaster
at my old workplace...

11
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,610
before I got married.

12
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:44,720
After his daughter gave birth,

13
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,650
she stayed with her parents
for postnatal care.

14
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,490
The whole family was
at the hotel to relax,

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,890
and I was on my way up
to greet them all.

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,890
His daughter's name
is Park Soo Yeon.

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,560
Confirm it if you don't believe me.

18
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,000
Room 1512, Park Soo Yeon.

19
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,170
The reservation is probably
under her name.

20
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,740
Then, why were you
talking about money?

21
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,010
Money?

22
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,580
Let me know if you need more money.

23
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:13,550
I'll try to make it happen again.

24
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:16,950
I'm grateful enough
for your assistance before.

25
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:18,750
It's not like we're strangers.

26
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:21,650
How else can I help you
if not with your financial problems?

27
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,090
You're the best.

28
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,990
I needed money
when taking over the brewery,

29
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,730
and the postmaster granted my loan.

30
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,900
He knows my situation,

31
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,030
so that was him offering
to help out again.

32
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,670
Are you happy now?

33
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,810
I don't know why
I need to explain myself like this,

34
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,010
but now that I
have explained it all,

35
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,850
whether you think of me
as a gold digger or not...

36
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,080
is entirely...

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,220
up to you.

38
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,000
(Somang Hall)

39
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,940
I never thought
I'd be treated like this.

40
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,240
What does he take me for?

41
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,680
(Eagle Brewery)

42
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,710
Darn, that hurts.

43
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,070
Yes, sir.

44
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,440
It's me, Mr. Park.

45
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
Well,

46
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,650
I'd like you to look into something.

47
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,520
I don't care if he's a chairman.

48
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,090
He has no right
calling me a gold digger.

49
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,260
Unbelievable.

50
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,030
It frustrates me
the more I think about it.

51
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:11,560
Contract or no contract,
I should've slapped him...

52
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,200
across the face.

53
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,210
Hello. Ok Bun, is it?

54
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,480
Are you free to talk?

55
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,940
Of course.

56
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,650
Do you have new evidence?

57
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,750
The private detective is gathering
whatever information he can...

58
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,050
from the neighborhood
where Ms. Kim...

59
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,920
ran her piano academy ten years ago.

60
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,120
I'm sure
we'll get good news pretty soon.

61
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,290
Could the photo we saw
have been fabricated?

62
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,530
Ms. Ma, come on.

63
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,430
Who'd bother to fabricate
such a photo?

64
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,300
Oh, right. That reminds me.

65
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,470
I even saw the little girl
that's most likely her daughter.

66
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,770
Really?

67
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,280
We'll soon have heaps
of irrefutable evidence.

68
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,250
How dare she try to fool
my brother-in-law?

69
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,420
If this is true,
I won't let it slide.

70
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,950
I'll teach her a lesson
in a way that'll shut her up!

71
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,890
It seems as though
you and I see eye to eye.

72
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,990
Can I call you Kwang Sook
from now on?

73
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,890
Sure thing, Kwang Sook.

74
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,930
I'll call you again
once I have more to tell you.

75
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,400
Sure. Have a good day.

76
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,640
You're here.

77
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,080
I heard you quit
the Zumba dance class.

78
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,740
Oh, that.

79
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,580
I'm busy at the salon
and have too much to do.

80
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,750
That's just one of many reasons.

81
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,150
In fact, it's not like
you have any weight to lose.

82
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,690
Oh, please.

83
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,550
All right.

84
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,490
How was the rummage sale?

85
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,960
I set one up to raise money
for volunteer work at the prison,

86
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,300
and many people participated
since it was for a good cause.

87
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,100
You volunteer even at a prison?

88
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,970
I do. Once a month.

89
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,870
That reminds me.

90
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:02,510
While volunteering
at Uijeongbu Prison last week,

91
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,940
I ran into Ms. Kim.

92
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,680
Ms. Kim who runs the piano academy?

93
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,710
That's right.

94
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,050
Her friend must've been
falsely imprisoned.

95
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,150
She was on her way out
from visiting,

96
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,920
and she must've cried
her eyes out...

97
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,790
because her eyes were bloodshot.

98
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,960
They were like those of a rabbit.

99
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,960
Wait.

100
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,690
I'll be right back
after making a quick phone call.

101
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,760
Okay.

102
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,540
- Hello?
- It's me, Detective.

103
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,840
Please look into Uijeongbu Prison.

104
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,880
It seems like someone important
related to Ms. Kim...

105
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,680
is imprisoned there.

106
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,090
It's unbelievable.

107
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,190
Not only did she
sponge off Chun Soo,

108
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,930
but she even cheated on him.

109
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,290
And yet she held her head high
and raised her voice?

110
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:00,830
She's not our sister-in-law,
and she's not even a human being.

111
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,930
I also found it hard
to believe at first.

112
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,170
Anyway, it's Chun Soo
who's hurting the most right now.

113
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,710
Let's be careful with what we say,
considering his situation.

114
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,710
We shouldn't just sit back
and watch it like this.

115
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,150
What can we do about it?

116
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,980
- If I could, I'd just...
- What would you do?

117
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,050
I'm just saying this
because I'm upset.

118
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,030
By the way,

119
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,960
she's the one at fault.

120
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,030
It's not right to divorce her
while giving her all the alimony.

121
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,340
But there's Yeoung Ju.

122
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,080
To be honest, I have this suspicion.

123
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,920
Can we be sure that
Yeoung Ju is Chun Soo's daughter?

124
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,980
I don't believe a word she says.

125
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,990
- Come on!
- Come on!

126
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,150
She suddenly showed up
and said she was pregnant.

127
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,560
That's how they got married.

128
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,230
I thought...

129
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,530
he'd marry Mi Sun.

130
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,500
- Mi Sun?
- Yes.

131
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,070
The two had always been together
since they were little, you know.

132
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,510
I thought they were just friends.

133
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,340
Was it in middle school
or high school?

134
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,880
I took a peek
at Chun Soo's diary one day.

135
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,350
He had a big crush on Mi Sun.

136
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,310
It was 30 years ago.

137
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,780
If Chun Soo had married Mi Sun,

138
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,890
he wouldn't have turned out
this way.

139
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,290
Chun Soo wouldn't act on
dark thoughts, would he?

140
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,330
Hey!

141
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,300
Why would you say that?

142
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,230
I don't think he would,

143
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,430
but he rarely expresses
his feelings...

144
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,000
and often carries grudges.

145
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,340
So I'm a little worried
that he'd explode one day.

146
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,340
We should call him often.

147
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,910
We should visit him a lot
and see how he's doing.

148
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,910
We should help him
unleash his emotional baggage.

149
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,280
That's the only thing we can do.

150
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,990
Kang Soo, go ahead and unjinx it.

151
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,150
Say you take it back.

152
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,920
Go ahead and do it.

153
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,060
I take it back.

154
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,060
I haven't slept a wink...

155
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,800
for the past three days.

156
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,530
For three days?

157
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,270
Yes.

158
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,570
I've been awake for three days.

159
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,670
I couldn't sleep even for a second.

160
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,710
Even when my eyelids get heavy
and I close my eyes,

161
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,040
I can't fall asleep.

162
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,110
Have you been shocked
or stressed out recently?

163
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,850
I had a big fight...

164
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,520
with my wife.

165
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,800
These are sleeping pills.

166
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,670
You can't increase the dosage
just because you can't fall asleep.

167
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,940
Take only 1 pill
30 minutes before going to bed.

168
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,170
Okay. I will.

169
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,180
(Wife)

170
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,020
What's the matter?

171
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,320
Where are you?

172
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,520
Let's meet up.

173
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,220
I have no reason to see you.

174
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,720
And I have nothing to say to you.

175
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,660
Come on, Chun Soo.

176
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,400
Don't leave Yeoung Ju alone.
You should go back to the States.

177
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,360
Do you want me to go back like this?

178
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,630
Without concluding anything?

179
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,970
I told you.

180
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,370
I can't give you
the conclusion you want.

181
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,210
Do whatever you want in the States,
whether it's cheating or whatever.

182
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,080
I don't care.

183
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,780
But I will never get a divorce.

184
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,750
Being stubborn
won't resolve anything.

185
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:38,180
I'll keep paying for...

186
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,550
Yeoung Ju's tuition
and living expenses.

187
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,220
Just be a good mother to her.

188
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,020
There is nothing else
I want from you other than that.

189
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,840
Hello, Mr. Park.

190
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,810
Here's an update
on your instructions.

191
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:08,750
The person who reserved
Junior Suite Room 1512...

192
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,010
is named Park Soo Yeon.

193
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,780
Three adults and a newborn baby
stayed in the room.

194
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,190
It seems like they were a family.

195
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,850
Okay.

196
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,720
Thank you.

197
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,640
(Eagle Brewery Unrefined Makgeolli)

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,140
You're back.

199
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,310
- Nothing happened, right?
- No.

200
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,910
Oh, right. A visitor just came here
looking for you.

201
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,050
- A visitor?
- Yes.

202
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,410
Your mother took him to the annex.

203
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,430
Gosh.

204
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,530
I apologize for showing up
unannounced like this.

205
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,770
You don't have to apologize.

206
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,070
You're always welcome.

207
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,270
My gosh.

208
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,240
Please drop the honorifics, Mother.

209
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,710
You can just think of me
as your son.

210
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,410
My son?

211
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,950
Did I go too far?

212
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,480
You are the youngest brother-in-law
of Dr. Lee.

213
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,720
You are like my son.

214
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,020
Thank you for saying that.

215
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,560
I'll be your son for the time being,

216
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
but hopefully,

217
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,060
I'll soon become your son-in-law.

218
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,130
How sweet.

219
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:38,040
You sound
so straightforward and assertive.

220
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,900
Mother!

221
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,340
I'm home...

222
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,850
Mr. Park Sang Nam,
what are you doing here?

223
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,790
Why would you sound so tactless?

224
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,390
What do you think he's here for?

225
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,190
I came here to see you.

226
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:04,860
Can we talk outside?

227
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,360
If you have anything to say,
say it here.

228
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,470
Have a seat.

229
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,700
Come on out.

230
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,640
Please excuse me
for a second, Mother.

231
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:23,780
That darn brat!

232
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,190
(Live brightly, have a broad mind,
and have big hopes.)

233
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,690
You can't be unilateral like this.

234
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,970
I made myself clear
that I didn't want to get remarried.

235
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,000
I made myself clear as well...

236
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,700
that I don't want to rush things,
so we can stay friends.

237
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,870
You just don't understand
what I'm saying.

238
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,040
I have no intention...

239
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,680
of being friends with you...

240
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,280
at all.

241
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:02,220
I will be friends with you
no matter what.

242
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,220
What?

243
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,520
I figured it would be difficult...

244
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,260
to meet someone
as precious as you again.

245
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:11,660
I don't want to lose you.

246
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,830
I think you're mistaken.

247
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,630
I'm not the kind of person...

248
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,300
you think I am.

249
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:23,670
Your sincere feelings
for your late husband are precious.

250
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,340
And your hard work
to run the brewery...

251
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,310
of your husband is precious too.

252
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,180
You are a truly precious person
who is hard to find...

253
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,120
in today's world.

254
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,120
Whatever.

255
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:42,430
Please stop coming here
unannounced like this.

256
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:43,860
It makes me uncomfortable.

257
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,760
If you keep being like this,

258
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,940
it will only make me
more enthusiastic.

259
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,340
What?

260
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,210
Since I was little,
I have had this habit...

261
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,410
of wanting to do something even more
when someone tells me not to.

262
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,250
You just lit a fire
of determination...

263
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,120
in the heart of Park Sang Nam.

264
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
My gosh.

265
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,390
I'm making dinner.

266
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,230
It's not much,
but stay for dinner, Sang Nam.

267
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:15,860
Mom!

268
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,560
What? Why?

269
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,730
Please leave.

270
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,870
It is impolite
to send away a guest...

271
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,440
who visited us during mealtime
without offering him a meal.

272
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,440
You can stay, can't you?

273
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,040
Of course, I can.

274
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,440
Do you like doenjang jjigae?

275
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,210
I can't get enough of it.

276
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:37,210
We have similar tastes in food.

277
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,380
Mom!

278
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,750
He's my guest,
so mind your own business.

279
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,290
It's not much,

280
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,120
but have dinner with me.

281
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,190
Sure, Mother!

282
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,760
What's with them?

283
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:56,100
You're home.

284
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,470
Your dinner is ready, sir.

285
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,010
No. I don't feel like eating dinner.

286
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,470
Are you not feeling well?

287
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,580
I'm still kind of full from lunch.

288
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,280
Can you get me some headache pills?

289
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,680
Do you have a headache?

290
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,250
No, it's not bad. Thank you.

291
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,550
All right.

292
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,790
The chairman
hasn't been feeling well lately.

293
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,260
You're right.

294
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,760
Come in.

295
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,870
Some painkillers.

296
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,330
Yes, thanks.

297
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,940
Are you having trouble at work?

298
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,010
No. Why?

299
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,910
You've been looking grumpy...

300
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,650
and a bit down recently.

301
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:46,720
Why would I have any trouble
at work?

302
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,490
Nothing's wrong, so don't worry.

303
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,460
Good, then.

304
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,730
I need to think
and would like to be alone.

305
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:56,930
Okay. I'll let you rest.

306
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,140
I was too rash.

307
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,480
Why would someone as cautious...

308
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,280
and perfect as me make that mistake?

309
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,030
Welcome home.

310
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,930
I trust you had a great day,

311
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:32,900
- Chairman.
- Chairman.

312
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,900
This is what gives me
the will to live.

313
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,310
I give it my all
in that battlefield called "work"...

314
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,240
for you and Se Ri.

315
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,310
Do you know that?

316
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,910
I do.

317
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,980
You're in a good mood today.

318
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,290
You bet I am.

319
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,720
Ta-da.

320
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:58,890
(Sorabol's Moonlit Night)

321
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,360
Is that our new product?

322
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,790
I rushed home
as soon as I got off...

323
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,800
so you could have a taste.

324
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,430
Gather in the kitchen!

325
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,600
Your dad's on a high.

326
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,580
This is called...

327
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,210
Sorabol's Moonlit Night.

328
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:23,450
Here we go.

329
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,720
For you, Se Ri.

330
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,730
For my darling Mi Ae.

331
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,760
Sorabol's Moonlit Night.

332
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,670
Isn't it lovely?

333
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,330
- It is.
- It is.

334
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,780
What do you think?

335
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,940
It's nice and sweet.

336
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,650
Right?

337
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,720
But I don't know makgeolli.

338
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,220
That's strange.

339
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:05,690
What is?

340
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:08,330
It doesn't taste like
what you brought home last time.

341
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:13,330
That was a working prototype.

342
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,700
We improved on that
and made this new product.

343
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,140
I prefer the other one.

344
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:21,000
What?

345
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:25,440
That tasted luxurious
without being sweet.

346
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,810
I don't think
the additives are mixed well.

347
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:32,180
It's as if
all the ingredients are separate.

348
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,720
You don't know enough
to criticize our product!

349
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,990
My gosh.

350
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,960
Why did you yell?

351
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,890
Your husband
slaved away all day long...

352
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,960
and instead of stroking his ego,

353
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,560
all you think about...

354
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,900
is what you can do
to spend more money.

355
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,300
And you put me down!

356
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,700
What do you do all day long?

357
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,870
What do you do at home?

358
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,770
What got into you?

359
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,740
Mom. Stop it.

360
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,210
Calm down, Dad.

361
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,680
You ruined my mood.

362
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:09,720
Don't drink this!

363
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,890
What's wrong with him?

364
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,760
What did I say
that got him so upset?

365
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,760
Don't.

366
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,300
My goodness.

367
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,070
I thought my ears would bleed.

368
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:38,020
These will suit Ha Ni perfectly.

369
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,790
(Kimchi Jjigae and Pork Belly)

370
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,920
Goodbye.

371
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,390
I'm in a weird mood.

372
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,590
Can we go somewhere
for another drink?

373
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,230
Let's call it a day.

374
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,430
I have to pick up Ha Ni.

375
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,930
I'm not in the mood for a drink.

376
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,840
Poor Chun Soo.

377
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,910
I can't handle the situation
unless I have another drink.

378
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,640
Let's have just one more.

379
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,550
Instead of making up excuses
to drink, go home.

380
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,450
You're so inconsiderate.

381
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,690
Don't call Chun Soo drunk
and say something weird.

382
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,220
He must be
distraught enough already.

383
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,320
How dare you?

384
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,990
I'm the older brother here.

385
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,060
You're always lecturing me.

386
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,900
I can tell what not to do.

387
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,930
I'm afraid to get married.

388
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:35,670
Chun Soo and you too, Beom Soo.

389
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,110
Your marriages failed.

390
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,710
Who am I to meet, trust and marry?

391
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,710
There are people like Kwang Sook.

392
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,180
Let's be honest.

393
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,080
Women like her
are fewer than 0.1 percent.

394
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,120
Jang Soo was lucky.

395
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,620
Yes.

396
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,490
The 0.1 percent.

397
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,820
I'll be like Jang Soo...

398
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,160
and find someone
that falls in that 0.1 percent.

399
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,170
What?

400
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,840
You've been acting suspiciously.

401
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,700
Are you dating?

402
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:11,040
The smart ones catch on faster.

403
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,110
- See?
- For real?

404
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,450
Just you wait.

405
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,350
I'll introduce her to you properly.

406
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,150
Gosh.

407
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,490
Let's have another drink.

408
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,550
Bye.

409
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,820
- Hey.
- Wait for me.

410
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,430
(Pot Number 4)

411
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,730
You care about being dignified,

412
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:33,530
and you're being called
a gold digger?

413
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:35,370
Did you say a gold digger?

414
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,630
You mean the kind of gold digger...

415
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,770
who extracts money from men?

416
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,140
Yes. That kind of gold digger.

417
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,580
What does he take me for?

418
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,650
The more I think about it,
the worse I feel.

419
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,190
Mr. Park's leaving.

420
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,120
He's leaving.

421
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,990
So what?

422
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,090
Get out here and see him off.

423
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,870
(Eagle Brewery)

424
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,970
Goodness.

425
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,340
Thank you for the lovely dinner.

426
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,810
Your doenjang jjigae...

427
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,810
is the best in Northeast Asia.

428
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,380
I'm glad it was to your liking.

429
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,780
You can come over
whenever you want some.

430
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:25,950
Can I really?

431
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,650
No. Don't come here.

432
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,650
Hey. Ma Kwang Sook.

433
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,190
My mom and I don't live here alone.

434
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,060
My youngest brother-in-law
lives here too.

435
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,930
Your mother told me so.

436
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,370
I worry what my staff will think,

437
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,500
and I am afraid
of what the neighbors will say.

438
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,570
Please be careful.

439
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,770
Don't.

440
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,970
If you feel that uncomfortable,

441
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,410
I'll stay away.

442
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,640
Goodbye, then, Mother.

443
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:56,910
Goodbye. Let's meet again soon.

444
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,910
Sure.

445
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,620
Why would you meet him again?

446
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:07,820
Be quiet.

447
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:35,450
Why are you so incredibly rude?

448
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,460
How can you say that
to a guest who came to see you?

449
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,090
I never invited him over.

450
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,130
He's not that bad-looking,
and he's rich.

451
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,900
He has no children either.

452
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,770
Park Sang Nam
is the best of the best.

453
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,530
To be honest,

454
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:52,570
he's way better than Jang Soo.

455
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,070
How dare you compare him
to someone like Jang Soo?

456
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,410
Listen to yourself.
Even a dog would laugh at that.

457
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,780
He has the looks,
the riches, and the personality.

458
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,380
Jang Soo is nothing compared to him.

459
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,720
To be frank,

460
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,850
Jang Soo left you nothing but debt.

461
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,590
He didn't leave me just debt.

462
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,220
He left the brewery...

463
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,690
and four brothers.

464
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,790
They're all burdens!

465
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,990
They're not burdens!
They're blessings!

466
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,460
You imbecile.

467
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,570
How could that ever be a blessing?

468
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:26,600
I say this loud and clear.
Don't get your hopes up.

469
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:30,510
There will be nothing
between Park Sang Nam and me.

470
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:34,210
Our deal is done.

471
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,010
I'm not pushing this for my sake.

472
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,150
For the rest of your life,

473
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,450
you'll be called a widow.

474
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:42,250
That's you,

475
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:45,260
and I feel bad
that it's the life you'll live.

476
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,890
Don't be this way...

477
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,930
to a fellow widow.

478
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,730
Don't pity me...

479
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,230
or feel bad for me,

480
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,740
and let's live our lives...

481
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,970
with confidence and courage.

482
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
Okay?

483
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:13,650
(Eagle Brewery)

484
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,890
What did she just say to me?

485
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,220
Welcome.

486
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,330
- You're here.
- I was a little peckish...

487
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,000
and stopped by for some cup ramyeon.

488
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,530
Take a seat,
and I'll bring some over.

489
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,400
Would you? Thanks.

490
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,410
It's about Chun Soo.

491
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,450
What about him?

492
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,180
He's getting a divorce.

493
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,860
A divorce?

494
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,330
I wondered why his wife
suddenly flew to Korea,

495
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:01,160
but it was to sign divorce papers.

496
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,030
Really?

497
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,470
I don't want to gossip,

498
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:10,770
but she has a boyfriend in the US.

499
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,580
What?

500
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,980
Something is bound to happen
when a married couple...

501
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,050
lives apart for too long.

502
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,490
Hey, you're spilling the seasoning!

503
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:26,160
Gosh, I'm sorry.
I'll get you a new one right away.

504
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,920
Was the news too shocking?

505
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,900
(Areum Gosiwon)

506
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,240
You're back.

507
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,610
- Hey.
- Is something up?

508
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,540
You don't look so well.

509
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,250
I haven't been able to sleep.

510
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,580
- I see.
- I'm good.

511
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:55,790
Good night, then.

512
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,940
- Dad, let's have breakfast.
- I don't have an appetite.

513
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,110
But you skipped dinner yesterday.

514
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,720
My mouth's so dry that
I can't even tell if I'm hungry.

515
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,350
Are you sure nothing's up?

516
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,990
I said everything was fine.

517
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,220
I can grab a bite at the hotel
if I'm hungry,

518
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,630
so don't be too concerned.

519
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,700
I hope you haven't forgotten
about our lunch plans today.

520
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,600
Lunch?

521
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,400
We're meeting
Lieutenant Oh Kang Soo.

522
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,530
Goodness.

523
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,100
Was that today?

524
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,610
Something came up at the hospital,
so Gyeol can't make it.

525
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,910
I'll be at the hotel on time.

526
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,410
Sure thing.

527
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,580
Have a good day.

528
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,790
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

529
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,600
Five companies...

530
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,800
including Silla Brewery will submit
their products to be tasted.

531
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,870
Will Eagle Brewery be present?

532
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:28,810
We already tasted theirs
the other day.

533
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:31,040
No, not for tasting.

534
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,310
I was talking about CEO Ma.

535
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,410
Will she be here
to deliver her products?

536
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:35,710
I'm not sure.

537
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,650
I'll ask the culinary department.

538
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,090
Hello, Chef Baek.

539
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,720
Will CEO Ma Kwang Sook
of Eagle Brewery...

540
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,530
be here with a delivery today?

541
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,230
I see. Thank you.

542
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,330
She won't be here today.

543
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,740
- No?
- If you have something to say,

544
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,070
I can call her and have her come by.

545
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:06,080
No, it's nothing urgent,
so don't concern yourself with it.

546
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,610
Understood, sir.

547
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:16,820
Who on earth said
something like that?

548
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:20,720
Who is the darn person
that said such filthy nonsense?

549
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,330
I'll sterilize that vicious tongue
with chlorine bleach!

550
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,810
Now that it's warmer,

551
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,440
we'll have to call the ladies
to make nuruk.

552
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,050
Due to the increase in sales,

553
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,220
we might run out of it
if we're not careful.

554
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,320
I trust you'll decide on a good day
for that.

555
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,560
Gosh, the sweet aroma.

556
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:02,230
You've really become
a proper brewer now.

557
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,710
I'll get going, Kwang Sook.

558
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,440
You must be going somewhere fancy
in that nice suit.

559
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,210
I have a job interview
in the afternoon.

560
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,580
Don't let the jitters get to you
and break a leg.

561
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:21,850
It'll be their loss
if they can't see your value.

562
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,950
Right. I'll get going, then.

563
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,420
Kang Soo.

564
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:31,090
- Good luck.
- Same here.

565
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,930
Good luck to me.

(CEO Dokgo Tak)

567
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:42,770
The team just left...

568
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,110
for the taste test at LX Hotel.

569
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:49,280
The test was ordered
by Chairman Han himself,

570
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,580
so we'll be getting good news.

571
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,280
There's no need to worry.

572
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,320
You and Chairman Han
go way back, don't you?

573
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,090
You could say we're like family.

574
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:06,430
Our families will be connected
through our children soon.

575
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:12,000
Then, your daughter and...

576
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,170
We said we'd soon settle on a date.

577
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:20,610
Then there's no need
to worry about the taste test.

578
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,690
Does Se Ri have a boyfriend?

579
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,360
Why would you ask that?

580
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,160
There's a client of mine...

581
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,500
who'd like Se Ri
as her daughter-in-law.

582
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,830
She's from a well-known family.

583
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,300
We're good.

584
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,900
- Se Ri must have someone.
- Of course, she does.

585
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,740
Of course. Someone like Se Ri...

586
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,910
would have plenty of men
lining up to marry her.

587
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,140
Would I know the family
of this boyfriend?

588
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,950
But the client I mentioned
is well-mannered and classy.

589
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,620
It's too good of an opportunity
to pass up.

590
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,830
Gosh, no. Forget it.

591
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,260
Seeing how you're
refusing that family tells me...

592
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,400
that Se Ri's seeing someone better.

593
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,870
You'll soon find out.

594
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,970
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

595
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,240
It's been too long.

596
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,770
I was too busy to come.

597
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,380
I see.
Congratulations on your wedding.

598
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,840
Where have I seen her before?

599
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,350
She's the future wife
of Jang Je Hyeong,

600
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:31,350
Daeheung Group's chairman.

601
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,650
Let me escort you to your seat.

602
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,150
That's right.

603
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,160
No wonder she seemed familiar.

604
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,600
She's the one idolized
by every woman...

605
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,970
in Korea these days.

606
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,870
He said I could bring Ha Ni.

607
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,500
His children are grown...

608
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,040
Don't be ridiculous!

609
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,510
I was just asking
about your circumstances.

610
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,410
Don't you dare mention Ha Ni again.

611
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,980
She's my daughter
and has nothing to do with you.

612
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,650
You and Ha Ni
have always been a part of me.

613
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,320
We'll wash your hair.

614
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,060
Why would they be jealous
when she's marrying a man...

615
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,860
old enough to be her father?

616
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,300
She's becoming the wife
of one of the top five rich men...

617
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,600
in the country.

618
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,770
Putting up with the age difference
is a small price to pay.

619
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,670
You think so?

620
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:33,080
The hair treatment product
is applied.

621
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,210
Please wait about 30 minutes.

622
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,250
Okay.

623
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,730
Spit your gum out.

624
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:52,730
- Why?
- The snapping sound bothers me.

625
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,630
But it still tastes sweet.

626
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,070
I'll chew it quietly.

627
00:34:57,130 --> 00:34:58,770
Just spit it out.

628
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:00,840
What's with the fuss?

629
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,210
Go ahead and spit it out.

630
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,770
All right.

631
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,050
I'll go and get
the hair treatment mask.

632
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,520
Please wait a moment.

633
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,360
Let's get our hair done nicely
and go eat something delicious.

634
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,600
I should go to school.

635
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,370
Did you hide
something precious there?

636
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:07,000
Why do you go to school
every time you get a chance?

637
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,270
I'm a student,
so I should go to school.

638
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:11,340
What about me?

639
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,710
Please move to the shampoo room.

640
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,210
Okay.

641
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,320
- Sorry.
- Forget it.

642
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,090
What on earth did you do to my hair?

643
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:27,990
I didn't do anything.

644
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,990
I didn't even touch your hair.

645
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,330
Then why is this thing on my hair?

646
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,730
Isn't it that you got it
before coming here?

647
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,870
Are you kidding me?

648
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,970
Please calm down.

649
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:45,140
We will get rid of it
without damaging your hair.

650
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,240
Please don't worry.

651
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:50,510
I heard it would come off easily
if you used mosquito repellent.

652
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,780
What did you say?

653
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:55,950
Or not.

654
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,320
Darn it.

655
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:05,700
Ha Ni.

656
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,560
Let me finish the report first.

657
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,970
Then I'll give you food, okay?

658
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,700
After you eat, you'll go to Grandma,

659
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,600
and I'll go to school. Okay?

660
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,540
All right? That's my girl.

661
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,340
I'll make it quick.

662
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,210
All right.

663
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,060
You're early.

664
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,060
I woke up early in the morning...

665
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,060
because I couldn't wait to see you.

666
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,000
Well...

667
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,100
Does it look good on me?

668
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,170
It would've been better
if it had a real diamond...

669

in the middle.

670
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,680
Come on.
I prefer something simple like this.

671
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,620
You're just saying that
not to make me feel small.

672
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,650
What? There are no wings.

673
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,060
Are you an angel without wings?

674
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,530
My goodness.

675
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,500
I'll finish cleaning
and start the lesson.

676
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,930
No, you should get some rest.
I'll do the cleaning.

677

did you?

Ms. Ji, you should get married now.

Aren't there any good guys
around you?

682
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,630
There's one.

683
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,310
But he's not interested in me.

684
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:59,810
He doesn't recognize
a great woman like you?

There's this silly one I like.

All right. I'm done with shampooing.

688
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,640
Did you only use shampoo?

689
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:37,080
It feels so soft.

690
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,580
I really like the shampoo here.

691

for a reason.

but it's so bouncy.

is living a double life.

but she has a ten-year-old daughter.

00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:53,750
I knew it.

723
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,490
My hunch was right.

724
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,430
(Angel Piano)

725
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,200
Oh, no.

726
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,300
This is not it.

727
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,170
Again.

728
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,340
Stop it.

729
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,270
Try it again.

730
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,000
(Be happy here and now.)

731
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,440
This is Silla Brewery's new product,

732
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,950
Sorabol's Moonlit Night.

733
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:13,660
This is the taste test report
from the executives.

734
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,270
Silla Brewery's product...

735
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,830
got a lower score than expected.

736
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,600
Products from other companies
also failed to meet...

737
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,710
our executives' requirements
as they had little time to prepare.

738
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,310
Is that so?

739
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:32,480
Then let's select
Eagle Brewery's product.

740
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,550
Yes, sir. We'll do that.

741
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:40,360
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

742
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,570
Hello?

743
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:59,310
It's LX Hotel's Han Dong Seok.

744
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,810
What made you want to call?

745
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,950
You'll soon hear from the person
in charge,

746
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:07,880
but I called ahead
to give you the good news.

747
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:11,690
"Good news?"

748
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,860
Yes. I have good news.

749
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,790
Did you figure out the person...

750
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,500
who called me a gold digger?

751
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,470
About yesterday...
That was my mistake.

752
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,500
I apologize sincerely.

753
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:30,070
Did you confirm the name
of the guest in Room 1512?

754
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,480
Yes. I won't make any excuses.

755
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,740
I'm sorry.

756
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:39,150
Since you apologized,

757
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:42,520
I'll be cool and accept it.

758
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,220
Goodbye.

759
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,560
Wait.

760
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,690
I have good news.

761
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:54,960
For the festival that's coming up
in a few days,

762
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:58,770
we've decided to serve
Eagle Brewery's makgeolli...

763
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,370
with our food.

764
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:03,610
Good.

765
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:05,670
"Good."

766
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,980
Is that all you have to say?

767
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,010
What?

768
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,320
Do I need to say more?

769
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,190
No. Not at all.

770
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,490
I hope...

771
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:20,220
you prepare well
and get a good response.

772
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,090
Okay.

773
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,890
I'll prepare as best I can.

774
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,830
She has no manners.

775
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,940
I was considerate enough
to call her myself.

776
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:36,270
"Good."

777
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:38,170
What was that?

778
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:42,850
My goodness.

779
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:50,020
Mr. Go. Kim.

780
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:52,420
- What is it?
- Is something wrong?

781
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,760
The festival people
decided to serve our makgeolli!

782
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:58,560
That's it?

783
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,600
You made a fuss
about what I knew would happen.

784
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,000
I heard that Silla Brewery
and other big companies...

785
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,740
sent in samples to compete.

786
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,540
I felt a bit intimidated.

787
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:13,880
Don't compare our product
with Silla Brewery's cheap stuff.

788
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,180
That's nonsense.

789
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:19,280
Shouldn't we eat out
to celebrate something like this?

790
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,050
You bet we should.
Name what you want. It's on me.

791
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,120
Ask for beef.

792
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:25,350
Beef.

793
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,420
Beef? Okay.

794
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,790
We should eat that. Let's go.

795
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,160
Darn you.

796
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:35,030
How could you ruin it
at the last minute?

797
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,570
I had Chairman Han's word.

798
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:39,900
What on earth did you do...

799
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:42,000
that we got such horrible results?

800
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,540
We didn't have enough time
to develop the product...

801
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,840
and failed to find
the ideal ratio of taste...

802
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,480
- and flavor...
- You fool.

803
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,610
Do you call that an excuse?

804
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,250
I'm sorry, sir.

805
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,550
Those punks in the Development Team.

806
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:57,390
I'll fire them all.

807
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:59,920
They're treated too well
and have gotten too comfortable.

808
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,420
They don't take
their jobs seriously.

809
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:05,230
And you.

810
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:08,300
Why can't you keep a tight rein
on the staff?

811
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,470
What do you even do here?

812
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,370
I'm sorry, sir.

813
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:14,870
Is that the only thing you can say?

814
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,100
I'm sor...

815
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:19,340
Forget it. Get out of here!

816
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,840
I can't stand your face!

817
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,580
My gosh. This is so annoying!

818
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:30,290
I'd curse him out if our kids
weren't going to get married.

819
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:33,120
It's okay.

820
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,520
Dokgo Tak. You're doing well.

821
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:39,800
Relax. Calm down.

822
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:53,880
Hello, Mr. Dokgo.

823
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:57,880
Hello. I just heard the news.

824
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:02,050
Our Silla Brewery's product
didn't make the cut...

825
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:03,920
to be served at the festival?

826
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,590
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

827
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:08,490
That's a great shame.

828
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:10,990
It was an official tasting,

829
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:13,960
so even as the chairman,
I couldn't change the results.

830
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,870
I'm sure that was the case.

831
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,570
You don't need to worry.

832
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,570
Could you tell me which product...

833
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:27,240
made the final cut to be served?

834
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,050
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli
from Eagle Brewery.

835
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,280
That's what we'll be serving.

836
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:35,280
Jang-Kwang...

837
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,520
Jang...

838
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:42,020
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli?

839
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:46,060
I thought I told you
about the tasteless rumors...

840
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,500
that were circulating
about Eagle Brewery.

841
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,030
I tipped you off.

842
00:48:52,230 --> 00:48:53,970
Rumors are rumors,

843
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:56,440
and good wine tastes good.

844
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:00,280
Since you didn't get
the result you wanted,

845
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,350
let me treat you to a meal
to console you.

846
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,320
Shoot.

847
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:13,690
Darn it!

848
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,930
Eagle...

849
00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:18,890
Eagle!

850
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,500
Who on earth are they to me
that they keep tackling me?

851
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:29,940
This won't do.

852
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:34,610
I'll chew them out
and stomp all over them...

853
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,680
so they're left without a trace.

854
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,320
That woman earlier.

855
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,320
The woman who'll marry
Daeheung Group's chairman.

856
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:45,350
What about her?

857
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:50,090
Did you stick
the chewing gum to her hair?

858
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:52,230
You offered...

859
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:54,130
to throw away the gum I was chewing.

860
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,230
It wasn't you, was it?

861
00:49:58,570 --> 00:49:59,570
I can't say.

862
00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:04,910
It's either yes or no.
Why can't you say?

863
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:07,680
It was you.

864
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:11,250
Did you stick the gum on her hair?

865
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,520
- Yes.
- My gosh.

866
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:18,890
I don't believe it.

867
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:22,590
Why did you do such a thing?

868
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:23,890
Why?

869
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,530
She's annoying.

870
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,130
Why is she annoying?

871
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:32,600
She cares too much about money.

872
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,300
I couldn't stand it.

873
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:37,970
Dokgo Se Ri.

874
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:41,810
Why do you care
what she thinks about money?

875
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:43,780
She has nothing to do with you.

876
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:46,250
I just felt like doing it.

877
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:48,650
You could get into huge trouble.

878
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,250
What if someone saw?

879
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,850
What if there were cameras?

880
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:55,720
I knew there weren't any
and moved in and out fast.

881
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:57,960
My gosh.

882
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,370
It's not funny.

883
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,330
Why are you acting out of character?

884
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:12,840
You really...

885
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:28,020
We need to talk later.

886
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:29,990
What for?

887
00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:32,690
You've been acting strangely.

888
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,360
You're not my darling puppy.

889
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,030
I'll get a facial at the hotel...

890
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:39,400
and pick you up on time.

891
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:41,200
I'll be late. I have a meeting.

892
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,270
Why do you always have a meeting?

893
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,740
Are you the only TA
in your department?

894
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,780
That's how good your daughter is.

895
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:50,180
You can go.

896
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,310
Goodness.

897
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:56,690
What got into her these days?

898
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:06,330
Professor.

899
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,660
How are you?

900
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:12,600
You seem to be in a good mood.
Did you get good news?

901
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,340
It's not exactly good news.

902
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:18,070
More like
something refreshing happened.

903
00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:19,980
What's that?

904
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:22,040
Will it cheer me up too?

905
00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:26,180
There was a person
I was annoyed with,

906
00:52:26,550 --> 00:52:28,480
but I taught her
a small lesson today.

907
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,420
"A small lesson?"

908
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:34,860
You'll probably tell me off
if I tell you the details.

909
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:36,930
It's a secret.

910
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:40,560
You can be an oddball.

911
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,700
Whatever it is,
if it cheered you up, it's good.

912
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:53,780
Hello, welcome.

913
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:55,510
Goodness.

914
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:59,310
How are you?

915
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,050
It has been a while.

916
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:03,520
It has. Have you been busy?

917
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:06,390
I had so much to do,
I couldn't visit.

918
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,620
But I bring good news.

919
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,330
Good news?

920
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:15,300
You mentioned
Eagle Brewery last time.

921
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,600
Oh, right.

922
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,530
You said you'd call
after reviewing the files.

923
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,940
I had given up
since I wasn't contacted.

924
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,410
The purchase department just called.

925
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:27,210
You're to present the product
at the head office next week.

926
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,080
Really?

927
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,110
Yes.

928
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:34,850
I had given up
since I didn't hear back from you.

929
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,480
No way.

930
00:53:37,550 --> 00:53:40,660
Thank you so much. Thank you.

931
00:53:41,490 --> 00:53:43,690
- Goodness. Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

932
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,160
My gosh.

933
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,670
(Mi Sun)

934
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,580
The call cannot be connected and
will be transferred to voicemail.

935
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:08,750
He's not picking up.

936
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:16,190
I have good news.

937
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:18,260
Call me when you have time.

938
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:32,540
Goodness, it's Bom.

939
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:34,240
Hey...

940
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:40,320
What?

941
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,820
It's been a while, Bom.

942
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,420
Have you been well?

943
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:48,290
Gyeol only told me a few days ago
that you had left the navy.

944
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,590
I'm afraid it happened that way.

945
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,800
Something urgent came up
at the hospital, so Gyeol...

946
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,240
Right. We talked
on the phone just now.

947
00:55:04,270 --> 00:55:06,240
My dad's waiting for us
at the restaurant.

948
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,740
- Let's go.
- Sure.

949
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:09,680
Just a second.

950
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:35,700
Thank you.

951
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:36,840
Goodness.

952
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,710
Hello, I'm Oh Kang Soo.

953
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:41,580
It's a pleasure to meet you.

954
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,110
Let's sit.

955
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:52,020
I hope I didn't take time
out of your busy schedule.

956
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,690
Of course not.

957
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:56,390
Gyeol told me you left the navy.

958
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:58,660
That's right.
Due to an issue with my ears,

959
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:00,460
I couldn't manage
underwater training.

960
00:56:01,830 --> 00:56:03,130
Does it affect your daily life?

961
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,530
Not at all.

962
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:07,570
You'll have to look for
something new to do.

963
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:10,610
I'm afraid so.
I've been looking for a job...

964
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:12,170
while helping my sister-in-law
at her brewery.

965
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:14,110
Her what?

966
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:17,550
It's a place
that brews alcoholic beverages.

967
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:20,380
I see. Like one
that brews makgeolli?

968
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,920
That's right.

969
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,820
It's been in the family
since my grandfather,

970
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:26,760
but my eldest brother
passed away recently,

971
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,760
so my sister-in-law
has been running it since.

972
00:56:31,390 --> 00:56:32,630
Hold on.

973
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,960
Is the name of the brewery...

974
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,600
It's Eagle Brewery.

975
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,830
Eagle Brewery?

976
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:41,600
Do you know the place?

977
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,570
Yes, of course.

978
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:47,440
The brewery supplies us
with traditional wine.

979
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:53,210
I see.

980
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,750
My father's the chairman
of this hotel, you see.

981
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,790
Really?

982
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,530
Please think fondly
of my sister-in-law.

983
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:12,830
Did your sister-in-law
say anything about me?

984
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,200
No, sir.

985
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:17,610
She only said she was
supplying makgeolli to the hotel.

986
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,040
I see.

987
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:27,550
Running a brewery won't be easy...

988
00:57:27,550 --> 00:57:30,190
because it requires real expertise.

989
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:35,120
How did your sister-in-law
get to run the brewery?

990
00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:39,230
Since the brewery
was my late brother's dream...

991
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,000
and the root of our family,

992
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:45,070
she couldn't let us abandon
the family business for generations.

993
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,770
That's why she took the brewery over
on our behalf.

994
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:51,410
There could've been an issue...

995
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:53,980
regarding the inheritance
among family members.

996
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:59,150
It was sitting on a pile of debt,
so my brothers and I were ready...

997
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:00,750
to give up the inheritance
and dissolve it.

998
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:03,050
But my sister-in-law spent...

999
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:05,020
her severance pay and even used
her mother's retirement savings.

1000
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:08,390
She also took out a loan
through her previous job,

1001
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:10,160
which was just enough
to keep the brewery afloat.

1002
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,800
Gosh, I see.

1003
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:18,230
My brothers and I
have been deeply grateful to her.

1004
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:21,970
We respect and rely on her
as if she were our big sister.

1005
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:24,840
She's the one...

1006
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:28,210
I respect the most in this world.

1007
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,370
The call cannot be connected and
will be transferred to voicemail.

1008
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,970
Who are you calling
in the middle of eating?

1009
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:02,540
Chun Soo.
I was wondering if he had eaten.

1010
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,450
Try worrying about your own mother
like that.

1011
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:11,390
How come you're worried about him?
He's not even family by blood.

1012
00:59:12,450 --> 00:59:13,760
I feel bad for him.

1013
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:16,590
He had to live alone
and send money abroad for ten years,

1014
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:18,130
but his wife cheated on him.

1015
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:20,430
Don't worry about others
and worry about yourself,

1016
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:21,760
Ma Kwang Sook.

1017
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:23,560
I'm doing well for myself.

1018
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,100
You and Park Sang Nam...

1019
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,200
Again?

1020
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,610
What did I say about
bringing him up?

1021
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:35,540
Why am I not even allowed
to talk about him?

1022
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,510
Fine, you brat.

1023
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,860
Sighing in the middle of a meal
will only chase luck away.

1024
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:51,490
It's Heung Soo.

1025
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:54,730
I'm worried about how he's doing.

1026
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,430
Unbelievable. Just unbelievable.

1027
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,030
Get a grip on yourself, you brat!

1028
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,870
I bet you thought I'd smack you.

1029
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:25,690
(I have good news!
Call me when you have time.)

1030
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:27,130
Is he busy?

1031
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,670

1035
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,420
Yes?

1036
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:55,290
Get over here.

His phone has been ringing
since last night.

1039
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:04,170
Check if everything's all right.

Aren't you there?

1043
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:19,450
I don't know.

1044
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,220
- Let yourself in.
- Darn.

1045
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,850
I'm coming in.

1046
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:29,560

Mr. Oh, are you asleep?

This is a prescription bottle.

1049

What's this?

1050
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:47,210
Mr. Oh, wake up.

Mr. Oh is unconscious.

1058
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,990
