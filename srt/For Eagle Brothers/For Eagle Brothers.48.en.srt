00:00:02,383 --> 00:00:04,253
(Episode 48)

2
00:00:06,353 --> 00:00:07,453
For the time we have left,

3
00:00:08,623 --> 00:00:11,393
I'll love you with all my heart.

4
00:00:15,503 --> 00:00:18,133
Will you marry me?

5
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:48,533
Hold on.

6
00:00:54,003 --> 00:00:55,003
After...

7
00:00:56,603 --> 00:00:57,943
we get married,

8
00:01:01,643 --> 00:01:03,983
let's live with your mother-in-law.

9
00:01:06,513 --> 00:01:07,553
What?

10
00:01:07,653 --> 00:01:08,953
No matter how I think about it,

11
00:01:09,683 --> 00:01:11,453
that seems like the best idea.

12
00:01:12,523 --> 00:01:13,793
Let's live...

13
00:01:14,693 --> 00:01:16,293
with your mother-in-law.

14
00:01:21,463 --> 00:01:22,503
What?

15
00:01:23,163 --> 00:01:24,763
She's losing her memory.

16
00:01:25,403 --> 00:01:28,203
How can we let her live alone in a foreign country?

17
00:01:29,103 --> 00:01:32,113
I just can't do that.

18
00:01:35,143 --> 00:01:38,352
You're not supposed to say things like that so easily.

19
00:01:38,353 --> 00:01:40,653
I'm not saying this easily.

20
00:01:41,213 --> 00:01:43,983
I've given it a lot of thought since I found out...

21
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,553
she had dementia.

22
00:01:46,853 --> 00:01:49,093
We will find out more about it when the results come out,

23
00:01:49,563 --> 00:01:52,093
but her current condition isn't so bad.

24
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,463
And more importantly,

25
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:57,063
do you think she will want to live with us?

26
00:01:57,263 --> 00:02:00,473
This isn't about what she wants.

27
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:03,543
It is a matter of responsibility and duty.

28
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:07,343
If that's what you think,

29
00:02:08,413 --> 00:02:10,613
what kind of person do you think I am...

30
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:12,953
for not having lived with her for the past 15 years?

31
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,123
Am I someone who does not understand responsibility and duty?

32
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:17,823
No.

33
00:02:18,553 --> 00:02:20,292
That's not what I meant.

34
00:02:20,293 --> 00:02:23,393
Taking care of others is nice, but there's a limit.

35
00:02:24,223 --> 00:02:27,663
I feel really tired whenever you're being like this.

36
00:02:28,903 --> 00:02:32,073
You said your nickname was Mad Psycho. Is this why?

37
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,543
Why would you say that?

38
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,473
Are you saying I'm a psycho?

39
00:02:39,073 --> 00:02:40,973
If you don't want me to say things like that,

40
00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:43,083
you should know when to stop.

41
00:02:59,863 --> 00:03:02,163
Where have you been?

42
00:03:02,503 --> 00:03:04,363
Were you with Dong Seok?

43
00:03:05,003 --> 00:03:08,233
Dong Seok, whom you adore so much,

44
00:03:08,903 --> 00:03:10,203
called me a psycho.

45
00:03:11,203 --> 00:03:12,243
What?

46
00:03:13,043 --> 00:03:15,782
How could he say such a thing to me...

47
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:18,413
just because I said something he didn't like?

48
00:03:19,313 --> 00:03:21,053
What did you say?

49
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,693
He asked me to marry him,

50
00:03:25,993 --> 00:03:27,923
so I said I wanted to live...

51
00:03:28,123 --> 00:03:30,493
with his mother-in-law after we got married.

52
00:03:30,763 --> 00:03:33,363
- And he called me a psycho. - What?

53
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:34,993
His mother-in-law?

54
00:03:36,263 --> 00:03:38,773
Do you mean his ex-mother-in-law?

55
00:03:39,203 --> 00:03:42,243
- Yes. - Why you... You're unbelievable.

56
00:03:42,403 --> 00:03:44,302
Of all people,

57
00:03:44,303 --> 00:03:46,643
you offered to live with the ex-mother-in-law?

58
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:48,043
Have you lost your mind?

59
00:03:48,113 --> 00:03:49,712
- You're out of your mind. - My gosh.

60
00:03:49,713 --> 00:03:51,483
- Mom, it's not like that. - Oh, no.

61
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:53,282
- I had a reason! - My gosh. Ms. Gong.

62
00:03:53,283 --> 00:03:55,583
- I have a reason I can't tell you. - What's going on? Please calm down.

63
00:03:56,183 --> 00:03:57,883
How would I stay calm now?

64
00:03:58,223 --> 00:04:01,053
My goodness. That darn fool says...

65
00:04:01,223 --> 00:04:02,292
she will live...

66
00:04:02,293 --> 00:04:04,263
with Dong Seok's ex-mother-in-law after their wedding.

67
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:06,763
- You silly... - My gosh. Please stop it.

68
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,873
I understand the situation,

69
00:04:17,073 --> 00:04:19,273
but it is very strange to live with your husband's...

70
00:04:19,913 --> 00:04:21,173
ex-mother-in-law.

71
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:26,813
I really want to take your side,

72
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:30,423
but I think you are way over the line this time.

73
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:33,693
I understand how you are feeling,

74
00:04:34,193 --> 00:04:35,893
but this is just too much.

75
00:04:36,823 --> 00:04:37,893
They're right.

76
00:04:38,323 --> 00:04:40,692
Mr. Han must've gathered all his feelings for you...

77
00:04:40,693 --> 00:04:42,633
when he proposed to you.

78
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:44,533
But at the very moment,

79
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:46,903
your answer was to live with his ex-mother-in-law.

80
00:04:47,573 --> 00:04:49,243
Of course, it's not easy to accept.

81
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,873
Right. I understand him.

82
00:04:53,713 --> 00:04:54,813
That's right.

83
00:04:55,113 --> 00:04:57,043
They are saying only the right things,

84
00:04:57,483 --> 00:04:59,313
which I really like.

85
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:06,753
How could you do this to me?

86
00:05:07,553 --> 00:05:10,793
How come no one's on my side?

87
00:05:23,373 --> 00:05:25,643
I knew she could be a little nosy,

88
00:05:26,273 --> 00:05:28,042
but how could she offer...

89
00:05:28,043 --> 00:05:30,243
to live with your grandmother so easily?

90
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,283
I don't think it was easy for her to say that.

91
00:05:33,013 --> 00:05:34,083
Of course not.

92
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:36,583
She must've thought it through before saying that.

93
00:05:38,323 --> 00:05:39,593
Wait, you mean...

94
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:42,193
you understand her?

95
00:05:42,963 --> 00:05:44,563
Gosh, no.

96
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:49,333
But I'm just grateful and touched...

97
00:05:49,603 --> 00:05:50,863
that she cares about Grandma.

98
00:05:51,703 --> 00:05:54,503
I agree. To be honest, I'm really touched.

99
00:05:55,603 --> 00:05:57,273
Touched, my foot.

100
00:05:57,973 --> 00:06:01,413
It's not like your grandma's condition is serious.

101
00:06:01,773 --> 00:06:03,113
My gosh. I'm not sure...

102
00:06:03,983 --> 00:06:06,413
if she's nosy or reckless.

103
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:09,383
I just don't understand her.

104
00:06:14,193 --> 00:06:15,593
Hello, Chun Soo.

105
00:06:15,963 --> 00:06:17,393
I heard from Kwang Sook.

106
00:06:18,193 --> 00:06:19,633
That you two had an argument.

107
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:24,133
Wouldn't you have argued in that situation?

108
00:06:25,033 --> 00:06:27,873
She said unreasonable things without knowing my feelings.

109
00:06:28,273 --> 00:06:30,973
She just says such things because she's tenderhearted.

110
00:06:31,373 --> 00:06:32,443
Please understand her.

111
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:36,583
No matter how much I think about it, it's just too much.

112
00:06:37,013 --> 00:06:38,043
She just can't...

113
00:06:38,543 --> 00:06:40,553
turn away from those who are struggling.

114
00:06:41,753 --> 00:06:43,153
She's living...

115
00:06:43,283 --> 00:06:45,923
with all her brothers-in-law when her husband is already gone.

116
00:06:46,253 --> 00:06:48,393
That pretty much tells you what she is like.

117
00:06:49,193 --> 00:06:52,233
She is the nosiest person in this country.

118
00:07:05,143 --> 00:07:06,173
My gosh.

119
00:07:08,413 --> 00:07:09,943
Hello, Gyeol.

120
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:13,113
I hope I didn't wake you up.

121
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:15,483
No. I wasn't asleep.

122
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:19,353
By the way, is something wrong?

123
00:07:19,623 --> 00:07:22,193
Dad said you two got into an argument.

124
00:07:24,263 --> 00:07:25,263
I see.

125
00:07:26,293 --> 00:07:27,293
That's true.

126
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:31,203
I really appreciate that you care about my grandmother.

127
00:07:31,863 --> 00:07:33,402
But she's quite independent,

128
00:07:33,403 --> 00:07:35,543
and she hates being a burden to others.

129
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,873
If her condition worsens,

130
00:07:39,013 --> 00:07:40,412
we will figure out another way...

131
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:41,943
to take care of her and live closer to her.

132
00:07:42,943 --> 00:07:44,813
So please don't worry about her.

133
00:07:45,013 --> 00:07:46,653
I just want you to be happy with Dad.

134
00:07:49,683 --> 00:07:52,323
I understand what you mean.

135
00:07:53,793 --> 00:07:55,423
Thank you for calling me.

136
00:08:05,603 --> 00:08:06,933
Still, I'm not going...

137
00:08:07,233 --> 00:08:09,803
to call him first to say sorry.

138
00:08:19,713 --> 00:08:22,153
I've always apologized first,

139
00:08:22,983 --> 00:08:24,423
but that's not the case this time.

140
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:26,953
My gosh.

141
00:08:37,403 --> 00:08:38,403
Where's Se Ri?

142
00:08:39,403 --> 00:08:40,673
She's not feeling well.

143
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:47,013
The police investigation has turned public opinion against you.

144
00:08:48,913 --> 00:08:51,043
The shareholders and the employee stock ownership association...

145
00:08:51,713 --> 00:08:53,753
are also turning their backs on you.

146
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:55,583
If you get fired like this,

147
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,653
the last shield to protect you will be gone.

148
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,063
You have to admit what you did wrong...

149
00:09:04,893 --> 00:09:07,963
and apologize for your wrongdoing to take responsibility...

150
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:11,733
so that you will have a chance to come back later on.

151
00:09:11,763 --> 00:09:13,473
I said I didn't do anything wrong!

152
00:09:32,693 --> 00:09:33,793
Dad.

153
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:35,323
Are you sick?

154
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:37,223
Shouldn't you go to a doctor?

155
00:09:37,993 --> 00:09:39,433
What's happening to you now?

156
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:47,503
I guess you are worried about me...

157
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:52,213
because of the police investigation.

158
00:09:54,173 --> 00:09:55,982
But I'm not someone who will cave in...

159
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:57,613
just because of some video clip.

160
00:09:58,013 --> 00:09:59,483
I'll be fine.

161
00:10:00,313 --> 00:10:01,313
Are you sure?

162
00:10:01,314 --> 00:10:02,583
Yes, of course.

163
00:10:02,983 --> 00:10:05,382
I got here by getting through...

164
00:10:05,383 --> 00:10:07,693
much worse situations than this.

165
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:11,492
So don't waste your energy worrying,

166
00:10:11,493 --> 00:10:14,033
and get on with your life.

167
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,463
I won't give in easily.

168
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:18,063
Okay?

169
00:10:18,903 --> 00:10:19,903
Okay.

170
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:22,503
Good. Get some rest.

171
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:45,933
Ha Ni. Shall we wish Se Ri a good morning?

172
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:48,233
Hello.

173
00:10:52,163 --> 00:10:53,632
Ha Ni slept well last night,

174
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,873
but she's a bit gloomy today.

175
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:58,473
I am too, actually.

176
00:10:59,213 --> 00:11:00,873
I guess it's because we haven't met.

177
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:04,043
Anyway,

178
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,913
we're both here waiting for you.

179
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,982
Whenever you feel ready,

180
00:11:08,983 --> 00:11:10,282
come back...

181
00:11:10,283 --> 00:11:11,753
and show us your smile.

182
00:11:14,323 --> 00:11:16,923
Ha Ni. Say goodbye.

183
00:11:19,593 --> 00:11:22,333
I miss you so very much, Professor.

184
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:39,812
Her heart, liver, and kidney functions...

185
00:11:39,813 --> 00:11:41,453
are all good for her age.

186
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:43,552
And she's watching...

187
00:11:43,553 --> 00:11:45,353
her blood pressure and blood sugar.

188
00:11:46,653 --> 00:11:47,722
However,

189
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:50,363
her cognitive function is below average.

190
00:11:50,763 --> 00:11:52,122
The MRI shows...

191
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:53,863
her hippocampus has shrunk.

192
00:11:54,863 --> 00:11:56,932
I'd diagnose her...

193
00:11:56,933 --> 00:11:59,173
with early-stage dementia.

194
00:12:00,373 --> 00:12:01,472
The thing is,

195
00:12:01,473 --> 00:12:04,443
we lived with her, and we didn't notice.

196
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:06,473
Are you sure...

197
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:08,473
it's dementia?

198
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:10,143
Yes.

199
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:13,352
It's not yet affecting her everyday life.

200
00:12:13,353 --> 00:12:15,853
If she takes her medication and maintains a healthy routine,

201
00:12:16,123 --> 00:12:17,823
she can slow the progression.

202
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:38,143
Hey. Did you speak with the doctor?

203
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:39,743
Yes.

204
00:12:41,513 --> 00:12:43,583
You're in much better health than I am.

205
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:46,813
You'll go strong for at least another 50 years.

206
00:13:20,413 --> 00:13:23,183
Ms. Park. Are you back at home?

207
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:26,553
Yes. I just got back.

208
00:13:27,193 --> 00:13:28,393
Well done.

209
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:30,523
Have you...

210
00:13:31,093 --> 00:13:34,193
heard from the alumni association?

211
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:36,103
Oh, that?

212
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:39,102
I'm still waiting for their call.

213
00:13:39,103 --> 00:13:40,903
I haven't heard anything yet.

214
00:13:41,773 --> 00:13:44,802
I'll call you as soon as I hear anything.

215
00:13:44,803 --> 00:13:46,642
Don't worry too much.

216
00:13:46,643 --> 00:13:49,183
Why don't you get some rest?

217
00:13:51,783 --> 00:13:52,853
Okay, bye.

218
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:01,353
How come...

219
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:05,163
he hasn't called once after leaving like that?

220
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:11,163
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

221
00:14:11,563 --> 00:14:12,803
If I let her,

222
00:14:13,703 --> 00:14:17,343
she'll try to take in and feed the whole world.

223
00:14:19,173 --> 00:14:22,243
I must not give in this time.

224
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:24,283
No way.

225
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,383
Hello, Mother.

226
00:14:29,553 --> 00:14:30,553
(3H Acupressure Bed)

227
00:14:30,554 --> 00:14:32,553
That won't happen,

228
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:35,193
but I called to ask, just in case.

229
00:14:36,863 --> 00:14:38,492
Living with your mother-in-law?

230
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:40,293
That's utter nonsense.

231
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,933
I will not let that happen.

232
00:14:43,703 --> 00:14:45,732
I know. Don't worry.

233
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:47,403
That won't happen.

234
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:50,943
She's my daughter, but I can't stand her sometimes.

235
00:14:52,173 --> 00:14:54,173
Where did she even get that idea?

236
00:14:54,943 --> 00:14:55,983
Well...

237
00:14:56,283 --> 00:14:59,613
My mother-in-law isn't doing well health-wise.

238
00:15:00,283 --> 00:15:02,722
Kwang Sook's worried about her.

239
00:15:02,723 --> 00:15:05,723
Don't take it too seriously.

240
00:15:07,193 --> 00:15:08,953
Your mother-in-law is unwell?

241
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:10,793
What?

242
00:15:12,123 --> 00:15:13,393
Well, yes.

243
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:15,063
What's wrong with her?

244
00:15:16,533 --> 00:15:18,963
Is it a serious illness?

245
00:15:23,043 --> 00:15:25,703
She has early-stage Alzheimer's.

246
00:15:26,873 --> 00:15:27,913
What?

247
00:15:28,143 --> 00:15:31,383
Alzheimer's? You mean she has dementia?

248
00:15:31,943 --> 00:15:33,213
Oh, no...

249
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:38,023
I won't allow it. It's a no.

250
00:15:38,723 --> 00:15:41,392
Talk some sense into Kwang Sook.

251
00:15:41,393 --> 00:15:43,063
She wants to live with her? Forget it!

252
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:50,763
Bye, then.

253
00:15:55,673 --> 00:15:58,602
Ma'am, I think it's done.

254
00:15:58,603 --> 00:16:00,173
Okay.

255
00:16:05,443 --> 00:16:07,713
- Will you try this lotion? - Okay.

256
00:16:11,323 --> 00:16:12,453
- Like this? - Yes.

257
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,662
It's nice and cooling.

258
00:16:16,663 --> 00:16:17,863
- Isn't it? - Yes.

259
00:16:19,463 --> 00:16:21,532
I feel better already.

260
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:24,162
I'm glad to hear that. Come by whenever you want.

261
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:25,163
I will.

262
00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:34,343
Combine your shares with Chairman Kim's,

263
00:16:34,873 --> 00:16:37,083
and you'll have 41 percent of the company on your side.

264
00:16:37,543 --> 00:16:41,112
On the other hand, including Chairman Pyo's 18 percent,

265
00:16:41,113 --> 00:16:43,083
thirty-five percent is against you.

266
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:45,083
The problem is...

267
00:16:45,323 --> 00:16:46,522
the 5.5 percent held by...

268
00:16:46,523 --> 00:16:47,853
the employee stock ownership association.

269
00:16:49,153 --> 00:16:51,592
The general consensus is not in your favor...

270
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,963
because of the investment in the premium line.

271
00:16:54,533 --> 00:16:55,962
If we include that number,

272
00:16:55,963 --> 00:16:58,203
over 40 percent are against you.

273
00:17:00,303 --> 00:17:03,142
We're in regular contact with the other shareholders,

274
00:17:03,143 --> 00:17:04,702
so there's no immediate problem,

275
00:17:04,703 --> 00:17:06,643
but we can't relax at the moment.

276
00:17:09,013 --> 00:17:10,943
- Also... - There's more?

277
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:14,883
Don't we have to do anything about your wife?

278
00:17:17,183 --> 00:17:19,392
Not only are we husband and wife,

279
00:17:19,393 --> 00:17:21,992
but we also established this company together.

280
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:23,722
However much she hates me,

281
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:25,293
she wouldn't join the other side.

282
00:17:26,193 --> 00:17:28,062
Stop worrying about that...

283
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,502
and do the job I gave you.

284
00:17:30,503 --> 00:17:31,503
Okay?

285
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:33,173
Yes, sir.

286
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:35,873
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

287
00:17:42,643 --> 00:17:43,643
Kwang Sook.

288
00:17:46,753 --> 00:17:49,623
The special shipping truck just left for Incheon Port.

289
00:17:50,353 --> 00:17:53,192
Good job. When will the shipment arrive?

290
00:17:53,193 --> 00:17:56,623
The date of arrival is... Next Wednesday.

291
00:17:57,763 --> 00:18:00,193
The liquor we made is doing well in the US.

292
00:18:00,563 --> 00:18:01,762
It's hard to believe.

293
00:18:01,763 --> 00:18:04,333
The locals love it too, and not just the expats.

294
00:18:04,963 --> 00:18:07,202
How do they know it's good? It's weird, isn't it?

295
00:18:07,203 --> 00:18:09,542
Come on, Mr. Go.

296
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:13,073
These days, loving Korean food is a trend.

297
00:18:13,213 --> 00:18:14,442
That's a trend?

298
00:18:14,443 --> 00:18:15,773
Goodness.

299
00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:18,943
CEO Ma. Are you in?

300
00:18:20,153 --> 00:18:21,213
Who's that?

301
00:18:22,113 --> 00:18:23,853
It looks like someone's here.

302
00:18:27,693 --> 00:18:29,823
(Eagle Brewery)

303
00:18:32,323 --> 00:18:33,333
Hey.

304
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,993
(Eagle Brewery)

305
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,603
You're the wholesalers who demanded a refund last time.

306
00:18:43,243 --> 00:18:45,203
We haven't met in a long time.

307
00:18:45,743 --> 00:18:48,273
- Hello. - I thought you were done with us.

308
00:18:48,743 --> 00:18:50,243
Why are you back here?

309
00:18:50,643 --> 00:18:53,453
We were shocked and flustered by the news,

310
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:56,553
and we struggled to fend for ourselves.

311
00:18:58,083 --> 00:19:00,352
We were rash and inconsiderate.

312
00:19:00,353 --> 00:19:01,353
We apologize.

313
00:19:02,763 --> 00:19:05,193
Yes. We didn't think things through.

314
00:19:05,623 --> 00:19:08,263
That won't happen again, CEO Ma.

315
00:19:08,993 --> 00:19:12,033
Can you let us sell Jang-Kwang Makgeolli again?

316
00:19:18,603 --> 00:19:20,773
Of course. We'll supply you.

317
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,683
Holding a grudge is bad for business.

318
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,483
But...

319
00:19:26,913 --> 00:19:29,483
the conditions won't be the same as before.

320
00:19:29,853 --> 00:19:31,153
You get that, right?

321
00:19:31,653 --> 00:19:32,923
Yes, of course.

322
00:19:33,653 --> 00:19:35,123
By the way,

323
00:19:35,553 --> 00:19:38,923
I hear Jang-Kwang yakju is doing well too.

324
00:19:39,863 --> 00:19:42,063
Can we sell that too?

325
00:19:43,463 --> 00:19:45,102
As for Jang-Kwang yakju,

326
00:19:45,103 --> 00:19:47,773
the export volume to the US has suddenly surged.

327
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,342
So, we can't tell you when we can supply you...

328
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:52,302
until we adjust the production line.

329
00:19:52,303 --> 00:19:53,312
Sorry.

330
00:19:53,313 --> 00:19:54,643
Do what you can.

331
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:56,812
Retailers are hounding us,

332
00:19:56,813 --> 00:19:59,653
asking why we can't get our hands on any.

333
00:20:01,253 --> 00:20:03,823
You should've been nicer to us while we were supplying you.

334
00:20:05,923 --> 00:20:07,653
But since we're starting fresh,

335
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:11,393
let's keep this relationship going peacefully for a long time.

336
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:12,693
Of course.

337
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:16,363
- I hope we get along. - Thank you.

338
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:18,702
Thank you, CEO Ma.

339
00:20:18,703 --> 00:20:20,233
I hope we get along.

340
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:22,733
- Thanks. - I hope we get along.

341
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:24,165
It's Ri An!

342
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:27,305
- Heung Soo. - Hey, you.

343
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:31,975
Are you here without your manager today?

344
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:33,974
A client booked a haircut,

345
00:20:33,975 --> 00:20:35,015
so she'll join me afterward.

346
00:20:35,585 --> 00:20:36,985
A client booked a haircut?

347
00:20:37,815 --> 00:20:39,655
She runs her own hair salon.

348
00:20:39,915 --> 00:20:40,985
I see.

349
00:20:41,425 --> 00:20:43,285
Anyway, what's this urgent business you mentioned?

350
00:20:45,225 --> 00:20:48,065
I was invited to be on a reality dating show,

351
00:20:48,225 --> 00:20:50,325
and I recommended you as my partner.

352
00:20:50,425 --> 00:20:51,765
You'll be getting the offer soon.

353
00:20:52,435 --> 00:20:54,665
A reality dating show?

354
00:20:54,935 --> 00:20:57,065
Yes. They're trending these days.

355
00:20:57,305 --> 00:20:58,634
If everything goes right,

356
00:20:58,635 --> 00:21:00,275
this could lead to instant stardom.

357
00:21:02,505 --> 00:21:05,515
Forget it. I'm not interested in doing a show like that.

358
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:07,445
Why not?

359
00:21:09,545 --> 00:21:11,915
For starters, there's already someone I like.

360
00:21:15,755 --> 00:21:16,955
Straitlaced, are you?

361
00:21:17,825 --> 00:21:19,695
I never said we should actually date.

362
00:21:20,025 --> 00:21:22,395
This is a project all by itself.

363
00:21:22,765 --> 00:21:25,495
Besides, dancing on stage is what I want to do.

364
00:21:26,595 --> 00:21:28,505
I don't want to be famous for anything else.

365
00:21:32,035 --> 00:21:34,435
A top female celebrity meets a washed-up backup dancer.

366
00:21:34,905 --> 00:21:37,745
What do you think? Isn't it already intriguing?

367
00:21:37,915 --> 00:21:38,915
What?

368
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:56,465
That minx. She's flirting with him again.

369
00:22:04,135 --> 00:22:06,075
You can use me to gain fame...

370
00:22:06,205 --> 00:22:07,975
while I play the innocent romantic.

371
00:22:08,605 --> 00:22:10,645
It's a win for everyone, and no one loses.

372
00:22:12,345 --> 00:22:15,245
If this goes well, you'll be famous all because of me.

373
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:18,585
After shooting a bunch of ads, you could even afford a house.

374
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:24,725
Should I move out of the way...

375
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,065
so Heung Soo can spread his wings?

376
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,705
It's great to be popular and own a house,

377
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:42,805
but something else matters more to me.

378
00:22:45,415 --> 00:22:47,374
I don't want to be on a show like that...

379
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,115
if it means upsetting my girlfriend.

380
00:22:50,585 --> 00:22:51,585
I'll get going.

381
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:54,155
All it takes is one lucky strike.

382
00:22:54,855 --> 00:22:57,525
But opportunities like this only come once.

383
00:23:07,935 --> 00:23:08,935
What the...

384
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:11,235
Was I just rejected?

385
00:23:18,615 --> 00:23:20,315
I'm officially terrified.

386
00:23:23,915 --> 00:23:25,055
Hello?

387
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:26,555
It's me, ma'am.

388
00:23:26,615 --> 00:23:29,155
My meeting ended early, so I'm getting ready to leave work.

389
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:31,755
You're coming to pick her up already?

390
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:33,855
Yes, I'll be there in ten minutes.

391
00:23:37,995 --> 00:23:40,735
You visited a botanical garden with Mommy today, didn't you?

392
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:43,735
We enjoyed the fresh air and took a lot of photos.

393
00:23:44,265 --> 00:23:45,705
It felt nice, didn't it, Ha Ni?

394
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:50,505
Goodness. Did you have a good time?

395
00:23:52,545 --> 00:23:56,385
You must love spending time with your mom, right?

396
00:24:02,055 --> 00:24:03,084
Yes, ma'am.

397
00:24:03,085 --> 00:24:04,124
It's bad.

398
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:07,125
Ha Ni's dad will be picking her up in ten minutes.

399
00:24:07,495 --> 00:24:08,525
What?

400
00:24:09,225 --> 00:24:11,765
We still have more than an hour left in the time we agreed on.

401
00:24:11,865 --> 00:24:13,235
His meeting ended early.

402
00:24:13,935 --> 00:24:15,135
Where are you right now?

403
00:24:16,735 --> 00:24:18,375
It'll take me about 20 minutes.

404
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:21,505
What do I do?

405
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:24,675
You need to get here as fast as possible.

406
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,675
Got it.

407
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:30,585
Oh, no.

408
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:40,095
Ma'am, it's me. Where are you right now?

409
00:24:40,995 --> 00:24:44,265
I'm almost there. Can you hang on a little longer?

410
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,295
Sure.

411
00:24:56,945 --> 00:24:58,045
Where is she?

412
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,445
My gosh.

413
00:25:02,745 --> 00:25:03,785
Unbelievable.

414
00:25:07,155 --> 00:25:08,285
Ha Ni.

415
00:25:09,225 --> 00:25:10,225
Oh, dear.

416
00:25:14,355 --> 00:25:15,525
All right.

417
00:25:19,235 --> 00:25:20,235
Unbelievable.

418
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:23,604
You said it'd only be 20 minutes. What took you so long?

419
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,335
I'm sorry. We got caught in traffic.

420
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,445
There you go.

421
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:35,285
Ha Ni, let's get you to your dad.

422
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:37,815
Just a second.

423
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:42,855
Ha Ni, I'll see you again tomorrow.

424
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,855
Let's spend more time together.

425
00:25:56,765 --> 00:25:57,835
Goodness me.

426
00:25:58,135 --> 00:25:59,335
- Let's go. - Ha Ni?

427
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:04,005
- I kept you waiting, didn't I? - Ha Ni.

428
00:26:06,615 --> 00:26:08,445
Ha Ni, are you okay?

429
00:26:10,115 --> 00:26:12,655
Where on earth were you?

430
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:16,024
We went to check out a huge indoor playground...

431
00:26:16,025 --> 00:26:18,395
that opened nearby and lost track of time. Sorry.

432
00:26:18,725 --> 00:26:19,725
What...

433
00:26:20,425 --> 00:26:23,165
Why would you take her there when she can't even walk?

434
00:26:24,895 --> 00:26:27,595
Please talk to me first before taking her to places like that.

435
00:26:27,935 --> 00:26:29,335
Of course. I'll do that.

436
00:26:29,805 --> 00:26:32,505
Ha Ni was fussier than usual today,

437
00:26:32,705 --> 00:26:35,345
so I took her outside for a walk.

438
00:26:35,545 --> 00:26:36,805
I guess things went sideways.

439
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,375
I'm so sorry.

440
00:26:39,075 --> 00:26:40,815
Thanks for looking after her, as always.

441
00:26:42,745 --> 00:26:43,785
Let's go.

442
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:02,665
I was scared out of my wits today.

443
00:27:02,905 --> 00:27:04,805
That was way too close.

444
00:27:07,435 --> 00:27:10,175
She's my baby, not someone else's.

445
00:27:11,545 --> 00:27:14,245
So why do I have to see her while being consumed by guilt?

446
00:27:23,385 --> 00:27:26,125
Ha Ni, let's go home.

447
00:27:26,195 --> 00:27:27,195
Come on.

448
00:27:29,895 --> 00:27:31,635
Here you go.

449
00:27:33,995 --> 00:27:37,135
You'll take a bath and then a nap.

450
00:27:37,505 --> 00:27:39,005
Good. Let's go.

451
00:28:01,325 --> 00:28:04,025
You all did great work today. I'll see you tomorrow.

452
00:28:04,195 --> 00:28:05,965
- Have a good evening. - See you tomorrow.

453
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,365
What do you say to fried chicken and beer?

454
00:28:10,935 --> 00:28:12,735
Sorry, but I have a blind date today.

455
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:17,375
Bom, what do you say?

456
00:28:18,475 --> 00:28:20,314
My grandma's visiting from the US,

457
00:28:20,315 --> 00:28:21,845
so I should get home early.

458
00:28:24,685 --> 00:28:25,785
And you, Kang Soo?

459
00:28:26,355 --> 00:28:28,325
I actually have plans today.

460
00:28:29,585 --> 00:28:31,285
So, I'm the only one without a social life.

461
00:28:32,395 --> 00:28:33,525
I'll head out first.

462
00:28:34,325 --> 00:28:35,695
Wait for me.

463
00:28:36,095 --> 00:28:37,565
- I'll get going. See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow.

464
00:28:41,335 --> 00:28:42,935
We should get going too.

465
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,675
I hate to ask, but could you do me a favor?

466
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:55,185
Bom, it's been a while.

467
00:28:55,385 --> 00:28:56,715
Have you been well?

468
00:28:57,785 --> 00:28:58,855
I guess I've been managing.

469
00:28:59,485 --> 00:29:00,515
Where's Se Ri?

470
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:03,024
I guess she wanted some fresh air.

471
00:29:03,025 --> 00:29:05,095
She just went out for a drive.

472
00:29:05,895 --> 00:29:08,025
I should've called her before coming.

473
00:29:08,565 --> 00:29:09,595
Here.

474
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:14,635
It's okay to come empty-handed.

475
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:18,065
These are beautiful.

476
00:29:18,705 --> 00:29:19,835
Thank you.

477
00:29:21,505 --> 00:29:22,575
Where's Mr. Dokgo?

478
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:25,215
He hasn't come home yet.

479
00:29:26,075 --> 00:29:28,245
He has a lot to take care of at work these days.

480
00:29:31,085 --> 00:29:32,785
Actually, the flowers...

481
00:29:34,555 --> 00:29:36,225
are from Kang Soo.

482
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,055
What?

483
00:29:38,255 --> 00:29:39,655
He asked me to keep it a secret.

484
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:42,025
But I thought I should tell you.

485
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:45,865
Kang Soo was worried about you and Se Ri,

486
00:29:45,995 --> 00:29:48,335
so he asked me to drop by and check in on you.

487
00:29:56,305 --> 00:29:57,505
My Kang Soo...

488
00:29:58,615 --> 00:30:00,275
is worried about me and Se Ri?

489
00:30:01,315 --> 00:30:02,315
Yes.

490
00:30:03,985 --> 00:30:06,884
And he said you liked calla lilies.

491
00:30:06,885 --> 00:30:09,154
So he went to a flower shop near our office with me...

492
00:30:09,155 --> 00:30:11,895
and picked each flower himself.

493
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:15,195
My goodness.

494
00:30:46,495 --> 00:30:47,894
(Se Ri's mother)

495
00:30:47,895 --> 00:30:50,165
I got the flowers from Bom.

496
00:30:54,595 --> 00:30:57,365
I was getting into a stew,

497
00:30:58,135 --> 00:31:00,205
but now that I smell the flowers you sent me,

498
00:31:00,635 --> 00:31:03,145
I feel like I can finally breathe.

499
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:11,785
When I'm incompetent and lacking in many ways,

500
00:31:12,685 --> 00:31:15,485
you still care about me as your mom.

501
00:31:16,455 --> 00:31:19,395
I feel so grateful and ashamed.

502
00:31:21,425 --> 00:31:22,525
My son.

503
00:31:31,365 --> 00:31:32,705
I'm home.

504
00:31:38,845 --> 00:31:39,914
Hello, Jin Young.

505
00:31:39,915 --> 00:31:42,684
Heung Soo, are you and Ri An dating?

506
00:31:42,685 --> 00:31:44,515
What? What are you talking about?

507
00:31:44,885 --> 00:31:48,255
There are articles that say you and Ri An are dating.

508
00:31:48,355 --> 00:31:49,355
What?

509
00:31:51,525 --> 00:31:53,295
I've got to go, Jin Young.

510
00:31:54,655 --> 00:31:55,995
What is going on?

511
00:31:57,865 --> 00:31:59,365
No way.

512
00:31:59,735 --> 00:32:01,394
(Ri An, Oh Heung Soo)

513
00:32:01,395 --> 00:32:02,404
What...

514
00:32:02,405 --> 00:32:04,964
(Oh Heung Soo, a Backup Dancer in His 40s, Is Dating RI An)

515
00:32:04,965 --> 00:32:06,804
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

516
00:32:06,805 --> 00:32:11,605
(Oh Heung Soo and Ri An officially admitted they're dating.)

517
00:32:22,455 --> 00:32:23,555
(Mr. Heung Soo)

518
00:32:38,605 --> 00:32:40,004
(Eagle Brewery)

519
00:32:40,005 --> 00:32:42,975
Unless we have a factory-style mass production system,

520
00:32:43,475 --> 00:32:46,075
there's only so much we can do to increase output.

521
00:32:46,515 --> 00:32:50,214
We have the traditional methods we have maintained so far,

522
00:32:50,215 --> 00:32:51,444
so we can't give up on them...

523
00:32:51,445 --> 00:32:53,755
and use the mass production system.

524
00:32:54,315 --> 00:32:56,284
What would be the maximum volume...

525
00:32:56,285 --> 00:32:59,594
that can be produced using the current methods?

526
00:32:59,595 --> 00:33:01,095
It doesn't have to be the entire process.

527
00:33:01,495 --> 00:33:03,094
If we can automate just a few processes,

528
00:33:03,095 --> 00:33:04,695
such as stirring the liquor,

529
00:33:05,265 --> 00:33:08,095
we can still handle the amount of Jang-Kwang Makgeolli...

530
00:33:08,165 --> 00:33:10,204
we used to produce, even after accounting...

531
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:11,335
for the US export volume.

532
00:33:11,405 --> 00:33:14,204
Then we should check...

533
00:33:14,205 --> 00:33:16,004
how the space layout will be...

534
00:33:16,005 --> 00:33:19,114
if we bring in a few machines to replace simple manual labor.

535
00:33:19,115 --> 00:33:21,814
We also need to estimate the projected investment costs.

536
00:33:21,815 --> 00:33:23,544
We can't just start it without detailed plans.

537
00:33:23,545 --> 00:33:24,545
Yes.

538
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:26,515
Come here. We need to check this.

539
00:33:27,415 --> 00:33:28,654
The quantity here.

540
00:33:28,655 --> 00:33:30,025
Hello?

541
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:32,055
Is this Ms. Ma Kwang Sook?

542
00:33:32,895 --> 00:33:35,094
I'm calling you after hearing from the alumni association...

543
00:33:35,095 --> 00:33:36,865
of Hankuk University.

544
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:39,195
Is this Mr. Park Jong Woo?

545
00:33:39,535 --> 00:33:42,065
No, I'm his son.

546
00:33:42,765 --> 00:33:43,965
His son?

547
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:54,715
Please come on in.

548
00:33:59,115 --> 00:34:00,185
Is someone here?

549
00:34:01,015 --> 00:34:02,885
We have a precious guest.

550
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,264
Hello.

551
00:34:13,265 --> 00:34:15,365
Hello. I'm glad you're here.

552
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:25,845
You could've called me to apologize.

553
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:28,615
But you came.

554
00:34:33,085 --> 00:34:34,655
Aren't you here to apologize?

555
00:34:35,425 --> 00:34:36,485
I'm not.

556
00:34:37,455 --> 00:34:38,525
No?

557
00:34:38,695 --> 00:34:41,295
I'm not here for you, Mr. Han.

558
00:34:45,465 --> 00:34:47,134
Are you ready?

559
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:49,764
- Yes. Let's go. - Okay.

560
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:52,175
Mother. Are you going somewhere?

561
00:34:53,335 --> 00:34:55,105
- You don't need to know. - You don't need to know.

562
00:35:02,015 --> 00:35:03,485
What is going on?

563
00:35:05,955 --> 00:35:09,925
(Eagle Brewery)

564
00:35:19,335 --> 00:35:20,535
Hold my hand.

565
00:35:36,945 --> 00:35:39,455
(May he rest in peace.)

566
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:41,015
(Room 5)

567
00:36:13,385 --> 00:36:14,485
Jong Woo.

568
00:36:15,585 --> 00:36:17,055
I guess I'm too late.

569
00:36:18,585 --> 00:36:19,655
I'm sorry.

570
00:37:35,805 --> 00:37:38,265
I'm so sorry for your loss.

571
00:37:40,275 --> 00:37:41,674
Excuse me,

572
00:37:41,675 --> 00:37:44,145
but are you Ms. Ma Kwang Sook I called earlier?

573
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:47,045
Yes. That's me.

574
00:37:47,815 --> 00:37:51,645
How did you know my father?

575
00:37:52,755 --> 00:37:54,855
Well... It's not me.

576
00:37:56,085 --> 00:37:58,225
- My mother... - Well...

577
00:37:59,055 --> 00:38:02,525
I went to the same college as him.

578
00:38:02,695 --> 00:38:04,325
I see.

579
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:06,535
Thank you for coming.

580
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:20,215
(Funeral Hall)

581
00:38:21,515 --> 00:38:22,644
Ms. Park.

582
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:23,715
Thanks.

583
00:38:34,995 --> 00:38:36,225
Are you all right?

584
00:38:38,565 --> 00:38:39,595
Sure.

585
00:38:41,435 --> 00:38:42,605
No problem.

586
00:38:45,205 --> 00:38:46,205
If we...

587
00:38:46,975 --> 00:38:49,105
had found him just one day earlier,

588
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:52,345
you could've met him.

589
00:38:54,245 --> 00:38:55,715
It is such a shame.

590
00:38:59,655 --> 00:39:01,055
Now that I think about it,

591
00:39:02,855 --> 00:39:04,355
he did everything...

592
00:39:05,755 --> 00:39:07,695
faster than me.

593
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:11,795
He walked faster,

594
00:39:13,095 --> 00:39:14,395
ate faster,

595
00:39:16,405 --> 00:39:17,805
and read faster.

596
00:39:19,235 --> 00:39:20,705
He even ended up...

597
00:39:22,105 --> 00:39:23,605
dying before I did.

598
00:39:29,385 --> 00:39:30,715
Kwang Sook.

599
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:35,785
If you cry all the tears I'm meant to,

600
00:39:36,455 --> 00:39:40,125
how am I to mourn the death of my friend?

601
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:43,295
You're right.

602
00:39:47,195 --> 00:39:48,265
It hit...

603
00:39:51,205 --> 00:39:53,335
so close to home.

604
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:57,675
It shouldn't.

605
00:40:01,045 --> 00:40:02,175
You shouldn't...

606
00:40:03,385 --> 00:40:05,085
make the same mistake.

607
00:40:09,055 --> 00:40:10,855
There's a right time for everything.

608
00:40:13,555 --> 00:40:15,295
Don't regret things...

609
00:40:15,495 --> 00:40:16,825
when it's too late.

610
00:40:18,365 --> 00:40:21,395
Do what you can when you can do it.

611
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:26,235
That goes for marrying Dong Seok too.

612
00:40:29,975 --> 00:40:31,975
I talked to him about it already.

613
00:40:34,075 --> 00:40:35,415
Your marriage.

614
00:40:37,215 --> 00:40:39,055
I won't object to it anymore.

615
00:40:42,085 --> 00:40:43,185
You won't?

616
00:40:45,955 --> 00:40:48,455
My daughter will want you two to be happy.

617
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:52,265
So don't feel bad or guilty.

618
00:40:54,195 --> 00:40:55,805
Speed up the preparations.

619
00:40:56,835 --> 00:41:00,475
Shouldn't you be happy as soon as you can?

620
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:06,075
My goodness.

621
00:41:06,145 --> 00:41:08,145
- Thank you. - I can't breathe.

622
00:41:08,515 --> 00:41:10,815
- Thank you so much. - Let go.

623
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:13,515
You are so strong for a woman.

624
00:41:13,815 --> 00:41:15,115
Goodness.

625
00:41:16,885 --> 00:41:18,285
- Ms. Park. - What?

626
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,995
Thank you so much.

627
00:41:22,795 --> 00:41:23,865
You're welcome.

628
00:41:24,925 --> 00:41:26,395
Live happily.

629
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:31,910
Where on earth did you both go?

630
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,570
Stop it.

631
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,110
Why do you keep asking when I said you didn't need to know?

632
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:41,850
He has a tendency to do that.

633
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,620
I'm tired. I'll go upstairs to my room.

634
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,890
Good night.

635
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,990
- Good night. - Sleep well.

636
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,090
You too.

637
00:41:58,330 --> 00:42:01,070
I'll head home, then.

638
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:05,370
Wait. You can't leave just like that.

639
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:07,110
Why not?

640
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,310
We're not done talking.

641
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:14,250
If you apologize to me,

642
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,080
I will too.

643
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,850
What did I do that you want me to apologize?

644
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:31,970
My handbag.

645
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,570
Oh, dear.

646
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,600
Did I leave it in the truck?

647
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:40,540
You called me a psycho.

648
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:43,109
Chun Soo told me your nickname...

649
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,480
used to be Mad Psycho.

650
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:48,180
I just asked if you were a psycho.

651
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:51,650
I did not call you a psycho.

652
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,590
Are you kidding me? It's the same thing.

653
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:57,659
It was all nice and romantic when I proposed to you,

654
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,689
and you suddenly said...

655
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:00,329
we should live with my mother-in-law.

656
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,960
Who wouldn't question your sanity?

657
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:04,460
Why is it insane to suggest we live with your mother-in-law...

658
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:06,129
who has dementia?

659
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:09,939
It's not as easy as you think, okay?

660
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,510
She's family, not some stranger.

661
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,610
Why wouldn't it be easy?

662
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:16,040
What are you talking about?

663
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,310
Tell me.

664
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:21,080
I know you're excessive,

665
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,150
but isn't this too much?

666
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:27,050
Why would I live...

667
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,860
with my widowed son-in-law...

668
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:32,060
who remarried to start a new family?

669
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,990
I'm not that shameless of a leech.

670
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,999
It's not leeching.

671
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,130
Are you pitying me for being ill?

672
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,500
Why would you call it pity, Mother?

673
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,870
What is it, then?

674
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:45,040
Kwang Sook...

675
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,579
thinks it's a great shame you're alone in this condition,

676
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,510
and that's how she expressed it.

677
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,550
You let me down too.

678
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:54,920
Why did you pretend...

679
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,250
not to know I was ill?

680
00:43:57,950 --> 00:43:59,620
Did you enjoy putting on a show?

681
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:02,320
You're mistaken.

682
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,160
He pretended not to know...

683
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:07,900
because I swore him to secrecy.

684
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:10,360
He didn't mean to dupe you.

685
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:12,800
What is this?

686
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:14,900
Are you ganging up on me...

687
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,870
to make me feel left out?

688
00:44:35,290 --> 00:44:37,760
She seems really angry.

689
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,090
What should we do?

690
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:44,200
She knows why we said and did what we did.

691
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:46,000
She won't be angry for long.

692
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:48,970
I'm sorry.

693
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,540
I went overboard...

694
00:44:53,270 --> 00:44:54,440
and caused a mess.

695
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:58,010
You didn't do anything wrong.

696
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,950
It wouldn't have gotten this far if I'd apologized.

697
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,650
No.

698
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,850
I deserve to be called a psycho.

699
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:19,370
Oh, gosh...

700
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:28,710
I feel uncomfortable...

701
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,380
if we don't talk for a day or more after a fight,

702
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:36,550
and when I feel uncomfortable, I feel physically unwell.

703
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:42,220
This takes up way more energy compared to when I was young.

704
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:48,000
To be honest,

705
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,670
I couldn't concentrate at all today.

706
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:56,540
Let's not fight if we can help it.

707
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,010
And even if we do fight,

708
00:46:00,510 --> 00:46:02,480
let's put our pride aside...

709
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:07,450
and call the other person before too much time passes.

710
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:13,150
Let's acknowledge that the one to call the other first...

711
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:16,960
isn't the loser but the one to come around first.

712
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:20,360
If possible, I'll come to my senses first.

713
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,770
Every now and then, can you come around too?

714
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:27,400
No.

715
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,770
From now on, I'll be the one...

716
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:33,340
to come to my senses before you.

717
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,610
Thank you.

718
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,720
(G Hair Salon)

719
00:46:55,430 --> 00:46:56,960
Ok Bun, are you in?

720
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:03,740
Hey. I called and texted...

721
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,570
over ten times each, and you ignored them all.

722
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,880
Then you got me worried by turning off your phone.

723
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,080
I'm not in the mood to talk to you.

724
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:19,890
Is it about the news article?

725
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,100
You saw for yourself that day.

726
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:30,530
Ri An does whatever she wants.

727
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:33,399
When we met,

728
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,400
I told her clearly that I had a girlfriend.

729
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:37,470
But she still published that article.

730
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:39,509
She wanted people to believe...

731
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,480
she was a romantic in love with an unknown dancer.

732
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:45,850
Do you think...

733
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,280
I was into it?

734
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:51,490
No.

735
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,820
Then why did you ignore my calls and texts?

736
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,660
I know you're not interested,

737
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:03,400
but seeing you...

738
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:05,770
become more famous...

739
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,640
made me nervous,

740
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:10,600
and it brought me down.

741
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,110
I don't know what's been coming over me.

742
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:18,910
I feel like...

743
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,920
you might suddenly leave me one day,

744
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,450
and that worries me.

745
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:29,460
I'm scared as well.

746
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:35,700
I don't know if staying with me is really good for you.

747
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,100
It's driving me crazy.

748
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:53,980
Get on your feet already.

749
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:55,820
Why?

750
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,350
There's somewhere we have to go.

751
00:48:57,650 --> 00:48:58,689
Where?

752
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:00,350
You'll know once we get there. Come on.

753
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:15,540
Why are we here, Heung Soo?

754
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:17,999
Why else?

755
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,339
We're here to pick a dress and tuxedo...

756
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,470
for the wedding.

757

760
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,650
but ours?

761
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,480
What?

762
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:34,590
I hate seeing you feel insecure.

763
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:38,890
Today, I'll officially announce that I'm yours.

764
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,460
Heung Soo, have you lost your mind?

765
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,830
Yes, I've completely lost it.

766
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:51,370
I, Oh Heung Soo, want to prove...

767
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,440
how much I love you.

00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,520
Do I look okay?

773
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,360
You're stunning.

Your way... Like this?

786
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:31,559
A little more.

787
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,670

00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:04,540

873
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:06,769
I haven't seen her for quite some time.

874
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:08,539
I used to always see her at the convenience store,

875
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,180
and now I miss her.

876
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:13,450

885
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,350
Isn't my dress just the cutest?

886
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,360
Did they really get married?

887
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:01,160
Yes, they did.

888
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,960
You're shocked, aren't you? We were too.

889
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:09,740
It's your turn, Se Ri. You know that, right?

890

891
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,590
Will you really fight at the shareholder meeting?

892
00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:27,890
Do you want me...

893
00:58:28,090 --> 00:58:29,960
to step down and become a nobody?

894
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:35,560

896
00:58:39,330 --> 00:58:41,100
and neither are the employees.

897
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,810
You want to divorce me,

898
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:49,340
and I'm surrounded by enemies who want to chew me out.

899
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:51,140
You must be overjoyed.

900
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:52,480
Goodness.

901
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:58,120
Take responsibility and step down.

902
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:00,520
Cooperate with the police,

903
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:03,520
eliminate the owner risk, and then come back.

904
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:08,030
The negative sentiment will turn positive,

905
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:10,960
and you will get another opportunity.

906

00:59:52,670 --> 00:59:53,740
I know, right?

918
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:55,710
(Silla Brewery Extraordinary Shareholder Meeting)

919
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:57,810
CEO Dokgo Tak is under police investigation...

920
00:59:58,180 --> 00:59:59,509
for forcing someone...

921
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:00,750
to create a fake video...

922
01:00:00,910 --> 01:00:02,420
to slander a competitor.

923
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:05,319
Because of that,

924
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:07,219
the company's stock has fallen over 30 percent,

925
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:09,159
and sales have dropped by 28 percent...

926
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,860
compared to the same period last year.

927
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:13,430
Despite the negative situation...

928
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:15,289
brought upon by his own actions,

929
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:16,560
our CEO...

930
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,999
utterly ignored concerns of other shareholders...

931
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,070
and the employee stock ownership association.

932
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:23,539
He began construction on a premium production facility...

933
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,970
and established a subsidiary,

934
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:28,010
which is putting a growing strain on our finances.

935
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:30,940
We called this meeting...

936
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,850
to suggest we dismiss the CEO.

937
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:37,649
- Yes. - That's bad.

938
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:38,890
It's unacceptable.

939
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,989
- This is awful. - Should we dismiss him?

940
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:46,060
- It could get worse. - Is that a good idea?

941
01:00:50,130 --> 01:00:53,230
(Silla Brewery Extraordinary Shareholder Meeting)

942
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,270
(Result of vote to dismiss CEO Dokgo Tak)

943
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:01,539
(For: 42 percent)

944
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:02,680
(Against: 41 percent)

945
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,210
Now,

946
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:10,280
it's down to Ms. Jang Mi Ae who owns...

947
01:01:10,650 --> 01:01:12,250
about 4.9 percent of the company.

948
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:34,140
As a shareholder, I should acknowledge...

949
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,410
the difficulty the company is in...

950
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,810
and vote to dismiss the CEO for the company's future.

951
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:44,120
But as a member of the CEO's family,

952
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:48,650
I will express my shame by refusing to exercise...

953
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:51,320
my right to vote.

954
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,040
Jang Mi Ae!

955
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:08,270
The vote is 42 percent versus 41 percent.

956
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:10,679
It's the shareholders' decision...

957
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,780
to dismiss CEO Dokgo Tak.

958
01:02:14,710 --> 01:02:16,480
What stupidity is this?

959
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:20,049
I started this company by stacking the walls...

960
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:22,690
brick by brick in the middle of a field.

961
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:26,730
How dare you dismiss me?

962
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,400
You.

963
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:35,530
You...

964
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:40,840
You dare do this to me?

965
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:40,570
(For Eagle Brothers)

966
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:43,570
Did I do something that bad that I should...

967
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,140
step down from my position?

968
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:46,609
I refused to vote...

969
01:03:46,610 --> 01:03:48,740
for you and Se Ri, for our family.

970
01:03:48,770 --> 01:03:51,580
Will you keep your mouth shut?

971
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:54,350
I'll return to Golden Castle soon.

972
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,280
Come with me, Mr. Go.

973
01:03:56,350 --> 01:03:57,419
Is it me or the brewery?

974
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:58,750
Pick just one.

975
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,849
Is there something exciting?

976
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:04,060
The chairman seems to have a headache about how to propose.

977
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,560
I'm expecting about 500.

978
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:08,389
Five hundred guests?

979
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:09,929
I want to make it official...

980
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:13,200
and brag to everyone that you're by my side.
