(Eagle Brewery)

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,040
(Episode 25)

3
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,280
Chairman Han?

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,610
Well...

5
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:11,620
What brings you by unannounced?

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,920
I wanted to deliver
the good news in person.

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,020
Good news?

8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,260
I take it that
they haven't contacted you yet.

9
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,060
They have the suspect in custody.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,460
What? Really?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,030
No way!

12
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,240
I had no idea
they'd make an arrest so soon.

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:39,080
Thank you, Chairman Han.

14
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,180
I'm happy to see you're thrilled.

15
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,750
Kwang Sook.

16
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,660
Goodness.

17
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,100
Chairman Han, is that you?

18
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,330
Hello, ma'am.

19
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,670
What brings you here, Chairman Han?

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,240
I wanted to tell you
that the suspect is in custody.

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,810
- The suspect is in custody?
- The suspect is in custody?

22
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,380
- My gosh!
- They got her.

23
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,320
I was terribly worried.

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,080
I'm relieved they arrested her
sooner than expected.

25
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,690
Oh, right.
He's my eldest brother-in-law,

26
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,430
who's also the vice-CEO
of Eagle Brewery.

27
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,690
I'm Oh Chun Soo.

28
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,000
It's a pleasure. I'm Han Dong Seok.

29
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,770
It's a pleasure to meet you.

30
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,670
Rather than standing out here,

31
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,440
why don't you come into the office
for a cup of tea?

32
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,370
- Forget it. He's a busy man.
- I see.

33
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,440
Actually, I wouldn't mind
that cup of tea.

34
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,040
Goodness, of course.

35
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:51,220
What will happen to the suspect?

36
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,920
She's currently exercising her right
to remain silent,

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,220
but I'm sure
she'll confess to the crime soon.

38
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,330
If I could, I'd rush
to the police station now...

39
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,160
and wring an answer out of her.

40
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,000
Why did she do this to us?

41
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,100
The legal team at LX
will soon get to the bottom of it.

42
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,170
According to my attorney,

43
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,840
she couldn't have possibly done this
on her own.

44
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,310
He believes
someone put her up to it.

45
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:18,240
What?
Who on earth would do such a thing?

46
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,680
What beef
could they possibly have with us?

47
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,710
Tell me about it.

48
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,620
No one could possibly hold a grudge
against you or my brother.

49
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,950
Now that Chairman Han is helping us,

50
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,050
everything will soon be sorted out.

51
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,290
You help us
every time we're in trouble.

52
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,190
This family owes you so much.

53
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,260
That's nonsense.

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,200
LX Hotel and Eagle Brewery
are business partners,

55
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,600
which makes your business ours.

56
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,340
Goodness. You're not only handsome,

57
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:52,810
but also a true gentleman
in both your thoughts and words.

58
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,350
By the way, I heard from Bom.

59
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,320
You turned down
Gwangseong Defense...

60
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,820
and accepted the position
at our company instead.

61
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,560
- I appreciate that.
- Oh, please.

62
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,230
I'm the one grateful
for this job opportunity.

63
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:11,430
I'll do my best
not to disappoint you.

64
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,500
What are you talking about,
Kang Soo?

65
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,370
I wasn't able to tell you...

66
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,240
amidst all the madness
that was happening,

67
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,240
but I took a job at LX Fashion.

68
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,180
My gosh.

69
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,580
Congratulations, Kang Soo.

70
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,290
Thank you for helping my brother
take his first steps...

71
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,420
as a member of society,
Chairman Han.

72
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,160
There's no need for you to thank me.

73
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,290
I'm the one who feels reassured...

74
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,890
to have a talent
like your brother...

75
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,160
as part of my company.

76
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,100
Anyway, thank you for the tea.

77
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,170
I guess I should head out now.

78
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,040
I know you're all busy too.
Don't worry about seeing me off.

79
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,010
It was a pleasure to meet you.

80
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:02,250
- Likewise.
- Thank you for coming.

81
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,650
I'll see him off.
I'll be right back.

82
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,690
(Eagle Brewery)

83
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,860
Now that they have
the suspect in custody,

84
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,930
it won't be long
before the truth comes out.

85
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,970
Sure.

86
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,670
It's almost over now,

87
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,970
so take it easy,
and let it play out.

88
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,710
Rushing it
won't help solve it any faster.

89
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,110
Of course. I hear you.

90
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:33,850
I'll get going, then.

91
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:37,950
Get back safely.

92
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,990
Until next time, then.

93
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,930
Drive back safely, Chairman Han.

94
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,600
Now,

95
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:57,600
our misfortune will come to an end,
and happiness will begin.

96
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,700
Tell me about it.

97
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,170
I'm so glad they caught the woman.

98
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,210
That's not what I meant.
Chairman Han was looking at you...

99
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,080
with love in his eyes.

100
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,250
Not again with this nonsense.

101
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,020
It's not nonsense at all.

102
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,690
The chairman
surely has feelings for you.

103
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,160
Enough with this nonsense!

104
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,590
Your mom is a natural-born expert...

105
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:20,930
in the field
of romantic relationships.

106
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,230
I could tell almost instantly.

107
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:25,130
Stop!
I don't want to hear any of this!

108
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,470
There will come a day...

109
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,530
when you clap your hands,
realizing I was right all along.

110
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:30,970
I'll get going.

111
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,170
Where are you off to?

112
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,940
I told you I got a job
watching Ok Ja's store for her.

113
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,010
I'm sorry, Mom.

114
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:40,610
For what?

115
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,720
For making grand promises
of giving you a life of luxury,

116
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,750
when in reality,
you had to take on a part-time job.

117
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,520
There's no need to apologize.

118
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,090
When things work out
between you and Chairman Han,

119
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,390
I'll be swimming in a pool of money
and then some.

120
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,530
Mom, come on. Enough with that!

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,040
It amazes me that I ever gave birth
to someone so dense.

122
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,410
It's fascinating.

123
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,350
Take me to the columbarium.

124
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,520
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

125
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:26,020
There's something
I need to confess to you, honey.

126
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:31,930
You had filled every space
within me,

127
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,770
and I never thought
I could fall for someone new.

128
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,240
However,

129
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,740
to my surprise,

130
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,520
I found someone
who could also fill my heart.

131
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,320
I pushed the thought away
and denied it several times,

132
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,460
but she came crashing back at me
like a wave.

133
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,460
You two have very little in common,

134
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:09,030
yet you still share many qualities.

135
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,410
I wanted...

136
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,910
to get...

137
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,450
your approval first.
That's why I'm here today.

138
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,880
(The late Kang Min Seo)

139
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,350
The woman I remember...

140
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,390
would definitely...

141
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,060
wish me the best.

142
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,090
Aren't I right, honey?

143
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:52,910
You're home early today.
Are you not feeling well?

144
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,180
I wasn't feeling well,
so I left the office early.

145
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,350
In what way
are you not feeling well?

146
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,280
Did something happen at the office?

147
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,550
Of course not.

148
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,620
Stop pestering me with questions.

149
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,660
Just bring me something
for this headache.

150
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,130
Does your head hurt?

151
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,860
It's ringing like crazy,

152
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,200
as if
someone is hammering away at it.

153
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,970
I'll get some right now.

154
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,980
Talk about a nasty turn of events.

155
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,250
One wrong move
could ruin this entire family.

156
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,280
Darn it!

157
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,790
Shoot.

158
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,060
As you know,

159
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,660
I've just regained my stability
after going through a stormy time.

160
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,900
I don't want to experience...

161
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,970
another whirlwind of emotions.

162
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,570
If you say something like this
one more time,

163
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,640
I won't see you again.

164
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,070
And I'll fire you
as my teaching assistant.

165
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,310
I'm about to go through...

166
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,610
a whirlwind of emotions myself.

167
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,130
(Gyeol)

168
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,550
This is made with my favorite beans.

169
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,660
I hope you will like it.

170
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,030
It does smell good.

171
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:14,590
Would you like some extra volume?

172
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,450
No. This is just right.

173
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,020
I love it.

174
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,060
- We're done, then.
- Okay.

175
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,430
Welcome.

176
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,900
Oh, okay.

177
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:38,040
- How much is it?
- Fifteen dollars.

178
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:39,910
Here.

179
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,720
I noticed while drying your hair
that you need a perm soon.

180
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,820
Drop by sometime this month.

181
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,350
I'll make you look great.

182
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,450
Okay. Bye.

183
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,220
- Thank you.
- Sure.

184
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,740
- We...
- You...

185
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,350
- You...
- You can go first.

186
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,050
You go first.

187
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,420
So, about yesterday.

188
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,890
I had too much to drink.

189
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,700
I wasn't in my right mind, actually.

190
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,840
The agency had rejected
my choreography,

191
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,110
so I was in despair.

192
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:48,050
When you said you used to be
the president of my fan club,

193
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,250
I was pleased.

194
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,950
I felt grateful and...

195
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:54,550
I won't try to tie you down...

196
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,320
just because
we spent a night together.

197
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,060
Don't worry.

198
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,330
Oh, gosh.

199
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:13,000
I feel so much better
now that I've heard you say that.

200
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:16,840
Thanks.

201
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,780
You don't have to thank me.

202
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,750
- Heung Soo.
- Yes?

203
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,960
You were fired
from the cultural center,

204
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,430
and the agency
rejected your choreography.

205
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,860
What will you do now?

206
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,130
I feel a bit lost, to be honest.

207
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,670
I'll contact
some other cultural centers.

208
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,340
I should go.

209
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:54,180
Wait, Heung Soo.

210
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,350
Why?

211
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,430
What's this for?

212
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,140
My dad told me long ago...

213
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,370
that a man could walk
straighter and taller...

214
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,840
with some cash in his pocket.

215
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,140
No.

216
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:28,550
I haven't even paid you back
for the taxi fare.

217
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,080
Pay me back in full
when you find a job.

218
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,680
Don't feel down or intimidated.

219
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,190
Be confident and dignified, okay?

220
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,660
Why are you so nice to me?

221
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,970
I'm the president of your fan club.

222
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,840
I'm on your side forever.

223
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,560
- It's my youngest brother. Hold on.
- Sure.

224
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,760
Hi, Kang Soo.

225
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,430
Can you talk?

226
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:20,630
Yes, why? Is something wrong?

227
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,200
Didn't you see the news?

228
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,740
The news? What news?

229
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,070
What?

230
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,670
Okay. Let's hang up.

231
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,010
What is it? Is something wrong?

232
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,980
Hang on.

233
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,220
Eagle Brewery's staff...

234
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,250
are denying all rumors
about the stale rice...

235
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,390
- that was in the news.
- Ms. Ma.

236
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:47,090
- The video that was released...
- Oh, my goodness.

237
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,930
What on earth is going on?

238
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,230
An investigation
will be launched soon...

239
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,160
I had no idea about any of this.

240
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,330
It's very likely.

241
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,040
Wait. Heung Soo, wait for me!

242
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,380
(Closed for the day)

243
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,750
(Closed for the day)

244
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,160
Hello, sir.

245
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,690
It's Eagle Brewery.

246
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,160
You're two months behind in payment.

247
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,860
Can you pay up?

248
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:34,100
The video in the news was faked.

249
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,740
The police caught the culprit.

250
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,180
The truth will come out soon.

251
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:44,050
We should help each other
when times are tough.

252
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,980
Is there anything you can do?

253
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,220
Please, sir.

254
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:50,890
Okay, then. Bye.

255
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,760
They used to bow and beg
to let them sell our makgeolli.

256
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,270
They won't have to pay us
if we go out of business,

257
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,270
so they keep making excuses...

258
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,110
to put off paying what they owe.

259
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,870
Everyone's like that
when things go wrong.

260
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,210
Hello.

261
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,880
Goodness, sir.

262
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,890
Can we help you?

263
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,460
Wait.

264
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,590
His company makes
our Jang-Kwang Makgeolli bottles.

265
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,690
I'm from Ilhan Industries.

266
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,830
I see.

267
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,060
Take a seat.

268
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,000
I saw the news report.

269
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,600
You must be worried.

270
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,310
Yes, I am.

271
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,540
Well...

272
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,950
I know you're stuck at the moment,

273
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,520
but we have to procure materials
in advance...

274
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,750
to make sure
we have enough products.

275
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,920
I'd be grateful if you could pay us
whatever you can.

276
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,460
Oh, you need us to pay.

277
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:07,530
Yes. Of course, we should pay you.

278
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:14,340
(3H Acupressure Bed)

279
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,440
Hey.

280
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,210
Hi.

281
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,640
Come in, Mr. Go.

282
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,680
(3H Acupressure Bed)

283
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,490
Thanks a lot.

284
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,060
There's no rush to pay me back.

285
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,900
Debts should be repaid soon.

286
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,430
It's all here.

287
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,440
Did you take a part-time job
to pay me back?

288
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,870
No.

289
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,370
I was getting sick
of being at home all day long too.

290
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,310
Multiple reasons.

291
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,180
Anyway, if it hadn't been for you,

292
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:58,980
I'd have suffered at the hands
of that Park Sang Nam.

293
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,520
And if Kwang Sook...

294
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,090
were to know
I was gifted a handbag...

295
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:06,920
She'd have turned the house
upside down.

296
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,260
Park Sang Nam
might have looked normal,

297
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,930
but he's no man at all.

298
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,030
Mrs. Gong, you seem to be...

299
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,000
a terrible judge of character
when it comes to men.

300
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:19,440
Pretty women
tend to be easily swayed.

301
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,510
Would you like a massage
while you're here?

302
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:26,510
Are you going to
put your hands on me?

303
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,540
What?

304
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,880
You'll feel so good after.

305
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,850
Come with me. Let's go.

306
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,350
My back was sore.
This might be good.

307
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,620
Lie down.

308
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,600
I feel it.

309
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,370
This feels so refreshing.

310
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,810
Refreshing but warm.

311
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,340
Warm but relaxing. Isn't it great?

312
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,310
It feels like
my muscle pains are gone.

313
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,320
Right, I have to
take care of the receipts.

314
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
Enjoy the massage, Mr. Go.

315
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,900
What?

316
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,740
He fell asleep already?

317
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:31,280
My goodness.

318
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,280
Unbelievable.

319
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,550
He snores just like my husband.

320
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,860
What?

321
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
My gosh.

322
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:02,740
Come on.

323
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,680
Why do you keep following me?

324
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,480
I wasn't following you.

325
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,880
I'm worried about Kwang Sook.

326
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,580
So I came here to see her face
and hold her hand.

327
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,550
Kwang Sook?

328
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:16,690
We decided to be friends.

329
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:17,920
You and my sister-in-law?

330
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,060
You're crossing the line here.
You really are.

331
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,160
I'm not crossing the line.
It's sisterhood.

332
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,430
Sisterhood?

333
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:31,070
Kwang Sook and I have
this friendship of girls.

334
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,540
Whatever.

335
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,500
Things are crazy here.

336
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,140
This isn't a situation
where you should interfere.

337
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,480
My family is having
an emergency meeting.

338
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,710
What right do you have to come here?

339
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,110
Is this...

340
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,250
about what happened last night?

341
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,920
I said I wouldn't hold you back.

342
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,060
Yes. That's it.

343
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,760
We have to know
where to draw the line, Ok Bun.

344
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:03,730
You should go.

345
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,440
Should I call you a taxi?

346
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,970
No.

347
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,610
I'm busy, so I should go in.

348
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,610
I'll call you later.

349
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:12,540
(Eagle Brewery)

350
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,150
I don't want to go back...

351
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,490
without seeing Kwang Sook
after coming all the way here.

352
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,390
Hey, Heung Soo.

353
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,460
You came so quickly.

354
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,230
You should've called me
as soon as it happened.

355
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,970
It's ridiculous that
I was the only one who didn't know.

356
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,330
Hey.

357
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:40,140
Kwang Sook asked us not to tell you.

358
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,010
You were having a hard time
after the breakup,

359
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:43,240
and she didn't want
to make things worse.

360
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,940
Chun Soo,
that has nothing to do with this.

361
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,010
Goodness.

362
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,510
Where's Beom Soo?

363
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:52,080
He should be here soon.

364
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:59,020
(Eagle Brewery)

365
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,410
My goodness!

366
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,240
Your baby is so adorable.

367
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:28,120
Are you Heung Soo's younger brother?

368
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,950
Oh, do you know my brother?

369
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,320
Yes.

370
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,890
Your brother just got here.

371
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,090
Go on in.

372
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,760
- Okay.
- All right, then.

373
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,300
By the way,

374
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,530
what's the baby's name?

375
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,370
It's Oh Ha Ni.

376
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:48,140
Oh Ha Ni? You're Oh Ha Ni.

377
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,510
How adorable.

378
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,580
- All right, then.
- Yes.

379
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,920
- Thank you.
- No problem.

380
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,190
All the brothers are good-looking.

381
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,230
But Heung Soo
is the best-looking one.

382
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,740
- I'm here.
- Hey.

383
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,770
Where's Kwang Sook?

384
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,170
She went to the bank for a loan.

385
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,780
Ha Ni, come to your uncle.

386
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:27,910
Come here. There you go.

387
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,680
By the way,
who is the woman at the gate?

388
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
A woman?

389
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,950
It seemed like she knew you well.

390
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,790
Is she still here?

391
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,220
My goodness.

392
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:47,400
(Eagle Brewery)

393
00:23:54,670 --> 00:23:56,710
Why are you still here?

394
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:02,480
I want to see Kwang Sook
for a moment before I leave.

395
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,780
She went to the bank.
She's not here.

396
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,750
When is she coming back?

397
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,220
How many times
do I have to tell you?

398
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,090
We have to know
where to draw the line, okay?

399
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,760
It's you who crossed the line.

400
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,560
What?

401
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:22,630
Last night, it was you who first...

402
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,670
Hey.

403
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,010
We have an emergency today,
so you should just go.

404
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:33,310
You can see her next time.

405
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,610
It's a disaster here today.

406
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,180
There is no one to welcome you.

407
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,780
Okay?

408
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,290
I see.

409
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,020
I'll leave.

410
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,560
I'll call you later.

411
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,840
When I think the worst is over,
there's something worse.

412
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,610
Honestly, I feel hopeless.

413
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,010
The companies...

414
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,380
that asked for a quick delivery
while paying the deposit...

415
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,320
are making a fuss
about getting their money back.

416
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,920
Gosh, I have never experienced
anything like this before,

417
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,520
so I don't know what to do.

418
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:23,160
They all know
how things are going here.

419
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,330
Things like this happened
a few times when we were young.

420
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,330
But the culprit has been caught.

421
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:29,900
Apparently,
she hasn't confessed to her crime.

422
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,400
Even if she does,

423
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,340
our brand is already ruined,

424
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,340
and consumers are shunning
our products.

425
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:39,240
So, what's the point?

426
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,080
What's the amount we have to
pay back to the bank right away?

427
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:44,850
It's 500,000 dollars.

428
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:45,920
Is it 500,000 dollars?

429
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,590
Kwang Sook asked for a loan
through the post office,

430
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,620
but it didn't work out.

431
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:53,060
If I hadn’t paid alimony to So Yeon,

432
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,460
I would have tried to do something.

433
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,660
I also asked
the Teachers' Credit Union...

434
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,530
and the school’s main bank,

435
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:01,530
but all I could do
was open an overdraft account.

436
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,470
Maybe I should just marry...

437
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,670
my fan who owns multiple buildings.

438
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,610
Then I could take care
of the brewery's debt.

439
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,140
There you go again.

440
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,210
How are you making a joke
in this situation?

441
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:14,340
I'm not joking.

442
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,750
Are you looking down on me again?

443
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:21,050
Heung Soo,
stop the nonsense and just sit.

444
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:23,490
I'm serious.

445
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,860
Maybe we should just...

446
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:33,830
sell our brewery to Silla Brewery.

447
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,570
- No way!
- We should never do that!

448
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:36,970
That's not a good idea, Chun Soo.

449
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,800
I know it's not a good idea.

450
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,870
But realistically, I'm not sure
if there will be any company...

451
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,380
that wants to take over our brewery.

452
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,410
Chun Soo.

453
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,080
Have you already forgotten
how our father suffered...

454
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,310
because of that jerk, Dokgo Tak?

455
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,180
How would I forget it?

456
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,220
I remember it vividly
as if it happened yesterday.

457
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,750
How could you say that
when you knew all that?

458
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:58,420
I was frustrated,
so it came out wrong. I'm sorry.

459
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,820
I'm sorry, guys.

460
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,900
(Yuil Bank)

461
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,770
The culprit has been caught.

462
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,710
You can call the police station
and check for yourself.

463
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,110
I'm glad to hear that.

464
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,480
Once everyone hears
that we were falsely accused,

465
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
this incident will be something
that never happened.

466
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,780
And the brewery
will be back on track.

467
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,290
Please grant permission
to extend the loan term.

468
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,660
This was not decided by our branch.

469
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,290
The head office made the decision,

470
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,360
so there's nothing we can do.

471
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,330
You're the branch manager.
There must be something you can do.

472
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,670
Instead of coming to us,

473
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,270
I suggest you reach out
to the head office directly...

474
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,410
if you know of someone
who can help you.

475
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,310
I have a meeting to attend,
so please excuse me.

476
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:54,980
Wait, but...

477
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,450
(Police)

478
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:07,520
I am a lawyer
with LX Group's legal team.

479
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,230
LX Hotel,
which is a part of LX Group,

480
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,930
is being supplied
with Eagle Brewery's makgeolli.

481
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:16,300
That's why we are interested
in this case.

482
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,670
If you confess to your crime
and offer your cooperation,

483
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,610
you might be shown leniency.

484
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,180
Should you choose to do so,
I will represent you...

485
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,480
until the end of your trial.

486
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,090
Your services...

487
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,320
must be expensive.

488
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,230
I don't have the money to pay you.

489
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,800
You won't have to worry
about my fee.

490
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,410
You're home.

491
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,210
We have fine weather today.

492
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,010
The flowers in the garden
are also in full bloom.

493
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,210
Sure.

494
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:02,650
You're home, Chairman Han.

495
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:07,250
I'll give you a few days off
so that you can enjoy the flowers.

496
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,420
Flowers have blossomed beautifully
all around.

497
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,450
Goodness me.

498
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,590
Thank you, sir.

499
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,660
Right.

500
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,430
His face is glowing
with smiles today.

501
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,670
He must be in a spectacular mood.

502
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,770
Tell me about it.
Could something good have happened?

503
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,480
Yes, Attorney Jeong.

504
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,780
I was just with the suspect, sir.

505
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,280
How did it go?

506
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,480
I have a feeling
she'll soon confess.

507
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,550
Is that so?

508
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:42,950
Her mother is staying
at a nursing hospital.

509
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,890
My guess is that
she filmed the video...

510
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,190
to cover her mother's medical bills.

511
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,460
Time is of the essence.

512
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:52,160
The truth must come out...

513
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,760
before things get worse
for Eagle Brewery.

514
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,200
Mother.

515
00:29:58,570 --> 00:30:00,340
What brings you here unannounced?

516
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,210
I dropped by
on my way home from work.

517
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:03,510
Goodness, you're here.

518
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,670
Hello, sir.

519
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,210
You must've been having dinner.

520
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:08,210
Actually, we haven't eaten yet.

521
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,280
There isn't much,
but why not join us for dinner?

522
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,880
Maybe I should.

523
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,450
- Sure.
- Let's go.

524
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,220
Goodness.

525
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,960
By the way, where's Se Ri?

526
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,930
She wasn't hungry,
so she stayed in her room.

527
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,760
- I'll bring her downstairs.
- Mother.

528
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,030
Hold on.

529
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,800
Here you go.

530
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:31,300
What could this be?

531
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,770
It's Parents' Day soon.

532
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,870
I got it for you
while getting some for my dad.

533
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,170
I hear it works wonders
for those in your age range.

534
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,340
Please try some.

535
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,380
Aren't you sweet?

536
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,950
Maybe it's all the golfing.

537
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:48,050
My wrists have been aching lately.
Just my luck.

538
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,090
Are you taking some right now?

539
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,960
It's the first gift
from my son-in-law.

540
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,160
Of course, I should take some now.

541
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,390
He must love it.

542
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:01,900
- Take some too.
- What?

543
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:04,970
My knees
have actually been sore lately,

544
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,470
so maybe I should.

545
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,580
Goodness. Thank you for this.

546
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,180
Don't just stand there.
Bring us dinner.

547
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,650
Sure, honey.

548
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,050
Why don't I bring Se Ri downstairs?

549
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:24,450
- Would you do that?
- Sure.

550
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,730
Come in.

551
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,670
Gyeol?

552
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,840
When did you get here?

553
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,770
A moment ago.

554
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,240
It doesn't seem right for you
to come by my house...

555
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,980
without calling in advance.

556
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:52,150
You've been ignoring my calls.

557
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:57,420
I actually came by today
to ask you something.

558
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,220
Our wedding.

559
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,990
Have the parents and I...

560
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,300
been pressuring you into this
when you're clearly not interested?

561
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,200
I'd like an honest answer.

562
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,640
That's better for us both.

563
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:25,320
I don't want to deceive you.

564
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,490
I have feelings for someone else.

565
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,190
My heart skips a beat
when I see him.

566
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,090
I'm curious about him.

567
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,330
And I worry about him.

568
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,400
I found someone
who makes me feel that way.

569
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:48,910
I've been trying
to gather the courage to tell you,

570
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,870
but the timing never felt right.

571
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,350
Because I thought of you
as a brother since I was a child,

572
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:00,380
what I felt for you...

573
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,820
never grew into romantic feelings
that could lead to marriage.

574
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,590
I should've realized sooner
how I truly felt about you.

575
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,130
It only became clear to me recently.

576
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,670
That man you have feelings for.

577
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,370
Can I ask about him?

578
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,750
I'm sorry to have to tell you this,

579
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,750
but he's the man of my dreams.

580
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,790
That's why even his shortcomings...

581
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,230
don't matter to me at all.

582
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,400
When I'm with him,

583
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,600
I don't want to be calculative.

584
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,670
The soup's getting cold.
What's taking them so long?

585
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,910
Gyeol, that punk.

586
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,210
Could he be crossing the line
before their wedding?

587
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,210
Leave them be.

588
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,380
They're going to marry anyway,
so it's actually for the best.

589
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,180
Are you kidding me, woman?
What do you think you're saying?

590
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:09,450
That's not something
a mother with a daughter should say!

591
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,790
Fine. I'll go and check on them.

592
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,800
You'd only say that...

593
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:23,670
if you liked him a lot.

594
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,940
I'm sorry, Gyeol.

595
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,080
Don't be.

596
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:40,050
I was also wrong to assume
that this marriage was set in stone.

597
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,450
If I hadn't met him,

598
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,290
I might've married you.

599
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,960
But now that I've become aware
of these precious feelings,

600
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,660
I can't ignore them and marry you.

601
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,830
What on earth are you saying?

602
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,670
What did I warn you
about speaking nonsense?

603
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,070
Mother, please calm down.

604
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:06,040
She was gaslighted by a man
and isn't thinking straight.

605
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,480
So please pretend
you didn't hear any of that, okay?

606
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,580
Mom.

607
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,650
I dare you to say one more word.

608
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:14,120
If you do,
I'll take my life right here.

609
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,990
What could possibly explain...

610
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,260
how our Se Ri fell
for a divorced single father?

611
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,830
Being as naive
and compassionate as she is,

612
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,300
she feels bad for him
and has mistaken pity for love.

613
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,610
As you know,
Se Ri is as gullible as they get...

614
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:36,870
and is too pure.

615
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:39,740
Her heart is too pure.

616
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,380
This shows
her immaturity and childishness.

617
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:49,620
So please,
don't be angry about this.

618
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,420
I ask that you help her
snap back to reality.

619
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,660
I'm begging you. Please?

620
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:14,210
Look at that.
She's not fussy at all.

621
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,250
Aren't you going to remarry?

622
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,560
Where did that come from?

623
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,790
You can't stay a single father,
raising Ha Ni your whole life.

624
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,100
I don't know if it'll be forever,

625
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,330
but I'll focus on raising her
for the time being.

626
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:40,270
I don't have room in my heart,

627
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,500
and my confidence
has been shattered.

628
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,870
What about you, Heung Soo?

629
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,740
- Me?
- Yes.

630
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,720
I can barely take care of myself.
Marriage? No way.

631
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:56,490
What's going on between you
and that lady with curls?

632
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,850
Oh, her?

633
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,090
She used to be
the president of my fan club.

634
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:03,860
Is that it?

635
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,530
That's all it should've been,

636
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,660
but I don't think it is.

637
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,130
What do you mean by that?

638
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,500
Beats me.

639
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,240
Even I can't make sense
of what I'm saying.

640
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,910
My gosh.

641
00:37:26,550 --> 00:37:30,320
(Eagle Brewery)

642
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,120
Mi Sun.

643
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,220
Hey.

644
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,560
Are you heading home from work?

645
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:40,930
Yes.

646
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:44,130
What about you?
Were you still working?

647
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,840
Well, I was going over the books...

648
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,340
and calling our clients.

649
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,040
Would you like to come in
for a cup of tea?

650
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,340
Sure.

651
00:37:56,950 --> 00:37:58,050
Here you go.

652
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,620
- Thanks.
- Sure.

653
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,850
I'll enjoy this.

654
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,030
Is something troubling you?

655
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,870
What?

656
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,800
Why do you ask?

657
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,000
A shadow is cast across your face.

658
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:23,970
I thought the arrest
of the suspect...

659
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,080
would lift some weight
off your shoulders.

660
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,310
It's good that
they have the suspect in custody,

661
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,650
but the brewery took a huge blow
because of this incident.

662
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,850
I don't know
if we'll recover from this.

663
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,020
Of course.
I guess it'll take some time...

664
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,420
for operations to return to normal.

665
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,030
We need to weather the storm
until then,

666
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:46,800
and that worries me.

667
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,600
You can do this, Chun Soo.

668
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,440
I have faith in you.

669
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,910
Mi Sun, you...

670
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,710
You always manage
to boost my morale.

671
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,480
Thanks.

672
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:09,590
Actually, I should be thanking you.

673
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,990
The fact that you moved back here.

674
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:16,590
Not crumbling despite the hardships.

675
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,830
I'm grateful for everything,
including this presence you have.

676
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,110
If we're comparing notes,
I have more to be thankful for.

677
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:32,880
I almost died,

678
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,540
but you saved my life.

679
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,150
This time around,
you helped us catch the culprit.

680
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,650
I owe you my life.

681
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,920
How about we spend
the rest of our lives...

682
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,260
owing each other everything
and treating one another...

683
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,030
with respect?

684
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,030
Maybe we should.

685
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:14,020
I thought about this place
from time to time.

686
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:16,220
Do you remember...

687
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:18,850
giving me draff when we were young?

688
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,960
You used to come by the brewery
in tears...

689
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,290
whenever your stepmother
scolded you.

690
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,360
I can't believe you remember that.

691
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,060
How could I forget
you being in tears?

692
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,430
I may have been young,
but it broke my heart.

693
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,140
I see.

694
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,440
Why don't we...

695
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,480
have some draff
like in the old days?

696
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,120
(Eagle Brewery)

697
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:15,010
All done.

698
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,780
Here. Try one.

699
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:30,990
No way.

700
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,630
It tastes just like it used to.

701
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
I know.

702
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,030
We still follow the same recipe
for the liquor,

703
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,340
so the draff
should probably taste the same.

704
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,310
You're right.

705
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,180
It tastes
just like it did back then.

706
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,180
My gosh.

707
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,850
I must be getting older.

708
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:58,750
Nostalgia always brings tears.

709
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,290
You must think I'm weird.

710
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,190
Hardly.

711
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,430
I find myself reminiscing a lot too.

712
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,600
If only I could go back in time.

713
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,870
If I were given a second chance,

714
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,550
I would make a wiser choice.

715
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,280
Hang on.

716
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,750
I thought you were headed
to the brewery.

717
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:05,320
Well, I was tired, so I came back.

718
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,160
You should call...

719
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,360
Chairman Han.

720
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,530
To say what?

721
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,600
He went out of his way to help us,

722
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,370
so you should thank him.

723
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:22,240
I thanked him
when he came by the brewery earlier.

724
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:26,180
You have no romantic bone
in your body, do you?

725
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,650
Why are you looking at me like that?

726
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:37,890
When I conceived you,

727
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:40,020
I dreamed of a golden pig
with a magic pearl in its mouth...

728
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,320
soaring into the sky.

729
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:44,930
I finally know why.

730
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,000
A golden...

731
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:48,430
A pig, and not a dragon,

732
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:49,870
soared into the sky
with a magic pearl in its mouth?

733
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,940
You were born
to live a life of wealth.

734
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,540
A life of wealth, my foot.

735
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:56,210
If I can't repay the loan,

736
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,710
our assets might be seized.

737
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:01,440
Let them seize all we have.
See if I care.

738
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,510
You're destined to be
the wife of LX Hotel's chairman.

739
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:09,020
Not again. Didn't I tell you
to quit that nonsense?

740
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,950
Just wait, and you'll see I'm right.

741
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:15,420
Mom. If you keep spouting
this nonsense,

742
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,690
I'll take you to a doctor...

743
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,560
to be checked for dementia.

744
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,130
Don't accuse me of having dementia
when I don't,

745
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,630
and let's see if I'm right.

746
00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:34,510
What's her problem?

747
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,820
Should I send this to CEO Ma?

748
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,190
(Eagle Brewery Ma Kwang Sook)

749
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:56,070
I'm sending you the photo we took
at the pear orchard.

750
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,130
We both...

751
00:44:59,070 --> 00:45:01,140
look good in it.

752
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,270
(We both look good in it.)

753
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:07,040
Hold on.
Would that seem to lack emotion?

754
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,820
It was an unexpected trip,

755
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:19,150
but I had a good time.

756
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,620
Han Dong Seok.

757
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,260
(Han Dong Seok)

758
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,200
Shoot. There has to be
a more graceful way to say this.

759
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,380
Unbelievable.

760
00:46:19,450 --> 00:46:21,750
We'd set off to avoid wasting...

761
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,590
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

762
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,360
Wait, no. Come on.

763
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:29,220
But I was pleased
to make such beautiful memories...

764
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,660
on a spring day
of raining petals and flowers.

765
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,660
I know
you have a lot going on right now,

766
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,400
so I hope this photo helps you
take a moment to relax.

767
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:46,880
LX Hotel's Han Dong Seok.

768
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,280
Wait, that sounds wrong.

769
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,280
Han Dong Seok.

770
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,920
(Han Dong Seok)

771
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:55,920
No.

772
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,490
Dong Seok.

773
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,400
Let's see.

774
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:11,000
Hold on, makgeolli, flowers...

775
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:13,500
Oh, no.

776
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,810
Shoot. I wanted to read through it
once more.

777
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,420
(LX Hotel Chairman Han Dong Seok)

778
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,990
(We'd set off to avoid wasting
Jang-Kwang Makgeolli,)

779
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:38,460
(but I was pleased
to make such beautiful memories...)

780
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,900
(on a spring day
of raining petals and flowers.)

781
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,300
(I hope this photo helps you
take a moment to relax.)

782
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:45,200
(Dong Seok)

783
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,130
Okay.

784
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:12,760
Okay.

785
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,630
(Okay.)

786
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:17,900
"Okay?"

787
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,040
What?

788
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,110
My goodness.

789
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:27,610
I put so much care
into writing a long message.

790
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:30,980
"Okay?" What is that?

791
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:33,120
I'm older than she is,

792
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,080
and I'm the chairman
of the hotel that she supplies.

793
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,750
I even drove the truck
back to Seoul.

794
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:39,860
"Okay?"

795
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:43,460
Isn't this too mean?

796
00:48:52,870 --> 00:48:54,200
Hello, sir.

797
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:58,040
Don't you think that was a bit rude?

798
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:00,880
What was?

799
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,780
I could've sent it some other time,

800
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,910
but I sent you the photo now...

801
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:07,050
with a long message for your sake.

802
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,680
All I got was an "okay."

803
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:11,620
How could you reply
with just one word?

804
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,920
Oh, well...

805
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,290
"Thank you for the photo."

806
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,830
"It's a lovely photo."

807
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,700
"We look great."

808
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,670
Shouldn't you have texted back
something along those lines?

809
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:28,270
You see, I got the text
while washing my face.

810
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,670
I sent the short reply
to acknowledge receipt...

811
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,740
and meant to send
a decent reply later.

812
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:36,480
Oh, was that your intention?

813
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:41,950
Yes. It's a really pretty photo.

814
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:44,520
Do you like it?

815
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,160
Yes. I like it.

816
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:52,160
I'm glad that you like it.

817
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,530
Okay, then. Bye.

818
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,740
I'm glad she likes it.

819
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:13,620
Wait, what?

820
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,220
He did the same last time.

821
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,450
Yes.

822
00:50:17,090 --> 00:50:19,890
He sent a one-word reply too.

823
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,400
I feel like...

824
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,610
the photo smells of flowers.

825
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,870
The aroma is even richer today.

826
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,850
I'm home.

827
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,780
Yes, hi.

828
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:22,520
You said you'd drop by Se Ri's.
Did you see her?

829
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,190
Dad.

830
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:27,620
What? Do you want to talk?

831
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,660
I'll tell you later.

832
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:33,360
Good night.

833
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:41,100
Is something wrong?

834
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,280
Mom.

835
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,960
I'm sorry, Mom.

836
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,700
I'm really sorry.

837
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:11,700
Instead of being angry,

838
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,870
can't you try to understand me?

839
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,070
Keep your mouth shut.

840
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:18,840
Your dad might hear.

841
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:40,230
I'm Dokgo Se Ri's mother.

842
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:42,860
I believe
you have a lecture tomorrow.

843
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:46,130
I'll come to your office
30 minutes before it starts.

844
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,410
Why would her mother want to see me?

845
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:54,810
There we go.

846
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:03,950
- Goodness.
- You're home.

847
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:05,490
Hello.

848
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:07,890
The deadline came and went.

849
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:09,960
Why haven't you paid your rent yet?

850
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,600
I'm still waiting for my pay
to come in.

851
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,960
I promise I'll pay you this week.

852
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,730
You barely paid me last month.

853
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:18,430
You can't keep doing this.

854
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:21,000
I know. I'll wire the money
before the end of the week.

855
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:22,170
Don't worry.

856
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:24,340
Please don't make me come here again
to collect rent.

857
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:27,640
My knees are sore,
and I hate climbing the steps.

858
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:29,110
I get it.

859
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:31,110
Sorry.

860
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,280
Isn't it a lovely day?

861
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:40,820
Get down safely.

862
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,000
My goodness.

863
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,470
How much is the monthly rent?

864
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,740
I'll pay whatever is in arrears...

865
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,010
and the next three months' rent
all at once.

866
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:07,580
Why would you do that?

867
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:11,020
Are you his girlfriend?

868
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,220
I'll give you my number.

869
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,830
Text me your account details
and the amount.

870
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:23,730
Here.

871
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:31,740
Goodness.

872
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:33,680
I didn't know...

873
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,010
the rooftop guy had
such a slim and pretty girlfriend.

874
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:38,880
Oh, please.

875
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,120
I'll wire the money
as soon as you text me.

876
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:45,150
Thanks, miss.

877
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:47,490
- Go on up. Hurry.
- Okay.

878
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,690
My gosh.

879
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,830
Oh, dear.

880
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,340
He looks fine on the outside,

881
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,810
but he's a pauper.

882
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:05,740
Oh, boy.

883
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,580
Heung Soo, I'm coming in.

884
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,520
You can't have ramyeon
for breakfast.

885
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:23,430
What's all this?

886
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,060
I bought some groceries.

887
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:32,900
- Goodness.
- Let's make a soup...

888
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:36,000
with beef and radish
and have a full breakfast.

889
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,540
The harder life is,
the better you must eat.

890
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:42,680
I'm thankful and all,

891
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,050
but I feel almost uncomfortable.

892
00:55:46,610 --> 00:55:49,820
I'm not trying to tie you down
because of that night.

893
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,890
Don't worry.

894
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,160
Wash this for me.

895
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:05,370
Welcome.

896
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:07,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

897
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,810
What sells well these days?

898
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:16,410
Ladies like
something colorful like this.

899
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:17,910
And men...

900
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:20,280
like bright-colored items
that are easy to move around in.

901
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:22,880
I see. I like both options.

902
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:25,720
They're quite comfortable,
so couples often buy a set.

903
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,790
I like it.

904
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:33,030
You'd look great in it.
Shall I get it in your size?

905
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:34,960
- Yes.
- Give me a moment.

906
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:55,220
Come in.

907
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,730
Do you recognize me?

908
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,660
Ms. Jang?

909
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:12,070
Yes.

910
00:57:12,830 --> 00:57:14,270
It's me, Ms. Jang.

911
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,570
What brings you here?

912
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:22,110
I'm Se Ri's mom.

913
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:25,810
What?

914
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:27,820
Who knew...

915
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:30,650
we'd meet again like this?

916
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:38,930
(Letter of Resignation)

917
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:41,700
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

918
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:42,730
Sir.

919
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:45,800
Please take care.

920
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,870
Don't worry about the rest.

921
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:52,740
I'll call you
when things settle down,

922
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,910
so make sure to exercise
and take good care of your health.

923
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,950
It won't take long.

924
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,190
Don't get yourself into trouble
with a woman again like last time.

925
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:14,930
Please don't worry.

926
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,100
I'll live like a monk
until I come back.

927
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:20,200
Just make sure
not to get into any trouble.

928
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:23,040
Did you tell your wife
to keep her mouth shut?

929
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:24,040
Yes, sir.

930
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:27,740
She will be better off without me.

931
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:29,380
Goodness.

932
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,810
You've caused so much trouble
because of women.

933
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:36,950
Anyway, you don't have to worry
about here.

934
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:39,720
I'll have the secretaries
take care of your wife.

935
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:42,390
What time is your flight?

936
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,890
I should leave now.

937
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,260
Then you should get going.

938
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,960
Please stay healthy
until we meet again.

939
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:53,900
All right.

940
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,570
It will be over soon.

941
00:58:58,210 --> 00:58:59,440
I'll see you soon.

942
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,080
Yes. All right, then.

943
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:03,510
I'll get going.

944
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:13,690
Oh, dear.

945
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:16,060
I let him take care of things...

946
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,760
just because
he was a founding member.

947
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,130
How would things go well?

948
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,560
My goodness.

949
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:26,700
Please let me meet the culprit,
Detective.

950
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:30,270
I really need to meet her
and ask her something in person.

951
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,270
I understand you want
to get this sorted out quickly,

952
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:35,240
but we're doing our best
to investigate the case.

953
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,450
What's the point
of catching the culprit?

954
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,280
We're standing on the verge
of bankruptcy every day.

955
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:44,720
We have to clear our name quickly...

956
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,320
and reveal the truth...

957
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,220
so we can do something too.

958
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:51,360
Actually, the suspect is meeting
with an attorney now.

959
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:53,460
An attorney?

960
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:56,500
Yes. The attorney is
from LX Group's legal team.

961
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,100
Unless you confess,

962
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,840
there's nothing
I can do to help you.

963
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:08,680
If you don't tell the truth,

964
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:10,610
your crime may become
more serious...

965
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:12,380
because you are trying
to cover it up.

966
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:17,120
Eagle Brewery is
on the verge of bankruptcy now,

967
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:19,590
so you should reveal the truth...

968
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,560
and help them recover.

969
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:23,690
It will eventually be the way
to protect yourself.

970
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,270
Listen. If you reveal the identity
of the person behind this,

971
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,430
you can avoid imprisonment.

972
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:37,040
But if you refuse to cooperate
with the investigation like this,

973
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:39,870
you will have to take the fall
for everything.

974
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:47,250
If I confess everything,

975
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:50,220
will I really...

976
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:52,990
be able to avoid imprisonment?

977
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:57,090
Confessing doesn't make
the crime itself disappear,

978
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:59,660
but you can easily get
a suspended sentence.

979
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:01,400
In that case,

980
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:03,660
you'll be able
to take care of your mother again.

981
01:01:13,510 --> 01:01:14,740
(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

982
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:16,180
Thank you.

983
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:19,910
Mr. Chairman.
It looks like someone's calling you.

984
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:24,290
I put it on mute during the meeting
and forgot to turn it back on.

985
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,690
Hello, Attorney Jeong.

986
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,730
The suspect started talking.

987
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,730
She did?

988
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:35,930
Why on earth did she do that?

989
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:37,600
As expected,

990
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:40,470
she was instigated
with financial compensation.

991
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:42,670
She was
in a bad financial situation...

992
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:44,570
because she had to
take care of her sick mother.

993
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:47,280
Her distant relative, who was
an executive of a major company,

994
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,340
offered to send her mother
to a nursing hospital...

995
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:52,710
and support her financially
to make her do such a thing.

996
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:54,580
That sounds horrible.

997
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,750
So? Who is behind all this?

998
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:00,960
I haven't figured out
the direct connection...

999
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,360
with the company yet,

1000
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:04,130
but the person who gave the order...

1001
01:02:04,290 --> 01:02:07,160
was Director Seo Gil Yong
of Silla Brewery.

1002
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,230
What?

1003
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:11,930
Silla Brewery?

1004
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,810
(Silla Brewery)

1005
01:02:22,410 --> 01:02:24,280
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

1006
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,750
Is Director Seo Gil Yong
in the office?

1007
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:26,980
We need to go in.

1008
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:28,120
Who are you?

1009
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,120
- You can't be doing this here.
- What's all the fuss?

1010
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,320
We're on official duty,
so please cooperate.

1011
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,590
Are you in there?

1012
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:37,790
Who are you?

1013
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,200
I'm Detective Kim Jong Hoon
from the Investigation Division.

1014
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:48,600
I see.
What brings you here, officers?

1015
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:50,810
We're here to meet Director Seo.

1016
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:53,570
This is not an arrest
under a formal warrant,

1017
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:55,110
but a voluntary escort
for investigation.

1018
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,410
Where is Director Seo Gil Yong now?

1019
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:48,230
(For Eagle Brothers)

1020
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,930
Please give up your greed!

1021
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:53,730
Without that greed,
I wouldn't have come this far!

1022
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:56,100
Stop making
cheap makgeolli like this...

1023
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:59,610
and come up with a proper one
to compete with me fairly!

1024
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:01,240
Ok Bun.

1025
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:03,210
We promised
not to tie each other down.

1026
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:05,780
Are you looking down on me
just because you have some money?

1027
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:07,280
By the way, Mr. Han,

1028
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,250
I feel like I've been receiving
a lot from you lately,

1029
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:11,490
which makes me uncomfortable.

1030
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:13,190
I'll do the giving,

1031
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,620
so you just have to receive.

1032
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:18,060
What?
