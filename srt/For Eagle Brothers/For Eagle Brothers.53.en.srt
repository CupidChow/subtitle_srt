00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,240
(Episode 53)

2
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,380
Don't you think...

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,980
we're the oldest couple here?

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,590
Physical age doesn't matter.

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,700
Actually,

6
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,370
what I fear more
than a geriatric pregnancy...

7
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,100
is the disappointment
you'll experience...

8
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:33,770
if you get your hopes up.

9
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,240
I won't be disappointed,

10
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,440
so don't worry ahead of time.

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,980
Ma Kwang Sook and Han Dong Seok.

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,120
Here.

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,280
Let's go.

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,590
You had tests today...

15
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,990
to check your chances
of pregnancy and infertility.

16
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,630
That's right.

17
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,330
We're on the older side, you see.

18
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:06,040
Ms. Ma, we conducted blood tests
and a uterine sonogram for you.

19
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,710
Your husband was also tested.

20
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,880
Yes, we completed them
without any issues.

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,820
I hate to break this to you.

22
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,550
Why? Is something wrong?

23
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,990
You jumped through hoops
for no reason.

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
Ms. Ma,

25
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,460
you're already four weeks along.

26
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,800
- What?
- What?

27
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,510
Are you saying we're already...

28
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:45,780
Are you saying I'm expecting?

29
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,680
That's right. Congratulations.

30
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,520
How could this be?

31
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,760
I haven't experienced any signs
that would suggest I'm pregnant.

32
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:03,290
Both your blood work and sonogram
confirmed it.

33
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,600
Hubby.

34
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,340
You need to be careful
from this point forward.

35
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,040
Ms. Ma, due to your age,

36
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,210
your pregnancy
is considered high-risk.

37
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,610
- Of course.
- You must be especially careful...

38
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,010
during the first few weeks.

39
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,780
Sure. We'll be extra careful.

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,060
You're most vulnerable...

41
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,890
between the 4th and 6th weeks
of pregnancy.

42
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,590
Avoid strenuous physical activities,
high stress,

43
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,130
and long-distance travel.

44
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,560
Also, focus on eating foods
that are easy to digest.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,270
Got it.

46
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,340
- May I take your credit card?
- Oh, sure.

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,420
- Pay by installments?
- I'll pay the full amount.

48
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,490
Sure.

49
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,790
Please sign.

50
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,820
Of course.

51
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,880
The doors are closing.

52
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,050
What did I tell you?

53
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,620
I knew it felt like
a conception dream.

54
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,190
I was spot on.

55
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,290
Tell me about it.

56
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,860
It hasn't fully hit me yet.

57
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:45,560
I'm worried,

58
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,430
and it feels like
my insides are screaming.

59
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,500
Why worry...

60
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,340
when we've been blessed
by a miracle?

61
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,070
All we need to do is be grateful.

62
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,450
I never believed
pregnancy was possible for me...

63
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,350
at this age.

64
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,020
I also felt selfish,
which made me hesitant...

65
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,850
about having a child.

66
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,320
How did I end up...

67
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,290
being blessed with such a fortune?

68
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,200
You were blessed
simply because you are who you are.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,930
You received love, a miracle,
and now a baby.

70
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,140
You truly deserve them all.

71
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,040
Please don't say that.
You're making me cry.

72
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,350
Tears of joy are always welcome.

73
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:41,890
Thank you.

74
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,190
Thank you so much.

75
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,960
Seriously, I sure hit the jackpot
with my wife.

76
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,000
Wait, we should call your mother.

77
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,070
Sure.

78
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,580
Dong Seok, hi.

79
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,750
It's not like you
to call me at this hour.

80
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,950
Congratulations.

81
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,020
Congratulations?

82
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,460
What for? Did something happen?

83
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,700
Mother,

84
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,600
you'll be a grandmother.

85
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,370
What?

86
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,000
We're just coming
from a doctor's appointment...

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,170
at the women's clinic.

88
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,270
She's four weeks pregnant.

89
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,950
Dear deities and ancestors,
thank you.

90
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:41,950
Thank you!

91
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,750
Kwang Sook accomplished
something amazing.

92
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,850
Kwang Sook's not the only one
who deserves praise.

93
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,990
You accomplished this as well.

94
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,630
You two make the best couple ever.

95
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,330
The dynamic duo.

96
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,600
Thank you, Mother.

97
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,670
I'll put Kwang Sook on.

98
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,940
Mom.

99
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,970
Well done, my daughter.

100
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,540
I never imagined
this would happen to me.

101
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,580
It hasn't...

102
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,920
fully hit me yet,
and I'm still in shock.

103
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,890
I felt the same way
when I was pregnant with you.

104
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,790
It's the same for everyone.

105
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,330
It feels like I'm dreaming.

106
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,030
It's all so surreal.

107
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,070
Well done, darling.

108
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:37,640
For enduring
every hardship gracefully,

109
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,570
you were given a reward from above.
Don't you agree?

110
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,980
As your mom,

111
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,950
I hope you have
a daughter like you...

112
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,880
I'd like to say that,

113
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,120
but to be honest,

114
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,590
I hope you have
a son like Dong Seok.

115
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,390
I agree.

116
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,630
Rather than a girl like me,

117
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,760
a boy like Dong Seok is much better.

118
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,830
Don't be silly.

119
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,430
Rather than a boy like me,

120
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,370
I want a girl like you.

121
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,840
You're very wrong about that.

122
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:16,410
I'm not.

123
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,940
A girl like you
would be smart and decisive.

124
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,410
If you consider looks
and temperament,

125
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,150
it would be much better
to have a child like you.

126
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,120
No way.

127
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,520
I'm right, okay?

128
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,460
I think it would be great...

129
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:37,200
if the child were a mix of you both.

130
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,270
That would work.

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,070
Mom.

132
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,270
We agreed that our baby...

133
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:51,380
should be half like me
and half like Dong Seok.

134
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,490
Goodness.

135
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,730
Is Ha Ni asleep?

136
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,160
She fought to stay awake
even though she was sleepy.

137
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,330
I patted her back gently,
and she just went to bed.

138
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,070
You're an expert.

139
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,180
Raising her alone
must be hard on Professor Oh.

140
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:26,180
Seeing Ha Ni's sleeping face...

141
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,950
made me emotional.

142
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,250
It's easy to say
a single dad can manage,

143
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,850
but every day
must've been a struggle.

144
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,590
Beom Soo still handled that.

145
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,690
He never let it show
that it was hard on him.

146
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,270
That must be him.

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,040
Hello.

148
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,340
Welcome.

149
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,140
It's hard work, isn't it?

150
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,280
Not at all.

151
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,680
I talked to the lawyers.

152
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,180
Getting a non-guilty verdict
at this stage...

153
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,880
is practically impossible.

154
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,590
Showing the judge
that he's remorseful...

155
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,060
and repents for what he did
is his best chance.

156
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,890
And he must admit his involvement
when there's evidence showing that.

157
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,230
I see.

158
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,930
That's the only way
the petition will have effect.

159
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,500
It can't be easy for the victim
to write a petition...

160
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,040
before we even asked.

161
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,440
I'm sure he'll change his attitude
when he hears this.

162
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,550
Thank you.

163
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,250
It wasn't me.

164
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,420
It was Kwang Sook and Chun Soo
who decided to be lenient.

165
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,820
I don't know how to make up
for everything we owe.

166
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,390
Thanks for everything
when you must be busy...

167
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,030
with your full-time job already.

168
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,760
Not at all.

169
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Wasn't Ha Ni a handful?

170
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,570
Ha Ni...

171
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,500
is so much like Se Ri as a baby.

172
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,010
Looking after her
was like going back in time.

173
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,740
I lost track of time.

174
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:10,050
Dad said Ha Ni looked just like me
when he first saw her.

175
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,580
- Do we really look alike?
- Yes.

176
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,190
So much so that it's shocking.

177
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:18,120
Her smile and her sleeping face.

178
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,460
I guess...

179
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:25,230
you were meant to be Ha Ni's mom.

180
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,770
- Se Ri.
- Yes?

181
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:36,340
He must be hungry. Heat the soup.

182
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,740
- Right.
- No, I'm fine.

183
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,110
I'll eat at home.

184
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,680
My mom cooked a soup
and some side dishes.

185
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,320
We just have to heat the soup.
Stay for dinner.

186
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,920
- Thank you.
- Sure.

187
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,830
Spending time with Ha Ni...

188
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,930
cheered my mom up.

189
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,330
Did it?

190
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,470
She hadn't smiled once...

191
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,640
after my dad got detained.

192
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,040
She smiled a lot
while babysitting Ha Ni.

193
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:10,740
She talked a lot too,

194
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,010
and I felt much better.

195
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,410
That's good to hear.
How are you doing?

196
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,050
My heart breaks
when I think of my dad,

197
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,620
but as Mom said, I'm trying
to think of it as a new beginning.

198
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,900
Is he still refusing her visits?

199
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:33,730
Yes.

200
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,030
She went this morning,

201
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,840
but didn't get to see him.

202
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,610
She knows
Dad won't agree to see her,

203
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,110
but she goes every day.

204
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,640
She's pretty tough.

205
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,350
She is.

206
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,150
My mom made these pickles.

207
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,660
Try it.

208
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,530
Thanks.

209
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,830
How is it?

210
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,300
It's good.

211
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,370
You have one too.

212
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,370
Eat all you want.

213
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:20,950
- Four weeks pregnant?
- Four weeks pregnant?

214
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:22,450
Yes.

215
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,650
The doctor confirmed it.

216
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,180
That's incredible.

217
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:30,790
You pulled it off at your age.
You two are amazing.

218
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,560
You're legends.

219
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,890
Congratulations.

220
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:35,430
Congratulations, Kwang Sook.

221
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,790
Thanks, Mi Sun.

222
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,200
I was a bit worried
until a while ago,

223
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,430
but your support gave me courage.

224
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,270
You're healthy,
and your baby will be too.

225
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,110
Thanks, Kang Soo.

226
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,610
Have you named the baby?

227
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,350
Not yet.

228
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,080
What did you name yours, Ok Bun?

229
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,050
We named our unborn baby Hanbang.

230
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,950
"Hanbang?"

231
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,820
That's a bit...

232
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,630
We're home.

233
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,060
- Hey!
- Ha Ni.

234
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,530
Ha Ni.

235
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,400
You'll have a cousin
other than Hanbang.

236
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
What do you mean?

237
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,910
Kwang Sook is four weeks pregnant.

238
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,070
What?

239
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,940
- Ha Ni's home.
- Ha Ni. You'll be a big sister.

240
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,040
Applause.

241
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,510
Well done.

242
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,050
Are you happy?

243
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,830
The spirits
that govern childbirth...

244
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,000
have gone all in
on the brewery family.

245
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,970
They gave us two babies already.

246
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Right?

247
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,410
What is it? Are you upset?

248
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,710
No.

249
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,880
I'm not upset. I just wonder...

250
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,650
why I'm not pregnant yet...

251
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,390
when Kwang Sook and Ok Bun...

252
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,390
seem to have gotten pregnant
so easily.

253
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,590
That thought hit me earlier.

254
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,370
Dong Seok and Heung Soo
don't know what's coming up.

255
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,740
Caring for a baby at our age
is back-breaking,

256
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,940
and it causes hair loss too.

257
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:31,340
I'm being serious right now.

258
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,110
We can live...

259
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,150
a full and fruitful life
without a child.

260
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,350
I'm sure of it.

261
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,420
I'm sure of it too.

262
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,320
That's good enough, then.

263
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,730
Let's not ask for anything more.

264
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,400
Not long ago,
we thought we'd get married...

265
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,230
only in a dream.

266
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,130
Forget a baby.

267
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,740
The fact that we got back together.

268
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,170
That's a bigger miracle.

269
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,070
You're right.

270
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,010
Rather than wish for our baby
that doesn't exist,

271
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,910
I'll focus on you...

272
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:11,050
and show you more love and interest.

273
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,520
I love you to bits.

274
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:17,760
Darn it.

275
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,520
What was that for?

276
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,800
(Gongjubuyang Shampoo)

277
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,600
My gosh.

278
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,440
I can say for sure...

279
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,610
that not even Dong Seok
washes Kwang Sook's hair for her.

280
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,910
Of all the pregnant women in Korea,

281
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,480
you're getting
the best treatment ever.

282
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,220
I'm treating you
like a national treasure.

283
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,790
You're at it again.

284
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:51,160
I bet you're a national treasure...

285
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,020
when it comes to bragging.

286
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:58,630
I'll give you
an extra special scalp massage.

287
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,700
There.

288
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,040
They say a dog that lived at a diner
for three years can cook noodles.

289
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:10,740
You're a true hairdresser's husband.

290
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,740
You're amazing at this.

291
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,310
You have a beautifully shaped head.

292
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,560
Oh, my.

293
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,990
Your hair looks great,
and you smell nice.

294
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,130
Now that my hair looks extra bouncy,

295
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,770
it feels like when we were dating.

296
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:39,170
What are you talking about?
You look a lot better now.

297
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,440
By the way, Heung Soo,

298
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,110
about the Dancing Prince.

299
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,550
You are losing subscribers quickly.

300
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,890
I think we will have to take
special measures.

301
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,820
I told you.

302
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,590
Popularity is something
that doesn't last long.

303
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,300
Maybe you should've done...

304
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,330
the reality dating show with Ri An.

305
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,100
Or maybe we shouldn't have revealed
our wedding live.

306
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,640
Anyway, I have a lot of regrets.

307
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,010
Ji Ok Bun!

308
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,740
You startled me.

309
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,550
Why are you shouting?
You surprised Hanbang.

310
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,480
That's because
you're being ridiculous.

311
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:31,560
You and Hanbang
are all I'll ever need.

312
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:34,160
I don't care about things
like a million views.

313
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,460
I know how you feel.

314
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,870
But it was a chance
that you worked so hard to achieve.

315
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:46,100
I'm just upset
that it's vanishing so quickly.

316
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,110
I'm telling you again.

317
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,010
This is the prime of my life. Okay?

318
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:56,710
I get it.

319
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:05,160
- A younger sibling?
- A younger sibling?

320
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:08,890
That's how it happened.

321
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,430
You might have friends
who got married early and had kids.

322
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,940
I'm sorry that you are getting
a younger sibling at your age.

323
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,870
This is embarrassing.

324
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,640
Why are you sorry?
Please don't say that.

325
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,450
It's something we should celebrate.

326
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,780
We are really happy for you.
I mean it.

327
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,320
I'm glad that you are happy for us.

328
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:35,990
Thank you.

329
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:42,930
I didn't know
how I was going to tell you guys.

330
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,160
I was at a loss for words.

331
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:47,900
Thank you for being happy for us.

332
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,700
As long as you two are happy,

333
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,000
that's enough for us.

334
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,710
Right. We really mean it.

335
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,950
Do you see the black dot here?

336
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
Do you see it?

337
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,350
What? Of course.

338
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:12,760
This is the gestational sac.

339
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,030
The gestational sac?

340
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,560
In this black, round thing,

341
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,130
our baby will grow.

342
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,000
Isn't that amazing?

343
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:24,900
Yes.

344
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,370
We must stay healthy
and live a long life.

345
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,710
Until our baby goes to college,
gets married,

346
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,410
and has children,

347
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:41,890
we really have to stay healthy
and hold out well.

348
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,850
Of course.

349
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:48,560
By the way, there's something
I'm really worried about.

350
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,160
On our baby's elementary school
sports day,

351
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,700
there will be a relay race
for the parents.

352
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,430
What if we both have sore knees
and end up sitting on the bench?

353
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,300
Our baby will be so embarrassed.

354
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,640
Why are you running
to meet your troubles?

355
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,110
"All my friends' moms and dads
are young and cool."

356
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,420
"Why are only my mom
and dad so old?"

357
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,220
If our child says that,
I'll be really sad and upset.

358
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,260
So we have to stay healthy...

359
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,490
as we are now, okay?

360
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,330
You should never age.

361
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,600
Okay.

362
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:31,300
From now on, I'm going...

363
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,540
to take good care
of my health and skin,

dress young,

365
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,840
and never look like an old woman.

366
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:43,680
Our goal is to become
young-looking parents.

367
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,980
I don't want people to think
we are our child's grandparents.

368
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,220
So we should start...

369
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,820
taking good care
of our health and skin now.

370
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,420
Don't you know getting enough sleep
is good for your skin?

371
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,130
Stop worrying about useless things
and go to sleep.

372
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,330
Okay.

373
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
Be careful.

374
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,860
Stop it.

375
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,660
You're here.

376
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,900
They're here.

377
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,730
Congratulations.

378
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,270
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

379
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,170
Thank you.

380
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,570
How are you feeling?

381
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,910
I feel like I've won
half of the whole world.

382
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,610
Is it a girl or a boy?

383
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,750
It's too soon to tell.

384
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,050
She's not supposed to work too hard.

385
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,080
I need you to watch her closely
and stop her when needed.

386
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,020
The doctor says
she should never work too hard...

387
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,560
and try to avoid stress
as much as possible.

388
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,690
Okay. I'll remember that.

389
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,060
Please don't worry about it.

390
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,360
We will do all the work
so she won't have to lift a finger.

391
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:09,830
Please take good care of her.

392
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,000
Don't worry. Just go.

393
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,570
I should get going, then.
Have a good day.

00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,010
- Bye.
- Oh, right.

396
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,880
You should never taste makgeolli.

397
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,080
If possible, don't even smell it.

398
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,780
I won't. Stop worrying about me
and just go.

399
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:30,590
Bye.

403
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,140
Are you not feeling well, sir?

404
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,480
What? It's nothing.

405
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,020
Here.

406
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,190
There will be an on-site inspection
of the VIP suite renovation...

407
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,690
in 30 minutes.

408
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,930
The general manager
and the design team...

409
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,960
will be accompanying you.

410
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,600
Okay.

411
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,650
Hello. This is Han Dong Seok.

412
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,990
Yes. This is about
what you mentioned the other day.

413
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,830
Yes. Can you book the appointment
for the earliest possible day?

414
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,200
I believe I'm running short on time.

415
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,640
Are you going out?

416
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,010
There's no one to look after Ha Ni,

417
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,640
so I'm going over
to Professor Oh's house.

418
00:23:56,970 --> 00:23:57,970
I see.

419
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,610
They haven't found a babysitter yet?

420
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,280
Actually,
he was totally betrayed last time.

421
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,620
He was betrayed?

422
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,690
Yes. The new babysitter he found...

423
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,520
contacted Ha Ni's mother
and let her meet Ha Ni...

424
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,720
without telling him.

425
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,930
I didn't know it happened.

426
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,500
After that happened,

427
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,070
I guess he's worried
about leaving Ha Ni with a stranger.

428
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,670
I see.

429
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,070
I know Ha Ni's mom was wrong,

430
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,750
but I understand
how she was feeling.

431
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,950
People would say she has no right
because she abandoned her child.

432
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:47,990
But it's not that simple
for a mother.

433
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,260
You know...

434
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,460
it's better for the child
that you are not around,

435
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,170
so you try
to pull yourself together,

436
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,240
but whenever you think
of your child's face,

437
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,940
you just give in right away.

438
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,870
"Is she eating well?"

439
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,910
"Isn't she crying at night?"

440
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,810
When you get to see her shadow,

441
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,550
even from afar or behind her,

442
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,180
you can finally breathe a little.

443
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,320
You just can't afford to mind
being shameless or wrong.

444
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,880
Honey.

445
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:57,490
(1S9 1523)

446
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,510
Is the food good enough to eat?

447
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:15,410
I figured I wouldn't get
to see you today either,

448
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,050
so I appreciate you meeting me.

449
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,620
Today...

450
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,590
is your birthday.

451
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,890
You remembered?

452
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,730
How could I forget?
It's not like I have dementia.

453
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,240
I'm not really in the best position
to say this,

454
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,640
but happy birthday.

455
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,320
Thanks.

456
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,060
Seeing you today...

457
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,520
is the best birthday gift
I could ask for.

458
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,460
Anyway,

459
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,430
this place is too far from home...

460
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,530
for daily visits.

461
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:13,500
It's the least I can do
to put my mind at ease.

462
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:18,540
How did you go
from wanting a divorce...

463
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,840
to becoming inseparable?

464
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,790
You're not sick or anything,
are you?

465
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,960
This place is pretty much livable.

466
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:39,660
I'm fine, so don't worry about me.

467
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:46,370
You've probably heard
that Eagle Brewery...

468
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,440
submitted a petition for you.

469
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,610
My lawyer told me.

470
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,280
Why did Eagle Brewery
submit a petition for me?

471
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,520
Why else?

472
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,350
It was for Se Ri
and Beom Soo's sake.

473
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,290
You probably know...

474
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,030
that Beom Soo...

475
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,630
is handling your case
with a new legal team.

476
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,170
I do.

477
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,840
Think of it as help
from your future son-in-law.

478
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:32,850
Don't think my being here
means he gets a free pass.

479
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,220
I never approved of them dating.

480
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,760
You can't be like this,

481
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,860
not when Beom Soo's been
going out of his way to help you.

482
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,840
Why are you here?

483
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,740
How dare you go after my daughter?

484
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:30,610
What the...

485
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,380
What do you think you're doing?

486
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,380
- Let go!
- What was that?

487
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,740
Let go of me!

488
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,910
If you're incapable,
you have to make an effort.

489
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,580
You framed me for a crime
I didn't commit...

490
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,780
and then stabbed me in the back?

491
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,760
What are you doing?

492
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
(CEO Dokgo Tak)

493
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,730
Hey!

494
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,870
What do you think you are doing?

495
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,540
Honey.

496
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,300
While I was on a business trip,

497
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,040
you called this brat over
to our house without telling me?

498
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,540
It's not like that, honey.

499
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,540
You...

500
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,320
What are you doing?

501
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,320
Don't lay a hand on my mother.

502
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,510
Among the three companies
we analyzed,

503
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:39,880
Guseong Group showed...

504
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,010
inconsistent cost fluctuations
each quarter,

505
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,580
making it unreliable as an index
for calculating in-house risks.

506
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,120
Then we should compare
Hwahu Group and Jangseong Group.

507
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,850
Doesn't Hwahu Group have
many foreign branches?

508
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,560
Yes. The Vietnam branch...

509
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,090
is their biggest moneymaker,

510
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,230
but the costs from there
saw a sudden decrease.

511
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,460
We all know why.

512
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:05,470
(Na Young Eun)

513
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,510
It might be
an internal accounting issue.

514
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,770
Let's check
whether the drop occurred...

515
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,010
when they appointed a new CFO.

516
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,440
Yes, Professor.

517
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,380
The call cannot be connected and
will be transferred to voicemail.

518
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,680
Your call may be charged
after the tone.

519
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,550
It's me, Beom Soo.

520
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:27,420
My husband and I are leaving
for the US tomorrow.

521
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:31,690
I won't be coming back
to Korea anytime soon.

522
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,600
That's why...

523
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,000
Before I go,

524
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,610
could I see Ha Ni one last time,
even if only from afar?

525
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,640
Can't I see her
for just a few moments?

526
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:51,550
I'm outside your place now.

527
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,250
Please call me
when you get this message.

528
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:34,920
Ha Ni.

529
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:37,330
It's all right.

530
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,300
Did I upset you
by waking you from your sleep?

531
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,070
Please don't cry.

532
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:46,200
Princess,
what could have made you so upset?

533
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,640
Ha Ni, are you hungry? Is that it?

534
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,110
Goodness.

535
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,410
I'm going to get your meal,

536
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,750
so wait here patiently for me.
Got it?

537
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,550
I'll be back in a flash.

538
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,100
Ha Ni, I'll be right back
with your food.

539
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:19,970
Ha Ni.

540
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,770
Mommy's here.

541
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,660
Ha Ni, your food is ready.

542
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,060
Let's eat, princess.

543
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,730
Ha Ni!

544
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,880
What do you think you're doing?
How did you get in here?

545
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,480
I kept hearing Ha Ni crying outside,

546
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,610
and the door was unlocked.

547
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,280
That doesn't give you permission
to enter someone's house.

548
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,020
Were you going to sneak off
with her?

549
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:11,720
Gosh, of course not.
That wasn't my intention.

550
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,260
I wasn't going to do that.

551
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,190
So, what were you thinking
when you came in here?

552
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,960
I was going to apologize to Beom Soo
and say goodbye.

553
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,400
With his permission,

554
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,700
I wanted to see Ha Ni one last time.

555
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:30,310
"Goodbye?"

556
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,350
While in Korea,
I kept losing my way,

557
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,850
obsessing over Ha Ni.

558
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,650
My husband
likely reached his limit...

559
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:49,690
and suggested I complete my studies
in the US.

560
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:52,960
That's why,

561
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,570
before I left,

562
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:59,300
I wanted to see Ha Ni,
even if just from a distance.

563
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,840
I had no other intention.

564
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:10,880
But it's not that simple
for a mother.

565
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:12,920
You know...

566
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:16,120
it's better for the child
that you are not around,

567
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,850
so you try
to pull yourself together,

568
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,990
but whenever you think
of your child's face,

569
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,790
you just give in right away.

570
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,630
"Is she eating well?"

571
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,530
"Isn't she crying at night?"

572
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,340
When you get to see her shadow,

573
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,170
even from afar or behind her,

574
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,010
you can finally breathe a little.

575
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,110
You just can't afford to mind
being shameless or wrong.

576
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,520
If you don't believe me,
I'll show you my flight itinerary.

577
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,660
It's fine.

578
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:03,830
You see,

579
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,900
I considered those
who abandon their babies...

580
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,540
to be evil and irresponsible.

581
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,150
To be honest, I still feel that way.

582
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:22,690
However, I'm now willing to try
to understand them.

583
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,690
They did the unthinkable,

584
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,460
but they must've had their reasons.

585
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,330
What did they feel
when they left their babies?

586
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,170
How do they feel now?

587
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,410
I'm at least trying to put myself
in their shoes.

588
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,150
Come back safely
after finishing your studies,

589
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,720
and call me if you want to know
how Ha Ni is doing.

590
00:36:57,890 --> 00:37:01,520
I'll often send you photos
and videos.

591
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,560
Really? Can I ask that of you?

592
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,960
However,
I won't be able to help you...

593
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,000
if you show up
unannounced like this again.

594
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,800
How are you this mature...

595
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,470
when you're far younger than me?

596
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,110
That must be why Beom Soo likes you.

597
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:31,290
I won't mention what happened today
to Professor Oh.

598
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:32,990
Thank you.

599
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,830
By the way,

600
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,630
you're going
to marry Beom Soo, right?

601
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:43,830
Due to the ordeal with my family,
it won't happen anytime soon,

602
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:48,070
but I do want to marry him.

603
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,270
Se Ri,

604
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,080
I believe you'll be
a wonderful mother to Ha Ni.

605
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,510
I can leave feeling reassured.

606
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:06,260
Say your final goodbye to Ha Ni.

607
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,470
Say goodbye, Ha Ni.

608
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,610
Ha Ni.

609
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,440
I'll finish my studies in the US,

610
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,940
so be healthy and happy...

611
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,950
with Se Ri and your dad
until I get back.

612
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:36,450
I'm sorry, my baby.

613
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,890
Know that I love you.

614
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
(Eagle Brewery)

615
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,010
You're here often.

616
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:03,710
Where's Kwang Sook?

617
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,220
She went to the studio
with Vice-CEO Oh.

618
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,960
You seem more haggard
than the last time I saw you.

619
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,030
Have you been missing me
like a lovesick puppy?

620
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,630
Don't be absurd.

621
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:20,700
How is that absurd?

622
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,760
Be honest with me.

623
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,530
I bet you've missed me a lot.

624
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,270
No, I haven't!

625
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:29,540
Don't lie to me when it's written
all over your face.

626
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:31,710
We're way past the point
of playing hard to get.

627
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,740
Aren't I right? I know I am.

628
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,650
Go away, will you?
You're distracting me.

629
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,580
As if stirring the pot
is that important.

630
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,050
Mr. Go, I missed you so much...

631
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,250
that this baby bird...

632
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,820
flew all the way from Golden Castle.

633
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,460
"Baby bird?"

634
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,800
I made you laugh.
You just laughed, Mr. Go.

635
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
(Eagle Brewery)

636
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,500
Please stop bothering me
while I'm working.

637
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:03,070
You can do the work
once this baby bird flies away.

638
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,340
I'm bored, you know.

639
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:06,610
"Baby bird?"

640
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,280
Why does that voice sound familiar?

641
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,390
To be honest, I'm worried.

642
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,090
What are you worried about?

643
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,460
Out of sight, out of mind, remember?

644
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,000
There are many wealthy men
and doctors...

645
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,760
at Golden Castle.

646
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:32,800
You might change your mind
at any second,

647
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,200
and that makes me insecure.

648
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:37,970
Shouldn't a man be more confident?

649
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:42,610
I wouldn't trade you, not even
for ten truckloads of doctors...

650
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,680
from Golden Castle.

651
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,180
Do you mean that?

652
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,520
Of course, I do.

653
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:49,690
Do you really mean that?

654
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,700
What are you two doing?

655
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,530
Kwang Sook!

656
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:03,800
Boss.

657
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,510
Are you toying with Manager Go?

658
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,480
What do you take me for?

659
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,950
This isn't a fling.

660
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,720
What if it isn't? Are you saying
you're serious about him?

661
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:25,550
- I am.
- What?

662
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:27,020
We've been dating...

663
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,130
for quite some time now.

664
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,700
You've got to be joking.

665
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,200
Why do you say it's a joke?

666
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,000
Do you not see me...

667
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,910
as someone good enough
for Mrs. Gong?

668
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,910
What?

669
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,280
What's with this response?

670
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,480
I mean,

671
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,650
you're way older than Mr. Go.

672
00:41:52,650 --> 00:41:54,280
Our age difference doesn't matter.

673
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,020
On the outside,

674
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:58,490
she looks way younger than I do.

675
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,890
Well said.

676
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,060
What other issues do you have?

677
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,960
He is such a sweet
and innocent soul,

678
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,400
and you could break his heart!

679
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,500
Sweet and innocent, my foot.

680
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,470
If only you knew how much
he was playing hard to get.

681
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,540
That's true.
I'm not innocent at all.

682
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,410
So what's the next issue?

683
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:23,980
My mom's at Golden Castle,

684
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,280
and you're here.
The long distance...

685
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,720
You sure are old-fashioned
for someone your age.

686
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,720
Haven't you heard of LDR?

687
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:35,260
Living just an hour apart
doesn't even count as long distance.

688
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,360
Even if Mrs. Gong were living
in Busan,

689
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,960
I'd visit her every day.

690
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,400
I could even go see her twice
in one day.

691
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,030
Mr. Go, you hopeless romantic.

692
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:49,640
Hey, it's Mr. Kim, the driver.

693
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,510
- Hello.
- Hi.

694
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:55,480
Mr. Kim, what brings you here?

695
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,280
The chairman sent over
some lunch for you.

696
00:42:59,450 --> 00:43:00,620
- What?
- Goodness.

697
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,690
Oh, no.
This really wasn't necessary.

698
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,820
You had to drive all the way here
because of me.

699
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:09,690
No problem, ma'am.
I'll see you when you get off work.

700
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,030
Hold on. Please stay
and have lunch with us.

701
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,530
I'm fine, ma'am.

702
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:16,870
Let's see.

703
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:26,010
The chairman really goes all out,
doesn't he?

704
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,950
Nothing shows a man's competence
better than his fat wallet.

705
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:40,390
There are exceptions, though.
Like you, Mr. Go.

706
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:52,430
(Rumian Ophthalmology Clinic)

707
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:58,310
It's a typical disease
associated with aging.

708
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,480
You need the surgery anyway,

709
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,880
so why put it off?

710
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,350
You should have the surgery
tomorrow.

711
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:11,920
Our goal is to become
young-looking parents.

712
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,590
I don't want people to think
we are our child's grandparents.

713
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:16,830
So we should start...

714
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:19,430
taking good care
of our health and skin now.

715
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,170
My wife's pregnant with my child,
and I have a geriatric illness.

716
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,110
Darling.

717
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,880
Thank you for the lunch box.

718
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,750
You didn't have to do that for me.

719
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,650
I sent it just in case
you didn't have an appetite.

720
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,190
Could you eat anything there?

721
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:46,860
Everything tasted delicious.

722
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,990
I shared it with the staff.

723
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,030
What's that noise?

724
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:58,630
Are you at a hospital?

725
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:03,310
It's not about me.
I visited a friend who's a doctor...

726
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:04,440
to discuss something.

727
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,540
My gosh.

728
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:11,710
I thought something was wrong,
and my heart almost sank.

729
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:14,820
Your heart almost sank?

730
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,820
Yes, of course.

731
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,490
Our baby and I can't manage...

732
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,390
if something were to happen to you.

733
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:24,330
For our baby's sake,
you can't ever fall ill.

734
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:25,930
Okay?

735
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:29,200
You bet. Don't worry.

(Dancing Prince, Subscribers)

737
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,380
My word.

(Dancing Prince, Subscribers)

739
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:44,050
It's just been days,

740
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,080
and you lost this many subscribers?

741
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:50,650
Take a look.

742
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:52,020
(Dancing Prince, 173 subscribers)

743
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:55,220
I told you.

744
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:58,030
In this field, people gain
and lose interest overnight.

745
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:01,200
Even so, this is disastrous.

746
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:05,400
You might end up
with less than 100 subscribers.

747
00:46:05,870 --> 00:46:07,800
Don't care about the number.

748
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,870
You'll get paranoid.

749
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:12,140
We need to find a solution.

750
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,510
We can't lose your fan base.

751

The only people
you have to look after...

752
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:19,820
are me and Hanbang.

753
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,050
Don't care about
my subscriber count.

754
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:26,620
Heung Soo.
Let's do a fan meet-and-greet.

755
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:28,990
A what?

756
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,730
Let's host
a flashy meet-and-greet...

757
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,430
and lure back your subscribers.

758
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:37,600
Well...

759
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:46,110
It's Mom's birthday today.

760
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,140
With Dad gone,

761
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:51,010
I thought it would be nice
if you could wish her a happy day.

762
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,620
I'd like you two
to have a good time.

763
00:46:57,390 --> 00:46:58,390
Kang Soo.

764
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,060
What will you do after work?

765
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,360
How about a beer?

766
00:47:04,030 --> 00:47:06,700
Sorry. Someone just scheduled
something important for me.

767
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:09,160
Okay.

768
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,600
It's my mother's birthday.

769
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,370
I'll visit her after work.

770
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:17,410
That's it?

771
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:19,880
Of course, you should wish her
a happy birthday.

772
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,980
Kang Soo, what do you say
to a blind date?

773
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,350
What?

774
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,420
A little while ago, I posted...

775
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,890
a picture of the team
on my social media,

776
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,290
and a junior of mine
fell head over heels for you.

777
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:37,730
She's begging for an introduction.

778
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:41,360
She's pretty
and has a great personality.

779
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:47,200
What do you think? Isn't she great?

780
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:53,080
Take a look.

781
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,040
Don't you think
they'd make a great couple?

782
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,350
What would I know?

783
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:00,720
You should ask if he's interested.

784
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:06,090
I'm sorry. I'm not interested.

785
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,720
Why not?

786
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:09,890
Do you have a girlfriend?

787
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,560
Well... Not yet.

788
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,900
"Not yet?"

789
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,330
Are you testing the waters
with someone?

790
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,100
I'm still a bit cautious...

791
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,340
because I haven't figured out
how she feels.

792
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,780
Thanks for the offer, though.

793
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:29,210
Okay.

(Chairman Han Dong Seok)

795
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,230
Cancel my plans
for tomorrow and the day after,

796
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:52,930
and take notes if anything happens.

797
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:55,700
Why, sir? Is something wrong?

798
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:58,470
Goodness.

799
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:02,310
Something came up,
and it's quite a bother.

800
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,710
"A bother?"

801
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,220
What I'm about to say...

802
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,990
will stay between us, Mr. Park.

803
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:21,900
I hope you had a good day.

804
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:23,970
Did you have a rough day at work?

805
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:25,830
Not at all.

806
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:27,800
Thanks to the lunch box you sent,

807
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,340
I was happy all day long.

808
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:32,870
I'm leaving on a business trip
tomorrow.

809
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:36,310
A business trip?
Where to so suddenly?

810
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:37,580
I'm going to Tokyo.

811
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:41,120
It's pretty sudden and urgent,
and I'll be away for a night.

812
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:44,350
Shall I come with you?

813
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:46,620
No, you can't.

814
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:50,230
You need peace, quiet, and rest
more than anything.

815
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:51,960
Okay.

816
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:54,200
I said that because
I didn't want to be away from you.

817
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,470
Wash your hands, get changed,
and come over for dinner.

818
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:22,260
I have a visitor?

819
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,630
What are you doing here?

820
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:28,330
Happy birthday.

821
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:30,930
Oh, gosh.

822
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,470
How do you know my birthday?

823
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:35,270
Se Ri told me.

824
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:39,540
She didn't say anything
this morning,

825
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:43,010
so I thought she'd forgotten
because of what had been going on.

826
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:47,250
She pretended to have forgotten
so I could spend time with you.

827
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:48,880
I guess so.

828
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,920
I didn't have time to prepare much.

829
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:53,660
Here.

830
00:50:58,030 --> 00:50:59,360
What is this?

831
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:00,960
Goodness.

832
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,530
My gosh.

833
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:07,670
It's beautiful.

834
00:51:11,010 --> 00:51:12,710
Did you pick it out?

835
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:14,710
With Bom's help.

836
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,980
Are you and Bom very close?

837
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:26,020
I'm not sure yet.

838
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:30,130
She's a good kid.

839
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:33,900
I know her well because she was
Se Ri's friend for many years.

840
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,170
She's sweet, good-mannered,
and good-natured.

841
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:39,870
Yes.

842
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,240
Let's light the candle
so you can blow it out.

843
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:01,260
Why is there just one candle?

844
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:03,490
Oh, right.

845
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:06,060
You don't know how old I am.

846
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,660
It's not that.
This is your first birthday...

847
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:11,430
that we're celebrating together.

848
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,030
So I got just one candle.

849
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,170
Is that okay?

850
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:17,140
Of course, it is.

851
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:19,370
Thank you.

852
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,280
Shall we blow it out together?

853
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,680
Yes.

854
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:46,870
Are you packed?

855
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,540
I think I have everything.

856
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:51,540
The suitcase is almost empty.

857
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:52,740
Is this all?

858
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,040
I'm away for just one night.

859
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,480
I just need a pair of underwear
and clothes.

860
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,550
You didn't pack any pajamas?

861
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,650
Pajamas?

862
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,390
Oh, I forgot.

863
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:06,220
I'll get our matching pajamas...

864
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:07,790
so you can think of me.

865
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,200
Thanks.

866
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,270
I'll be away for just one day,

867
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:26,210
but eat and sleep well
and look after yourself.

868
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:31,550
I will. Don't worry,
and take care of business well.

869
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:40,420
It's our first night apart
since we got married.

870
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:44,030
It is. It feels strange.

871
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:46,860
Should I go with you?

872
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:49,260
The doctor stressed...

873
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,200
that you shouldn't travel...

874
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,770
during the early stages.

875
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:57,510
I know.
I wasn't serious about going.

876
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:02,140
I'll look after myself on the trip.

877
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:05,380
You rest
and look after yourself too, okay?

878
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,380
Okay. I'll do that.

879
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,890
That was tonight's goodnight kiss.

880
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,020
And that was
tomorrow's good morning kiss.

881
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:17,890
I paid you in advance.

882
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:26,370
I paid you back with interest.

883
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:44,920
Yes.

884
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:50,290
I'll measure your blood pressure
and take your blood sample.

885
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,290
Okay.

886
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:09,910
Hello?

887
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,250
Did you arrive
at the airport safely?

888
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:14,520
I just got here.

889
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,820
I just got my ticket,

890
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:17,590
so I'm now ready to go through
the departure procedure.

891
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:19,950
Have a safe trip.

892
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,230
Don't work too hard at the brewery.

893
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:27,060
If you feel unwell or dizzy,

894
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,630
go to the doctor right away.

895
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:32,800
Okay. Don't worry about me.

896
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,540
Just make sure
to get your work done.

897
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:37,740
Call me when you arrive in Tokyo.

898
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,140
Is Dong Seok going to Japan?

899
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:45,580
He's going
on an urgent business trip.

900
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:53,560
By the way, where's Mr. Go?
I haven't seen him today.

901
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:57,260
He took a day off and went out.

902
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,460
Didn't he say anything to you?

903
00:55:59,790 --> 00:56:01,730
I see. No, he didn't.

904
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:07,870
What's wrong?

905
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:14,940
Mr. Go says he is going out...

906
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:16,910
with Mom.

907
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:26,190
You don't seem surprised.

908
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:30,060
Actually, I've been noticing it
for a while.

909
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:34,130
I saw Mr. Go and Ms. Gong dating.

910
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:36,800
- Say, "Ah."
- "Ah."

911
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,000
That's Ms. Gong and Mr. Go.

912
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,540
- No way.
- Oh, my.

913
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:48,440
What should I do?

914
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:51,780
Gosh, my head.
I don't know what to do.

915
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:55,250
You're pregnant.
You shouldn't be stressed out.

916
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:02,090
I think
I'm having a stomachache too.

917
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,590
Oh, no.
Do you need to go to the doctor?

918
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,800
I'm fine.

919
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:13,640
You came home early.

920
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,870
Are you feeling unwell?

921
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,910
It's not that I'm sick.

922
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:20,410
I just wanted to rest,
so I came early.

923
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,140
That's good.

924
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,380
You should never overtax yourself
in the early stages of pregnancy.

925
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,220
Okay. I'll be lying down in my room.

926
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,920
Okay. Call me if you need anything,

927
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:31,920
Ms. Ma.

928
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:33,090
I will.

929
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:43,060
My head...

930
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,780
I should look at the sonogram
of our baby.

931
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:06,220
What?

932
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:10,590
I think I saw it
and put it back here yesterday.

933
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,060
Where did it go?

934
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,880
This is strange. Where did I put it?

935
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:52,130
It's not here.

936
00:58:59,470 --> 00:59:02,510
(Passport, Han Dong Seok)

937
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:08,050
His passport is here.

938
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,320
How did he go abroad?

939
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:21,300
The call cannot be connected and
will be transferred to voicemail.

940
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:27,400
Hello, Ms. Ma.

941
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:29,300
Mr. Park.

942
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,910
Where is Chairman Han now?

943
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:35,610
Pardon?

944
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:38,050
Where is he now?

945
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:41,980
Did you not hear it
from Chairman Han?

946
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:44,950
He's on a business trip to Tokyo.

947
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:48,560
But his passport is at home.

948
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,630
How did he go abroad?

949
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:53,090
Where is he now?

950
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:01,440
Thank you, Mr. Kim.

951
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:03,870
(Rumian Ophthalmology Clinic)

952
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:06,840
The surgery went well.

953
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,610
The cataract was
in an advanced stage,

954
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:13,010
but the lens opacity
has been completely removed.

955
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:16,050
And the artificial lens
has also been successfully inserted.

956
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,650
Now that the surgery was successful,

957
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:23,690
I'll be able
to see this clearly, right?

958
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:27,900
I think this is a sonogram
of a fetus.

959
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:31,130
My wife is four weeks pregnant,

960
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:32,870
so she took this sonogram.

961
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:36,500
But I couldn't see it well
as a father,

962
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,610
so I decided
to have the surgery soon.

963
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,110
That's why you suddenly decided
to have the surgery...

964
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:44,410
after putting it off day after day?

965
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:47,680
I promised my wife
that I'd be a young father.

966
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:51,420
Hubby.

967
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,760
Well... How did you know I was here?

968
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,960
What happened?

969
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,930
Why are you here
when you're supposed to be in Japan?

970
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:10,770
Do you know how worried I was
on my way to the hospital?

971
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:15,310
It's no big deal.
It was a simple surgery.

972
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:19,780
Did the surgery go well?

973
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,280
Is everything all right?

974
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:24,220
It's not that serious.

975
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:26,620
It's a common surgery
people have when they get older.

976
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:31,130
But still,

977
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:34,960
how could you get the surgery
without telling me?

978
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,430
I didn't...

979
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:40,370
want to worry you.

980
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,600
I'm not a stranger.

981
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:44,840
How could you say such a thing?

982
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:48,410
You need to be careful
in the early stage of pregnancy.

983
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,510
I was worried...

984
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:53,880
that you'd get stressed out
and it would affect the baby.

985
01:01:56,450 --> 01:01:57,890
Still, how could you...

986
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:02,220
lie to me that you'd go
on a business trip to Japan?

987
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:03,790
And...

988
01:02:04,130 --> 01:02:06,960
I didn't want
to show you and the baby...

989
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,860
that I was old.

990
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:13,100
I didn't want you to think of me
as an old dad.

991
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:17,540
What?

992
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:20,510
Now that
the cataract surgery went well,

993
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:22,940
I'm now a perfectly young dad.

994
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,110
So...

995
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:29,320
did you hide it from me
not to be seen as an old dad?

996
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:32,420
That was not the only reason,

997
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:35,120
but I could say
it was one of the reasons.
