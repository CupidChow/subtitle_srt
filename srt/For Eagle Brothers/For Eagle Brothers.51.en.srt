00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,940
(Episode 51)

2
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,150
Have a safe trip back,

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,960
and please call us
if anything happens.

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,430
Mother, it's me.

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:23,430
Kwang Sook and I will visit
during the Christmas season.

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,060
Sure thing.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,430
Try to get some rest
on your flight home,

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,740
and please call once you land.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,840
Got it.

10
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,780
She'll be fine, right?

11
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,850
We're not at the stage
where we need to worry just yet.

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,650
Also, some of her siblings,
nieces, and nephews...

13
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,920
live in the US,

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,590
so she'll be well cared for.

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,860
Do you want to switch drivers?

16
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,160
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course, I should drive.

17
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,460
I insisted on going camping...

18
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,730
instead of traveling abroad.

19
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,900
I feel bad about it. That's all.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,130
You couldn't take much time off...

21
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,100
since things are so busy
at the brewery.

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,540
But...

23
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,040
during the Christmas season,
we'll go on a real honeymoon.

24
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,880
How considerate of you.

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,120
I feel so lucky
to have married a man like you.

26
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,850
I'm the one who got lucky with you.

27
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,850
Earlier at the wedding,

28
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,260
people were gushing over
how beautiful you are.

29
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,860
All I heard...

30
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,830
were compliments about the groom.

31
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,870
You must be tired,
so catch some sleep.

32
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,200
I'll wake you once we get there.

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,340
I'm fine.

34
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,910
How could I nap
while you drive alone, sweetie?

35
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:43,370
Unbelievable.

36
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,410
Why are you still calling me that
when we're married now?

37
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,280
You should call me hubby.

38
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,650
My gosh.

39
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,750
Forget it.

40
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,320
As if.

41
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,860
Every time you call me sweetie
instead of hubby,

42
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,290
I'm going to plant a kiss on you
as a penalty.

43
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,730
But...

44
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,030
how can I suddenly
start calling you "hubby?"

45
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,170
It's embarrassing.

46
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,970
It might be embarrassing at first,

47
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,140
but it'll get easier
after the first time.

48
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:13,540
Go ahead.

49
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,510
Hub...

50
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:28,350
Forget it. I'm taking a nap.

51
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,960
Goodness.

52
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,070
Thank you for everything today.

53
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,740
It was probably more tiring for you.

54
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,780
Exactly.

55
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,780
Thank you...

56
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,280
for sincerely congratulating
Kwang Sook.

57
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,550
I really appreciate it, guys.

58
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,660
As we should.

59
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,390
Kwang Sook was stunning today.

60
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,660
I know.

61
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:09,360
Her wedding dress was spectacular.

62
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,860
A day like this calls for drinks.

63
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,940
I've already stocked the fridge
with makgeolli.

64
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,200
I'll bring them.

65
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,510
I'll go and change
out of this hanbok.

66
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,540
Sure.

67
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,410
You should lay Ha Ni down
in your room.

68
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,310
Are you free to stay, Se Ri?

69
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,810
Yes.

70
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:31,780
If you catch the bouquet,

71
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,920
you know you have
six months to marry, right?

72
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,690
It's your turn next.

73
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,760
Hey.

74
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,660
Oh, my.

75
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,110
Thanks.

76
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,080
I didn't think you'd come
to the wedding, but you did.

77
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,480
Kwang Sook called me last night...

78
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,510
and told me to come.

79
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,980
And...

80
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,220
I thought I had to
face your family this way...

81
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,160
so things wouldn't get too awkward.

82
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,960
So I shamelessly
plucked up the courage.

83
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,430
Good for you.

84
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,780
Chun Soo.

85
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
What?

86
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
What is it?

87
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,760
You want to talk?

88
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,490
Try to accept Se Ri if you can.

89
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,630
What?

90
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,070
I get how you feel,

91
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,870
but Beom Soo and Se Ri...

92
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,970
fought through a lot to get here.

93
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,010
Try to accept them.

94
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,380
Keep them separate from the parents.

95
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,250
Why?

96
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:13,050
Are you upset because you think
I disapprove of her?

97
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,090
I feel sorry for her, not upset.

98
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,690
You're looking out
for your sister already?

99
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,360
No, it's not that.

100
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,160
As if it's not that.

101
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,130
You're taking me on
for not being nice to your sister.

102
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,200
I'm not taking you on.

103
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,740
She is your only sister.

104
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,910
You should look out for her
as her older brother.

105
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,710
Kang Soo.

106
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,110
I know how you feel.

107
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,920
I'm worried. That's all.

108
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,050
I don't disapprove of Se Ri,

109
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,220
so give me a little time.

110
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,360
Oh, my.

111
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:58,600
I'll take this.
Come and join us, you guys.

112
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,170
Good job, everyone.

113
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,810
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

114
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm sorry...

115
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:29,360
for all the mean
and silly things I said.

116
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,260
Family comes first,

117
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,530
and my daughter had been widowed...

118
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,770
just ten days into her marriage.

119
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,940
I was in disbelief
and utterly distraught,

120
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,640
so I was unable to even care...

121
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,210
how you must have felt.

122
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,940
Don't say that.

123
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,750
You were pretty open,

124
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,950
and we liked that.

125
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,690
Yes. You were
always bright and cheerful,

126
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,920
and you gave us
a lot of positive energy.

127
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,090
Thanks for saying so.

128
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,190
- My gosh.
- Stay seated.

129
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,270
It was a long day
for you too, Mr. Go.

130
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,510
Have a drink.

131
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,480
Oh, my.

132
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,550
Don't you feel upset or sad
that you have to...

133
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,060
leave the brewery?

134
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,360
I grew to love all of you
and the place,

135
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:36,830
so it's a shame to leave,

136
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,570
but I should go back
to where I came from.

137
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,770
Before she came here,
she stayed at...

138
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,440
a senior citizen residence
called Golden Castle.

139
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,480
Did you pack your things?

140
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,180
There's no rush.

141
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,910
I'll start today.

142
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,490
The house will feel empty...

143
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,260
without you and Kwang Sook.

144
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,700
We'll leave your room as it is.

145
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,530
You can visit whenever you want.

146
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Thanks.

147
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:23,140
Mr. Go. Aren't you drinking
too much, too fast?

148
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,610
It's fine.

149
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,400
I love the smell of the forest.

150
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,840
The smell of the soil
and the trees...

151
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,770
washes away all my fatigue.

152
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,610
I'm glad I listened to you, darling.

153
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
What do you think?

154
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,010
Doesn't it feel like
it's just us in the whole world?

155
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,550
Yes.

156
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:08,090
But I think
it also feels a bit spooky too.

157
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:12,690
Why would you feel spooked
when you have a dependable husband?

158
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,390
You're right.

159
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:16,990
Get some rest.

160
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,160
I'll set things up
and call you when I'm done.

161
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,230
No.

162
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,700
A married couple is one body.

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,870
We must share
the tough and bothersome work.

164
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,000
Let's do it together.

165
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,050
Nice.

166
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,210
You're pretty good at this.

167
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,750
Let's see.

168
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,420
I'll put this here.

169
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,530
Okay.

170
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,070
There. I think that's done.

171
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,040
Shall we hold a lighting ceremony?

172
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,910
This is...

173
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,480
Han Dong Seok and Ma Kwang Sook's
first night together.

174
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,110
This is the lighting ceremony.

175
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,480
- Press this button.
- This one?

176
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,850
Turn on the lights.

177
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,630
They're beautiful.

178
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,860
I'm glad you like it.

179
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,830
Yes. I love it.

180
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,970
We worked frantically
to get to this point,

181
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,840
and reality is sinking in at last.

182
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,680
I agree.

183
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,080
You took a long detour to get here.

184
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,280
It must've been hard.

185
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:46,050
It was pretty hard on you too,
sweetie.

186
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,720
I told you...

187
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:55,130
I'd kiss you as a penalty
whenever you called me that.

188
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,630
What? You can't do that, sweetie.

189
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,870
What got into you?

190
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,230
Hey.

191
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,100
Are you calling me that
on purpose to make me kiss you?

192
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,270
No, it's not that.
Sweetie, you made up a rule...

193
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,410
It looks like
you're messing up on purpose.

194
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,050
You're being gross.

195
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,580
Why is it gross when we're married?

196
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,920
- Come here.
- Stop it, seriously!

197
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,190
It's against the rules to run away.

198
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:26,660
- I have one more kiss left.
- Stay away from me.

199
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,360
No, stop it.

200
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,460
What's wrong with you?

201
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,260
Stop it.

202
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,230
Your family got together
for the first time in a while,

203
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,500
and you had to leave early
to take me home.

204
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,470
They were all tired
and hoped to go to bed early.

205
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,870
Don't worry.

206
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,850
My dad's alone at home,

207
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,410
and I was getting worried.

208
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,320
Of course. I get it.

209
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,520
Is your mother still at a hotel?

210
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,460
Yes.

211
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,830
- Professor.
- Yes?

212
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,960
What happens if we don't marry
within six months...

213
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,100
- of catching the bride's bouquet?
- What?

214
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,000
Will we break up?

215
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,910
Don't be silly.
That's a superstition.

216
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,110
- It is, right?
- Yes.

217
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,680
Even things people say
without much thought...

218
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,020
make me anxious and uneasy.

219
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,850
You're that worried
about your parents.

220
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:33,060
If I could get my way,
I'd marry you right now,

221
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,330
not six months later.

222
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:46,400
The prosecutors plan
to apply for an arrest warrant.

223
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,710
I'll counter with an investigation
to determine its validity.

224
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,750
I'm home.

225
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,550
Hey. Why do you have
a bunch of flowers?

226
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,160
I caught a bride's bouquet.

227
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,560
Bom's father
and Professor Oh's sister-in-law...

228
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,700
got married today.

229
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:14,770
Bom's father
and Professor Oh's sister-in-law?

230
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,870
You mean Chairman Han...

231
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,000
and Eagle Brewery's CEO
Ma Kwang Sook got married?

232
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,540
Yes.

233
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,840
What... My goodness.

234
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,050
Why would he marry a woman like her?

235
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:31,950
Ms. Ma is a good person.

236
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,150
Good person, my foot.
She's a total nutcase.

237
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:39,260
By the way,
why did you get the bouquet?

238
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,160
Are you marrying Beom Soo or what?

239
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,100
I want to marry him.

240
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:49,300
My goodness.

241
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,970
You are just like your mom.

242
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,170
You are unbelievable.

243
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,410
Your dad got into this situation
because of his family,

244
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,980
but do you not care at all?

245
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,680
It's not their fault...

246
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,320
that you got into this situation.

247
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,290
No one is...

248
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,720
on my side in this house.

249
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:17,230
I want you
to see things objectively...

250
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,730
and be more coolheaded now.

251
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,130
That's enough.

252
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:29,070
Are you going out?

253
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,380
I'm meeting with your mom.

254
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,450
Don't yell at Mom. Be nice.

255
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Okay?

256
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,860
I don't have...

257
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,730
the energy to yell at her anymore.

258
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,390
What is this about?

259
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,600
Why did you ask me
to have dinner with you?

260
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,270
Why? Do you want me to leave?

261
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,970
It's not that I hate it.

262
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:36,340
But you hate seeing my face.

263
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,880
I find it strange, so I'm asking.

264
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,680
If you don't want
to have dinner with me, just go.

265
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,910
Come on. I get it.

266
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,980
I won't say anything.

267
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,100
Why are you staring at me like that?

268
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,070
Now that you are
no longer bothered by me,

269
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,340
I thought
you would look a lot happier,

270
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,240
but why the long face?

271
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,470
You are always talking like that.
Can't you be nice?

272
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,850
I'll pour you some wine.

273
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,780
(Application for Divorce)

274
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,720
Honey.

275
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,820
You said you wanted to divorce me.

276
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,660
You know they grant wishes
even for the dead.

277
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,300
I guess I should grant a wish
for someone alive at least once.

278
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:09,870
Honey.

279
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,740
When I think
about how you betrayed me,

280
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,070
I want to kick you out
with no alimony,

281
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,010
but I took care of things...

282
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,680
so you could get enough money
for Se Ri's sake.

283
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,880
My lawyer will contact you
in a few days.

284
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,730
Is something wrong with you?

285
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,830
Why are you being like this?

286
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,860
You said
your wish was to divorce me.

287
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,630
I'm granting your wish.
What's your problem?

288
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,840
Don't nitpick.

289
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,510
It's just so sudden.

290
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:54,140
Are you curious
if I'm planning to die or something?

291
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,450
What?

292
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,820
Do you think
I will cave in so easily?

293
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,550
I will never die.

294
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,060
Even if I get trampled
or hit rock bottom,

295
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,090
I will hold out until the end
and survive.

296
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,560
That's how
I've lived my life so far.

297
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,210
I didn't get to talk to you
at the wedding earlier today.

298
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,840
So I wanted
to have a drink with you.

299
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,840
Okay.

300
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,210
Actually, my family
was also having a drink together.

301
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,080
I'm sorry if I interrupted
your time with your family.

302
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:34,320
No, we started early,

303
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,820
so we were about to call it a night
anyway.

304
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,060
Here. This is Jang-Kwang Makgeolli.

305
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:43,460
So, this is the famous makgeolli
I've heard about.

306
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,330
You're here.

307
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,300
Let's go and drink it.

308
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,470
Okay.

309
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,540
Wait.

310
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:54,300
This is a hangover cure. Drink up.

311
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:56,870
What about Mr. Han?

312
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,940
I have only one.
You should drink it.

313
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,010
Go ahead.

314
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,520
What's taking you so long?

315
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,750
Yes, I'm coming.

316
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,160
Cheers.

317
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,100
Please take good care
of my sister-in-law.

318
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,200
I was surprised...

319
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,870
when I saw how your brothers
treated Ms. Ma like their sister.

320
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,500
I think it's really nice.

321
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,510
Kwang Sook took great care of us,
like we were her younger brothers.

322
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,380
It's Dad.

323
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:36,650
Dad.

324
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,350
Hey, did you have dinner?

325
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:40,850
Yes.

326
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,290
What? What are you doing there,
Kang Soo?

327
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:48,290
I wanted to have a drink with him,
so I called him over.

328
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,330
That's nice.

329
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,960
Things look nice there.

330
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,500
Who put up the light bulbs?

331
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,000
Your dad did the whole thing.

332
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,470
- My gosh.
- Nice.

333
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,780
Ms. Gong went to her room to sleep.

334
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:09,410
Beom Soo went out
to take Se Ri home.

335
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,650
And Kang Soo is at Mr. Han's place,

336
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,850
so it's just us, drinking together.

337
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,520
Aren't you tired?

338
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,060
No. I'm not tired at all.
Maybe it's the fresh air.

339
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,530
Me neither.

340
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,330
You all went through a lot today.

341
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,730
It was the most touching wedding...

342
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:32,300
I've ever seen.

343
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,670
I agree. I will never forget it.

344
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,710
It's all thanks to you guys.

345
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,580
Thank you so much.

346
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,450
Let's talk more about it
when you get back from your trip.

347
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,050
You should get some rest now.

348
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,490
Kwang Sook.

349
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,220
Have a great time tonight.

350
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,490
A great time?

351
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,900
You know what I mean.

352
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,000
Aren't you embarrassed?
How could you say that?

353
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,970
Why is it embarrassing?

354
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:07,040
Now, you are officially married.

355
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,870
We might end up doing this
all night.

356
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:10,870
We should hang up so they can rest.

357
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,110
- Good night.
- Good night.

358
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,680
Good night.

359
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,250
Good night.

360
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,180
- How nice.
- All right.

361
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,920
We should wrap things up now.

362
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,060
Okay.

363
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,530
You two went through a lot today.

364
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,760
Good night.

365
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,730
Are you going in?

366
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,500
Well... Yes.

367
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,270
Actually,

368
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,410
my belly has been feeling
a little tense.

369
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,710
But I was putting up with it.

370
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:59,220
I'm not pretending to be sick
because I don't want to clean up.

371
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,890
Now that I'm pregnant,

372
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,400
I feel really tired...

373
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:08,770
and drowsy all the time.

374
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,940
I understand.
Go to your room and rest.

375
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,640
I'll get Ok Bun settled in bed
and clean up out here,

376
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,070
so head to your room and rest.

377
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,940
I'm going to clean up the table,
so don't touch anything.

378
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:21,040
I mean it.

379
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,850
Let's go.

380
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,950
Careful.

381
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,520
Are you kidding me?

382
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,360
Don't. I'm sure
they didn't mean anything.

383
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,530
They keep talking like
they deserve some huge privilege.

384
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,330
Forget it.

385
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,670
Leave that there.

386
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,930
Don't even lift a finger.

387
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,600
Head to your room and rest.

388
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,410
Maybe I should instead of resisting.

389
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,910
You should.

390
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,150
Thanks for putting in
the extra work, Mr. Kim.

391
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,480
Close up well today.

392
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,680
I'll be at the shop early tomorrow.

393
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,780
Sure. Got it.

394
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,690
Were there fans lined up
outside the sandwich shop again,

395
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,730
hoping to catch a glimpse of you?

396
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,270
Yes. Not as many as before,
but some fans were still there.

397
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,400
Our baby must be our lucky charm.

398
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,240
How else can you explain
this stroke of luck for you?

399
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,780
Still, let's not get
our hopes up too much.

400
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,980
Having only a brief moment
in the spotlight...

401
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,250
before fading away.

402
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,250
It's common
for people in this field.

403
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,360
I'm grateful
for the interest they've shown...

404
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,390
in a washed-up backup dancer.

405
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,360
High expectations only lead
to greater disappointment.

406
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,300
Also,

407
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:51,870
let's not flaunt our pregnancy...

408
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,040
in Chun Soo and Mi Sun's faces.

409
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,640
I wasn't flaunting anything.

410
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,850
I'm really tired
and sleepy all the time.

411
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,180
Don't you know
how hard it is for me?

412
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,950
Of course, I know it's hard for you.

413
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,460
However, it might not come off
as intended in some instances.

414
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,060
There's no harm in being careful.

415
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,360
I get it, so stop nagging me,

416
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,430
and clean the kitchen.

417
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,970
Sure.

418
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,570
Get some rest, then.

419
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,070
I'll...

420
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,420
My gosh. Sorry, Chun Soo.

421
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,220
I had to make a phone call.

422
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,830
Mi Sun...

423
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:51,430
Is your wife resting?

424
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,960
Yes, I told her to.

425
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,500
Right. I'm glad you did.

426
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,230
I'll clean up the rest,
so head to your room.

427
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,370
- Heung Soo.
- Yes?

428
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,210
I'm thrilled that
you and Ok Bun are pregnant,

429
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,140
but don't rub it in our faces.

430
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,610
Oh, that.

431
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,780
I actually warned Ok Bun
about it just now.

432
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,190
We should be more considerate.

433
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:20,690
Given that Ok Bun is not that young,

434
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,060
this must be truly exhausting
for her.

435
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,330
She also needs to be extra careful
during the first trimester.

436
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,460
Yes, of course. I understand that.

437
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,570
I'll be more considerate
from now on.

438
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,140
Chun Soo, head to your room.

439
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:35,610
Get some rest
and let me clean this up.

440
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,140
- It was a long day today.
- Right.

441
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,780
I'll head to my room, then.

442
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,780
Sure.

443
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:47,220
- I love you
- I love you

444
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,490
- Thank you, my love
- Thank you, my love

445
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:54,190
- I sing this only for you forever
- I sing this only for you forever

446
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,860
Let's sing this love song together

447
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,630
From the weather
to the nuptial song,

448
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,930
everything made it
the perfect wedding.

449
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:09,140
To be honest,
I felt it could've been better.

450
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,080
How so?

451
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:16,050
The venue could've been bigger,

452
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:19,820
and we should've invited
more guests.

453
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,850
Why is that?

454
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,850
I should've proudly...

455
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,560
announced to the world
that you were mine now.

456
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,860
I feel like
I didn't get that chance.

457
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,730
Unbelievable.

458
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,210
We should get ready for bed now.

459
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:43,640
Sure.

460
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,580
What?

461
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,780
All right, let's start filming.

462
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:51,380
What's this?

463
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,820
Come up with an acrostic poem
for Ma Kwang Sook.

464
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,460
Ma.

465
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,160
Deep in your hearts,

466
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,090
you embraced us.

467
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,100
Kwang.

468
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,400
Even during a storm,

469
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,930
you were the rock we could lean on.

470
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,000
Sook.

471
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,270
I deliver my heartfelt words...

472
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,380
of gratitude.

473
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,210
Hold on. Why are you about to cry?

474
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,350
- That's not it.
- Are you crying?

475
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,250
My eyes filled with tears
before I even realized it.

476
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,990
- It's true.
- What are you all doing in here?

477
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,390
- Hold on. It's Kwang Sook.
- Hey.

478
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:34,020
She can't know we're filming this.

479
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,360
- Coming!
- They must've filmed this...

480
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,060
without me knowing.

481
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,060
It seems that way.

482
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,300
Hold on.

483
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,830
Did they only come up
with an acrostic poem for you?

484
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,270
How could they?

485
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:50,940
- All right, guys. Gather around.
- Hush.

486
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,680
Kwang Sook almost caught us.

487
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,650
- I know. That was close, right?
- Yes.

488
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,320
Exactly.

489
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,420
Now, you'll come up...

490
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,850
with an acrostic poem
for Han Dong Seok. Han.

491
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,120
Chairman Han Dong Seok.

492
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:08,730
Dong.

493
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,460
He looks way younger
than most men his age.

494
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:12,300
Seok.

495
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,970
He might seem rigid,
almost like a statue.

496
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:17,970
- What?
- But once you get to know him,

497
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,600
you'll find out
he's actually mellow.

498
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,510
That was a good one.

499
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,140
All right. We set the mood
with acrostic poems.

500
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,680
Now, please say a few words
to the bride and groom.

501
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,250
- Chun Soo, you first.
- Me?

502
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,410
- Yes.
- Right.

503
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,720
Well, Kwang Sook...

504
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:36,650
and Chairman Han. Hold on.

505
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,590
I'll call you Dong Seok from now on.

506
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,160
I sincerely congratulate you...

507
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,230
on your wedding.

508
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,930
I wish for only good things for you.

509
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,670
Kwang Sook, tomorrow's wedding...

510
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,970
doesn't mean we're sending you away.

511
00:28:54,170 --> 00:28:56,510
It means
we're gaining Chairman Han...

512
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,740
as a brother-in-law.

513
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,440
That's why
we'll attend the wedding...

514
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,610
not with sadness, but with joy.

515
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,320
It'd be great to hear...

516
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,850
- that you're expecting too.
- Hey, come on.

517
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,060
Ok Bun, please. Stop that.

518
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,120
Unbelievable.

519
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,590
Now that you are united as one,

520
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,630
may your love and joy double.

521
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,830
May happiness always come to you
in doubles.

522
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,400
Beom Soo, my arm's too short.

523
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,600
- All right.
- Here.

524
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,900
Once again, congratulations...

525
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,510
- on your wedding.
- Congratulations!

526
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:36,610
I have to say, Kwang Sook,

527
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:40,480
no sister-in-law in Korea
is as loved as you are.

528
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,550
I agree.

529
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,060
By the way, this turned out to be
a profitable deal.

530
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,890
What do you mean?

531
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:53,100
I not only gained a wife...

532
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:56,530
but also four younger brothers.

533
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,470
You hit the jackpot, didn't you?

534
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,670
I did.

535
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,980
Who is it?

536
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:15,790
What now?

537
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,690
I came by because I was worried.

538
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,290
Worried about what?

539
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,300
You drank a lot...

540
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,430
earlier.

541
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,400
Aren't you feeling queasy?

542
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,230
Are you here to pick me up
after kicking me down?

543
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,870
Living separately doesn't mean...

544
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,010
our relationship is over.

545
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:39,310
It doesn't have to be
a black-and-white situation.

546
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:42,510
It's not like I'm moving abroad...

547
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,150
or to Busan.

548
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,480
I'll be under an hour away by car.

549
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,190
That doesn't even count
as a long-distance relationship.

550
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:52,220
Now, we can date openly
without having to be cautious...

551
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:54,290
around Kwang Sook
and her brothers-in-law.

552
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,630
It feels like we're moving past
office romance.

553
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,800
I actually feel good about this.

554
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,700
Darn.

555
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,770
So please don't be angry.

556
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,070
I won't be able to move out,

557
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:12,910
knowing you're still upset
about this.

558
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,450
Mrs. Gong.

559
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:20,250
If you move back to Golden Castle,
I have a bad feeling...

560
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:24,520
that the distance between us...

561
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,960
will only grow.

562
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,960
You're getting carried away.

563
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,200
So stop moping and come outside.

564
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,700
Before I leave,

565
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,600
let's tango one last time.

566
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,710
Shall we dance?

567
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,550
(Eagle Brewery)

568
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,170
What are you doing, Mr. Go?

569
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,600
I love you, Mrs. Gong.

570
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,260
I know you're not sleeping,

571
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,160
so get up already.

572
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,880
Hold on. Are you really asleep?

573
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,280
Darling.

574
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:06,750
Kwang Sook.

575
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:09,720
Kwang Sook?

576
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,590
Seriously?

577
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,810
Sleep tight.

578
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,650
Here comes the bride!

579
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,540
Gosh, you startled me.

580
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,250
What kind of husband
drinks wine alone...

581
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:12,180
on his wedding night?

582
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,080
You should sleep some more.

583
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,120
I didn't wake you to let you sleep.

584
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,360
Were you watching
the wedding video again?

585
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,400
I don't think
I'll ever get tired of this.

586
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:31,770
Who knew...

587
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,600
I'd be given a gift like this
in my life?

588
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:39,710
Thank you.

589
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,080
I'm the one who's more grateful.

590
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,620
Thank you.

591
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,530
No way. Look at the stars.

592
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,030
I've never seen so many stars
in the sky before.

593
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,770
Tell me about it.

594
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:11,910
We...

595
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,610
should often go out to stargaze.

596
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,110
Of course.

597
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,120
Anytime.

598
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:25,560
No way.

599
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,990
Come to think of it,

600
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,800
I don't believe...

601
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,400
I've said this before.

602
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,270
Say what?

603
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,310
I love you.

604
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,150
I love you...

605
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,550
truly.

606
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,190
Also,

607
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,260
I'll love you forever.

608
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:07,830
I...

609
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:11,500
love you too.

610
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,980
Did you sleep well?

611
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:02,390
Did you sleep well too?

612
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:03,950
I did.

613
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,460
Your arm must be aching.

614
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,430
Don't. It doesn't hurt at all.

615
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,960
Time flew by so fast.

616
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,170
I can't believe
we have to get back already.

617
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,140
We could always stay one more day.

618
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,610
We have a lifetime ahead of us
to spend together.

619
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,210
Let's get up, freshen up,

620
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,780
eat breakfast, and take a walk.

621
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,610
Shall we?

622
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:30,810
Sure.

623
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:52,000
Wouldn't it be better
to stop by the brewery first?

624
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,240
Yes.

625
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,140
My mom will head to Golden Castle...

626
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,810
after we return,

627
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,310
so we'll greet everyone
and then head home.

628
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:05,080
How about we leave now
to avoid traffic?

629
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,150
Sounds good.

630
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:09,850
Goodness.

631
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,050
Are you all right?

632
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,760
Yes, I'm good.

633
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,720
Are you sure?
Don't you need a doctor?

634
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:17,590
It's fine. I think I can walk.

635
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,600
Gosh, that could've been bad.

636
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,100
Hop on.

637
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,300
What?

638
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,270
I'll carry you to the RV.

639
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,210
I'll be heavy for you.

640
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,780
Listen to your husband. Come on.

641
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,910
I can walk just fine.

642
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,150
I'm heavier than you think.

643
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,680
I aced the physical exam, remember?

644
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,750
Now, hop on.

645
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:46,390
I'll hop on, then.

646
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,690
All right.

647
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,860
Here we go.

648
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,000
Are you okay?

649
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,030
I bet I'm heavy.

650
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,800
I'm usually not this heavy,

651
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,300
but I probably
had too much breakfast.

652
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:02,970
You're not heavy at all.

653
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,570
My wife's too slim, if you ask me.

654
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,310
I'll carry you safely
over to our RV.

655
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,350
Are you sure you're okay?

656
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,930
Dad.

657
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,260
Hey.

658
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,430
You're wearing a tie
in this hot weather.

659
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,940
Do you have
an important appointment?

660
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,310
I guess you can call it...

661
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,080
an important appointment.

662
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,310
Who are you meeting?

663
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,150
I'll tell you when I get back.

664
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,420
Se Ri.

665
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,560
Yes?

666
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:01,830
Even though you're my daughter,

667
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:05,400
I have to say you've become
such a fine young lady.

668
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:10,810
That came out of nowhere.
Why would you say that?

669
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,680
I mean it.

670
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,340
I looked around,

671
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,880
and I couldn't find
a child prettier...

672
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,580
or sweeter than you.

673
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,350
I'm not saying that
because you're mine.

674
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:27,690
You really grew up well,
and I'm proud of you.

675
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,830
Thank you, Se Ri.

676
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,100
What got into you, Dad?

677
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:38,130
Is something wrong?

678
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,300
Why would anything be wrong?

679
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:48,010
You just look extra pretty today.

680
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,880
When you have...

681
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,850
a child of your own,

682
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,780
you'll understand how I feel.

683
00:41:56,850 --> 00:41:58,320
Could I give away...

684
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:01,220
a beautiful daughter like you
to just anyone?

685
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:06,630
It would feel wrong and upsetting
because no man is good enough.

686
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,470
I had...

687
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,740
high expectations for and about you,

688
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,640
so I laid a massive amount
of pressure on you.

689
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,040
I said what I did
for your sake and benefit,

690
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,380
so don't be too upset
or angry about it, okay?

691
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,150
You're weird today.

692
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,650
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

693
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:33,920
I'll be late.

694
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,390
I should go.

695
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,400
My darling daughter.

696
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,200
Can I hug you?

697
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,970
Yes.

698
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,480
I will...

699
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,850
see you later.

700
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,680
Okay.

701
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:05,420
Dad.

702
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,090
Are you really okay?

703
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,490
(Application for Divorce)

704
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,070
Honey.

705
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:58,640
Where are you?

706
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,910
I'm at the hotel.

707
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:05,150
You don't have to stay
in a suffocating, tiny suite.

708
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,350
Go home.

709
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:09,990
What do you mean?

710
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:16,790
I'm off to the prosecutors' office
for questioning.

711
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:21,300
They'll get an arrest warrant
by the end of it.

712
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,970
Why are you telling me this now?

713
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:31,970
I didn't want to...

714
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,640
tell you too soon...

715
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:36,580
and make you worry.

716
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,490
When the result is out,

717
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,220
my lawyer will call you.

718
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:52,030
If I'm arrested,

719
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,360
move back home.

720
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,900
We don't want Se Ri
to live alone in that huge house.

721
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,940
Did you call me to say that?

722
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,910
Well, that was one of the reasons.

723
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:13,420
I wanted to hear your voice
one last time too.

724
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,160
Why is this the last time?
Are you going somewhere to die?

725
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:24,790
I'm not going off to die.

726
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,100
But...

727
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,400
I am scared, Mi Ae.

728
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,170
Don't be scared.

729
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,740
Tell the truth...

730
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,640
and say you're sorry.
They'll take that into account.

731
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,640
I know what to do.

732
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:45,210
You look after Se Ri.

733
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,190
I have to go.

734
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:04,930
Honey.

735
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,520
Did you have a good time,
Kwang Sook?

736
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,730
No, we didn't prepare much at all.

737
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:34,630
Drop by
and have a simple meal with us.

738
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,830
Okay. Drive safely.

739
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:45,040
Can I help you?

740
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,340
Oh, dear.

741
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,250
Are you looking for someone?

742
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,720
No, I'm not.

743
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,790
Excuse me?

744
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,130
Ok Bun, how do you feel today?

745
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:14,340
I don't feel nauseous today.

746
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:15,740
I feel pretty good.

747
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:17,470
That's good to hear.

748
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,080
Oh, right.

749
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:23,910
I saw a woman...

750
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:27,380
peeking over our gate
when I got back from the store.

751
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,380
A woman?

752
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:31,450
What did she look like?

753
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,460
I didn't get a good look
because she was wearing a cap,

754
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,960
but she had short hair.

755
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,860
She was looking into the yard,
so I asked who she was,

756
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,030
and she walked off.

757
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,930
Did she come to the wrong address?

758
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:45,700
Did she?

759
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,240
Kwang Sook is here.

760
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,550
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

761
00:47:57,910 --> 00:47:59,950
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

762
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:01,320
Oh, my.

763
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,790
- Welcome!
- Welcome.

764
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:06,390
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

765
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:11,390
Aren't you upset
the honeymoon was so short?

766
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,730
The length isn't important.

767
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,900
It depends on what you do.

768
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,570
Yes. You're not exactly young.

769
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,240
Work hard and speed things up.

770
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:28,640
Mom, what's there to speed up with
when we're married?

771
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,910
You should have a baby.

772
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,380
Goodness.

773
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,050
Mom. Don't you know how old I am?

774
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:37,690
Who cares about that?

775
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:41,290
You're both healthy and in love.
What's to stop you?

776
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:42,820
Am I wrong?

777
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,090
No.

778
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,090
Medicine has advanced a lot,

779
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:47,330
so more older couples
are having kids.

780
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:49,970
A professor in my department
is in his 50s,

781
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,930
and his wife
just had another daughter.

782
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:55,800
If you're going to have a baby,

783
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:58,370
it would be better to get pregnant
as soon as possible.

784
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:01,380
I don't think
I'd be having this hard a time...

785
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:04,150
if I'd gotten pregnant last year.

786
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:05,510
Poor you.

787
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:09,120
What do you think, Dong Seok?

788
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,650
Me?

789
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:13,860
Well...

790
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,390
He has an adult son and daughter.

791
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,830
We can't have a baby.

792
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:24,570
The thing is,

793
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:27,340
I already have a babe.

794
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:37,210
My Kwang Sook is my babe.

795
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:40,620
My gosh...

796
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:45,420
Being married changed you, Chairman.

797
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,060
Yes.

798
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:51,490
Mom. Enough of that nonsense, okay?

799
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,500
Fine, you brat.

800
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,900
Let's eat
so those who must go can get going.

801
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,330
- Let's move it.
- Okay.

802
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,130
Thanks for the food.

803
00:49:59,370 --> 00:50:00,370
Let's eat.

804
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:08,810
Welcome home.

805
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,480
Hello.

806
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:12,680
We welcome you to our family.

807
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,280
I hope we all get along.

808
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,020
Thank you.

809
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:20,820
I hope you'll help me out
from now on.

810
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,460
You can speak freely and casually.

811
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,030
Well...

812
00:50:25,830 --> 00:50:27,060
Shall I do that, then?

813
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,930
You're extremely welcome.

814
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:33,300
Thank you, Bom.

815
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:36,640
I hope you two and Kwang Sook...

816
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,370
will look out for me too.

817
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:41,310
I'm not used to hearing you
talk like that.

818
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,310
He wasn't this sweet.

819
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:46,080
He's right.

820
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:48,680
Do you two...

821
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:51,590
have to ruin my image on day one?

822
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,660
You'll get to see a much sweeter...

823
00:50:56,660 --> 00:50:58,090
and kinder dad from now on.

824
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:01,560
Let's compromise when we must,

825
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,900
adjust to suit each other's needs,
and have a fun life.

826
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,170
- Okay.
- Okay.

827
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,440
Let's all try to get along.

828
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,140
My gosh.

829
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:19,050
I got a great son and daughter
like Gyeol and Bom...

830
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:20,850
as soon as I got married.

831
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:23,120
Aren't I so lucky?

832
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,450
I'm happy that you are happy.

833
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,460
By the way,

834
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:33,330
about what Mom said earlier.

835
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:35,700
Don't worry about it at all.

836
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:38,170
We already have Gyeol and Bom.

837
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:40,400
Don't worry about what she said.

838
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:42,640
I know, right?

839
00:51:42,740 --> 00:51:45,370
You think the same as I do, right?

840
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:46,810
Of course, I do.

841
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:48,910
If we have a baby now,

842
00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:51,180
how old would we be
when our child starts school?

843
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:54,650
My goodness.
I don't even want to imagine it.

844
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,020
That's what I'm saying.

845
00:51:58,020 --> 00:52:01,520
The time our child can spend with us
will be too short.

846
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:05,590
All I want is you, Kwang Sook.

847
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:08,460
You don't need
to worry about it. Okay?

848
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:11,630
Did you just call me Kwang Sook?

849
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,600
You should be punished.

850
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,840
The helper asked if...

851
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:20,880
you had lunch.

852
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:22,380
I'm sorry.

853
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,350
For me,

854
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:33,290
you're more than enough.

855
00:52:33,290 --> 00:52:36,590
Let's live happily together
on our own, then.

856
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:40,630
(Reliable Movers)

857
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:42,130
- Thank you.
- No problem.

858
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,470
Go to the management office...

859
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:45,670
and tell them
that Gong Ju Sil is moving in.

860
00:52:45,670 --> 00:52:47,570
- Then they will let you in.
- Okay.

861
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:49,340
- Thank you.
- All right.

862
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,070
Please take good care of it.

863
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:54,780
(Eagle Brewery)

864
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:56,950
We will keep the room empty.

865
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,410
You can visit us anytime.

866
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:02,180
I'll keep your room clean.

867
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:04,190
How can you two...

868
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:07,360
be so sweet and considerate?

869
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,330
Thank you for everything.

870
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,800
Thank you.

871
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,100
I want you to be happy.

872
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,200
Okay.

873
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,610
The early stages of pregnancy
are the most important,

874
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,410
so take extra care of yourself.

875
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,710
Don't give your wife a hard time.

876
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,410
Of course not.

877
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:34,520
We will come to visit you...

878
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,350
and look around Golden Castle.

879
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,720
You are always welcome.

880
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:43,020
I'll look forward to your wedding.

881
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:47,560
Ha Ni, say bye.

882
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:48,800
Bye.

883
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:57,240
Kang Soo, you are in charge
of good looks at Eagle Brewery.

884
00:53:58,070 --> 00:53:59,210
Take care.

885
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:01,310
Take care. Please visit us often.

886
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:04,150
You too, Kim. Stay healthy.

887
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:05,380
Please be happy.

888
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,650
(Taxi)

889
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:09,850
The taxi is here.

890
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,590
Take care, everyone.

891
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,030
I'll miss you a lot.

892
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:24,170
Mr. Go isn't here.

893
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:25,430
Did he go out?

894
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:28,100
I know. He'll be sad
if she leaves without seeing him.

895
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:29,200
I know, right?

896
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,810
Hang on a second.

897
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,460
Ms. Gong is leaving now.

898
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:55,800
You'll regret this later.

899
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:58,770
Please go and say goodbye.

900
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:19,290
Well... I should get going.

901
00:55:19,290 --> 00:55:20,820
You can go back in now.

902
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:32,430
- Bye.
- Bye.

903
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:33,940
Bye.

904
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:41,210
Mrs. Gong...

905
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:44,910
Mrs. Gong!

906
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,120
Hello?

907
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:31,130
The arrest warrant has been issued.

908
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:33,630
Then...

909
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:36,200
Will he be arrested right away?

910
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:37,630
Yes.

911
00:56:38,430 --> 00:56:41,670
Mr. Dokgo
just got into the police van,

912
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:45,140
and he's now being transported
to the detention center.

913
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:47,810
Ms. Jang.

914
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:51,250
I'm sorry.

915
00:56:53,050 --> 00:56:54,320
I don't know what to say.

916
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,440
Mom.

917
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:18,740
What happened?

918
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:30,750
What's the matter?
Is there something wrong?

919
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:33,350
Don't be shocked.

920
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,590
Don't be surprised, darling puppy.

921
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,590
What's the matter?

922
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:43,870
Your dad...

923
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,130
has been arrested.

924
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:49,000
He was just taken...

925
00:57:50,570 --> 00:57:52,640
to the detention center.

926
00:57:57,410 --> 00:57:58,410
What?

927
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,750
What are you talking about?

928
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,690
I got a call from him this morning.

929
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:08,420
He told me...

930
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,390
to come home and stay with you
if he got arrested.

931
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:15,560
He was only worried about you
until the end.

932
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:22,940
I had no idea.

933
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:27,580
What do we do now, Mom?

934
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,940
Your dad...

935
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,780
will get over this.

936
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:38,650
What do we do?

937
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,960
I feel so bad for Dad.

938
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,430
You know he's not a weak man.

939
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:49,560
Your dad...

940
00:58:51,130 --> 00:58:52,630
will get through this well.

941
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,030
Hi, Se Ri.

942
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:23,700
My dad...

943
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:26,900
has been arrested.

944
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:32,340
I see.

945
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,440
What should Mom and I do now?

946
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:20,960
(1S9 1523)

947
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:34,940
(From a sinful person
to a merciful human being)

948
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:50,850
(For Eagle Brothers)

949
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:52,750
Is this you looking down on me?

950
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,350
This isn't right, Ok Bun.

951
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:56,480
Money isn't the answer
to everything, Ok Bun.

952
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:59,350
How could you put it like that?

953
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:01,760
Mi Sun can be a real stickler.

954
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,290
She's always so stubborn.

955
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,430
Whatever!

956
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:06,430
If this is how it'll be,
we'll move out.

957
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,000
- You'll move out?
- You'll move out?

958
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,630
You've refused
your wife's visitation for a month,

959
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:12,330
but you didn't turn me away.

960
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:14,770
Did you come here just to see...

961
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:17,070
how far I've fallen from grace?

962
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:20,540
How could we possibly have a baby
at our age?

963
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,280
We're still young enough.

964
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,110
This topic is now off-limits.

965
01:02:24,110 --> 01:02:25,680
Says who?

966
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:28,250
Knowing you four are in my corner,

967
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,050
I won't back out of this fight.

968
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:31,620
Here's to our brother's victory.

969
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:33,120
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
