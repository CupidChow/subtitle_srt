1
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,320
Come back.

2
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,280
What's wrong with you?

3
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,479
They are discussing

4
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,520
how to help your family make money.

5
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,480
I’ll go there later.

6
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,760
Ding Yike, Ding Yike,

7
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,520
Why do you have such a big heart?

8
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,360
Is that your boyfriend?

9
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,920
So what?

10
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,039
Leo.

11
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,200
I don't think she's your girlfriend yet.

12
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,640
Besides,

13
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,320
he's not mine.

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,240
Some people are destined to shine brightly.

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,200
to absorb

16
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,440
by their side

17
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,520
to absorb light and heat.

18
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,440
Why do you care who they are?

19
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,360
No.

20
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,200
By the way, Mr. Du,

21
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,200
you were

22
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,720
you were on bad terms with our boss.

23
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,040
When did you start to love from hatred?

24
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,880
Don't talk nonsense. What do you mean?

25
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,160
I'm caring about my colleagues, you know?

26
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,280
Are you doubting my IQ

27
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,280
or your own IQ?

28
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,680
You're

29
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,760
more and more like Leo.

30
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,040
Wrong, I am me.

31
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,040
Different fireworks.

32
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,120
I was wrong.

33
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,680
Are you serious about Coco?

34
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,760
I'm serious about you too.

35
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,160
That's right.

36
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,960
I did some research

37
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,920
and some information.

38
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,840
But not only for you,

39
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,680
Mr. Du, including May.

40
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,120
You know what?

41
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,520
Last season,

42
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,840
all your main designs in May

43
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,520
is my design.

44
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,560
right?

45
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,760
You want to sue Oh-wol?

46
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,400
But the intellectual property dispute in the fashion industry

47
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,440
is not that simple.

48
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,960
What I said is true.

49
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,079
I broke up with the television.

50
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,079
I'm going back to Shanghai.

51
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,880
Gradually, my focus of work

52
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,960
will also turn to China.

53
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,640
While taking care of haute couture,

54
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,920
it will slowly move to the garment.

55
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,079
As you know,

56
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,400
many European and American designers

57
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,520
When they are famous designers,

58
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,400
they will

59
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,760
by the way.

60
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,200
You're a professional. Oh-wol is a professional too.

61
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,560
Isn't this

62
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,840
for me?

63
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,960
Besides, you owe me

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,360
a big favor.

65
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,839
Why did you choose me as a breakthrough

66
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,600
instead of directly contact with Mr. Du?

67
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,040
It's because of Ding Yike.

68
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,240
She kept watching me every day

69
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,040
how excellent her boss is.

70
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,320
and awesome.

71
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,640
Besides,

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,320
you saw Mr. Du.

73
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,680
He doesn’t

74
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,040
to let me join.

75
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,240
So I can only make a second choice.

76
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,760
to make a joint design.

77
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:40,320
Actually this way

78
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,800
is the best for May.

79
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,760
Everyone has enough time

80
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,920
to test their real strength.

81
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,840
What do you think?

82
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,080
Have you figured out

83
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,360
someone else in May?

84
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,560
I think you're overconfident.

85
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,320
Your suggestion is interesting,

86
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,080
but in May,

87
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,240
I just want to work with

88
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,360
independent designers.

89
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,640
Your level is too high.

90
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,880
I'm afraid May can't control you.

91
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,040
No one can refuse me.

92
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,280
Including you.

93
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,000
Thanks for your ice cream.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,880
and your car.

95
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,640
Why are you laughing?

96
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,040
I'm laughing at you for being so arrogant.

97
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,159
It reminds me of myself many years ago.

98
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,760
Let's meet next week.

99
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,800
Sure.

100
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,560
Coming.

101
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,280
Let's go.

102
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,080
Let's go.

103
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
What were you two talking about?

104
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,800
I have a plan

105
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,000
to change Wuyue.

106
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,520
Let's talk in the car. Where's the car?

107
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,640
Over there.

108
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,560
What's wrong with him?

109
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,000
Crazy.

110
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,800
Who is it? Why did you turn on the light?

111
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,640
Are you out of your mind?

112
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,920
Turn it off.

113
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,280
Are you calling your father sick?

114
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,720
What brings you here?

115
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,040
What wind?

116
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Look at you.

117
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,640
You're not doing anything in the middle of the night.

118
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,200
Riding a shabby bike

119
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
with a bunch of bad friends.

120
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,200
I almost bumped into your father today.

121
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,640
What about tomorrow?

122
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,080
You want to kill and set fire?

123
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,760
Enough?

124
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,960
Are you done?

125
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,200
Please go home.

126
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,440
What?

127
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,520
You don't want me to hit you?

128
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,840
Uncle Zhao, why are you here?

129
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,200
Who is your Uncle Zhao? Go away.

130
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
You've grown up.

131
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,120
You know how to cut two shabby clothes.

132
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,280
You don't know who you are.

133
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,680
I know what you're capable of.

134
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,400
Stay in America if you can.

135
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,000
He even came back to work

136
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,920
You even said Shen Jin

137
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:42,920
I think

138
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,040
you're worse than her.

139
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,960
What era is this?

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,960
You still want to beat up the couple?

141
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,400
Even if I'm with Patrick, I won't let you go.

142
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,120
What?

143
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,159
How could you

144
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,760
despise your own son?

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,200
Yes.

146
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,600
He came back to Korea because of me.

147
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
He opened a shop to keep me company.

148
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,880
What's wrong with that?

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,680
Did he spend a penny of your money?

150
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,960
He even wore shabby clothes.

151
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,800
Do you know what design is?

152
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,120
Do you think

153
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,560
better than the president's daughter?

154
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,120
It's much better than those

155
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,200
who came to New York

156
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,680
You're a fashion boss.

157
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,240
They treat Moyuan as a treasure.

158
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,840
But look at you, your son is like a grass.

159
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,000
Wait.

160
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,600
Who are you?

161
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,280
What does it have to do with you

162
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,480
has nothing to do with you.

163
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,919
You don't know me.

164
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,159
You don't know me?

165
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,000
Patrick said he would take me home.

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,600
How dare you pretend not to know me?

167
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,280
You're an elder.

168
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,760
How can you insult me like this?

169
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,280
I'm not from Shanghai. I'm poor.

170
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,120
Am I guilty?

171
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,240
Is it wrong for me to pursue love?

172
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,320
That's right.

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,760
Yes.

174
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,720
Patrick likes motorcycles.

175
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,000
He likes to be with

176
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,240
better buddies.

177
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Is he wrong?

178
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,280
Who are you to scold him?

179
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,680
Why are you scolding us?

180
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,440
Why?

181
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,160
Yeah.

182
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Why are you scolding us?

183
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
No, I mean...

184
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,080
Dad.

185
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,400
Can't you be nicer to us?

186
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,240
Be nice to him.

187
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,120
That's right.

188
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,360
Be good to them.

189
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,040
Be good to that girl.

190
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,600
I can't stand it anymore.

191
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,840
I don't want to stay here anymore.

192
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,240
Mo Yuan, take me away.

193
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,040
Let's go. Take me away.

194
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,840
We're leaving now.

195
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,200
We're leaving.

196
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,960
Let's go.

197
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,920
Let's go.

198
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,560
Let's go.

199
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,240
Come on, stop looking.

200
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,520
Dismiss.

201
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,240
Let's go.

202
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,440
Let's go.

203
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,360
Mr. Zhao, no one is here.

204
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:55,920
Let's go.

205
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,440
Let me tell you.

206
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,600
I couldn't take it anymore.

207
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,640
Did you see her?

208
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,400
She's totally a drama queen.

209
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,600
Look at his dad.

210
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,880
his face is so bad.

211
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,360
Show some respect to your elders.

212
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,800
You kids

213
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,560
don't respect your parents at home.

214
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,280
Even if...

215
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,560
All right.

216
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,280
It has nothing to do with me.

217
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,600
Let's make a bet.

218
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,160
Who do you think

219
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,000
will choose in the end?

220
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,960
Who will he choose? Will you be his emperor?

221
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,680
But Miss Lei must be in the main palace.

222
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,840
Do you know how many years Momo has been looking for her?

223
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,720
Let me tell you, on the phone that day,

224
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,120
when you called me that day,

225
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,320
Sheng Sheng has changed.

226
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,280
I can only bet five yuan.

227
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,440
I bet on Sister Ding.

228
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,040
You didn't see

229
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,680
The way he looked at her just now

230
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,880
was so gentle.

231
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,320
I was so touched.

232
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,240
Let me tell you.

233
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,040
they will have a chance in the future.

234
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,840
Is it that exaggerated?

235
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,040
I've been with him for so many years.

236
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,160
I know him well.

237
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,400
Prince Charming

238
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,280
looks like he doesn't care

239
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,320
It doesn't matter.

240
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,120
But actually,

241
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,560
he cares about his pride.

242
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,040
What are his two acupoints?

243
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,680
One.

244
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,120
his dad always looks down on

245
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,080
his design.

246
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,600
Second, about Shen Jin

247
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,240
But Mr. Bai

248
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,400
he'll be in trouble.

249
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,920
If it weren't for you,

250
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,840
the family ethics drama would have turned into a soap opera.

251
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,800
There will be

252
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,320
in the circle tomorrow.

253
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,840
Understand?

254
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,760
What are they doing now?

255
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,400
Is it possible that the lady is holding the prince charming's waist?

256
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
Like this.

257
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,160
Uncle Qian.

258
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,920
Who are you calling Uncle Qian?

259
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,960
I’m 32 years old. Call me brother.

260
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,680
I have to pull over.

261
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,480
I left my helmet there in a hurry.

262
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,480
Wait for Qian.

263
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,480
He'll pick us up later.

264
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,720
What's wrong?

265
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,560
Nothing.

266
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,880
Stop it.

267
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,000
I know everything about you.

268
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,480
I'm not blind.

269
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,920
Why are you unhappy?

270
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,560
No.

271
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,120
I'm just too good at acting.

272
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,280
I argued with your dad just now.

273
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,120
I couldn't perform.

274
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,760
My dad is the one who's angry.

275
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,760
Why are you upset?

276
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,960
Do you think I was being nosy?

277
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,600
No, I didn't mean that.

278
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,680
What's wrong?

279
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,400
Cheer up.

280
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,400
What? We agreed not to play electricity.

281
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,920
Okay.

282
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
That's the business of Drama Queen.

283
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,320
I don't understand, okay?

284
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,920
What's wrong with being nosy?

285
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,680
That's because I'm loyal.

286
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,560
I just can't stand

287
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,720
being scolded.

288
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,520
Not even your dad.

289
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,120
Back in the company,

290
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,880
Leo was also gossiped.

291
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,320
I stood up for her too.

292
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,280
You are all excellent.

293
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:16,960
Very good.

294
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,080
Others know nothing.

295
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,600
How could they say that?

296
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,640
That means I'm petty.

297
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
You are the heroine

298
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,680
and uphold justice.

299
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,000
I apologize to you.

300
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,960
OK?

301
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,360
I...

302
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,520
I'm not just upset

303
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,360
because of your dad.

304
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,480
Two days ago, I met

305
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,920
Lin Sixian and his girlfriend.

306
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,560
My legs are weak again.

307
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
I hate myself

308
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,760
Why am I so disappointing?

309
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,600
You know what?

310
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,680
We've broken up.

311
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,320
Look at me.

312
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
I was still timid at the critical moment.

313
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,600
That's not right.

314
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,840
I didn't see him last time.

315
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,720
your ex-boyfriend.

316
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,920
I saw Mr. Du.

317
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,800
holding your hand.

318
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,320
He looks like your boyfriend.

319
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,520
No, he likes Ray.

320
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,200
Even a fool can tell.

321
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,280
he likes Leo.

322
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,720
You...

323
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,960
You don't mind?

324
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,200
Why should I?

325
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,080
Anyway, I think

326
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,520
Leo likes him.

327
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,640
That's why...

328
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,200
I hated him all afternoon.

329
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,560
But I didn't chase him away.

330
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,360
Anyway,

331
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,680
At least I saw

332
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,000
Leo's eyes

333
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,400
I think that fire is burning again.

334
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,840
I think it's enough. I'm very happy.

335
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,880
Are you crying

336
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,920
by me?

337
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,840
Don't cry.

338
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,080
Look at your eyeliner.

339
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,200
Look.

340
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,520
You lied to me.

341
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,280
I didn't draw eyeliner today.

342
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:57,880
You lied to me again.

343
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,840
Why are you so stupid?

344
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,800
Why did you lie to me?

345
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,320
What are you doing?

346
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
You're so annoying.

347
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,360
I'm afraid you'll cry.

348
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:02,880
Okay.

349
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,760
I hate you.

350
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,920
Okay.

351
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,080
Got it.

352
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,000
Wait for Qian.

353
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,400
Qian, we'll be there in five minutes.

354
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,960
So pretty.

355
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,280
Mr. Lin, you're still here.

356
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,960
I’m busy for a while.

357
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,440
Let me make you a cup of coffee.

358
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,880
Mr. Lin.

359
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,680
Where did you put the coffee

360
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,880
Where did you put it?

361
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,000
I don't drink coffee anymore.

362
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,280
You go first. Don't worry about me.

363
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,400
Okay, I'll get going then.

364
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,440
Bye.

365
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,560
The collaboration with high-end designers

366
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,000
collaboration with high-end designers

367
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,280
has always been a brand weapon.

368
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,319
Just like Moses.

369
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,359
and a famous designer.

370
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Their collaboration will be a hit.

371
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,319
If we need to transform in May,

372
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,079
I think this opportunity

373
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,599
is a good opportunity.

374
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,760
Well,

375
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,119
How do we divide the profit rate?

376
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Four or six.

377
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,359
He's six and we're four.

378
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,240
I think Zhao Moyuan

379
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,480
he can cooperate with us.

380
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,560
to work with us.

381
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,880
I need to discuss this

382
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,840
with the management.

383
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:34,800
Of course.

384
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,560
First of all,

385
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,800
the project yourself.

386
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,560
When did I

387
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,840
your proposal?

388
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,480
It's getting late. I should go back.

389
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,120
Go to the subway station ahead

390
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,080
and put me down.

391
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,480
Why are you going home? You haven't eaten yet.

392
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,880
Aren't you tired after talking for so long?

393
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,240
Besides,

394
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,920
you just rode a motorcycle.

395
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,520
You need more protein.

396
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,720
There are many details.

397
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,840
You have to tell me.

398
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,320
If not,

399
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,920
to persuade those old guys.

400
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,240
The salad here is great.

401
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,000
And oysters are air-transported.

402
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,880
Japanese and French

403
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,640
Australia.

404
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,520
Where do you like?

405
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,400
I'll have juice.

406
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,880
What juice for dinner?

407
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Juice at night is bad for your stomach.

408
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,720
Adultery and acid at night.

409
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,560
We have to drink some wine tonight.

410
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,840
The sound of 21 years

411
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,680
Not bad.

412
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,120
You must be a regular here.

413
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,280
You must have consummated a lot of rooms here.

414
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,600
What are you talking about?

415
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,800
How is that possible, Mr. Du?

416
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,720
Long time no see.

417
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,720
Is this the old room?

418
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,200
Okay.

419
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,720
Okay, I'll arrange it now.

420
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,280
Don't get me wrong.

421
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,600
Because our house is very far away.

422
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,160
in the western suburbs.

423
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,200
And this place is closer to the company.

424
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,440
Sometimes when I'm late for the meeting,

425
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,800
I had a regular meeting the next morning.

426
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,960
That's why I'm here for a night.

427
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,440
Miss Lei.

428
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,120
Long time no see.

429
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,440
Mrs. Zhou.

430
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,080
When did you come to Shanghai?

431
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,280
Kaixi wants to play Disneyland here.

432
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,720
Vincent

433
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,440
brought our family here.

434
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,800
Miss Lei, why are you in such a hurry?

435
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,560
Are you hiding from someone?

436
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,640
Leo!

437
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,600
Didn't you say you were going to fix your makeup?

438
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,960
I don't think your makeup is messed up.

439
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,280
I met an old friend.

440
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,240
I'm Leo's friend. My surname is Du.

441
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,120
Hello.

442
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:47,760
Nice to meet you.

443
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,040
Rose!

444
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,600
Leo, long time no see.

445
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,720
Are you okay?

446
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,640
I'm fine thanks to you.

447
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,080
Is this

448
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,600
you always mentioned to me, right?

449
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,160
Du Xiuqi, CEO of May.

450
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,000
It’s you.

451
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,760
I saw you on the company profile.

452
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,040
I didn't expect you to be better in person.

453
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,240
Thank you.

454
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,160
Hello, I'm Zhou Boan from Orange.

455
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,800
Nice to meet you.

456
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,040
When did you come to Shanghai?

457
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,880
Why didn't you tell me?

458
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,240
Let me be a host.

459
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,240
You're welcome.

460
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,640
This is not a business trip.

461
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,520
A family trip.

462
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,160
How many more days?

463
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,920
Do you have time to visit May?

464
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,280
You're welcome.

465
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,720
If you come again,

466
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,200
you must come to visit me.

467
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,520
Orange is indeed from a big family.

468
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,560
You look down on Leo and me.

469
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,760
with Leo and me.

470
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,200
That's enough.

471
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,920
It doesn't matter if it's tomorrow or later.

472
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,080
Anyway, May.

473
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,640
you're always welcome.

474
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,760
Mr. and Mrs. Zhou,

475
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,040
we’re leaving.

476
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,200
Excuse me.

477
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,920
Have you seen enough?

478
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,560
Stop it.

479
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,680
I told you.

480
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,240
we're just colleagues.

481
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,320
You can fool me,

482
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,200
but yourself?

483
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:32,880
What's wrong?

484
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,400
Thank you for earlier.

485
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,200
Did something happen just now?

486
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,240
I want a drink.

487
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,320
Okay.

488
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,160
I'll drink with you no matter what.

489
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,240
Let's go.

490
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,680
Caesar salad.

491
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,360
And a smoked salmon.

492
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,520
and a dozen of oysters.

493
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,320
A bottle of 21-year-old sound.

494
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,280
No salad.

495
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,880
Smoke salmon.

496
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,680
Change it to white truffle pasta.

497
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,880
Two more cream mushroom soup.

498
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,080
Add another bottle of Yu City for 15 years.

499
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
If you don't feel well,

500
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,000
don't eat cold food.

501
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,000
Listen to her.

502
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,800
Why do you suddenly care about me?

503
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,840
You care about your health.

504
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,080
Isn't it the basic quality

505
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,320
a professional manager?

506
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,680
Besides,

507
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,040
about working with Zhao Moyuan,

508
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,720
I hope you can help me

509
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,960
in front of your father.

510
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,160
You want to bribe me?

511
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,520
That won't do.

512
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,280
This is just the beginning.

513
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:39,920
Cheers.

514
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,280
Do you like the smell of smoke?

515
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,680
This is the first time you've smiled at me like this.

516
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,000
The line is too old-fashioned. Change it.

517
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,360
I'm telling the truth.

518
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,200
You used to smile at me

519
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,360
or you always smiled perfunctory.

520
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,560
You only smiled at one person.

521
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,360
To Ding Yike.

522
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,440
Because she is my true love.

523
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,360
Really?

524
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,720
Guess.

525
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,600
Really? I don't know.

526
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,160
Anyway, I know you.

527
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,840
You get carried away when you drink.

528
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,040
As long as the wine is real.

529
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,920
I don't know anything else.

530
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,600
One thing. It’s Zhao Moyuan’s design.

531
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,920
Is it similar to

532
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,320
Don't worry.

533
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,400
Leave the fusion to me.

534
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,280
Okay, that's what you said.

535
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,120
Let's get drunk tonight.

536
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,560
Come on.

537
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,320
Bottoms up.

538
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,600
I caught you.

539
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,800
You're smiling at me again.

540
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,680
Does that mean

541
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,840
Ding Yike and I

542
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,600
and Zhao Moyuan.

543
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,400
We can compete.

544
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,160
Think about me.

545
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,240
I'm better than Ding Yike, right?

546
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,440
She, right?

547
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,680
I don't have a boyfriend.

548
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,240
I'm still single.

549
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,960
Besides,

550
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,480
I can help you.

551
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,920
I can help you.

552
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,440
Even if we went to the bathroom together,

553
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,240
I'm the only one who can do it.

554
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,680
I didn't put it in your office.

555
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,680
I'm not a pervert.

556
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,680
I don't like watching those.

557
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,920
It's okay.

558
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,640
I have a good body.

559
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,800
360 degrees in all directions.

560
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,720
Don't be afraid. Just take a look.

561
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,960
I'm sorry for letting you down.

562
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,520
But I never

563
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,880
I don't like to develop friendship

564
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,720
friends.

565
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,040
So in order not to let you down again,

566
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,480
I suggest

567
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,640
not to be friends with me.

568
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,360
What do you think?

569
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,640
Would you consider me?

570
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,360
What do you think?

571
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:51,720
Hello?

572
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,160
Hello, Wang Yuan?

573
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:54,680
Mr. Du.

574
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,080
Find me a gym near the company.

575
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,920
It takes 24 hours.

576
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,200
Buy me another 3,000 yuan private lesson.

577
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,360
That's it. Bye.

578
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,520
Okay, tighten your abdomen.

579
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,240
One.

580
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:16,880
Two.

581
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,760
Three.

582
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,200
Move your ankles back. Yes.

583
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,640
Four.

584
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,840
Five.

585
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:28,960
Six.

586
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,240
Seven.

587
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,640
Come on.

588
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,040
Eight.

589
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:45,800
Nine.

590
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:50,800
Ten.

591
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,000
Eleven.

592
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,440
Are you okay?

593
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,440
Good. Keep it up.

594
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
Let's take a break.

595
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
Fashion.

596
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,880
Fashion.

597
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,280
Green.

598
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,920
Morning, Uncle Zhao.

599
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
Do you want breakfast?

600
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,120
I've had breakfast.

601
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,280
Thank you.

602
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,120
You... By the way,

603
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,120
I told you a lot of

604
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,240
to you last night.

605
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,720
I'm sorry.

606
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,560
I'm sorry.

607
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,240
Wait.

608
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,160
You...

609
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,560
What's your name?

610
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,560
My name is Ding Yike.

611
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,320
It means it's okay.

612
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:07,680
You don't have to recall it.

613
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,680
Zhao Moyuan never said he would take me home.

614
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,080
You've never seen me before.

615
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,120
But I've seen you before.

616
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,040
Last week.

617
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,080
It was here, right?

618
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,760
You may scold me,

619
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,320
but you still care about Zhao Moyuan.

620
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,480
No.

621
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,480
Don't talk nonsense.

622
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,560
When did I

623
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,040
I made a scene with you last night.

624
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,400
you must be very angry.

625
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,920
But in front of so many people,

626
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,000
in front of so many people,

627
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,720
He said his friend is a friend of a fox.

628
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,360
That's not right.

629
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,400
Zhao Moyuan is really excellent.

630
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,920
And he is really a top designer.

631
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,200
I've seen his design.

632
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,160
It's like garbage.

633
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,360
It's just a bluff.

634
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,800
I don't know how to pretend to understand.

635
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,480
One more thing to make you angry.

636
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,400
You really underestimated your son.

637
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,440
He's pretending to know.

638
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,440
But have you ever visited his shop

639
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,720
and bought his clothes?

640
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,600
Have you seen his design carefully?

641
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,560
Thousands of clothes.

642
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,120
Many people want to buy them.

643
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,880
Many people want to be fooled.

644
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,040
Don't you believe me?

645
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,280
Let me show you something.

646
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,160
Even the president's daughter is his fan.

647
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,480
You keep scolding him.

648
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,680
Why?

649
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,600
You don't have long ears.

650
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,520
Anyway,

651
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,720
a man should fight for his skin.

652
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,480
The most important thing for a man is dignity.

653
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,520
You should

654
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,360
give him more face.

655
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,000
Talk to your son nicely.

656
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,000
It's not embarrassing.

657
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,600
A successful person like you

658
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,840
must agree with me.

659
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,200
Even if you say no,

660
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,920
I understand.

661
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,800
I won't bother you then.

662
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,760
I'm leaving. Bye.

663
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,080
What?

664
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,400
This kid.

665
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,280
Liu.

666
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,640
What did you mean

667
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,640
What do you mean?

668
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,760
You called him a jerk.

669
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,800
Then what are you?

670
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,360
I...

671
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,920
This kid.

672
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,520
Welcome. Take a look.

673
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,640
Welcome.

674
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,800
Take a look.

675
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,520
Prince Charming.

676
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,840
What's going on?

677
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:26,840
Well...

678
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,960
See for yourself.

679
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,760
Do you have a size for me to wear?

680
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,280
There's nothing you can wear here.

681
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
I bought this in Huanya.

682
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,200
You might look more energetic in this.

683
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,000
Why are you still buying? You're a loser.

684
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,280
You make clothes.

685
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,800
Why didn't you make one for me?

686
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,320
You don't know

687
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,040
I've been making women's clothes all these years?

688
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,160
But do you know

689
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,200
our company's electronics are pottery

690
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,280
or calcium?

691
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,840
Uncle,

692
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,120
Would you like something to drink?

693
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,320
I have juice here.

694
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,440
He has diabetes. Mineral water.

695
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,000
I don't want it.

696
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,360
Okay.

697
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,760
I just want to know

698
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,040
what you've been busy with lately.

699
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,960
You won't understand.

700
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,640
Our company

701
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,960
is doing very well.

702
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,280
Prince Charming.

703
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,200
Brother Zhao plans to collaborate with

704
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,440
with a big company in China to promote new products.

705
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:45,880
Dad.

706
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,880
Is this your doghouse?

707
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,600
You don't know

708
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,880
how to write privacy?

709
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,800
I've seen you barefoot since childhood.

710
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:02,960
Why not?

711
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,880
You draw this every day.

712
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,480
It looks nice.

713
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,040
You always stay up late.

714
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,960
What time was it last night?

715
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,840
Four thirty.

716
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,719
Just like when you were young.

717
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,480
I couldn't do homework and threw it all over the place.

718
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,320
The designer is looking for inspiration.

719
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,719
is different from doing homework.

720
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:36,880
You don't have a kitchen here.

721
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,159
How can you eat?

722
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,320
Do you always order takeout?

723
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:41,840
No, no, no.

724
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,360
Yike often cooks.

725
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,800
It's very delicious.

726
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,920
That's more like it.

727
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,679
But your environment

728
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,280
is not for human beings.

729
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,679
The light is so dark.

730
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,040
You keep pouting here

731
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,080
You draw and write.

732
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,120
What should I do

733
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,880
My eyes are nearsighted.

734
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,760
I think

735
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,760
you should move back to your apartment.

736
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,960
so that I don't have to

737
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,840
to clean for you every day.

738
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,800
Yes.

739
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,600
I've applied

740
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,520
to stay here and watch the shop.

741
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,960
It's totally fine, right?

742
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,240
After I finish my work,

743
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,280
I'll go back.

744
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,000
Okay, I'm leaving.

745
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,840
Is there anything else you want to do?

746
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,600
Can't I come if there's nothing else?

747
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,800
Can you stop being so grumpy?

748
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,320
What do you mean?

749
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,200
Last night,

750
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,520
you were racing on the street.

751
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,080
I almost hit you.

752
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,160
I didn't hit you.

753
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,880
Even if I'm short-tempered,

754
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,440
That's why you...

755
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
Then tell me why.

756
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,280
You're over 30 years old.

757
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,360
You're still so unreliable.

758
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,120
I bumped into you.

759
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,160
What if someone else?

760
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,360
What if something happens to you?

761
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,560
Even if you like racing,

762
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,840
it's better than a motorcycle.

763
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,120
That's called meat-wrapped iron.

764
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,240
I'll be careful in the future.

765
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,360
Be careful.

766
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,440
How many times have I been here?

767
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,040
Your girlfriend knows it.

768
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,960
Have you noticed it?

769
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:11,920
Sure.

770
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,920
I think Ding is more reliable than you.

771
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,600
He even defends you.

772
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,480
What?

773
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,000
I've never bought anything here.

774
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,040
I've never seen your design.

775
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,840
I have no right to lecture you.

776
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,360
Did her parents

777
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,360
from the army?

778
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,440
Such a big mouth.

779
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,240
Like a machine gun.

780
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,000
Come home for dinner this weekend.

781
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:09,400
Summer. Summer.

782
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:13,560
Work, work.

783
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,280
Short.

784
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,000
It's hot

785
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,560
Hungry

786
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,600
Slowly, slowly.

787
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,680
Fish.

788
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,560
It's hard.

789
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,320
Carry on.

790
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,920
I didn't rest well last night.

791
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,760
Let me borrow this place for a rest.

792
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,720
You have guests so early.

793
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,520
similar design.

794
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,480
Actually my English results

795
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,640
in English.

796
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,600
I've been mute English since I was a kid.

797
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,920
I heard that

798
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,480
only the last two are OK.

799
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,720
Now I really need to use them

800
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,320
I can't even open my mouth.

801
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,840
Something similar

802
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,720
It's not Semiller

803
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:26,840
Similar

804
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,920
Yes, similar.

805
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,480
Similar.

806
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,560
Similar.

807
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,240
Thank you.

808
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,840
for telling me.

809
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,080
Yes.

810
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,600
Why?

811
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,640
It's been a long time since I moved colors.

812
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,040
So I couldn't find any inspiration yesterday.

813
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,040
But suddenly

814
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:45,040
I saw you reciting English.

815
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,440
I had a dream.

816
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,360
and inspired me.

817
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,680
Maybe God is helping me.

818
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,760
Pen and paper. Here.

819
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,720
Thank you, my muse.

820
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,280
I told you not to play electricity.

821
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,240
Foul again.

822
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,640
Okay.

823
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,520
It's my fault this time.

824
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,840
I'll treat you to ice cream this afternoon.

825
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,280
No.

826
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,560
I can't wear

827
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,640
size S.

828
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,960
Then low fat without sugar.

829
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,200
Cold ice cream with sugar.

830
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,360
Actually, I think

831
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,120
you look good in anything.

832
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:07,880
Really?

833
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,400
If the shepherd man

834
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,320
on the grassland,

835
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,280
He must have picked it up and left.

836
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,080
and hide it with him.

837
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,080
and never let go.

838
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:25,720
But...

839
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,640
What if the Stone is as big as the mountain?

840
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,120
He can only sit down

841
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,960
and stay there quietly.

842
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,120
Although I can't have it,

843
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,840
But looking at it like this

844
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,600
I'm already very happy.

845
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,320
These are just general directions.

846
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,840
He wants you to feel

847
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,400
if his style

848
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,480
match our May?

849
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,800
In his own series,

850
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,120
his style is more touching.

851
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,800
But for May,

852
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,480
the name Zhao Moyuan

853
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,760
is already a famous brand.

854
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,120
But I'm curious.

855
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,400
He used to be dark.

856
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,560
but now he dares to try the color.

857
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,160
And his level surprises me.

858
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,040
Do you know him?

859
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,000
The style of a famous designer

860
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,280
It's like a sticky pattern.

861
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,040
It's hard to change once it's fixed.

862
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,640
But he's willing to cooperate with us in May.

863
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,280
to try a new design style

864
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,920
in such a short time.

865
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,760
Style means personality.

866
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,240
Ding Yike.

867
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,600
As his girlfriend,

868
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,480
Do you really know him?
