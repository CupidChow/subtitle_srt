1
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,039
You have to be careful.

2
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,759
The domineering president

3
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,920
must have a crush on you.

4
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,280
Who are you texting?

5
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,040
Cocoa.

6
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,920
It’s me, Zhao Moyuan.

7
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,040
Listen, be careful.

8
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,760
Don't make fun of this.

9
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,360
Tell me where you're going later.

10
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,400
Be careful.

11
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,760
Don't drink or drink anything.

12
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,920
Share your location with me anytime.

13
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,040
What do you think?

14
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,760
We can

15
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,000
go to Binjiang Store now.

16
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,560
Sure. Please.

17
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,400
Please.

18
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,400
See you, Mr. Du.

19
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,040
Bye, Mr. Du.

20
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,960
She's quite cunning.

21
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,480
But I'm sorry.

22
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,120
I won't help you

23
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,680
expose this.

24
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,560
Why?

25
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,120
What's in it for me to kill her?

26
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,480
I'm not...

27
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,280
I can't stay on my own.

28
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,680
Why offend others?

29
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,760
As for you,

30
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,280
Didn't you

31
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,800
you called me good friends.

32
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,360
Why did you change suddenly?

33
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,360
Don't tell anyone.

34
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,360
Don't worry.

35
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,840
I don't have the time.

36
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,920
I'm not that petty.

37
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,360
Other than poetry,

38
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,400
work, promotion and bonus.

39
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,760
You like Miya-Doo?

40
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,480
That's your business.

41
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,680
But here's a friendly reminder.

42
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,120
don't

43
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,240
on your feet.

44
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,920
After all, even Mr. Du...

45
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,840
You didn't choose the design.

46
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,680
It's divided into the store for trial sales.

47
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,080
Many are out of town.

48
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,120
It's been the whole afternoon.

49
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,760
Why didn't you ask me?

50
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,960
Actually, as long as you ask,

51
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,960
I won't refuse.

52
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,680
No.

53
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,520
Excuse me, sir.

54
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,800
It's six o'clock. I should get off work.

55
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,280
The subway is over there. I'm leaving.

56
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,040
There's a car. I'll give you a ride.

57
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,800
It's okay.

58
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,360
It's okay. I'm leaving.

59
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,080
Ding Yike.

60
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,520
What's wrong?

61
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,480
Are you afraid of me?

62
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,640
It's only natural

63
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,120
to care about employees.

64
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,240
Don't get me wrong.

65
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,240
I don't mean anything else.

66
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,840
I didn't misunderstand.

67
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,280
I'm just afraid that you'll be in trouble.

68
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,120
Sure.

69
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,840
Si Xian.

70
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,960
Are you okay?

71
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,840
I’m fine. I’m patrolling the shop with my boss.

72
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,280
Hello, Miss Jiang.

73
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,400
Hello, Ms Ding.

74
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,080
What a coincidence. I'm patrolling the shop too.

75
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,520
Si Xian is here to pick me up.

76
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,360
Miss Jiang, right?

77
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,760
Hello, my surname is Du.

78
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,800
Hello.

79
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,480
You can talk to me often.

80
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,240
This is my name card.

81
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,640
Mr. Du.

82
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,680
I think we met

83
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
we met before.

84
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,360
Really?

85
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,800
That's your fault.

86
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,200
Why didn't you tell me

87
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,360
such an important thing?

88
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,760
I believe

89
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,040
we will meet again.

90
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,360
Excuse me.

91
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,080
Let's go.

92
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,240
I'm helping you.

93
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,480
I'm leaving. Bye.

94
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,920
I'm leaving.

95
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,800
My friend is here to pick me up.

96
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,680
Bye.

97
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
Who is this guy?

98
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,400
I don't know him.

99
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,520
Why don't you check it?

100
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,680
I’ll do it when I’m back.

101
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,920
Mr. Du.

102
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,039
Should we chase him?

103
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,240
No way.

104
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,240
He's a sports car. Can you catch him?

105
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
We have one too.

106
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,440
Okay, let's go.

107
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,160
The little rabbit is protected by the big wolf.

108
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,680
It saved me some trouble.

109
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,040
What?

110
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,240
Ms Ding's love life

111
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,480
is colorful.

112
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,240
Shouldn't you be happy?

113
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,360
No, I was thinking

114
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,800
about changing jobs.

115
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,480
I got distracted.

116
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,920
Sa Hyun, I'm not stupid.

117
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,040
Are you thinking about work

118
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,560
or something else?

119
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,800
I can tell.

120
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,360
Because I'm not stupid,

121
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,120
I won't think too much.

122
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,480
Ms Ding gave up on you

123
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,680
because she has a better choice.

124
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,800
Or did you really

125
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,120
and give up on Ms Ding?

126
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,560
I don't care about that.

127
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,360
What I care about is that you're back

128
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,160
and you're willing to be with me.

129
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,040
and manage our future.

130
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,800
Wenwen, you must believe me.

131
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
I meant what I said that night.

132
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,440
Really?

133
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,360
Of course I trust you.

134
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,680
because I trust you.

135
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,320
So

136
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,120
I will do my best for you.

137
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,320
I don’t care

138
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,360
I don’t need to go.

139
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,680
By the way, Uncle said

140
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,240
to treat us to dinner this weekend.

141
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,240
at their Michelin restaurant.

142
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,720
Wenwen, actually I...

143
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,040
Don't think about it.

144
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,560
Just come with me.

145
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,120
Okay.

146
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,000
Let's go.

147
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,720
Thank you.

148
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,120
What did you say?

149
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,240
I said thank you.

150
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,560
Why are you being so polite to me?

151
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,120
Later,

152
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,360
There are many things I want you to cooperate with me.

153
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,360
What is reality?

154
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,440
It's the light from the cinema.

155
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,560
in the cinema.

156
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,800
When you wake up

157
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,440
from your dream.

158
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,880
But you will

159
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,680
give up your right to dream

160
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,560
give up the right to dream?

161
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,360
As long as I'm sober,

162
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,560
when you're sober.

163
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,680
As for dreaming,

164
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,040
You're a fool if you don't take advantage of me.

165
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,240
Now I'll announce the statistics

166
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
of the sales rate.

167
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,920
Xu Wenxi, Binjiang Store,

168
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,680
48.6%.

169
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,440
Shen Bi, Shopping Store.

170
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,040
24.1 percent.

171
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,800
Yang Tian, Huaihai Shop,

172
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,360
58.7 percent.

173
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,160
Great!

174
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,120
Zhou Tianna, New Oriental Store.

175
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,000
68.2 percent.

176
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,880
Yaochi Art Center.

177
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,560
46.5 percent.

178
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,360
Qiao Zheng, Changle Shop.

179
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,040
31.4 percent.

180
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,880
Zhou Man, New Heaven and Earth Store.

181
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,680
62.4%.

182
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,560
Leo, Xin Guang Store.

183
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,120
84.3 percent.

184
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,360
Why is Leo here?

185
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,160
It's so high!

186
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,120
Go on.

187
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,680
Ding Yike, Rainbow Shop.

188
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,800
72.7 percent.

189
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,560
Great.

190
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,440
72.7.

191
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,320
Alright, stop talking.

192
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,040
The number is right in front of us.

193
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,000
Who should be eliminated?

194
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,480
I won't call the roll.

195
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,040
If you want to transfer,

196
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
contact the HR director of the company.

197
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,360
If you want to leave May,

198
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,040
I'll pay you by N plus 3.

199
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,920
until the end of the month.

200
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,720
No objections, let's dismiss.

201
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,040
I have an objection.

202
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,240
This trial sales is not fair at all.

203
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Why?

204
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,120
Ding Yike, she cheated.

205
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,720
Cheating? No way.

206
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,560
Shen Bi, you have to have evidence.

207
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,480
Of course I have evidence.

208
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,920
Ding Yike and someone

209
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,880
with someone

210
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,480
is 70 percent.

211
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,920
On top of that,

212
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,360
in her most familiar rainbow shop.

213
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,600
If no one helps her,

214
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,120
What a coincidence.

215
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,000
If you don't believe me,

216
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,040
get all the purchase orders

217
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,920
all the purchase orders.

218
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,320
Then everyone will know.

219
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,120
Yes.

220
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,360
Pull it out. Pull it out.

221
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,800
I didn't cheat.

222
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,120
No one helped me.

223
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,560
I chose them myself.

224
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,560
Alright, stop arguing.

225
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,040
Shen Bi,

226
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,720
I can understand that you're eliminated.

227
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,920
But you can't blame anyone.

228
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,920
I'm the one who picked all the trial stores.

229
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,040
A sample?

230
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,800
Don't make assumptions.

231
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,680
Show us

232
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,120
of our purchase order.

233
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,360
Are you sure?

234
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,120
See? Am I right?

235
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,920
It's true. It's exactly the same.

236
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
Ding Yike, explain it.

237
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
Did you copy my purchase order

238
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,360
or did I leak the question for you?

239
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,120
No.

240
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,480
Yes, Director Lei and I

241
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,440
are very similar.

242
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
But please take a closer look.

243
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,360
The depth of our design

244
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,920
is totally different.

245
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,240
I chose from XS

246
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,720
from XS to L.

247
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,160
And Director Lei is all size M.

248
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,440
Peter, check out

249
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,480
our sales data.

250
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,480
That’s right.

251
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,240
Mr. Du, please take a look.

252
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,040
Not to mention different cargo numbers,

253
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,480
the same number.

254
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,480
My sales data at Rainbow Shop

255
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,360
and the sales data

256
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,800
the sales data

257
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,360
in Xinguang.

258
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,480
Yeah, it's different.

259
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,240
Everyone is

260
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,040
with data every day.

261
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,120
It's obvious whether I cheated or not.

262
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,600
I won't say anything else.

263
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
Anyway,

264
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,920
"A clean person has a clear conscience. A muddle has its own self."

265
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,320
Now that I think about it,

266
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,880
she was wronged.

267
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,360
Did you see it clearly?

268
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,000
I don't know why some people

269
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,040
lack the basic quality of buyers.

270
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,000
When is the sales result?

271
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,920
depends on the purchase style.

272
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,560
The goods I gave you before

273
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,120
are the same.

274
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,920
According to your logic,

275
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,040
the sales

276
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,560
should be the same?

277
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,120
Alright.

278
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,480
Everything is clear now.

279
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,360
But there's one more thing

280
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,680
we need to figure out.

281
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Shen Bi.

282
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,000
These documents

283
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,040
are confidential information.

284
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,040
How did you know?

285
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,560
I...

286
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,680
How did she know?

287
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,440
This is confidential. She knows.

288
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,480
This is funny.

289
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,000
We are buyers.

290
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,040
Great!

291
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,560
Sure.

292
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,800
What happened to Shen Bi?

293
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,360
She didn’t say anything.

294
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,440
Mr. Du asked her

295
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,320
to pay her salary.

296
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,800
Shen Bi is really amazing.

297
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't know where

298
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,240
from somewhere.

299
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,320
Yes.

300
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,040
But you're awesome.

301
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,360
Not only did you pass another round,

302
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,800
but also the first.

303
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,920
Tell me.

304
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,680
How did you

305
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,560
with the boss?

306
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,560
Are they really in sync?

307
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It makes sense.

308
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,600
What are you talking about?

309
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,120
She's not.

310
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,680
If not everyone thinks

311
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,360
there's something between you and Boss,

312
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,000
Why is Shen Bi so angry?

313
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,120
Tell me, is there something?

314
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,800
There must be something, right? Tell us the truth.

315
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,680
We all saw it, right?

316
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,160
Yes.

317
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,480
When I did this to you,

318
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,360
we all saw it, okay?

319
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,560
There must be.

320
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,240
You've read too many novels.

321
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,720
I have a boyfriend.

322
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,560
You have a boyfriend?

323
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,680
I do.

324
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,720
Have you heard about it from her?

325
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,560
No, I didn't know.

326
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,120
you have a boyfriend.

327
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,880
Yes, that's impossible.

328
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,120
When did you have a boyfriend?

329
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,720
You got a boyfriend so soon.

330
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,560
Come on, tell me.

331
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,000
Who is it?

332
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,040
Hurry up.

333
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,800
No, you can ask that.

334
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,120
The receptionist.

335
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,440
One day, he came to the company with me.

336
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,000
The security saw it.

337
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,000
The security has moved out.

338
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What's your name?

339
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,920
How tall and handsome Are you trying to fool us?

340
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,480
How much do you earn? What are you doing? Trying to fool us?

341
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,240
Tell me.

342
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,920
Do you have a photo? Let me see.

343
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,920
What boyfriend?

344
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,320
Hurry up.

345
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,920
Evidence! Evidence! Hurry!

346
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,360
Okay, I'll show you the evidence.

347
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,120
Evidence?

348
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,040
That's it.

349
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,320
Really?

350
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,800
Tina told me herself.

351
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,200
She also said that man is handsome.

352
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,079
Is he handsome?

353
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
That's it.

354
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:14,839
By the way,

355
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,040
You said he came to the company.

356
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,200
Hurry up and check the CCTV.

357
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,560
Is it?

358
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,600
That's it.

359
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,080
I think so.

360
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,600
You're thinner than him.

361
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,360
I'm not interested.

362
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,120
How can you not be interested?

363
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,320
This is the first step

364
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,840
in May.

365
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:48,960
Of course we should have a meal

366
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,040
and celebrate.

367
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,800
I have plans tomorrow night.

368
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,920
Who are you meeting?

369
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,080
Ding Yike.

370
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,320
and her designers.

371
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Next Sunday.

372
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,960
I have a lot of time to rest.

373
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,800
I'm too tired. I'm not in the mood.

374
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:09,960
How about this?

375
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,600
we can have a spa first

376
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,840
before we eat.

377
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,200
Hey, Leo.

378
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,800
let me remind you.

379
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Ding Yike

380
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,320
has a boyfriend.

381
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,320
I know.

382
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
Didn't they go together last week?

383
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,600
Huanya Fashion Week?

384
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,440
Do you know

385
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,840
You were in the sample dressing room with her.

386
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,320
What did you see?

387
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,240
I saw everything.

388
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,920
I saw everything.

389
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,120
But

390
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,200
it's bad to happen in the company.

391
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,440
They are fine now.

392
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,800
Why do you have to get involved?

393
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,360
Like today.

394
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,920
If people see it and spread it,

395
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,560
it will ruin your image.

396
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,720
Mr. Du,

397
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,960
Let me tell you a secret.

398
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,920
About our relationship,

399
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,040
about our relationship.

400
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,680
let alone a boyfriend,

401
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,440
no matter how many girlfriends she has,

402
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,440
I don't care.

403
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,720
Please close the door when you go out.

404
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,960
Thank you.

405
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,800
I'm sorry.

406
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,560
I had no choice

407
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,360
because I had no choice.

408
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,200
But you said

409
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,440
you want to get close to our boss

410
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,920
without a trace.

411
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,840
That's right.

412
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,960
So...

413
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,240
it's the safest

414
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,360
in your boyfriend's way.

415
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,600
I don't mind at all.

416
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
We're close.

417
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,320
Miss.

418
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,440
I'm so sad if you don't choose me.

419
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
Go to hell!

420
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,040
Have you confirmed

421
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,840
Are you sure?

422
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Yes.

423
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,960
Go home early after work.

424
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,920
I have an appointment.

425
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,040
You don't have to cook for me today.

426
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,440
Oh.

427
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,600
Sure.

428
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,080
But it's okay.

429
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,320
The lobsters you bought

430
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,560
are quite energetic.

431
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,800
It's okay to put it on the day after tomorrow.

432
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,440
Okay, bye.

433
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,720
How virtuous.

434
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,720
Mr. Du.

435
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,200
Ke Ke.

436
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,720
As a human,

437
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
you must be grateful.

438
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,200
I helped you last time.

439
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,600
Now, it's your turn to help me.

440
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,040
How is it?

441
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,720
Don't worry.

442
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,200
Boss will never be late.

443
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,040
This way.

444
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,040
Let me introduce.

445
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,080
This is my boss, Leo.

446
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,560
This is Qian. Hello.

447
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,840
This is Feifei.

448
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,360
And this one.

449
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,080
You're so cool.

450
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,600
Zhao Moyuan, Coco's boyfriend.

451
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,360
is you.

452
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,600
You took her to the Fashion Week.

453
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,720
She's so young. Where did she graduate from?

454
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,080
The best one in London.

455
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
Zhao Moyuan.

456
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,960
Patrick Cho.

457
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,440
Have you heard of my name?

458
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,200
Of course.

459
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,320
In 2017,

460
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,480
in spring and summer.

461
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,600
I like it very much.

462
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,200
You even followed my design.

463
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,320
Don't be too modest.

464
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,840
Anyone who knows a little about the design industry

465
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,200
how could they not know you?

466
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,840
Besides, your dialysis back then

467
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,120
It's all over the streets.

468
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,600
Just call me Leo.

469
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,120
Your show

470
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,440
was printed 12 layers.

471
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,600
The details are handled very well.

472
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,960
The cost is high, right?

473
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,800
Not bad.

474
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,360
We can't fool them with numbers.

475
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,240
Yes.

476
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,440
Sit down.

477
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,720
Sit down.

478
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Boss, what do you want to drink?

479
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,440
Water will do.

480
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,840
I was thinking.

481
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,800
Who's so good?

482
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,960
He can bring us

483
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,800
to the exhibition hall of Lanrart.

484
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,800
So you met a master.

485
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,440
I often heard our family

486
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,840
the eldest and the eldest are short, right?

487
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,440
I thought you were just following

488
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,320
Young Dress.

489
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,600
I didn't expect you to follow

490
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,720
international fashion circle.

491
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,240
We plan to transform in May.

492
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,120
But it's not enough

493
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,080
is not enough.

494
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,920
This is bad.

495
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,320
I haven't been in Mainland for years.

496
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,560
I wanted to borrow your help

497
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,480
to meet some local

498
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,840
new and independent designers.

499
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,040
Then I met

500
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:26,960
who can't be invited.

501
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,240
I'm flattered.

502
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,960
No, Lei.

503
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,560
You can't only see him.

504
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,200
You have to have him.

505
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,320
We have to.

506
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,960
We have different colors.

507
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,920
Can I play with you later?

508
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,240
Hey.

509
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,080
What are you doing?

510
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,440
Why are you here?

511
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:48,480
Come out.

512
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,800
What are you doing here

513
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,080
Eat.

514
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,320
Really?

515
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,680
Or else, you think I'm following you?

516
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,680
I went to the bank to do business.

517
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,360
It's time for dinner.

518
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,560
Look. Search the surroundings.

519
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,360
Look.

520
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,480
I came here.

521
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,120
What bank? On weekends?

522
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,200
My personal finance.

523
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,920
What about you?

524
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,960
Why are you so careless?

525
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,840
He was obviously eating your tofu.

526
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,680
It's none of your business.

527
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,480
Of course.

528
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,600
Of course it's my business.

529
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,080
Now

530
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,320
Everyone is taking photos with their phones.

531
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,960
What if they post it online?

532
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,840
Don't let those with ulterior motives see it.

533
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,840
It will affect the company's reputation.

534
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,720
and the company's stock price.

535
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,680
That's not good.

536
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,080
He is your boss.

537
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,680
I finally know why

538
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,240
your company wants to steal me.

539
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,840
If I were Leo,

540
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,040
I would have

541
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,360
at the first moment.

542
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,480
He has low EQ.

543
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,840
A little tiger.

544
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,600
By the way,

545
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,080
do you still want to

546
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:51,960
about you?

547
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,440
I'm old. Of course.

548
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,200
I've been looking for this baby for so long.

549
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,320
finally appeared.

550
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,840
Why are you still going to court?

551
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,800
Miss,

552
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,840
Actually, you acted very well just now.

553
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,120
I think you two are very close.

554
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,320
Very good.

555
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,840
Of course.

556
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,840
I'm a top student

557
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,720
of Chinese Drama Queen Academy.

558
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,120
He graduated from the central school. Awesome.

559
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,080
Let me toast my girlfriend.

560
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,600
Here.

561
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,920
Just now...

562
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,120
Good acting.

563
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,440
We’re friends. Don’t be so polite.

564
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,680
Be polite to Mr. Du later.

565
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,200
Don’t offend my boss.

566
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,200
I know. Of course.

567
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,480
I think

568
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,800
she didn't recognize you.

569
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,560
Yes.

570
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,080
How could she recognize me?

571
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,960
But when I look at her,

572
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,200
I'm happy

573
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,040
I'm already very happy.

574
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:57,680
Let me tell you.

575
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,840
I have something important to discuss tonight.

576
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,040
Don't make trouble here.

577
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,040
Sit here.

578
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,560
Sit here and stay here.

579
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,440
Waiter, order please.

580
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,200
Okay.

581
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,560
Don't move.

582
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,080
Give me a glass of water.

583
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,600
Have a seat.

584
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:24,680
Thank you.

585
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,600
My pleasure.

586
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,800
How was it?

587
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,320
I'm fine.

588
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,720
It's just a small matter in the company.

589
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,920
Why is the water spilling?

590
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,600
Take your stuff and come with me.

591
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,600
Come on.

592
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,960
Actually in the design site,

593
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,480
there is always an old way in May.

594
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,080
Mr. Du.

595
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,840
Sorry.

596
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,600
It's dirty over there.

597
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,480
Can I share the table with you?

598
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,360
It's okay.

599
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,320
Waiter, bring me a chair.

600
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,040
Okay.

601
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,800
I'm sorry. I got hurt by mistake.

602
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,560
I'll treat you to dinner next time.

603
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,600
Nice to meet you.

604
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,360
Nice to meet you.

605
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,440
Does your hand still hurt?

606
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,960
You said you like my printing series.

607
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,840
then other series

608
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,320
aren't to your liking?

609
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,080
Of course not.

610
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,960
Actually, I admire

611
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,960
many series.

612
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,320
I think you are

613
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,560
of the fabric

614
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,200
are very unique.

615
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,440
So like now,

616
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,720
a neutral joke

617
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,800
It's more exquisite when it comes to you.

618
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,120
Is your big cushion

619
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,440
because of St. Roland?

620
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,200
No, Armani.

621
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,440
Americans.

622
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,080
It can't be helped. I'm a merchant.

623
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,320
For money.

624
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,320
For the market.

625
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,960
What's their code?

626
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,960
Among Zhao Moyuan's Couture Dress,

627
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,200
is

628
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,360
Kwon Ryoc's set.

629
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,600
It's a power suit.

630
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,960
Its characteristics

631
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,200
is using a big cushion.

632
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,720
In the 80s,

633
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,960
in the 80s,

634
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,320
in the 80s.

635
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,120
It's just

636
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,920
the wide and narrow size of a big shoulder.

637
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,080
Zhao Moyuan is famous

638
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,800
in New York Fashion Week.

639
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,440
The business in New York is very good.

640
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,800
But it's not as high as French brands.

641
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,120
Not bad now.

642
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,200
Your boyfriend does couture.

643
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,600
What a pity.

644
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,040
Unfortunately, our route in May

645
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,720
and your design

646
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,320
with your design.

647
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,200
It's okay.

648
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,600
I have many designers.

649
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,440
Their style

650
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,840
suits you well.

651
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,680
How about this? In a few days,

652
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,360
I'll ask Yi Ke

653
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,680
to you, okay?

654
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,680
Sure, maybe

655
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,600
we can work together someday.

656
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,560
We will.

657
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,320
I'm the CEO of May.

658
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,680
Go on.

659
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,600
Actually, this year

660
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,840
change my style this year.

661
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,440
I don't want to take the couture route anymore.

662
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,560
So now I’m working with

663
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,680
with

664
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,040
and cross-border cooperation.

665
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,480
Will you publish the garment-making series this year?

666
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,960
Yes.

667
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,240
But for now,

668
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,120
we don't have much money.

669
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,080
The scale of the team is small.

670
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,200
It's hard to meet the size of the ready-made clothes.

671
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,120
There are also Italy in Japan.

672
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,200
many famous brands

673
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,080
invited me to be the CNF.

674
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,720
But these years, I hope to stay in China

675
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,840
to spend more time with my father.

676
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,720
Will you consider

677
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,040
domestic garment brands?

678
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,960
domestic garment brands.

679
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,040
To be honest,

680
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:28,600
First,

681
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,200
I'm afraid my design will ruin them.

682
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:30,600
Second,

683
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,200
I'm afraid they'll ruin my design.

684
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,320
But with you, Leo,

685
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,240
I don't have these doubts.

686
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,080
Even if we do it together,

687
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,320
Do it together.

688
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:39,960
Anything is fine.

689
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,360
It's easy for me

690
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,840
take polite words seriously.

691
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
In front of the goddess,

692
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,960
you should be more honest, right?

693
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,960
Order.

694
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,240
Well,

695
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,480
Thank you for tonight.

696
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,080
You're welcome.

697
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,960
It should be us.

698
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,480
to thank you.

699
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,960
I'll buy you whatever you want next time.

700
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,440
Sure, anything is fine.

701
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,680
I have to go.

702
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,960
How can everyone go back?

703
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,080
Moyuan, how about

704
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,360
see her off?

705
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,440
No, no, no.

706
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:19,960
I'll see you off.

707
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
It's on my way.

708
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,360
I live in the east and you live in the west.

709
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,320
Why is it on the way?

710
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:24,920
Don't bother.

711
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,320
I'll just call a taxi.

712
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:26,920
No need.

713
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,080
Qian, come and see me off.

714
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,600
My car

715
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,680
in my car.

716
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,320
Okay.

717
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,720
Your Indian.

718
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,560
Yes.

719
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:43,680
Yes.

720
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,080
Ding Yike. Ding Yike.

721
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,120
I didn't expect you to like it too.

722
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,840
Wait, let me tell you something.

723
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,800
Try it if you're interested.

724
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,680
Keep an eye on your boyfriend.

725
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,080
No matter what he said to Leo,

726
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,840
you have to tell me.

727
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,320
I'll try my best.

728
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,720
What do you mean? I have to do it.

729
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,440
Have you forgotten the company slogan?

730
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,120
Never give up.

731
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,200
And be positive.

732
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,560
You must do it, otherwise...

733
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
Or what?

734
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,680
Mr. Du,

735
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:13,240
I think you're the one who wants to be positive with Director Lei.

736
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,560
You're confusing personal and threatening me.

737
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,440
Aren't you afraid that my boss and I will slander you?

738
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,600
I'm sorry.

739
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,720
Coco, I was wrong.

740
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,800
Please forgive me.

741
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,360
As long as you help me this time,

742
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,440
I can get a promotion and a raise.

743
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,200
Sure.

744
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,440
The exhaust is stable and the sound waves are strong.

745
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,040
Nice car.

746
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,680
It's just parked there.

747
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,960
How do you know if it's good or bad?

748
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,240
Tonight at 8:30,

749
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,840
we have a party

750
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,080
have a party at the port.

751
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,080
I'll lend you my car. Are you coming or not?

752
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,440
Are you scared?

753
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,240
You're provoking me.

754
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,440
Remember what I said.

755
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,360
Hurry up.

756
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,120
Get in.

757
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:30,440
No.

758
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,680
Where's my car?

759
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,080
Hurry up. Go from the left.

760
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,560
I'm adding it.

761
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,120
Hurry up. She's turning.

762
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:07,960
I'm watching.

763
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,800
Be careful.

764
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:10,320
Don't speed up.

765
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,480
I know.

766
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,680
Red light.

767
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,960
Why don't you drive it?

768
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,200
Okay.

769
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,120
What's wrong?

770
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,560
I think I got carsick.

771
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,080
What?

772
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,800
Hang in there. It hurts.

773
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,120
It hurts.

774
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,320
Hang in there.

775
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,800
Are you feeling better?

776
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,960
Yes. Let me go.

777
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,040
No.

778
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,320
Let me go.

779
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,240
No.

780
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,120
Let me go.

781
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,080
Your hands are made of steel.

782
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,080
You're so strong.

783
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,080
I'm sorry.

784
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,600
Just apologize.

785
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,480
You have to buy me and Feifei ice cream.

786
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,720
Moyuan, I want some too.

787
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,120
No problem, ice cream.

788
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,200
Haagen Das, Singer Van.

789
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,480
Make your choice, OK?

790
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,200
Prince Charming.

791
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,920
You knew

792
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,320
Goddess likes motorcycles?

793
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,320
Of course.

794
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,240
When she was in England,

795
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,040
when she was in England.

796
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,320
Our boss used to be St. Martin.

797
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,840
Of course.

798
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,960
I've never heard her mention it.

799
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,040
She didn't write the company's resume either.

800
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,240
Maybe

801
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,040
she doesn't want to talk about the past.

802
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,560
I envy you.

803
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,800
Then you should know

804
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,719
what Leo was like before.

805
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,639
She was so cool on a motorcycle.

806
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,440
She used to be cool.

807
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,920
She used to be like a little sun.

808
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,199
She was shining wherever she went.

809
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,040
There are only two emotions

810
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,920
have two emotions.

811
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,159
One, envy.

812
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,880
Two, jealous.

813
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,120
Who is she?

814
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,200
I see.

815
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,880
No wonder she is so young

816
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,120
at such a young age.

817
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,040
What? Do you feel inferior?

818
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,440
A little.

819
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,640
It's not necessary at all.

820
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,400
I dare say

821
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,360
you're no worse than her back then.

822
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,600
Don't comfort me.

823
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,640
I'm not comforting you.

824
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:33,920
Look at me.

825
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,160
I admit

826
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,040
I did think

827
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,200
you lack talent.

828
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,960
But you've improved a lot these days.

829
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,960
And I heard

830
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,080
Saint Roland?

831
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,840
Including what Armani said.

832
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,400
Very good.

833
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,600
Although you haven't received

834
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,600
professional system and fashion education,

835
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,600
But I dare say

836
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,040
you can learn fashion

837
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,120
majored in fashion class

838
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,240
in fashion class.

839
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,840
Really?

840
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,080
Of course.

841
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,880
Miss, who is my prince charming?

842
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,640
My prince charming is an international celebrity.

843
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,560
Whatever he says, it must be something.

844
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,400
You are really

845
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,440
very good now.

846
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,720
I saw the one you chose that day.

847
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,360
You have a great taste.

848
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,240
I admit that I was short-sighted.

849
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,800
I always judge others

850
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,920
to judge others.

851
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,600
And you're in Huan Ya.

852
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,800
You're right.

853
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,080
Fashion is a industry.

854
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:30,600
So everyone

855
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,120
has their own position

856
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,600
and strengths.

857
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,240
Fashion is not only art,

858
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,880
but also business.

859
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
So you're always right.

860
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,240
Please believe in your ability.

861
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,880
At the same time,

862
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,320
trust my judgment on you, okay?

863
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,160
Someone is so touched that I'm about to cry.

864
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,160
Tears.

865
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:00,880
Tears are love.

866
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,160
Who's going to cry? Who's going to cry?

867
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,160
Stop it.

868
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,360
Don't hit me. I'm driving.

869
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,840
Do you know what it feels like to melt your heart?

870
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Now is the time.

871
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,680
When you feel lonely

872
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,320
and useless,

873
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,120
someone suddenly

874
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,400
praised and admired you sincerely.

875
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,200
So,

876
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,720
you felt like you had power all over your body.

877
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,600
So,

878
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,400
you feel the world

879
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,440
all of a sudden.

880
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,440
The people and things

881
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,400
are no longer important.

882
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,080
Because

883
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,120
you are really

884
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,400
really happy.

885
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,120
Patrick.

886
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,680
My darling, you're willing to lend it to me.

887
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,800
Cut the crap. Give me the car.

888
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,160
Are you ready?

889
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,880
Anytime.

890
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,400
Okay.

891
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,320
Did I hear it right?

892
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,480
You have a competition today?

893
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,080
Yes.

894
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,960
Oh, right. Buy something for me.

895
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,160
Okay.

896
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,480
Three.

897
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,160
Two.

898
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,640
One.

899
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,400
Go! Go! Go!

900
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,040
How is Prince Charming?

901
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,040
Cool!

902
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,960
Leo is fast too.

903
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,720
Come on.

904
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,480
Mr. Du.

905
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
Where are they?

906
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,400
They're gone.

907
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,480
It's over.

908
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,440
Good luck.

909
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,400
She's really good.

910
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:16,880
Yes.

911
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,400
I didn't expect you

912
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,920
ride a motorcycle so well.

913
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,080
Liu, what's going on?

914
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,320
Liu, follow him.

915
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,400
Coming.

916
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,120
Move.

917
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,680
Mr. Du. Mr. Du.

918
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,480
What are you doing?

919
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,640
Calm down.

920
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,840
Am I not?

921
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,400
He's your boyfriend. Aren't you jealous?

922
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,240
No.

923
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,240
Look, when they stand together,

924
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:34,680
It's really eye-catching.

925
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,720
I don't think so.

926
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,160
Handsome man.

927
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,840
I haven't seen you before.

928
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,400
Why don't you have a drink with me?

929
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,160
Do we know each other?

930
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,240
Why would I drink with you?

931
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,600
I don't drink at night either.

932
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,720
I'll come again next week.

933
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,320
No, thanks.

934
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,320
Why?

935
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,920
You're enjoying it.

936
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,320
Because I felt danger.

937
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:58,960
I think

938
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,560
happened too perfectly.

939
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,560
Do you know

940
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,880
to work with an independent designer.

941
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,320
You know my favorite design style.

942
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,560
You also know that I played motorcycle.

943
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,600
I even threw out my own olive branch

944
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,800
to cooperate with May.

945
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:12,920
I think

946
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,320
unexpected surprise

947
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,080
There must be a huge price behind it.

948
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,080
I don't know.

949
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,440
how you fooled Coco.

950
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,600
But I’m sure

951
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,440
your purpose of approaching me is not simple.

952
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,920
So besides work,

953
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,400
I don't want anything to do with you.

954
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,200
I also want to give you a piece of advice.

955
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,560
But she's a good girl.

956
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,720
Please don't play with her.

957
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,080
Why would I play with Coco?

958
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,720
Why don't you ask her

959
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,480
how she tormented me?

960
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,160
Also,

961
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,920
she lives upstairs.

962
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,720
We're in a relationship, boss.

963
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,960
Let me take a photo for you.

964
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,120
We're talking.

965
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,640
Come on, let's go eat ice cream.

966
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,240
I'll keep my promise.

967
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,080
Okay?

968
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,360
Okay, take your time.

969
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,880
Hurry up.

970
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,360
Otherwise, I won't leave you a bite.

971
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,720
Okay. Go.

972
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,400
Come back.

973
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:15,480
What's wrong with you?

974
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:16,640
They are discussing

975
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,680
how to help your family make money.

976
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,880
I’ll go there later.

977
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,920
Ding Yike, Ding Yike,

978
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,680
Why do you have such a big heart?

979
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,560
Is that your boyfriend?

980
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,160
So what?

981
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,320
Leo.

982
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,400
I don't think she's your girlfriend yet.
