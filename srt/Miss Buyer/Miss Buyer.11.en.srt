1
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,080
What's wrong, Mr. Du?

2
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,400
Do you have nothing to do?

3
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,600
Follow me here.

4
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,080
I'm just worried about them.

5
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,120
How would I know

6
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,040
if they can.

7
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,199
It seems that you agree

8
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,240
to buy handmade in May.

9
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,800
I didn't say that.

10
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,360
How about this?

11
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,840
Let's talk about sales.

12
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,240
As long as they are eliminated,

13
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,440
the six left

14
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,880
The average sales rate of seven days

15
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,840
is higher than 50 percent.

16
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,200
I agree to support you.

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,880
Deal.

18
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,800
Wait.

19
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,360
So confident?

20
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,160
They never

21
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,280
let me down.

22
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,360
Then you test them. Who test you?

23
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,720
What do you want?

24
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,240
How about this?

25
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,120
You also choose 200,000 yuan

26
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,200
for trial sales.

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,680
As long as the sales rate is 60 percent,

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,720
I'll give you my full support

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,400
to reach 70 percent.

30
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,440
I'll promote you to vice president.

31
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,480
But if it's less than 50 percent,

32
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,240
you have to listen to me

33
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,160
in sales.

34
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,680
If I reach 80 percent,

35
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,880
if I reach 80 percent?

36
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,080
Then I can only

37
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,480
marry you.

38
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,720
If you say that again,

39
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
I'll sue you for sexual harassment.

40
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,520
I just said

41
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,800
to cooperate with you

42
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,079
to cooperate with you.

43
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,920
Mr. Du.

44
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,079
Calm down, smile.

45
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,079
What do you mean?

46
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,000
What do you mean?

47
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,280
What are you doing here instead of working?

48
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,240
You handed these in.

49
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,920
the purchase plan.

50
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,760
These are

51
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,160
anonymously handled.

52
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,079
Send the goods according to these orders.

53
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,079
Then draw lots and decide to sell the store.

54
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:59,040
We'll count the sales data seven days later.

55
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,280
compared with the original documents I left here.

56
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,760
We'll know your results then.

57
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,440
Absolutely fair. Absolutely simple.

58
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,800
Understand?

59
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,160
Yes.

60
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,800
Get ready. Dismiss.

61
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,320
What should we do?

62
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,840
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,200
I can't help you this time.

64
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,280
It's okay.

65
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,520
I won't lose anyway.

66
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,760
Me too.

67
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,600
Mr. Du.

68
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,800
This is our

69
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,040
of our quarter.

70
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,839
Take a look.

71
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,160
Go to Director Lei

72
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,960
Tell her I need to supervise

73
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,480
and ask her to copy

74
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,960
and send them to me.

75
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:36,960
Okay.

76
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,200
No, Mr. Du.

77
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,320
Are you

78
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,040
you want to buy

79
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,600
by Director Lei.

80
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,680
Am I that kind of person?

81
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,440
I'm monitoring her.

82
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,320
I'm afraid she'll cheat. Go.

83
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,000
Okay.

84
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,560
So what if you don't know the store?

85
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,240
Just remember the style and sample.

86
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,240
Isn't it the same?

87
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,960
Hello, who is this?

88
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,560
It's me.

89
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,360
Sa Hyun, what's the matter?

90
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,600
Nothing.

91
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,720
I just saw your Moments.

92
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,880
When did you go to Huan Ya?

93
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,880
The day before yesterday.

94
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,560
What do you think? Isn't the photo pretty?

95
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,280
It's pretty.

96
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,240
Are you still in Huan Ya?

97
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,320
No, I'm back.

98
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,960
You have to work today.

99
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,840
Who did you go with?

100
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,120
Just a friend.

101
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,600
A male friend.

102
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,400
Sure.

103
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,720
Your mom came to see me last week.

104
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
Jingle bells

105
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,200
Let me ask you a question.

106
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,680
Do you know why

107
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,240
You don't know who called?

108
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,400
Because...

109
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,000
Because you deleted

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,600
my name.

111
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,800
Correct. Correct.

112
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,840
Is there a reward?

113
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes.

114
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,200
Then I'll reward you.

115
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,400
A portion of small biscuits.

116
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,600
and a Blessing Pack, OK?

117
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:23,840
When you go abroad,

118
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,160
when you go abroad.

119
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,800
Sure, no problem.

120
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:30,840
Bye.

121
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:33,960
Bye.

122
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,800
No need.

123
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,840
It's okay.

124
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,000
These clothes are expensive.

125
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,360
Don't be ungrateful

126
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,640
just because I gave it to you.

127
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,919
Don't say things that make people misunderstand.

128
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:33,799
Okay.

129
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,200
I did it for you this time.

130
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,960
for being a model.

131
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,679
Image rights are quite expensive, you know?

132
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,120
Don't worry.

133
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,120
When we are together,

134
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,320
no one

135
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,080
misunderstand us.

136
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,800
What?

137
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,480
Your face is really on the video.

138
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,520
Listen.

139
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,080
The real high-end brands

140
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,280
They don't want to

141
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
to keep the model's face

142
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,080
the model's face.

143
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,840
Why

144
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,560
Because it will affect customers.

145
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,640
pay attention to clothes.

146
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,160
is very high-end like me.

147
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,960
and very similar.

148
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,800
You have such a low face.

149
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,440
How was the selection today?

150
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,360
Not bad.

151
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,800
But we have to wait for half a month

152
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,320
to know the sales data.

153
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,640
I just went around

154
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,680
and analyzed the competitive products.

155
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,480
I'm more and more confident.

156
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,200
Anyway, I did my best.

157
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,320
I won't regret it.

158
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,880
Thank you for taking me to Huan Ya.

159
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,320
It's useless to say these things.

160
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,560
Then braised beef.

161
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,520
Good.

162
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,440
Time to cook.

163
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,800
I hope you can lose weight successfully.

164
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,920
and never bounce back.

165
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,080
Okay, I'll work hard.

166
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,360
Please supervise me.

167
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,200
By the way,

168
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,160
when I was shopping with Linshi,

169
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,920
there was a dress similar to your home.

170
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,280
Do you want to take a look?

171
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,320
This is exactly the same

172
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,440
as my design.

173
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,880
This is too much.

174
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,080
Other than cheap fabric,

175
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,040
and lace.

176
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,320
The rest are the same.

177
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,280
We sell 3,800 yuan.

178
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,040
He sells 580 yuan.

179
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,280
He's stealing our business.

180
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,760
How many stores have this?

181
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,160
At least four or five.

182
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,080
And these are all imitated.

183
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,960
Hey!

184
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,400
Don't go too far.

185
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,240
Why are you so excited?

186
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,640
Did you just find out?

187
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,640
Zhao Moyuan.

188
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,360
How can you do business

189
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,760
How can you do business?

190
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,840
When I was in Huan Ya,

191
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,040
when I was in Huan Ya?

192
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,760
this is just the beginning.

193
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,360
You're relying on me

194
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,840
because of me?

195
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,800
You can do it.

196
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,800
We'll both lose.

197
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,720
Then the whole circle will know

198
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,960
you were kicked out by me.

199
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,280
Shen Jin, you...

200
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:26,960
Now you know

201
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,440
how it feels to be kicked out.

202
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,080
Then why did you

203
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,600
your girlfriend?

204
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,800
and told me

205
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,160
what original is

206
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,480
a designer's soul?

207
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,600
I repeat.

208
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,080
I don't know how. There's no pirated version at all.

209
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,160
Okay, you didn't.

210
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,040
How do you explain that?

211
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,360
You only use black.

212
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
In that season,

213
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,160
you used her new product

214
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,240
of her new product.

215
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,800
You stole your girlfriend.

216
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,080
Disgusting.

217
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
She's been imitating me.

218
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,960
You're blaming me, aren't you?

219
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,600
Zhao Moyuan, don’t worry.

220
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,960
The copyright

221
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,440
is not so easy to be defined.

222
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,800
But you're too bad at business.

223
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,200
You don't know how easy it is

224
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,360
to close a shop.

225
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,480
Just wait. There will be more surprises.

226
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,800
Hey!

227
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,400
Throw it away.

228
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,280
3,000 yuan.

229
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,960
4,000.

230
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,240
Five thousand.

231
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,600
Oh no.

232
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,240
It must be me this time.

233
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,560
that I finally got.

234
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,520
6,000 yuan is gone

235
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,400
Shen Jin

236
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,200
What grudges

237
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,600
between him and Shen Jin?

238
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,760
I don't think so.

239
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,280
It's just a business dispute.

240
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,480
I know the list of superiors.

241
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,160
I know the list.

242
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,440
Even if you torture me,

243
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,200
I will never betray the organization.

244
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,760
But...

245
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,400
you can use

246
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,280
our wisdom.

247
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,520
Just think about it.

248
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,320
Usually men

249
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,680
to such exhaustion.

250
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,760
What could it be?

251
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,440
A woman.

252
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,040
You guessed it yourself.

253
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:30,920
It has nothing to do with me.

254
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,400
What kind of woman is she?

255
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,440
I don't know.

256
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,520
I just heard him talk about it when he was drunk.

257
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,800
I think I have a photo.

258
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,080
Really?

259
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,760
Take a look.

260
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,000
Where is my prince charming?

261
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,880
Every time I change my phone,

262
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,960
the first picture

263
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,440
This is it.

264
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,280
So what should I call her?

265
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,720
Goddess of Prince Charming.

266
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,560
Do you think

267
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,920
her face shape is similar to yours?

268
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,920
I can't see clearly.

269
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,680
It doesn't look like it.

270
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,280
Is this the substitute you mentioned?

271
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,120
What else?

272
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,000
Otherwise,

273
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,960
for no reason.

274
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,240
It's just that

275
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,160
was wrong.

276
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,160
Don't you have feelings for him?

277
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,200
I'll tell you one last time.

278
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:09,840
Who has feelings for him?

279
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,760
Don't talk nonsense.

280
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,320
Xu Fei, come down and pack up.

281
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,440
Go down. Go.

282
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,120
Coming.

283
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,080
Miss,

284
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,960
Your cooking

285
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,240
better than my sister.

286
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,120
Ms Ding.

287
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,960
No.

288
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,040
Your takeout.

289
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,360
There are so many dishes and you still order takeout? Thank you.

290
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,680
I didn't expect them to give us food.

291
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,280
Let's eat.

292
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:48,640
Here.

293
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,080
Put cocktail in the fast food box.

294
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,840
You're so creative.

295
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,400
Have some if you want.

296
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,120
Beef

297
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,880
It tastes better with wine.

298
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,160
I'll go get a cup.

299
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,000
How did you know I like it?

300
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Apple Mastini.

301
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,040
Look.

302
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,920
This pair of unforgettable

303
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,120
titanium alloy dog eyes.

304
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,160
I see it.

305
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,800
Now I see it.

306
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,400
A small party and a hotel lobby.

307
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,360
You ordered all of them?

308
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
Yes.

309
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,480
Mr. Patrick Cho.

310
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,880
Didn't we agree before?

311
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,160
Don't be hard on yourself.

312
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,360
How about a bowl?

313
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,480
Thank you.

314
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,320
Cheers.

315
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,120
Why didn't you wait for me?

316
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,600
It suddenly occurred to me

317
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,120
Tomorrow, put all the imitated clothes

318
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,840
on models tomorrow.

319
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,040
10% more.

320
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,200
What?

321
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,320
Shen Jin wants to lower the price

322
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,480
to lower the price?

323
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,640
Actually customers who are really good at consumption

324
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,720
don't care about the price.

325
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,040
They only care whether it's real or not.

326
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,480
Yes.

327
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,480
Don't you have Weibo?

328
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,880
We can take two photos

329
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
Let the model wear a real version.

330
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,920
and a copycat.

331
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,280
together.

332
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,000
Don't say anything else.

333
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,400
Not bad, miss.

334
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,400
Wait.

335
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,920
Then why do we need a model?

336
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,360
You're the only one who filmed it.

337
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:17,760
Come on.

338
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,200
What are you doing? You're making me a coolie again?

339
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,920
I haven't finished eating.

340
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,240
We can't eat now.

341
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,600
After eating,

342
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,680
your belly will come out.

343
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,440
It affects the effect.

344
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,000
I don't have a belly. It affects the effect.

345
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,520
I don't have a belly.

346
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,120
You have a belly.

347
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,760
Thank you.

348
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,480
The dress you gave me was very beautiful.

349
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,480
I like it very much.

350
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,800
I won't stand on ceremony then.

351
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,240
Okay.

352
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,040
When you come to Shanghai next time,

353
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,040
I'll treat you and your husband to lobsters.

354
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,080
Okay, that's it.

355
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:56,880
Bye.

356
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,040
Come in.

357
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,440
Director Lei.

358
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,400
Please sign here.

359
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,800
Also, the 420 products

360
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
420 pieces of goods

361
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,680
has arrived.

362
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,760
Inform all the clerks to pick up the goods.

363
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,040
The sales will start tomorrow.

364
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,720
Okay.

365
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,880
This is Steven's lace, right?

366
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,160
Today is the first day of sales.

367
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,599
Are you nervous?

368
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,920
Maybe at this time next week,

369
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,640
some can't

370
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,280
eat with us.

371
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,040
Can you stop

372
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,000
a horror movie?

373
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,600
How is it scary?

374
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,600
It's true.

375
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,160
Who are you blaming for your poor performance?

376
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,960
Eat, eat, eat.

377
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,360
Okay, got it.

378
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,080
Thank you, honey. Kiss you.

379
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,240
Who is so flirty?

380
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,960
New boyfriend?

381
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,560
No, just a kid.

382
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,200
I don't believe it.

383
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,040
Let me see.

384
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,400
Give it to me.

385
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,040
Give it to me.

386
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,040
You're so stingy.

387
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,480
It's just a look.

388
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,680
I'm petty?

389
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,400
You sent messages with my phone last time.

390
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,120
I'm traumatized now.

391
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,800
Seriously?

392
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,600
Yes.

393
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,760
I'm doing this for your own good.

394
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,160
You don't have to do this for me.

395
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,840
All right.

396
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,360
Your Highness.

397
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,160
I was wrong.

398
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,440
Alright, I forgive you.

399
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,520
What is it?

400
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,200
What's wrong?

401
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,880
Nothing. Don't gossip.

402
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,560
Let's eat.

403
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,880
Why isn't your boss here yet?

404
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,000
He invited us to dinner, but he didn't come.

405
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,280
He should be here soon.

406
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,040
I'm very strange.

407
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,920
Jiang Jie

408
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,760
keeps pushing her luck.

409
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,200
You can still be friends with her.

410
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,400
Miss, I found that

411
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,320
Is your English name Maria?

412
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,880
You're the Holy Mother.

413
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,280
You don't understand, do you?

414
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,720
Friendship

415
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,760
Even if it fades,

416
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,400
we can't be completely enemies.

417
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,640
Besides,

418
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,280
she helped me a lot before.

419
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,800
Kid.

420
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,000
Sister, I'm serious.

421
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,320
You told me my butt is not big enough.

422
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,280
I find you very interesting.

423
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,600
Hold on. I need to take this.

424
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,320
Why aren't you going home?

425
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,960
Hey, Mom.

426
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,360
I... That's right.

427
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,000
I...

428
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,040
Last week, I was looking after the shop for the boss.

429
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,240
Yes, he...

430
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,040
He's on a business trip.

431
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,600
I'm really busy.

432
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,760
I have no choice.

433
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,440
23 years old.

434
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,840
I haven't found a proper job yet.

435
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,480
Isn't this nonsense?

436
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,360
Mao Ah Bao next door is only one year older than you.

437
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,240
He already bought a house.

438
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,240
My signal

439
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,640
I don't want to live in the hall forever.

440
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,600
Hello?

441
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,800
Hello, Mom.

442
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:45,840
Mom.

443
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,600
Hello, I don't think my signal is...

444
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,680
Hello?

445
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,880
You lied to his family again.

446
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,800
People born in 1995 are so disobedient.

447
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,600
and immature.

448
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,960
Luckily, he's not my son.

449
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,600
Otherwise, I'll kill him.

450
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,480
Luckily he's not my son.

451
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,960
He’s old.

452
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,720
By the way, Shen Jin…

453
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,480
Stop

454
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,200
I don’t want to mention Shen Jin again

455
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,120
OK?

456
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,920
I'm having dinner with you today.

457
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,280
I just want to eat well

458
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,360
And I know what happened

459
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,720
what happened between Shen Jin and me.

460
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,120
You're just a worried person.

461
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,120
Don't flatter yourself.

462
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,520
I'm not worried.

463
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,680
Here.

464
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:26,960
Eat.

465
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,000
Didn't you say

466
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,560
you cut your hand

467
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,840
Did you cut your hand?

468
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,120
Right.

469
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,160
Thank you.

470
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,640
Foul. You can't do this.

471
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,000
Are you hot?

472
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,760
The air conditioner is too small. It's a little hot.

473
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,880
How are you and Jiang Jie?

474
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,040
Nothing, really nothing.

475
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,520
She is

476
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,760
She's jealous when she sees my picture.

477
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,360
Mimi, are you crazy?

478
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,480
Touch your little conscience.

479
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,720
Take a good look.

480
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,240
Look, isn't this beautiful?

481
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,280
Isn't this an international style?

482
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,600
Isn't it beautiful?

483
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,480
Look at this.

484
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,800
It's beautiful

485
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,440
Not bad.

486
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,280
And this.

487
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,840
What?

488
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,640
Who is this?

489
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,960
My boss, Leo.

490
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,520
She's Leo.

491
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:55,520
Didn't you say

492
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,200
she works overtime to ten o'clock every day?

493
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Take me to May right away.

494
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Since young,

495
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,240
I hope the classic plot in the movie

496
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,920
will happen to me one day.

497
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,200
But when this wish

498
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,040
came true,

499
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,120
I realized

500
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,200
I wasn't the female lead.

501
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,200
She's Leo.

502
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,240
Didn't you say

503
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,440
she works overtime to ten o'clock every day?

504
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,600
Take me to May right away.

505
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,600
Where is my prince charming?

506
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,480
Every time I change my phone,

507
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,480
the first picture

508
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,040
This is it.

509
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,040
So what should I call her?

510
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,360
The goddess of Prince Charming.

511
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,760
Do you think her face shape

512
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,640
looks like you?

513
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,440
This one.

514
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,680
When you see her,

515
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,600
don't say anything.

516
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,480
Just tell them

517
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,520
are friends who came to the company together.

518
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,280
Understand?

519
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,320
Okay.

520
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,200
It's okay.

521
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,440
Let me see my clothes.

522
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,120
Give it to me.

523
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,440
No problem.

524
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,080
She's still here.

525
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,600
Come in.

526
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,880
Boss, you're still here.

527
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,400
Soon.

528
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,480
Why are you back?

529
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,960
Did you go to your shop

530
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,520
in your store

531
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,000
I found that I didn't have enough sales.

532
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,120
Did you come to me for the budget?

533
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,760
No.

534
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,360
I forgot something. I came back to pick it up.

535
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,200
Okay, go back early.

536
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,880
It's getting late. Be careful.

537
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,720
What will their past

538
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,920
their past?

539
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,680
No, I think there's something wrong with my age.

540
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,400
But Zhao Moyuan

541
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,240
doesn't look like a poor kid.

542
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,320
Let's go.

543
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm leaving.

544
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,760
Well...

545
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,400
You go first.

546
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,280
Director Lei and I...

547
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,280
Okay, stop talking.

548
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,560
I understand.

549
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,120
Why didn't I think of that before?

550
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,760
You are all in the foreign circle.

551
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,200
You must have known each other long ago, right?

552
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,440
Well...

553
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,080
Why don't you go up

554
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,240
Say hello.

555
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,160
There must be a reason.

556
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:10,640
Right?

557
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,280
You told me

558
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,080
she was unhappy

559
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,360
in your company, right?

560
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,640
She wants to change the company into a handmade.

561
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,560
If she wants a designer, she'll listen to the buyer.

562
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,440
But the higher-ups don't agree.

563
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,920
You idiots.

564
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,520
Who knows design better than her?

565
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,720
Yeah.

566
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,120
Sure. Can you do me a favor?

567
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,760
First,

568
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,040
Can you send me

569
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,880
to me?

570
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,440
Second,

571
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:40,720
Help me quietly

572
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,000
without a trace.

573
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,640
The closer, the better.

574
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,240
Of course, as compensation,

575
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,760
What do you want to learn and do?

576
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,480
What do you want?

577
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,560
I'll tell you everything I know.

578
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,360
Okay?

579
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,800
Okay?

580
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,080
Sure.

581
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,120
But once you meet,

582
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,000
she will recognize you.

583
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,040
Maybe she doesn't remember me anymore.

584
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,200
He could have called me for the first time.

585
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,560
He asked me to help him for the first time.

586
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,320
But it turned out that it was because of another woman.

587
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,040
The other woman

588
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,360
who can turn me into a scum.

589
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,240
It's not just a stuntwoman.

590
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,440
but also amnesia.

591
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,280
What should I do?

592
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,040
My eyes suddenly feel sore.

593
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,760
Admit the reality, Ding Yike.

594
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,880
You just had a fantasy before.

595
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,840
You really think you're the heroine?

596
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:11,760
After breaking up,

597
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,280
the male lead appeared.

598
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,440
Instead of suffering here,

599
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,400
think about

600
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,480
what if the sales won't sell tomorrow?

601
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,240
Before you dream,

602
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
please keep your job, okay?

603
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,520
Okay.

604
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,480
You can try it if you like it.

605
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,880
This new style looks nice.

606
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,400
Why do I feel

607
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,720
the style is different

608
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,920
from your family.

609
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,000
You have good taste. This is limited edition.

610
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,920
Really? Do you have a size M?

611
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,280
Please follow me.

612
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,400
I'll find one for you to try.

613
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:22,960
Okay.

614
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,320
She keeps everything from me.

615
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,000
How can I treat her as a friend?

616
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,600
Yangyang.

617
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,520
What are you looking at?

618
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,760
How can you join this group?

619
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,400
I finally got the owner

620
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,800
to get me in.

621
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,760
Let me tell you.

622
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,760
our designers

623
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:00,800
to work with hands.

624
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,040
This is a big trend.

625
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,120
I need to see

626
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,880
which buyer has a good taste.

627
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,160
If you team up with him,

628
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,360
the bonus will be higher.

629
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,160
Can I have a look?

630
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,400
Okay.

631
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,520
Isn't it strange?

632
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,920
The Rainbow Shop

633
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,480
is the same as

634
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,000
of Xinguang Store.

635
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,120
Is this appropriate?

636
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,800
Stop talking nonsense.

637
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,400
I want to unlock this file.

638
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,200
Hurry up, or I'll get angry.

639
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:58,960
Done.

640
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,320
Come on.

641
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,200
I was right.

642
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,800
Ding Yike...

643
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,520
What's wrong?

644
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,840
She really hooked up with Leo.

645
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,080
Leo not only gave her

646
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,320
a precious dress,

647
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,880
and helped her cheat.

648
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,280
Look.

649
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,920
This is Leo's.

650
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,800
This form is hers.

651
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,560
These two forms

652
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,600
70 percent

653
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,280
are the same.

654
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,480
You have no bottom line.

655
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,920
How dare you do this?

656
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,160
Xiaojie

657
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,240
Calm down.

658
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,480
What are you doing?

659
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,640
It's none of your business.

660
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,600
Why are you angry?

661
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,520
I just can't stand her cheating.

662
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,840
This is not the college entrance exam.

663
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,000
You still want to report it?

664
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,360
Besides, you are her friend.

665
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,840
In order to stay in May,

666
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,920
to stay in May.

667
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,440
She's getting close to Leo.

668
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,840
She just wants to take a detour.

669
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,200
That's normal.

670
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,520
If you go to the company now,

671
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,360
Who are you messing with?

672
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,960
Everyone in the company knows

673
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,040
you two are besties, right?

674
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,960
Even if you succeed,

675
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,240
will your reputation be good?

676
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,240
If we don't succeed, we'll be in trouble.

677
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,160
With Leo around,

678
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,720
can you still stay in May?

679
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,080
So, I can only

680
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,800
I can only try to get used to it.

681
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,920
It's her luck

682
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,040
to meet a noble lady.

683
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,840
Don't stand up for injustice.

684
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,840
But why is she the one

685
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,320
meet a noble lady?

686
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,000
Coco, can I borrow your computer?

687
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,040
Okay.

688
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,240
Isn't this

689
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,800
of the Italian fashion club?

690
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,280
I don't think the company ordered it yet.

691
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,480
How did you get it so soon?

692
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,120
A friend borrowed it.

693
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,840
What kind of friend is so powerful?

694
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,440
1,500 dollars per book.

695
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,360
It's just a fashion report.

696
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,920
Just friends.

697
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,040
Mr. Du, let me report to you.

698
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:18,840
Boss.

699
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,600
Last week I went to the Huanya Fashion Week for a show.

700
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:22,960
How many did you run?

701
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,159
from the exhibition hall.

702
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:25,960
See if you need anything.

703
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,520
I knew it.

704
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,960
your purchase order

705
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,360
doesn't look like a novice.

706
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,480
How did you get the invitation?

707
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,360
I met a few designer friends.

708
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,639
By the way, boss,

709
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,199
Didn't you say

710
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:43,800
to work with

711
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,480
to work with independent designers outside?

712
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,920
Do you have time

713
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,120
to have a meal and get to know each other.

714
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,880
Which exhibition hall

715
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,639
took you to?

716
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,199
Lanrarett, Hiroko Miyazaki.

717
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,080
and memory.

718
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,840
It's great.

719
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,800
Okay.

720
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,320
After the sales,

721
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,920
if you're not eliminated,

722
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,880
I'll treat you to a party.

723
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,680
Okay, let's do it on the weekend.

724
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,560
You're so confident.

725
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,800
Although I can't compete with you now,

726
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,320
but compared to others,

727
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,320
I think I'm not bad.

728
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,760
You're brave.

729
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,320
What's wrong? Did you catch a cold?

730
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,560
Did you take your medicine?

731
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,720
Who can remember to take medicine?

732
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,680
It's so troublesome.

733
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,440
You won't forget if you put this on.

734
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,840
I always forgot to take medicine.

735
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,600
Then I put this gold medal

736
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,920
on my notebook.

737
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,120
you won't forget

738
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,800
health is the foundation of revolution.

739
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,600
Boss.

740
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,480
You must learn to take good care of yourself.

741
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,840
and work hard with us.

742
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,400
You are interesting.

743
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,760
You have cold medicine with you.

744
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,920
I'll get going then.

745
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,560
Wait.

746
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,000
This brooch

747
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,920
is not suitable for this dress.

748
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,440
Mr. Du.

749
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,680
Calm down.

750
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,920
I'll do it myself.

751
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,920
What are you doing?

752
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,080
The report is so bad.

753
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,240
How dare you show it to me?

754
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,600
Take it back and make it again.

755
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,840
Okay, I'll do it again.

756
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,280
What's going on?

757
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,680
Why are you so tired?

758
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,480
Nothing I'm fine

759
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,400
There must be something.

760
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,600
I'm really fine.

761
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,440
Really?

762
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,480
I'll get angry if you don't tell me.

763
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,280
Fine, I’ll tell you.

764
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,880
Mr. Du and I

765
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,280
Director Lei and Ding Yike

766
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,320
in the sample dressing room.

767
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,800
Kiss?

768
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,880
They must be talking about the scarf.

769
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,960
about the fabric.

770
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,360
Jessie.

771
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,840
Drink more water.

772
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,160
Are you satisfied?

773
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,080
She can stay

774
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,680
she will definitely stay.

775
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,480
She will be promoted step by step.

776
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,560
Are you satisfied?

777
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,960
What do you mean?

778
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,920
Let me show you something.

779
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,600
Calm down.

780
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,480
Calm down.

781
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,720
She's here to deal with Vincent.

782
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,440
She's not here to date.

783
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,000
That's right.

784
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,160
Take a deep breath.

785
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,920
Yes.

786
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,320
I'll take it all out.

787
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,440
Yes, she agreed.

788
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,200
That's great. You can do it.

789
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,160
You are my sunshine.

790
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:36,640
How about this?

791
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,360
ask her

792
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,640
what she likes to eat.

793
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,480
French, Spanish,

794
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,400
Shanghai cuisine, Huaiyang cuisine, all are fine.

795
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,800
Okay, I'll ask for you.

796
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,080
Bye.

797
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:58,600
It’s OK.

798
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,480
Mr. Du, what are you doing?

799
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,600
I’m going to the rainbow shop this afternoon.

800
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,880
I heard you're close to the manager there.

801
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,400
Come with me to patrol the shop.

802
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:14,920
Don't worry.

803
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,400
Didn't I ask you to deal with Director Lei?

804
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,000
You look pretty today.

805
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,160
What are you looking at? I'm not talking about you.

806
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,080
Work hard.

807
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,840
That's what I'm talking about.

808
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,160
What's wrong with you?

809
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,960
I'm sorry.

810
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,160
It's okay. Let's go.

811
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,120
I'll do it.

812
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,400
Please.

813
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,840
No, you first.

814
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,040
Thank you.

815
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,120
This and that area.

816
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,960
I came up with them with Mr. Choi.

817
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,720
Very good. Very creative.

818
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,160
Hello, Mr. Du.

819
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,520
Good timing, manager.

820
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,280
Show me

821
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,080
Show me.

822
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,840
Hold on.

823
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,400
Here.

824
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,320
Get back to work.

825
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,440
Okay.

826
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,960
It's okay.

827
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,880
An anonymous salesman is just an act.

828
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,200
If you want,

829
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,920
just go to the stores

830
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,200
you'll know

831
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:53,920
Where is it?

832
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,160
I brought you here

833
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,160
to trust you 100 percent.

834
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,200
Mr. Du, take your time.

835
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,280
I’ll take a look over there.

836
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,760
Okay.

837
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,440
Mr. Du.

838
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,880
Isn’t this too much?

839
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,320
So this is the bottom of the pot you mentioned.

840
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,200
I'm taking a drastic measure.

841
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,560
You want to

842
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,880
find someone to hold down

843
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,560
of Ding Yike's trial sales.

844
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,640
After she was eliminated,

845
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,680
after she gets eliminated?

846
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,440
Am I such a person who can't distinguish personal and personal?

847
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,000
If Leo finds out about this,

848
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,360
she'll get mad.

849
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,840
In my opinion,

850
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,720
they haven't

851
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,680
haven't revealed that window yet.

852
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,640
As long as we are one step ahead

853
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,080
with the general manager,

854
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,960
is better than

855
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,240
than the director.

856
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,000
Yes.
