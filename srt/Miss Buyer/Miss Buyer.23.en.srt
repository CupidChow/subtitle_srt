1
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,920
What? You think I'm petty?

2
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,759
He can frame you?

3
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,360
Why can't I frame him?

4
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,880
Are you angry?

5
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,760
Actually,

6
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,560
had the same thought as you.

7
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,920
Sometimes I wonder

8
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,280
maybe

9
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,480
I'll do something hard with him.

10
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,760
If I beat him up,

11
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,400
he won't have so many tricks.

12
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,840
Exactly.

13
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,280
People like him should be taught violently.

14
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,640
You are too kind.

15
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,920
and give him face.

16
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,000
You're really...

17
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Hey.

18
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
Yes.

19
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,480
You look so pretty today.

20
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,760
Why did you say that?

21
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,640
Are you shy?

22
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,760
No.

23
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,000
Behind you. At 5 o'clock.

24
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,680
It's okay. Be natural.

25
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,920
It's not a good idea

26
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,120
That's inappropriate.

27
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,680
Leo.

28
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,920
What are you doing here today?

29
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,200
We happened to meet

30
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,760
and have afternoon tea here.

31
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,760
and talk about work.

32
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,280
What about you?

33
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,480
We're talking about work too.

34
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,120
Have a seat.

35
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,760
Have a seat.

36
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,640
Is it convenient?

37
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,400
Sure. Come on.

38
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,120
Sure.

39
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,040
Come on.

40
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,120
Thank you, Mr. Du.

41
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,400
Come on, Partrick.

42
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,040
Thank you, boss.

43
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,360
Thank you.

44
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,360
Order something.

45
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,640
Okay.

46
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,480
Let me do it.

47
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,200
The water is too cold.

48
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,200
Can you get me a cup of warm water?

49
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,280
Thank you. Okay.

50
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,640
What do you want to eat?

51
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,519
Give him this.

52
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,360
I want this.

53
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,279
Okay.

54
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,920
Excuse me.

55
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,200
I have to take this call.

56
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,240
Boya has already kicked you out.

57
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,520
I need to go to the toilet too.

58
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,960
I didn't expect

59
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,040
two people who didn't like each other

60
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,360
can still have fun.

61
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,040
Instead of caring about others,

62
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,240
you’d better think about yourself.

63
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,360
Shen Jin

64
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,680
If what you said

65
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,760
like you said,

66
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,120
I don't think

67
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,240
he won't bear it easily.

68
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,280
Actually, I've thought about it before that.

69
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,800
But what can I do?

70
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,040
We can only be careful and do whatever we want.

71
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,280
When Linda came to our company,

72
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,680
Do you know why she was so picky?

73
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,520
Because Zhou Bai’an

74
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,840
gave her enough benefits.

75
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,560
He thought that I was working hard to be in May.

76
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,520
so that one day

77
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,640
to fight against Orange.

78
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,360
So he made the first move.

79
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,760
Unfortunately, I didn't expect this.

80
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,800
Otherwise,

81
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,040
I wouldn't be so passive.

82
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,800
Then tell me,

83
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,960
what should I do first?

84
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,200
Think from another perspective

85
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,680
What would you do if you were Shen Jin?

86
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,960
What are you talking about? You look so serious

87
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,240
We're talking about

88
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,480
the order meeting

89
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,240
in a few days.

90
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,400
Don't worry.

91
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,240
I called my dad.

92
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,120
He saw it too.

93
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,200
He said it was great.

94
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,400
And when I was on a business trip,

95
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,960
in the business trip.

96
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,360
They all like it.

97
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,240
It depends on

98
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,960
it depends on the actual order.

99
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,240
Think of a way

100
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,040
to make some

101
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,080
from other shops.

102
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,640
This is the one I told you last time.

103
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,840
What should I do? It's not enough.

104
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,080
We like these styles.

105
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,520
And this. We want this too.

106
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,200
I think you can give us more.

107
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:32,800
Mr. Du is here.

108
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:33,920
Mr. Du is here.

109
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,040
Mr. Du, Mr. Du is here.

110
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,080
Mr. Du. Mr. Du. Mr. Du.

111
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,840
Listen to me.

112
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,800
It's not up to me to call Director Lei

113
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,760
President Lei

114
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,040
President Lei

115
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,560
Director Lei

116
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,640
We're old clients.

117
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,680
We don't have enough.

118
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,520
More, please help us.

119
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,480
Calm down.

120
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,200
All the supplies

121
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,960
are distributed according to the company's rules.

122
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,680
This rule is dead. People are alive.

123
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,080
Other designs

124
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,640
will appear on the show.

125
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,480
What should we do now?

126
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,920
Can you help me?

127
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,080
I know. I know.

128
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,280
Please calm down.

129
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,080
I'll arrange it as soon as possible.

130
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,080
We're in a hurry to sell it.

131
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,920
Most October magazines

132
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,080
on September 15.

133
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
At that time, our show

134
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,280
was fading.

135
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,200
It can be connected.

136
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,240
From last month,

137
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,480
and last month's theme event

138
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,679
and last month's event.

139
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:37,159
Thank you.

140
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,880
Can you tell us

141
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,240
which designer

142
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,600
next month?

143
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,480
are still in contact.

144
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,440
But this time,

145
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,560
we want to join some foreign style.

146
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,040
From the beginning till now,

147
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,000
from the beginning.

148
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,320
Mr Shen, this foreigner

149
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,920
is Nikolas Ruo.

150
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,360
He's a French designer.

151
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,440
His works in France

152
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,560
in France.

153
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,720
The audience is very low.

154
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,360
So I guess

155
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,920
he can't stay in Paris anymore.

156
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,320
He has been developing in Beijing recently.

157
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,600
He talks with Ding Yike

158
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,240
for more than 40 minutes.

159
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,040
This is the fifth time we met.

160
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,600
So I think

161
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,120
they must be talking about something big.

162
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,240
I looked into it.

163
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,240
I found that

164
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,600
the advertising company

165
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,040
are designing posters for them.

166
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,800
So I got them.

167
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,680
of them.

168
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,800
Please have a look.

169
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,560
If she wants to continue

170
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,040
such low and cheap routes,

171
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
We can only ask these lousy designers

172
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,800
Good luck, Mr Shen.

173
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,160
Bye.

174
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,040
Bye.

175
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,480
Goodbye.

176
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,120
Goodbye.

177
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,880
Bye.

178
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,120
Hello, Mr. Ruo.

179
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
Hello.

180
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,440
Nice to meet you. I’m Shen Jin.

181
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,480
I don’t think we know each other.

182
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,720
I'm also a buyer.

183
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,000
I know. This is my record.

184
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,720
Ms Ding talked to you about

185
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,040
next month's theme payment?

186
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Yes, that's it.

187
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,120
I'm in the competition.

188
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,720
In other conditions,

189
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,040
in other conditions,

190
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,360
15% more than her quotation.

191
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,160
But I'm not interested in that.

192
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,040
Twenty percent.

193
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,560
and a long-term cooperation agreement.

194
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,360
It's interesting now.

195
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,680
But you have to do me a favor.

196
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,560
until the last day of delivery.

197
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,040
I'll tell Ms Ding that we can't deliver the goods.

198
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,160
As for the contract,

199
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,120
you're smarter than me.

200
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,880
Okay, I understand.

201
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,120
Happy cooperation.

202
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,480
Pleasure working with you.

203
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,920
Nikolas Ruo.

204
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,560
He'll send us the information soon.

205
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,440
Prepare the poster and news.

206
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,880
We'll hold a press conference in ten days.

207
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,360
By the way, be careful.

208
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,560
the design and details of the poster.

209
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,320
Okay?

210
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,120
A suite, of course.

211
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,480
All 18 high-class guests in front

212
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,560
must be a suite.

213
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,240
Let's change the champagne to mam.

214
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Don't be too expensive.

215
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,480
Otherwise, it doesn't match our brand image.

216
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
At the later party,

217
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,040
all seafood with shells

218
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,920
don't show up.

219
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,040
There must be a lot of snacks before dinner.

220
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,000
That way we can guarantee

221
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,040
the customers can be elegant when eating.

222
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,480
Mr Shen, the goods are all here.

223
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,440
Okay.

224
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,360
Take care of the delivery.

225
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,680
Remember the number, number, number,

226
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,880
and numbers.

227
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,560
Okay.

228
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,800
By the way,

229
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,360
tomorrow,

230
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,560
I'm going far away.

231
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,360
I want to see it myself.

232
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,800
Ding Yike's face.

233
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,920
It's a shop with no stock.

234
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,040
That's it.

235
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,240
Honey.

236
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,480
I'm sorry.

237
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,800
I didn't listen to you this time.

238
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,000
I won't do it again, okay?

239
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,680
Don't worry.

240
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,560
All Zhao Moyuan’s energy

241
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,600
on the show.

242
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,680
He has no time to take care of this.

243
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,680
So he must

244
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,720
this time.

245
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,360
Mr Shen.

246
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
I'll call you later, Mr Shen.

247
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,480
Something happened, Mr Shen.

248
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,480
Look.

249
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
Send the money

250
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,120
to Nikolas Lasso.

251
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,240
Remove the telephone.

252
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,040
Sorry, it can't be deleted.

253
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,600
But this time,

254
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,800
we want to join some foreign style.

255
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,120
Happy cooperation.

256
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,240
Happy cooperation.

257
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,800
Okay.

258
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,240
Good.

259
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,480
Double-palace silk.

260
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,800
A few days ago,

261
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,160
Ding Yike,

262
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,040
did you mention these three words?

263
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,720
I didn't, Mr Shen.

264
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,680
Look at me.

265
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,440
Say it again.

266
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,040
I...

267
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,800
I didn't mention it, Mr Shen.

268
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,600
Mr Shen, are you looking for me?

269
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,920
Who told you to do this?

270
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,480
Say something.

271
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,240
Say it.

272
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,600
Mr Shen.

273
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,560
Please let me explain.

274
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,560
Explain?

275
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,120
Explain what?

276
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,160
I'm just serving you.

277
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,560
Serve me?

278
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
Let me tell you.

279
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,360
A wrong has a source.

280
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,160
Even if I don’t like Zhao Moyuan,

281
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,560
has anything to do with his girlfriend?

282
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,880
Does it?

283
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,440
No, girlfriend.

284
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,800
I, Shen Jin, am a decent businessman.

285
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,680
a fair business competition.

286
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,480
Don't be ungrateful.

287
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,000
I was wondering

288
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,560
dig a hole for me to jump.

289
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,360
It's good now.

290
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,000
I've become

291
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,680
I've become a person who's in the wrong.

292
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,920
No, Mr Shen, this...

293
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,720
Shut up!

294
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,240
I...

295
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,680
Let me tell you.

296
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,040
I'll settle your score with you.

297
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,680
You...

298
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,120
Right now, right now.

299
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,000
Get lost!

300
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,240
You want me to get lost?

301
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,560
Mr Shen, I'm here to serve you.

302
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,320
Zhao Moyuan worked so hard to investigate.

303
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,680
I did my best.

304
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,800
Fired.

305
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,599
Fired?

306
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,920
Di, can you spare my life?

307
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,960
The company has a position in the circle.

308
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,119
If I get fired,

309
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,600
how can I continue to work in the circle?

310
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,960
No company dares to hire me.

311
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,120
Please help me this time.

312
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,560
I'll resign myself, okay?

313
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,920
Bro, I have no choice.

314
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,840
I can't even protect myself this time.

315
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,120
How about this?

316
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,440
I'll inform the HR.

317
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,720
I'll help you

318
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,840
I'll speak for you.

319
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,600
No.

320
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,360
Di.

321
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,040
Zhao Moyuan.

322
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,080
He has grown up this time.

323
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,800
You're so vengeful.

324
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,200
I'll pay you back ten times.

325
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,600
Thanks to your goddess’s foresight,

326
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,600
Thanks for your guidance.

327
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,680
Luna.

328
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,840
Tell Qian

329
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,120
to return it as soon as possible.

330
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:22,720
No problem.

331
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,080
Be careful.

332
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,200
Okay.

333
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,800
Here.

334
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,720
Haven't we already filmed it?

335
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,480
I need to borrow a movie queen

336
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,120
to shoot their magazine cover next month.

337
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,080
Okay, be careful.

338
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,840
Okay.

339
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,200
Did Mr. Du

340
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,920
Did Mr. Du persuade Boss?

341
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,200
Will we

342
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,480
irritate her?

343
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
I really don't know.

344
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,360
It seems that he wants to

345
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,200
into a conclusive fact.

346
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,320
So all the rehearsals

347
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:52,960
in all rehearsals.

348
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,920
I didn't let her know.

349
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,440
Hello, Di.

350
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,720
Are you busy?

351
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,360
Give me one minute.

352
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,720
Let me tell you something big.

353
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,320
I gave Zhao Moyuan

354
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,040
to Zhao Yuyuan today.

355
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,080
Have the Three Kingdoms seen it?

356
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,320
Burn the red wall, understand?

357
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,200
I'll take care of Lingyun and the media.

358
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,440
I'll leave the guest to you.

359
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,720
I'm counting on you.

360
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,440
Patrick.

361
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,080
Why are you here?

362
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,240
I can’t tell you.

363
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,440
The closing dress.

364
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,480
Something happened on the way back.

365
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,360
What?

366
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,960
A dress.

367
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,720
Is the closing show a dress?

368
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,080
Isn't it a yellow dress?

369
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,960
Where are you going?

370
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,080
It's okay.

371
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,600
We have a plan anyway.

372
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,440
This is fate.

373
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,960
God punished us.

374
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,120
I shouldn't have kept it from you.

375
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,960
to do the finale show with your clothes.

376
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,240
Zhao Moyuan, are you crazy?

377
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,080
Listen.

378
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,200
If you want revenge, come at me.

379
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,560
Don't go after a woman.

380
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,560
You know what?

381
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,080
That was Linlin's last design.

382
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,080
What are you talking about?

383
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,120
Stop pretending. I hate it when you pretend.

384
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,200
I'll beat you if you keep pretending.

385
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,920
Understand?

386
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,200
Look at your tricks.

387
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
You are right.

388
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:14,840
This dress

389
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,040
is more suitable for the closing show.

390
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,600
It's as fantasy and light as a dream.

391
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,800
It will leave a deep impression

392
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
the audience.

393
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:28,840
It's less than six days

394
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,200
Less than six days.

395
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,040
This dress

396
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:33,480
is made

397
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,120
the production time should not exceed

398
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,200
100 hours.

399
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,080
I’ll call Moyuan

400
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,600
and ask him to come back.

401
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,200
No need.

402
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,040
This is my design.

403
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,320
Even Zhao Moyuan

404
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,040
know it better than I do.

405
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,840
So I have to

406
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,320
can only be done by me.

407
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:51,960
Okay.

408
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,480
From now on,

409
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,720
don't worry about anything and leave it to me.

410
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,440
Just focus.

411
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,840
and finish this dress.

412
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,720
I have an announcement.

413
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,840
Director Lei needs to take a break

414
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,120
due to her condition.

415
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,120
I'll take over her job.

416
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:10,960
Also,

417
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,320
Ding Yike will return to Daxiu Project

418
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,200
and be responsible for coordination.

419
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,240
Welcome.

420
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,920
Okay, let's get to work.

421
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,320
Okay, I got it.

422
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,320
Right, you...

423
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,720
Don't worry, Prince Charming.

424
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,600
I'm already here.

425
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,080
Yes.

426
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,440
I'll make sure

427
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,480
as the acting manager these days.

428
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,600
I'll make sure

429
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,040
keep going

430
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,440
to continue, right?

431
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,960
I'm already here.

432
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,720
I'm hanging up.

433
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,360
Bye.

434
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,320
Bye. Bye.

435
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,080
I overestimated myself.

436
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,240
If you cut it wrong, do it again.

437
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,120
I told you.

438
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,320
I, Eric,

439
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:35,960
including the tailor,

440
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,320
no one can help you.

441
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,120
You said

442
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,200
this is your war.

443
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,320
You have to defeat it yourself.

444
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,200
When did I say

445
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
to help me?

446
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,040
Watch out for long clothes.

447
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,600
Don't get it dirty.

448
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,320
The bottom part.

449
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,480
Mr. Du.

450
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,600
It’s far away.

451
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,200
It was shipped out this morning.

452
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,320
These are sent to Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai dealers.

453
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,080
Absolutely.

454
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,440
At 10 a.m. the day after the show,

455
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,840
all shops in the country will be available.

456
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,360
Okay.

457
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,600
She's back.

458
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,320
Where's my article?

459
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:27,960
Here, here.

460
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,320
Okay, thank you.

461
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:29,960
Yes.

462
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,600
Wen Xi.

463
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,600
Wang Yuan.

464
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,120
The flight number three has changed.

465
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,120
By 10 a.m. tomorrow,

466
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,480
and send someone to pick you up.

467
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:38,960
Okay, I got it.

468
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,440
Take this.

469
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:39,960
Thank you.

470
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,200
Then let's check

471
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,840
Let's symmetrize both sides of the pillar.

472
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,480
And the gap between each pillar

473
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,720
60 centimeters, okay?

474
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,800
Wen Xi.

475
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
Sign the media you're in charge.

476
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,720
Right here.

477
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,920
Two hours before the show,

478
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,080
let the media in the backstage.

479
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:29,440
Okay.

480
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,240
And you have to arrange

481
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,480
you have to arrange someone to take care of it.

482
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,240
What about this?

483
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,240
This is in the bag.

484
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,200
Keep it safe

485
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,120
Okay.

486
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:35,600
Hurry up.

487
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,320
Give it to me.

488
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,600
What do you think?

489
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,200
But I feel

490
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,560
something is missing.

491
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,120
No.

492
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,200
I think it's the same one

493
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,200
the one we destroyed last time.

494
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,240
I want to hear from non-designers.

495
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,080
Maybe the problem

496
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,800
is exactly the same.

497
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:26,840
Boss.

498
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,120
You designed this dress ten years ago.

499
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,360
Ten years ago and now,

500
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,480
you must have different mentality.

501
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,560
You were in an elegant way.

502
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,200
But in May, you were supposed to be young.

503
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,040
You said

504
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,920
this time the dress

505
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,560
is like a dream.

506
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,560
light and fantasy.

507
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,360
So should we make it

508
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,200
like...

509
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,320
I know.

510
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,440
I know what's missing.

511
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,200
But I'm not sure

512
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,600
if it's still not too late.

513
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,360
Every show has been revised

514
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,040
to the last second?

515
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,480
the studio is ready for you.

516
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,120
Senior, I apply

517
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:13,960
to be your assistant.

518
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,440
Me too.

519
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,840
Me too. Me too.

520
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,960
Get to work.

521
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,720
Can I join you?

522
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,560
Director Luo.

523
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,320
Welcome.

524
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,120
Feifei, move the chair.

525
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,920
Hey.

526
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,320
It is said that the first lady Amanda

527
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,720
This private schedule

528
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,960
for my friend designer.

529
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,080
for my friend designer.

530
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,600
The latter will compete with

531
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,560
in May

532
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,360
to launch a joint fashion show.

533
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,720
It's not Fashion Week. It's better than Fashion Week.

534
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,040
Count Zhao Mo and May.

535
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,560
How many supermodels are on the show?

536
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,600
Moyuan.

537
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,440
Hang it up.

538
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,800
How is she?

539
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,440
After she gave it to me,

540
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,840
she couldn’t hold on.

541
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,920
Luckily, Mr. Du is here.

542
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,320
Are you tired? Do you want to take a rest?

543
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,320
Come with me.

544
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,480
What?

545
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,840
Why did you bring me here all of a sudden?

546
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,360
I once told you

547
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,240
before the show,

548
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:06,920
before the show,

549
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,080
I couldn't sleep.

550
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,440
I can't sleep. I'm very nervous.

551
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,440
I'm worried that all the guests

552
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,360
with a polite smile on their faces.

553
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,960
I'm worried that a model

554
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,480
would fall on the T-stage.

555
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,120
I was worried

556
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,320
the media and reporters

557
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,720
and reporters

558
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,320
will demote my design

559
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,560
is worthless.

560
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,800
What worries me most is

561
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,920
tomorrow in the exhibition hall,

562
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,080
no buyer

563
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,960
No buyer would buy it.

564
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,800
Now this feeling

565
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,040
come back to me.

566
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,600
So I brought you here.

567
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,920
I told myself

568
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,960
this world doesn't belong to losers.

569
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,320
Because we are world champions.

570
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,240
Boss, why are you out?

571
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,480
I dare not look.

572
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,720
I risked everything

573
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,880
to get what I got today.

574
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,120
I told myself

575
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,880
if this battle

576
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,240
defeat Zhou Bai’an,

577
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,240
I'll jump off the rooftop of May.

578
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,880
Boss, trust yourself.

579
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,800
You won't lose.

580
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,320
How about this?

581
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,680
If you don’t want to go in,

582
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,160
I'll video call Mr. Du.

583
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,880
Look, my editor

584
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,120
She's smiling so happily.

585
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,120
I think she likes the bow-neck skirt.

586
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,400
She's coming out.

587
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,840
Your final design is out.

588
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,640
Look.

589
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,680
You did it.

590
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,600
You did it.

591
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,600
We're...

592
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:42,800
We did it.

593
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,640
We did it.

594
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:38,880
I think this show

595
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,360
really opened my eyes.

596
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:41,840
The last dress

597
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,440
is so impressive.

598
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:45,640
Many fashion media critics

599
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,160
commented online media

600
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,120
that it perfectly combines

601
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,120
and the sense of youth

602
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,320
of youth.

603
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:51,840
Excuse me.

604
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,560
is this the most satisfying work

605
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,160
of all your designs?

606
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,400
It's not my work.

607
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,600
Its real author is

608
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,440
It's made by

609
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,080
in May.

610
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:00,920
Thank you

611
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,640
for your love and support.

612
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,560
Please pay more attention and support.

613
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,560
Zhao Moyuan and May.

614
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,680
Tomorrow at ten o'clock,

615
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,040
online and offline sales tomorrow.

616
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,400
This time in May,

617
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,160
to buy and buy.

618
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,880
Mr. Du.

619
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,240
Why did Director Lei say that?

620
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,040
If she wants to keep this secret,

621
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,360
if she wants to keep this secret.

622
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,160
She belongs to May anyway.

623
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,200
May belongs to her too.

624
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,160
Is it time to celebrate?
