1
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,920
The style of a famous designer.

2
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,200
It's like a sticky pattern.

3
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,200
Once it's fixed, it's hard to change.

4
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,920
But he's willing to cooperate with us in May.

5
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,760
to try a new design style

6
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,400
in such a short time.

7
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,840
Style is personality.

8
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,759
Ding Yike, as his girlfriend,

9
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,560
do you really know him?

10
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,120
Are you caring about me?

11
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,280
I'm concerned about

12
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,920
the stability of working with him.

13
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,400
A few months ago,

14
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,640
I didn't know what it was.

15
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,640
A few days ago,

16
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,400
you never thought about working with him.

17
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,760
So let love be love.

18
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,280
Business is business.

19
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,760
No one knows

20
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,040
no one knows.

21
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,280
Just ignore it.

22
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,120
Just seize the moment.

23
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,040
You've changed a lot.

24
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,560
It's your turn to make me chicken soup.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,120
I passed your test

26
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,400
who survived until now.

27
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,000
Can you not change?

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,120
But today,

29
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,120
is different from before.

30
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,040
I've never seen this style before.

31
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,840
The car has already flown.

32
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,360
So what if I change my style?

33
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,640
That's enough.

34
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,560
Get ready for the meeting.

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:09,920
Yes, sir.

36
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,840
By the way,

37
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,040
you only saw Zhao Yuyuan

38
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,280
in the news.

39
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,640
Why do you know his style so well?

40
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,480
He's been so popular these two years.

41
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,400
You don't know who he is, do you?

42
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,760
But you...

43
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,280
have such a great boyfriend.

44
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,040
Are you sure you want to stay in May?

45
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,120
My boyfriend is like lipstick.

46
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,640
I can only add to it.

47
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,000
To be a real goddess,

48
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,640
you have to rely on your charm, right?

49
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,920
Bye.

50
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,560
That punk.

51
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,560
So it's a sibling relationship.

52
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,760
Good luck, Mr. Zhao.

53
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,280
This road is not easy.

54
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,120
What are you looking at? Go.

55
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,840
Morning, Mr. Du.

56
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,760
Report to boss as soon as you arrive.

57
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,480
Didn't we reserve it?

58
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,280
Why are you working overtime on weekends?

59
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,520
I'm going against the current. I'll retreat if I don't move forward.

60
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,480
Congratulations.

61
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,560
Thank you.

62
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,360
Okay.

63
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,640
Wenwen.

64
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,280
Sixian, are you in the office?

65
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,520
I'm at the office. I'm reading the report.

66
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,960
At 7 p.m. at the Imperial Garden Meeting.

67
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,560
Uncle wants to treat us to dinner.

68
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,680
Are you okay?

69
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,480
Seven o'clock tonight.

70
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,800
But I've made an appointment with my colleagues.

71
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,360
Is your project more important

72
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,040
or your future joining Chenxing Fund?

73
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,640
You know how difficult

74
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,760
how difficult my uncle is.

75
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,200
Wenwen, he's your uncle after all.

76
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,240
How about we find a weekend

77
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,480
and have more time

78
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,520
Would it be better

79
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,560
to visit him at home?

80
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,960
Okay, I'll listen to you.

81
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,240
Sa Hyun.

82
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,520
My favorite

83
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,680
is the two of us.

84
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,240
tacit communication efficiency.

85
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,680
You always know

86
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,200
what the best arrangement is.

87
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,960
Me too.

88
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,080
Do you need me to pick you up?

89
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,800
No, you can come on time.

90
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,520
Bye.

91
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,040
So I think

92
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,960
to work with independent designers.

93
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,360
The first step is to launch a joint design.

94
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,640
I hope you can give your full support.

95
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,960
If you have any opinion,

96
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,040
you can say it now.

97
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,560
Let's discuss it together.

98
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,200
We should ask for backup. Okay.

99
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,640
Thanks to someone,

100
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,400
our design department is so cool.

101
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,960
We dare not oppose

102
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,120
we dare not oppose.

103
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,280
We can't object either.

104
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,360
At most,

105
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,960
waiting for the notice of layoff.

106
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,240
It's just that the designer

107
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,280
is

108
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,400
Kawakubo Reinence.

109
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,960
or Gil Santa?

110
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,480
How good is he?

111
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,240
to cooperate with us in May?

112
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,360
146 kilograms.

113
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,520
The weight of our designer

114
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,960
146 kilograms.

115
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,560
How did Director Lei know

116
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,520
so well?

117
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,640
Because the details about this person

118
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,680
I can see it on various search websites.

119
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,080
The founder of Partrick Cho,

120
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,080
American Fashion Designer Association.

121
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,200
The winner is

122
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,360
I wonder

123
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,080
fall for your eyes.

124
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,280
Besides,

125
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,360
Mr. Du never

126
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,560
to neglect the Design Department.

127
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,680
Usually fast-selling brands and designers

128
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,520
will not exceed ten.

129
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
But every season,

130
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,960
in every season.

131
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,080
If it's ten times the price,

132
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,760
So, Director Luo,

133
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,800
your department will only be more important.

134
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,400
After all, in May,

135
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,480
more designs

136
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,120
similar to designs.

137
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,400
So these hard work

138
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,760
all these hard work.

139
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,960
Any objections?

140
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,080
Any objections?

141
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,480
I agree.

142
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,480
Okay, pass.

143
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,800
What do you think about my performance?

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,800
How many points?

145
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,560
You called me here just to claim credit?

146
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,480
Don’t forget to work with Zhao Moyuan.

147
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,120
I'm also making money for May.

148
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,000
What are you talking about?

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,680
That's ours.

150
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,360
Don't forget

151
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,600
I'm the general manager and you're the director.

152
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,360
If we add together,

153
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,720
is our home.

154
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,920
There's no need to be so ambiguous.

155
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,880
In the end, you not only agreed

156
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,480
to donate one quarter of the season

157
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,920
to Zhao Moyuan and May?

158
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,800
I think

159
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,240
I don’t know

160
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,440
Zhao Yuyuan.

161
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,320
I don't know his style.

162
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,240
So I can't put so much effort into it.

163
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,480
I still insist

164
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,800
last night.

165
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,720
Zhao Moyuan is so easy to work with.

166
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,440
He lacks the arrogance

167
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,360
a famous designer.

168
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,120
Besides, the collaboration went too well.

169
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,360
Why did he agree to

170
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,000
to cooperate with us in May so soon?

171
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,560
for another purpose.

172
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,360
What are you trying to imply?

173
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,120
Zhao Moyuan is Ding Yike's boyfriend.

174
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,360
You told me.

175
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,240
Most men in fashion circle

176
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,440
are unreliable.

177
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,040
Change a boyfriend. Girlfriend.

178
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,240
It's more frequent than changing a phone.

179
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,680
Don't get me wrong.

180
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,880
I'm not in the fashion industry.

181
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,720
I’m a businessman.

182
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,160
Mr. Du, I understand your prudence

183
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,720
and I respect your choice.

184
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,120
But I still want to tell you

185
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,360
business is a game of adults.

186
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,880
Adults only look at results.

187
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,000
Only children find their motive.

188
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,040
If you don't charge the budget, I'll ask the headquarters for it.

189
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,480
Don't go.

190
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,680
He's coming for you.

191
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,360
I don't believe you can't tell.

192
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,120
Don't you know

193
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,240
is also an important part of leadership?

194
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,360
I told you to practice your waist.

195
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,040
No way.

196
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,880
Are we really going to

197
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,560
with Patrick Cho.

198
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,440
I called you here

199
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,040
to get some air for you.

200
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,440
Once Zhao Moyuan and May

201
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,720
and May,

202
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,480
you have to make your own opinions

203
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,720
according to the market analysis

204
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,160
to help the PR department make a promotion strategy.

205
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,920
More importantly,

206
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,480
we need to extract

207
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,000
as soon as possible

208
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,240
with our own design department.

209
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,560
to ensure

210
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,600
a matching design with its style.

211
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,880
Otherwise, we can’t

212
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,000
to update our brand style.

213
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,680
Okay.

214
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,560
When will we launch

215
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,120
will be launched?

216
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,240
Our plan is about autumn.

217
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,560
So let's set the fashion show at the beginning of September.

218
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,920
We have a fashion show.

219
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,560
We can go to the T-station.

220
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:40,800
Surprised?

221
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,160
Yes, we're doing a fashion show this time.

222
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,480
And it's not like that.

223
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
After the press conference,

224
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,000
after the press conference.

225
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,040
for a show.

226
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,600
We're going to make a show

227
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:51,920
Great show.

228
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,240
We will build our own stage

229
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,120
We'll invite heavy guests and supermodels.

230
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,920
Through this show,

231
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,800
to change the image

232
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,040
in May.

233
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,440
to make May

234
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,560
a high-class fashion brand with a sense of design.

235
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,480
But boss,

236
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,040
Is it too late for us to prepare now?

237
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,440
It takes at least a few months

238
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,320
from fashion to retail.

239
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,240
Yes.

240
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,320
So this time,

241
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,560
we're going to take Ralph Lauren's

242
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,880
of Lauren.

243
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,360
Playing and buying.

244
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,040
In other words, there's no difference

245
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,160
are the same.

246
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,560
After the press conference,

247
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,320
customers can place orders

248
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,680
in May.

249
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,120
So in these months,

250
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,480
we have a lot of work to do.

251
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,480
We need to finish the design and set an example.

252
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,680
Marketing, mass production, distribution,

253
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,920
and a show.

254
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,800
But I can participate

255
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,160
such an important project.

256
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,680
no matter how tired we are.

257
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,480
Yes.

258
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,480
Don't be happy too soon.

259
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,240
Before that,

260
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,480
the early autumn will still be updated.

261
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,000
Since you are

262
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,120
of the company,

263
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,800
So the end of summer and early autumn.

264
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,120
replenishment and transportation.

265
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,440
from the original purchase department

266
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,040
from the original purchase department.

267
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,160
I’ll do the division of work now.

268
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,160
Xu Wenxi is in charge of the dressing line.

269
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,600
OK.

270
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,120
Tina is in charge of sewing.

271
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,800
Ding Yike.

272
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,360
You take care of the shirt and T-shirt.

273
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,040
Okay.

274
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,000
Zhou Man is responsible for daily and underwear lines.

275
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,720
Yiu Silk, you take the pants.

276
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,560
Okay.

277
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,880
You have a week.

278
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,560
to contact the people

279
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,320
who were in charge of the section.

280
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,920
The original purchase department

281
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
only the fabric

282
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,600
and accessories.

283
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,040
The sample at the end of summer is here.

284
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,800
The product adjustment work

285
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,120
You can start now.

286
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,240
Whether you order the factory

287
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,360
the factory

288
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,680
It's still the same as the season.

289
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,240
I don't mind

290
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,120
I don't mind.

291
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,920
The budget of 1.5 million each.

292
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,800
Everyone, seize it.

293
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,720
Because each of you

294
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,680
of each of you

295
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,880
Not only the sales rate,

296
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,360
but also the margin rate

297
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,680
and other dimensions.

298
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,320
I have shared

299
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,560
in the office system.

300
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,720
Check carefully.

301
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,240
Boss, I have a question.

302
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,560
Why is Coco's product line

303
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,920
is easier than ours?

304
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,680
Normally, according to the category of the industry,

305
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,720
the top line

306
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,240
the same buyer.

307
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,000
Yes.

308
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,000
She has other work arrangements.

309
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,320
She's in contact with

310
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,360
with Partlick Cho.

311
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,800
She's my assistant.

312
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,880
Why?

313
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,920
Because her last sales rate...

314
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,360
Boss, I have a suggestion.

315
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,880
Maybe I'm more suitable

316
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,040
to handle this project.

317
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
When I was in Huan Ya,

318
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,240
I was in charge of several designers.

319
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,040
Rejected.

320
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,880
None of you

321
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,000
knows better than her.

322
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,800
Patrick Cho.

323
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,000
Mr. Zhao Moyuan.

324
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,480
is the resource Keke brought back.

325
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,880
They are lovers.

326
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,480
So this job must be her.

327
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,920
Do you still have any doubts?

328
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,160
I will work hard

329
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,120
to live up to the company's expectations.

330
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,000
Boss,

331
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,920
can I apply

332
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,600
volunteer to join this project?

333
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
I'm willing to share my experience

334
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,480
with Coco.

335
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,680
No problem.

336
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,680
But your KPI

337
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,800
will not change

338
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,680
because of your duty.

339
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,160
No problem.

340
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,360
Tina is quick.

341
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,240
Why didn't I think

342
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,360
it could work like this?

343
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,720
If you envy Tina,

344
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,920
than you.

345
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,920
Look at him.

346
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,560
right?

347
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,240
All kinds of assessments are over.

348
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,240
Everyone's work has been assigned.

349
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,480
Since the competition

350
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,920
the competition system

351
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,360
is no longer there.

352
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,120
Some people are still saying

353
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,040
that make people misunderstand.

354
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,440
Isn't it a little thoughtless?

355
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,360
I don't care

356
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,120
what everyone is thinking.

357
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,480
Because last week,

358
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,120
someone thought

359
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,480
with the boss?

360
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,480
And now,

361
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,920
it's my turn to get promoted by my boyfriend.

362
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,600
I don't think

363
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,040
a substantial difference.

364
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,040
But I want you to remember

365
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,240
Boss and Mr. Du

366
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,040
know Zhao Moyuan

367
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,920
because of my introduction,

368
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,600
the company transformation.

369
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,480
Zhao Moyuan and May series.

370
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,480
because of my activeness,

371
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,120
it became reality.

372
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,120
connections and resources

373
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,680
are part of our strength.

374
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,560
If you think it's unfair,

375
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,680
please fight for it.

376
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,800
What do you think?

377
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,680
I just learned from the boss.

378
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,240
Did you learn it well?

379
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,360
Do we look alike?

380
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,000
Do we look alike? Yes.

381
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,360
I'm totally shocked.

382
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:09,920
Right?

383
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,800
That means I'm still strong.

384
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,240
By the way,

385
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,720
In this performance,

386
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,680
How much do you think

387
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,000
How much do you think it will take?

388
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,800
I think

389
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,360
it's not less than ten percent.

390
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,360
Coco.

391
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,040
I also

392
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,560
with our company's press conference before.

393
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,680
If you're too busy,

394
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,440
I'll help you.

395
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,160
Sure, no problem.

396
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,680
Yes.

397
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,160
We are in the same department.

398
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Yes.

399
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,680
We should help each other.

400
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
You did a good job.

401
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,680
We're all peers.

402
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,120
You always praise me like a leader.

403
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,920
I'll be embarrassed.

404
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,200
You feel guilty?

405
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,079
When you were talking,

406
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,440
you spoke faster than before.

407
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,560
And your hands are trembling.

408
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,440
This means

409
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
this cooperation

410
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,680
you didn't

411
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,960
as you said.

412
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,800
Am I right?

413
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,200
You thought...

414
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,720
Don't get me wrong. I mean no harm.

415
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,240
I came here

416
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,560
to show my loyalty to you.

417
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,920
I told you

418
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,840
I'm more suitable

419
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,920
to handle this project.

420
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,560
But from now on,

421
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,080
I will only help you wholeheartedly.

422
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,720
I won't give you any trouble.

423
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,360
And I won't steal any of your limelight.

424
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:48,720
Because this opportunity

425
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,320
this opportunity.

426
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,920
I just want to seize it.

427
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,240
I don't want you to misunderstand.

428
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,040
Please.

429
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,720
Let's go.

430
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,720
Found it.

431
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,440
Tina.

432
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,600
What's wrong with you?

433
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,080
I can't do anything to her.

434
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,600
Boss asked her

435
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,240
to handle an important case.

436
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,320
Let me tell you.

437
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,360
From now on,

438
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,840
don't play tricks.

439
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
She used to rely on you.

440
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,720
In the future, you'll have to rely on her.

441
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Is resources really a part of your strength?

442
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,960
If I never knew Zhao Moyuan,

443
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,200
do you think

444
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,960
I can go further

445
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,360
Can I still go further?

446
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,040
It's not here.

447
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,960
Impossible.

448
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,600
Are you sure?

449
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,720
Isn't it here?

450
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:03,960
Look.

451
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,320
Impossible.

452
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,040
But there's nothing

453
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,560
No.

454
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,600
I've written it clearly.

455
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,360
What should we do?

456
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,600
It's right here. Look.

457
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,080
Okay, I'll go back and look for it.

458
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,080
I've sent you the data.

459
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,600
Are you looking for the T-shirt?

460
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,080
The statistics, right?

461
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,440
I have it here. Take it.

462
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,480
Thank you.

463
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,120
From now on,

464
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,600
in the future.

465
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,200
When will we do the handover?

466
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,560
No hurry.

467
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,080
I just started.

468
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:41,680
You finish this week.

469
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,040
I'll think about it.

470
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:43,920
Okay.

471
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,840
There's a supplier called Da Yi.

472
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,080
I've been working for half a year.

473
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,440
Actually its strength

474
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,840
is much better than

475
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,080
than we use now.

476
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,720
I'll take you there tomorrow.

477
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,960
Okay, I won't stand on ceremony then.

478
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,840
Let's use our relationship.

479
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,800
Hello? Okay.

480
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,080
Yes, the executive has agreed.

481
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,320
Mr. Du, no problem.

482
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,320
Okay, bye.

483
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,120
Hello.

484
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,960
Miss Jiang, you can choose a room now.

485
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,040
Choose a room now.

486
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,960
To be exact, in an hour.

487
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,680
Ms. Jiang, hurry up.

488
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,560
There are many people

489
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,680
in the sales building.

490
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,840
I might not be able to make it.

491
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,360
But I'm working.

492
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,480
How can I get there now?

493
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,600
This is the company's decision.

494
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
I have no choice.

495
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,320
Buying a house is all about snatching.

496
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,200
Mr. Liu, line up here.

497
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,720
Miss Jiang, I'm sorry.

498
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,600
I have to hang up.

499
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Wait.

500
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,800
Hello, I just got a call.

501
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,720
I was suddenly told to pick a house.

502
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,720
I have a meeting with a Thai supplier.

503
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,960
Take a taxi.

504
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:29,720
Hello?

505
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,240
Hello, Jessie. It's me.

506
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,240
Michael from DTC.

507
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,080
I have something urgent to tell you.

508
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,840
Hello, I'm not Jessie.

509
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,440
I'm her colleague.

510
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,240
Okay, please tell her the cotton.

511
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,960
Wait.

512
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,800
Please forgive me.

513
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,720
Okay.

514
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,200
The fabric we ordered

515
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,600
in three weeks.

516
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,600
Okay, bye.

517
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,200
Bye.

518
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,840
Are you a pervert?

519
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:14,800
What's wrong?

520
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,200
The developer suddenly notified

521
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,080
to choose a house at eleven.

522
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,600
Tang Li is still in Songjiang.

523
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,120
I’m worried if he can’t make it

524
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,440
or not in the front,

525
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,320
the house we've been waiting for is gone.

526
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,320
It’s OK. It’s Monday.

527
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,600
If Tang Li is late,

528
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,480
others wouldn’t have come.

529
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,200
You don't know those agencies yet.

530
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,440
they will cause panic.

531
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,440
It's okay. Just focus on your work.

532
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,480
Don't worry.

533
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,680
By the way, your supplier

534
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,080
Michael from DTC called

535
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,920
It's about the shirt replenishment.

536
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,720
He has a heavy accent and speaks fast.

537
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,080
My English is not good.

538
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,440
I'm afraid I didn't remember it clearly.

539
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,920
Call and check.

540
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,840
I think he's talking about pervert.

541
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,120
What fabric?

542
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:53,960
Okay.

543
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,960
I'll call you later.

544
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,600
Okay.

545
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,320
Hello?

546
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,960
What?

547
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,440
No.

548
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,080
I can only use my savings card.

549
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,600
Wen Xi, here.

550
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,800
Keep it well.

551
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,840
How is it? Any progress?

552
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,560
Tang Li is here.

553
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,680
But there are

554
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,080
in front of him.

555
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
What if he

556
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,800
when it comes to him?

557
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,320
I don't think so.

558
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Didn't you say that house

559
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,600
a small house?

560
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,080
There are many small houses. It should be fine.

561
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,120
This is

562
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,040
can get

563
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,360
the only one I just need.

564
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,200
Jessie, go to the boss's office.

565
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,320
She wants to see you.

566
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,240
Go ahead.

567
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,440
In the company resource system,

568
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,720
Did you order

569
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,960
Did you place it?

570
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,720
Yes. Is there a problem?

571
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,800
This is your last order.

572
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,560
Come and compare it.

573
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,200
The fabric used to be made of cotton.

574
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,960
This time it's finished

575
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,200
Why did you make such a mistake?

576
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,320
The satin and coloring are mixed up.

577
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,480
If I hadn't found the problem

578
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,200
during the review,

579
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,440
Once your order is released,

580
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,720
it will cause hundreds of thousands of loss to the company.

581
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,600
You know?

582
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,120
You're a veteran purchasing of the company.

583
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:18,840
Tell me.

584
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,600
Why did you make such a mistake?

585
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,320
I...

586
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,840
Director Lei.

587
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,600
I'm indeed responsible for this.

588
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,480
But it was Ding Yike.

589
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,200
the fabric dealer she contacted.

590
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,560
hasn’t she started

591
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,800
take over

592
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,600
the order at the end of summer?

593
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,960
She made a mistake.

594
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,320
because she made a mistake.

595
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,960
You go out first. I'll find you later.

596
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,080
Yes.

597
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,920
Let me tell you.

598
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,560
I've been really busy lately.

599
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,320
and hiring people.

600
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,960
The boss is not human.

601
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,040
You know what?

602
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,800
Jiang Jie.

603
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,800
Come in.

604
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,120
Coming.

605
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,960
How are you? Are you okay?

606
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,680
I'm fine.

607
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,040
Jessie.

608
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,720
Did you pick a house?

609
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,440
I don't know yet.

610
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
Let me tell you.

611
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,680
Whether you choose or not,

612
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,360
you have to say you didn't get it these days.

613
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:40,680
Why?

614
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,600
Yes, why?

615
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,600
Who told you to call so loudly?

616
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,320
Our director heard it.

617
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,680
She just asked me

618
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,600
if Jiang Jie’s contract is about to expire.

619
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,480
It’s time to sign a non-fixed contract.

620
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,440
Thank you.

621
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,320
for telling me such important news.

622
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,480
I have to be extra careful from now on.

623
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,600
I'll buy you milk tea.

624
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,600
I'll go buy milk tea.

625
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,440
Sure.

626
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,120
A non-fixed contract.

627
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,200
Isn't that good?

628
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:15,960
Is there a problem?

629
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,120
Of course.

630
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,240
Young women like us

631
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,040
In the eyes of many companies,

632
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,600
buying a house means marriage.

633
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,720
Marriage means pregnancy.

634
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,320
She needs maternity leave when she's pregnant.

635
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,800
She's not here for half a year.

636
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,960
the position in the company

637
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,040
to add more people or not.

638
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,840
Anyway,

639
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,960
the Purchase Department will be replaced.

640
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,920
It's a waste of maternity leave.

641
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,800
I'd rather not renew the contract.

642
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,080
So?

643
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,440
When we wrote a letter to ask for a job,

644
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
in many resumes,

645
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,200
there's no marriage recently.

646
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,560
Do you think it's too realistic?

647
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,720
Unfortunately, the workplace doesn't believe in tears.

648
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,720
Really.

649
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,800
The last two are transparent in the south and north.

650
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,200
Check your WeChat.

651
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,480
I've sent the receipt.

652
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,200
Okay.

653
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,480
Do you see it, Jie?

654
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,240
I'm here

655
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,840
What's wrong, Xiaojie?

656
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,200
Are you crying?

657
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,480
Tang Li, we have a house.

658
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,120
We finally have a house.

659
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,960
Yeah.

660
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,320
We went to so many buildings

661
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,600
and borrowed so much money.

662
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,200
and begged so many people.

663
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,800
I finally have a house.

664
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,720
Okay, stop crying.

665
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,120
I have to go back to work.

666
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,840
Mrs. Tang, we have to work harder.

667
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,960
In two months,

668
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,320
we have to pay the mortgage.

669
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,200
If I work overtime in the future,

670
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,440
don’t blame me.

671
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,040
Tang Li.

672
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:08,080
I may have a problem with my work.

673
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,440
Ding Yike.

674
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,120
Mr. Du.

675
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,800
Jiang Jie is your best friend, right?

676
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:26,960
Yes.

677
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,120
Do you want to hear something?

678
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,320
How is it?

679
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,480
Got it. Thank you.

680
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,080
Okay.

681
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,040
Let me interview you.

682
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,200
How do you feel now?

683
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,200
The world is full of misfortune.

684
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,840
Friendship is as thin as paper.

685
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,840
I'm a little upset.

686
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,600
You're quite talented.

687
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,480
Just mood failure?

688
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,320
You're not worried about yourself at all.

689
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,680
As a CEO,

690
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,840
you have time to inform me.

691
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,200
That means the order

692
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,360
has been held.

693
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,440
So you didn't

694
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,120
to the company.

695
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,960
What am I worried about?

696
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:26,320
But

697
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,080
you've helped me a lot.

698
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,440
Do you want me to help you again?

699
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,360
Smart and smart.

700
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,320
Come, sit down.

701
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,720
Hurry up.

702
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,800
Your boyfriend, Patric, is going to

703
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,440
is about to start.

704
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,360
Just keep an eye on your boyfriend.

705
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,120
Don't let him get too close to Leo.

706
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,320
I'll take care of the rest.

707
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,960
I'll fix it for you.

708
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,960
Sorry, I don't agree.

709
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,800
Why?

710
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,440
As the main representative

711
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,680
of our company,

712
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,800
will have close contact with Moyuan.

713
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,200
I keep staring at him.

714
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,480
I don't trust him

715
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,240
and disrespect my work.

716
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,440
And this project

717
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,480
not only the company's

718
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
of our company,

719
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,680
It’s Moyuan’s first season garment-making series.

720
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,720
I should

721
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,200
devote myself to it and participate in it.

722
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,200
Mr. Du, I sincerely advise you

723
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,040
Please trust my profession

724
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,480
and Director Lei's profession.

725
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,240
Because for her,

726
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,080
it must be

727
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,720
a very important project.

728
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,680
Okay?

729
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,960
That makes sense.

730
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,720
I guess I'm being narrow-minded.

731
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,240
I take back what I said.

732
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,320
But if you refuse me so easily,

733
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,200
you should

734
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,680
the DTC case yourself.

735
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,200
How could you do that?

736
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,240
But I was totally panicked.

737
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,680
Tang Li, do you think Leo

738
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,920
would she believe me?

739
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,080
Will she stop renewing the contract

740
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,600
because of this?

741
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,240
It's not about Leo.

742
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,320
It's not about trusting you or not.

743
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,960
It's the problem that you shouldn't

744
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,360
to her.

745
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,560
She didn't.

746
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,840
Tell me.

747
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,200
It's just that

748
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,560
sent a message for you.

749
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,200
If something goes wrong,

750
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,720
How can you blame him?

751
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,720
This is your job.

752
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,320
Why can't you check it again?

753
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:10,960
At that time,

754
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,600
I was thinking about the house.

755
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,440
If you panic

756
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,600
Even if you're flustered,

757
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,200
you can't blame it on others.

758
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,960
What time is it now?

759
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,840
Why are you defending outsiders again?

760
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,240
If it weren't for the developer,

761
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,560
you suddenly told me to choose a house.

762
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,560
How can I be anxious?

763
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,120
Other's boyfriend

764
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,920
who doesn't own a wedding house?

765
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,120
I'm the dumbest.

766
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,080
I work hard with you every day.

767
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,440
and get scolded by you.

768
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,800
Jiang Jie, can you be reasonable?

769
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,200
How am I unreasonable?

770
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,720
It's said that men and women are equal.

771
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,320
But I do the same job as you.

772
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,240
With the same salary,

773
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,480
with the same salary.

774
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,320
than you.

775
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,920
I cook and clean the house every day.

776
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,200
the water, electricity and network insurance fee.

777
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,840
Have you ever thought about it?

778
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,600
If you didn't forget your credit card,

779
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,240
I wouldn't have made such a big mistake.

780
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,440
Are you done?

781
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:58,840
Xiaojie, let me tell you.

782
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,560
I'm very disappointed

783
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,680
very disappointed with you.

784
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,800
If you think

785
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,840
is too much pressure for you,

786
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,040
I can just give up the deposit.

787
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,600
I won’t buy this house.

788
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,320
Tang Li, what are you talking about?

789
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
Every time we quarreled,

790
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,920
I always let you win.

791
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,720
But this is a matter of principle.

792
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,720
Go find

793
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,960
Director Lei

794
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,080
before others

795
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,560
before others find you.

796
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,360
Are you crazy?

797
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,440
I'm not crazy. You didn't think it through.

798
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,080
Is Ding Yike a fool?

799
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,200
If you push the blame on her,

800
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,360
if you push her away?

801
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,480
You decide.

802
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,560
Tang Li,

803
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,080
I will explain to Director Lei myself.

804
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,480
Jiang Jie has never

805
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,560
with me.

806
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,360
Otherwise, I'll use my own account

807
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,600
with my own account,

808
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,720
instead of Jiang Jie’s.

809
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,240
Aren’t you good friends?

810
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,480
It's between good friends.

811
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,200
between good friends?

812
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,720
Boss will believe me.

813
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,840
Will other colleagues think

814
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,920
you purposely

815
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,239
because Leo thinks highly of you

816
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,639
because he thinks highly of you.

817
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,679
Ding Yike.

818
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,840
You don't look like

819
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,159
you don't look like

820
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:25,639
the champion I recruited.

821
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,960
The battery is low.

822
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,800
Does it look like it now?

823
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,040
What is this?

824
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,040
I've been practicing my language lately.

825
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,159
Moyuan said

826
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,120
to compare pronunciation and textbook.

827
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,560
I forgot to turn it off this morning.

828
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:00,840
You mean...

829
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,400
I recorded what I said.

830
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,080
Yes.

831
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,040
Hurry up. Are you okay?

832
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,040
Call Wang Yuan.

833
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,640
Wang Yuan.

834
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,680
Hurry up.

835
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,640
Mr. Du.

836
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,400
My waist.

837
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,240
My waist is sprained.

838
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,400
My waist hurts. Let me see.

839
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,240
Does it hurt, Mr. Du?

840
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,600
Slowly.

841
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,240
It hurts.

842
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,440
Hold it, Mr. Du.

843
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,680
Don't worry.

844
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,880
I won't give you

845
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,160
I won't give it to you.

846
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,200
Don't worry.

847
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,320
Hold it.

848
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,400
Be gentle.

849
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,120
Okay, I'll be gentle.

850
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,880
Actually, it hurts too.

851
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,640
Look at the apple of friendship.

852
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,320
It's one thing to grow black dots.

853
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,880
But seeing it rot slowly,

854
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,120
It smells sour.

855
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,200
is another thing.

856
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,880
Sorry, Director Lei.

857
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,480
I was wrong just now.

858
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,360
I'm responsible for the wrong order.

859
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,960
It has nothing to do with Ding Yike.

860
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,160
Your explanation

861
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,320
are totally different.

862
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,200
He knocked me out.

863
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,360
I was too anxious to explain.

864
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,200
but I made a mistake.

865
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,880
But she helped me

866
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,320
a call from the fabric dealer.

867
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,800
Maybe he didn’t tell me

868
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,720
whether it's cotton or color.

869
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,040
Anyway,

870
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,640
something went wrong during the handover period.

871
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,960
I should be responsible.

872
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,160
Do you think I can still believe

873
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,160
you're saying now?

874
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,880
I'll talk to DTC.

875
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,200
Their Michael

876
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,400
has worked with me for so many years.

877
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,560
It shouldn't be difficult to change the order.

878
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,960
The order hasn't been sent out.

879
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,840
No need to change.

880
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,440
But you should know

881
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,680
what I want to hear.

882
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,720
I'm sorry, Director Lei.

883
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,640
I shouldn't have

884
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,160
on Ding Yike.

885
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,200
I promise it won't happen again.

886
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,840
Please give me a chance.

887
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,440
The least welcome in my team

888
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,040
is emotionally unstable.

889
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,680
who likes to play tricks.

890
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,120
Go back to work.

891
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,960
I'll announce the decision later.

892
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,640
Yes

893
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,880
You also want to see Director Lei?

894
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,120
No, I'm going to the dressing room.

895
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,880
Go ahead.

896
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,040
Bye.

897
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:48,840
Bye

898
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,920
Xiaojie

899
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,400
What are you doing here?

900
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:17,400
Didn't we make it clear on WeChat?

901
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,920
I told Leo everything.

902
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,920
We broke up too.

903
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,240
No, Xiaojie.

904
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,160
It's all my fault.

905
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,640
I was too harsh this afternoon.

906
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,920
Don't be mad at me, Xiaojie.

907
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,160
We just have our own home.

908
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,960
How can this family lack you?

909
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,160
Jie, I'm sorry.

910
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,640
I shouldn't have said that to you.

911
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,120
I was too stupid.

912
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,800
Leo could've protected her so much.

913
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,960
I can't believe I tried to push the blame on her.

914
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,800
You're asking for it.

915
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,080
I checked the Labor Law.

916
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,640
If Leo gets into trouble because of this,

917
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,880
Give me the next punishment.

918
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,400
If the company doesn't renew the contract,

919
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,920
They can not pay me a penny.

920
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,640
Xiaojie

921
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,320
Director Lei

922
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,600
didn't announce

923
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,920
the final result.

924
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,160
That means there's a turning point.

925
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,840
Don't think too much, okay?

926
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,080
Maybe she already knows.

927
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,880
Yes, she must know.

928
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,600
She didn't talk to me much this afternoon.

929
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,160
And now...

930
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,880
Leo will definitely tell her.

931
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,960
Tang Li, what should we do?

932
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,240
What should we do now?

933
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,640
Xiaojie, it's okay.

934
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,920
Don't think about it. Everything will be fine.

935
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,960
Wang Yuan.

936
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,640
Bring me my ointment. Hurry.

937
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:39,720
Sure.

938
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,720
In my bag.

939
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:41,240
Okay.

940
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,640
Here, Mr. Du.

941
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,400
I told you.

942
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,920
I’m going to

943
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,600
with Zhao Yuyuan tonight.

944
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,960
If your waist hurts,

945
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,440
you really don't have to go.

946
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,680
Wang Won, stop the car.

947
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,400
No, no, no.

948
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,160
Keep driving.

949
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,560
How can I not go?

950
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,560
As the CEO of the company,

951
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,840
I have to attend this.

952
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,400
Only a minor injury

953
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,680
to show

954
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,360
our importance to Armour Zhao.

955
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,240
Right?

956
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:09,560
Coco.

957
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,040
What do you think about

958
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,400
about Jiang Jie?

959
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,400
What's wrong with Jiang Jie?

960
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,360
In my opinion,

961
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,400
Then why should I let you

962
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,720
hear that conversation?

963
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,720
In the cooperation with Zhao Moyuan in May,

964
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,360
you are a key point.

965
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,240
I don't want you to have any resentment.

966
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,200
But Jiang Jie is your good friend.

967
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,640
So I want to hear your answer.

968
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:34,880
The answer is...

969
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,840
Please don't think about me.

970
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,480
Just follow the company's rules.

971
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,880
It seems that

972
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,440
tolerance and understanding.

973
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,480
Jiang Jie did make a mistake today.

974
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,880
But who can guarantee

975
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,400
never make mistakes?

976
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,360
Moreover, she also took the responsibility

977
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,680
and took the responsibility.

978
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,040
If at this time,

979
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,640
give her a serious punishment,

980
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,880
Can she renew

981
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,840
will be renewed?

982
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,040
She's pretty good at her job.

983
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,600
Otherwise, you wouldn't have kept her.

984
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,680
On the other hand,

985
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,440
can she find a job

986
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,400
can she find her next job?

987
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,400
Actually, I'm not pleading for her.

988
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,720
I just thought that

989
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,640
one day,

990
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,640
I might also be treated the same way.

991
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,880
It's a bit sad.

992
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,160
After all, the workplace environment

993
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,720
is not fair

994
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,480
to women.

995
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,440
So if the company

996
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,960
any actual harm,

997
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,920
the actual harm.

998
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,360
Thank you for considering my feelings.

999
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,480
But

1000
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,800
I sincerely hope

1001
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,680
you chose me to join the project team

1002
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,840
because you chose me

1003
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,800
not because

1004
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,360
my personal relationship with Moyuan.

1005
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,680
Okay, I got it.

1006
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,880
We've read

1007
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,080
your first design manuscript.

1008
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,160
The style.

1009
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,880
It's perfect for May's new positioning.

1010
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,880
I think it's good.

1011
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,440
We can move on.

1012
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,120
After that, we will discuss

1013
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,640
we will have internal discussion.

1014
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,160
Internal discussion

1015
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,640
It sounds stressful.

1016
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,120
Mr. Zhao doesn't think

1017
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,800
as long as it's your design,

1018
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,640
will be taken in May.
