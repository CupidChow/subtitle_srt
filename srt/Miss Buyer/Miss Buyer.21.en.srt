1
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,560
Hello.

2
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,760
Hello, Miss Jiang.

3
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,200
I'm Ding Yike.

4
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,680
I got your number

5
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,840
from Feifei.

6
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,120
I was hesitating

7
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,920
if I should call you.

8
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,680
But I've decided

9
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,040
to tell you.

10
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,040
Actually, a long time ago,

11
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,920
Ms Ding.

12
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,040
You don't have to explain for him.

13
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,120
It's his problem now.

14
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,200
It's not your problem.

15
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,480
Lin Sixian is

16
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,040
a kind egoist.

17
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,400
We all know

18
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,640
why he gave up on you.

19
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,760
But he can't let you go now.

20
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,200
To put it nicely, it's love.

21
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,640
To put it bluntly,

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,640
Red roses and white rice.

23
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,200
Thank you.

24
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,840
for calling me today.

25
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,120
I really underestimated you before.

26
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,920
Now I sincerely apologize to you.

27
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,280
You're an opponent I respect.

28
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,120
She won't break up with him.

29
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,560
What's Lin Sixian's nature?

30
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,760
Mama's baby dislikes the old.

31
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,560
This is the Thunder Area.

32
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,680
Jiang Wenwen

33
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,560
fall in love with such a man?

34
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,280
I've been with him for half a year.

35
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,120
There's only one truth.

36
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,360
That is, in the marriage market,

37
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,400
in the marriage market.

38
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,680
And love

39
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,920
as time goes by,

40
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,640
women keep losing

41
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,840
For example, beauty, childbirth function.

42
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,840
The more men accumulate,

43
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,760
For example, wealth, seducing skills.

44
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,480
But the local girls

45
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,959
are very clear.

46
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,760
We quarreled,

47
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,959
but in the end,

48
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,480
we still have to reunite.

49
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,040
Why do you sound like you can see through the world?

50
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,800
This is called realism, okay?

51
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,920
The expiration date of hormone

52
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,640
It's only 18 months anyway.

53
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,360
So there's no need

54
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,520
for love.

55
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,280
If you meet a man with similar conditions,

56
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,560
just marry him.

57
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,120
It's nothing to hold your ex's hand.

58
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,960
As long as he's not cheating on you,

59
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,520
I think he went out

60
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,800
go shopping and watch movies.

61
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,080
Let's play games together.

62
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,080
I can do anything.

63
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,560
After all, this is humanity.

64
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,960
When I was young,

65
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,840
in my childhood.

66
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,760
Now,

67
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,800
I'm too lazy to give you a mobile game.

68
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,400
The male non-player character is charged.

69
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,800
Do you want to know

70
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,680
When will you meet me?

71
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,520
What about you?

72
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,400
You'll meet him, right? I'm confident.

73
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,520
Why are you here

74
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,920
Why are you here?

75
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,040
The show venue has been set.

76
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,240
Of course I have to come.

77
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,520
Take some photos

78
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,120
and post it on my official account.

79
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,520
A public account?

80
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,240
Where is it?

81
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,520
Of course it's far away.

82
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,680
I heard from Feifei that

83
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,360
you still use phone calls

84
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,960
to communicate with clients through emails.

85
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,400
is outdated.

86
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,680
So look.

87
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,800
I applied for a public account

88
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,680
to update information every day.

89
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,680
You need to know about your show.

90
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,240
Many fashion accounts

91
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,680
are very concerned about this.

92
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,240
We'll share it and share it.

93
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,960
the number of subscribers will go up.

94
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,080
Okay, go ahead.

95
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,040
Remember to

96
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,760
don't expose

97
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,520
our design in advance.

98
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,760
Of course. Don't worry.

99
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,080
Okay, go ahead.

100
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,640
I'm leaving.

101
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,760
You're worrying again.

102
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,360
Dad.

103
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,240
Why are you here?

104
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,800
I'm the president of this company.

105
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,080
Why can't I come?

106
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,480
You're doing a fashion show now.

107
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,280
What now?

108
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,080
A joint collaboration of designers.

109
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:45,080
It's so noisy.

110
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,960
If I don't check it myself,

111
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,200
if I don't come in person?

112
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,520
Go ahead.

113
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,240
What brings you here?

114
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,080
What is it?

115
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,480
you can ask me at home.

116
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,800
The doctor told me

117
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,520
you can't be tired.

118
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,800
You haven't been home for days.

119
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,080
How can I ask you?

120
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,560
Well,

121
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,800
busy.

122
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,080
Why were you sighing just now?

123
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,120
It's because of the cost.

124
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,520
We changed several kinds of fabrics.

125
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,560
But the effect

126
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,040
is not as good as Zhao Moyuan.

127
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,400
as Zhao Yuyuan.

128
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,240
But if we sell big goods according to his requirements,

129
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,080
plus other cost,

130
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,680
each one will lose more than 20 yuan.

131
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,640
This joint design is 15.

132
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,280
Each one costs over 20 yuan.

133
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,800
The total is...

134
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,560
a few million.

135
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,960
But have you ever thought

136
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,960
a famous designer like Zhao Moyuan

137
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,480
He's willing to stand up for you.

138
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,800
We'll pay you a few million yuan.

139
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,080
Is it high?

140
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,040
But Director Liu, Director Xu,

141
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,280
They don't think so.

142
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,360
short-sighted.

143
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,520
The joint payment

144
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,920
to make money and drink.

145
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,680
The real profit

146
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,480
depends on

147
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,960
our own product series.

148
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,400
You don't even understand this.

149
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,960
how can I get used to

150
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,360
our transformation in May?

151
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,760
I'll tell them about this.

152
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,240
Okay.

153
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,360
I’ll call them over.

154
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,280
Did Mr. Du really say that?

155
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,680
Yes.

156
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,840
Everything will be easier with him.

157
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,520
You

158
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,159
misunderstood my dad too much.

159
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,679
He

160
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,320
very strategic.

161
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,240
Since he knew

162
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,480
you love Oh-wol wholeheartedly,

163
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,039
No matter what happens,

164
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,600
he'll always support you.

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,320
It's the best

166
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,560
is the best.

167
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,680
I want to watch the show later.

168
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,560
It's not fun just looking at your photos.

169
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,920
By the way,

170
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,040
that director is from Hong Kong?

171
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,120
Yes.

172
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,000
He guided many famous shows

173
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,800
in Hong Kong Fashion Week.

174
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
In terms of language communication,

175
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,000
in language communication.

176
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,240
After we get familiar with each other,

177
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,680
we can ask him to guide our wedding next time.

178
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Sure.

179
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,920
As long as your wife likes it too.

180
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,480
Leo, you know what I'm talking about.

181
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,240
Mr. Du, let me say it again.

182
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,680
I don't date or get married.

183
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,000
We are eating, living, working

184
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,480
and rest together.

185
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,800
It's no different from getting married.

186
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,120
It's been so long.

187
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,560
your misunderstanding about men

188
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,160
about men.

189
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:43,920
Do you want to fight

190
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,240
or eat?

191
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,720
Let's drink. Forget it.

192
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,560
Everything.

193
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,560
We'll talk about it

194
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
our new series.

195
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,560
Let's eat.

196
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,800
This week's report

197
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
The loss rate is 10%.

198
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,120
How did you do that?

199
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,560
New media promotion. You don't understand?

200
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
I even used May

201
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,360
in May

202
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,120
with some bloggers for promotion.

203
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,360
What blogger?

204
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,120
Chase Lee and Lingling.

205
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,920
And they do promotions for free.

206
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Tell him to stop right now.

207
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,680
Don't let them promote us anymore.

208
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,800
Why?

209
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,160
They are all bloggers with plastic surgery.

210
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,240
So vulgar.

211
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,000
I don't want to get too involved

212
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,480
with them.

213
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,800
You're overthinking.

214
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,320
I use Dio and Chanel too.

215
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,000
His style isn't affected.

216
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,600
Actually, on the day of the show,

217
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,440
I want to tell you

218
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,800
if you open a public account,

219
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,360
you should have told me.

220
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,240
You think I drive the wrong way

221
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,920
I'm a cold person.

222
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,360
If we keep launching new products,

223
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,480
it will become a popular online shop.

224
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,920
But without promotion or promotion,

225
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,920
where will the profit come from?

226
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,240
I've never asked for profit.

227
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:17,880
right?

228
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,560
We are a typical

229
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,680
of a typical meaning.

230
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,800
It's different from

231
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,880
like Wuyue.

232
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,800
So you can't use May's business mode

233
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,000
with the business mode of May.

234
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,240
or you'll go astray.

235
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,120
Didn't you say

236
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,160
give me the full power of the distance?

237
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
If I can't make the decision,

238
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,440
why would you keep me far away?

239
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,880
After all,

240
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
any clerk.

241
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,120
Or

242
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,040
you pitied me

243
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,800
because you pitied me.

244
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,040
If that's the case,

245
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,040
I can find another job.

246
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:58,800
You don't have to stay here.

247
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,560
It's boring to say that.

248
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,920
I think we shouldn't go online.

249
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,560
OK?

250
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,560
Just get to the point.

251
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,040
Don't be unreasonable.

252
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,480
You're the unreasonable one.

253
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
Are you angry?

254
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,720
I'm sorry.

255
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,800
I'm sorry. Don't go.

256
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,360
All right.

257
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,480
I'm sorry.

258
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,360
Are you angry?

259
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,120
I admit my mistake.

260
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,360
I shouldn't go back on my word.

261
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,360
I shouldn't tell you later.

262
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,920
I told you to take care of it.

263
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,120
and interfere with your work.

264
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,560
Sorry, okay?

265
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,240
I'm sorry.

266
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,360
All right.

267
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,880
I shouldn't have lost my temper.

268
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,320
I know what you said makes sense.

269
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,240
But when I heard what you said,

270
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,040
I feel upset

271
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,120
I feel unhappy.

272
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,360
After all, I've worked hard for so long.

273
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,440
I'll reward you now, okay?

274
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,920
You're so annoying.

275
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:22,880
Moyuan.

276
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,800
Actually, I wasn't reckless this time.

277
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,040
If I can't even

278
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,120
the first step,

279
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,040
how can we expand it in the future?

280
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,600
How can we go beyond the dialysis?

281
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,880
What? You want to

282
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,720
fight Shen Jin on your own?

283
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,040
Of course.

284
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,000
I want to defeat him

285
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,320
from business.

286
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,360
Let's see how arrogant he is.

287
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,240
and frame you and me.

288
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,920
You're amazing.

289
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,440
You grew up with confidence, right?

290
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,680
Tell me then. Hurry.

291
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,560
What do you want to do

292
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,600
and fight against him?

293
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,720
Don't underestimate me.

294
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,800
Although I'm a rookie in fashion circle,

295
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,000
but this time,

296
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,320
this time.

297
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,480
I've done a lot of homework.

298
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,000
And I have

299
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,240
a rough plan.

300
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,360
In your eyes,

301
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,120
Shen Jin is good at doing business

302
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,360
But I don’t think

303
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,880
If we really want to fight,

304
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,480
we don't know who will win.

305
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,560
You just said that with a public account,

306
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,800
you'll become an e-commerce.

307
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,560
But e-commerce is not necessarily bad.

308
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
There are many

309
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,480
many top buyers

310
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,720
have their own online stores.

311
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,040
Some even don't have physical stores.

312
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,800
And Lingyun and May

313
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,120
are willing to donate so much money

314
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,880
to promote your cooperation.

315
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,040
So why don't we take this opportunity

316
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,240
take a ride

317
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,040
and expand our popularity?

318
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Go on

319
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,720
Shen Jin’s buyer has a weakness

320
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,160
which is that they’ve never been on the scale.

321
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,560
I think

322
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,720
as long as we adjust the distance,

323
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,800
we can change the market location.

324
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,360
What do you want to do?

325
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,680
First,

326
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,440
Clear the inventory and focus on funds.

327
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,040
This, this, and this.

328
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,000
It hasn't been sold for four months.

329
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,560
I can't keep it under control.

330
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,240
So I want to break you.

331
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,720
that never gives discounts.

332
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,160
We'll have a summer promotion.

333
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,480
and return the money as soon as possible.

334
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,120
What's your purpose

335
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,920
return the money?

336
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,680
With money,

337
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,680
we can find designers

338
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,800
to design clothes for us.

339
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,120
I've checked.

340
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,680
Many customers are willing to buy it.

341
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,000
Friends wear nice clothes

342
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
If so,

343
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,800
they can only come back to buy it.

344
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,800
When more people buy it,

345
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,320
it will become a hit.

346
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,120
You should know that

347
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,480
Once all designs become popular,

348
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,360
and become popular,

349
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,440
It has nothing to do

350
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,720
with high-end.

351
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,440
So I think

352
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,800
if we want Yuan to accept this,

353
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,720
is so different

354
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,360
our previous positioning.

355
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,480
I can't accept it.

356
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Actually, under a brand,

357
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,240
under a brand.

358
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,320
Your haute couture series is cold.

359
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,560
collaboration series.

360
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,360
Then the shop can stay

361
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
in the middle-end area.

362
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,600
Besides,

363
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,040
I still want to

364
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,120
on the official account.

365
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,120
When you established the distance,

366
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,680
you wanted everyone to know

367
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,360
China not only has luxury brands,

368
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,800
but also good

369
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,360
low-key designs.

370
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,560
If that's the case,

371
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,920
we can promote it

372
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
through the public account.

373
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,920
If you think the blogger's wife is an Internet celebrity,

374
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,800
we can find some

375
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,000
with good taste.

376
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,240
No, no, no.

377
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,800
I think you should calm down now.

378
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,560
We don't have that much money

379
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
to communicate with these superstars.

380
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,760
We need Qian's help.

381
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,880
I'm sorry.

382
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,240
I talked to Qian.

383
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,800
Celebrities nowadays

384
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,480
want to be in the fashion circle.

385
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,120
And they are willing

386
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,320
to work with us.

387
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,600
Let's work together.

388
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,480
We provide them clothes

389
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,040
and ask them to take street photos

390
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
and promote us.

391
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,160
With popularity,

392
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,680
the sales will boost.

393
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,360
Then we can

394
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,960
better designers

395
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,319
and better brands.

396
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,200
to be the exclusive sales rights of China.

397
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,560
By then,

398
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,319
the snowball will get bigger and bigger.

399
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,839
and the scale will get bigger.

400
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,079
and develop better.

401
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,319
What's wrong?

402
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:24,359
Did you think that all by yourself?

403
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,560
I didn't expect Leo to teach you so much.

404
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,720
Did you forget?

405
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:35,680
I used to work in a consulting company.

406
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Data analysis is my strength.

407
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,720
And your senior

408
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,840
because of this,

409
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,720
That's why you're willing to

410
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,600
stay.

411
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,600
Do you know why I like you?

412
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,600
Why?

413
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,960
Because you always surprise people.

414
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,840
So you agree?

415
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,360
You've told me so much.

416
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,600
at least give me two days.

417
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
Let me digest it, right?

418
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,480
There's too much information.

419
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,560
But I promise.

420
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,360
I'll think about it.

421
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,600
As long as you think about it,

422
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,200
I'm already very happy.

423
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
Thank you.

424
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,080
For what?

425
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,600
I should be touched

426
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,040
I should be touched.

427
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,920
Although all these years,

428
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,720
I've been

429
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,480
in the middle part of the workplace food chain.

430
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,720
But I'm just like Feifei.

431
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,720
I have

432
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,480
a childish career plan.

433
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,200
You are the first person

434
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,440
to listen to me.

435
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,320
Thank you, Moyuan.

436
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,560
for getting closer to my dream.

437
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,120
It's my duty.

438
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,480
Why did you come back today?

439
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,120
Did you quarrel with your girlfriend again?

440
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,840
There are indeed some conflicts.

441
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,920
But don't worry.

442
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,360
We finally made up.

443
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,320
We won't die

444
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,440
because of these trivial matters.

445
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,840
What's the reason this time?

446
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,840
Dad.

447
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,480
I know clothes, but I don't know how to make money.

448
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,960
I want to ask you something about making money.

449
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,720
Give me some advice.

450
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,440
It's not easy to think of my dad.

451
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,080
Tell me.

452
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,920
Here's the thing.

453
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,440
You can take over my far.

454
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,200
So marketing

455
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,320
or she wants to promote

456
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,680
or some Internet celebrities.

457
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,600
This set.

458
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,040
After changing it,

459
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,200
I think...

460
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,200
Of course, I don't think

461
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,440
she's not thinking right.

462
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,120
I think there are two things.

463
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,080
First,

464
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,320
I think it's getting farther and farther

465
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,200
from my original imagination.

466
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,840
Two.

467
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,080
I'm worried that she doesn't have market experience.

468
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,240
What if she loses again?

469
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,800
It's just an empty talk.

470
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,720
Interesting.

471
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,360
I see. Let me ask you two questions.

472
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,600
First,

473
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,840
the clothes you designed

474
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,320
on others.

475
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,320
is the effect

476
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,600
as you imagined?

477
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,960
Second,

478
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,920
if you continue

479
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,080
you call noble,

480
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,720
How long can you take care of him?

481
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,040
Two years, five years, or forever?

482
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,720
I don't understand your art.

483
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,920
But I know

484
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,320
we have to

485
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,800
to support ourselves.

486
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,200
You've been running your shop

487
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:02,960
for so long,

488
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,840
for so long.

489
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,200
I think you should take a gamble.

490
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,040
Let Ding try it.

491
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,040
Who is born to do business?

492
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,680
The older the better.

493
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,080
It's really good.

494
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,320
Okay, got it.

495
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,960
Where are you going?

496
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,840
I'm leaving.

497
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:36,320
How many times have you been here

498
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,720
since you came back?

499
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,680
I came here today for this girl.

500
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,440
Or you won't come, right?

501
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,080
What do you want?

502
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
Since you're here,

503
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,440
you should take care of your dad

504
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,080
Come here, give me a massage.

505
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,080
You're too old to act cute.

506
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,200
Okay, you have to be able to handle my strength.

507
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,240
It's really tight.

508
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,680
You can check it out.

509
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,880
Push harder. Come on.

510
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,720
What's wrong?

511
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,200
I have a cold.

512
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,560
You

513
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,600
take care of yourself.

514
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,120
Don't be nervous.

515
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,960
Father and son should make up.

516
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,080
There must be an awkward process.

517
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,440
It's good after the process.

518
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,360
Come on.

519
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,920
Hang in there.

520
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,680
Here, Mr. Zhao.

521
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,600
Liu.

522
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,720
Take this to Yuan.

523
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,840
I heard him coughing.

524
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,840
Maybe he's not feeling well.

525
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,080
No problem.

526
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,040
You went out just now

527
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,960
to buy medicine for him.

528
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,720
I'm a driver.

529
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,440
Why don't you use it?

530
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,440
I brought it back.

531
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,960
Don't you know his temper?

532
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,600
He never takes medicine when he has a headache.

533
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,080
I have to take care of him.

534
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,320
Go.

535
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,040
Okay.

536
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,440
By the way,

537
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,440
don't tell him.

538
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,680
I bought this for him.

539
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
I can tell. He's my biological father.

540
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,800
Poor parents.

541
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,680
Why is your logo

542
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,240
Why is your logo on it?

543
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,200
The sewing artist will be entering soon.

544
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,840
Of course we need to rent one more room.

545
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,320
What are you doing?

546
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,040
Are you trying to show me

547
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,600
some roses?

548
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:08,040
Or do you want to show me your new design?

549
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,440
You're an overseas designer.

550
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,360
Don't be so old-fashioned.

551
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,840
Don't play such old tricks.

552
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,080
This is for you.

553
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,960
For me?

554
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,600
Do you like it?

555
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,840
Do you remember it?

556
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,360
This was before we reconciled.

557
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,440
That night,

558
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,120
I designed it all night.

559
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,800
I was in a bad mood back then,

560
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,080
and depressed,

561
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,120
But my mind is full of you.

562
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,840
It's the shadow of you in my eyes.

563
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,600
It's the image of you in my eyes.

564
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,200
Didn't you say

565
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,440
you've never worn

566
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,720
my design?

567
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,600
Give me a chance today

568
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,440
to make up for my regret.

569
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:06,920
Okay?

570
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,240
Are you ready?

571
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,040
I'm coming in.

572
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,920
Wait for me.

573
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,480
Thank you.

574
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:46,960
Thank you.

575
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,920
for giving my design

576
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,360
has the perfect soul.

577
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,200
Why are you so nice to me?

578
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,720
This is a bribe.

579
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,720
Because from today onwards,

580
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,080
I've made up my mind.

581
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,720
I'll leave it to you.

582
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,960
I will respect all your plans for the future.

583
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,920
And from now on,

584
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,960
all my resources

585
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,080
with you.

586
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,440
Please.

587
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,920
Thank you.

588
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,920
Can I dance?

589
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,040
Beautiful.

590
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,200
Perfect.

591
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,720
Ding, you're here.

592
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,200
Qian.

593
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,920
Well, Ming.

594
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,720
Let me introduce.

595
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,200
Sure.

596
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,040
I'm going to work.

597
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,720
Go ahead.

598
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,200
This is our coke in May.

599
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,960
This is Mingming, this is her manager.

600
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,240
It's Cocoa.

601
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,240
Yes, I told you about that.

602
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,120
Hello

603
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,600
Hello

604
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,440
Nice to meet you.

605
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,960
That's all.

606
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,320
Kong said there will be more later.

607
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,440
Do I look good?

608
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,680
Do I look good?

609
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,600
Just so-so.

610
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,480
Say it again.

611
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,800
It's pretty.

612
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,920
I thought he was bored for a year

613
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,560
he was basically wasted.

614
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,040
Unexpectedly,

615
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,200
Not only didn't I lose,

616
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,960
but also more colorful.

617
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,720
Genius are genius.

618
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,840
A genius is a genius, but a character is a character.

619
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,920
Maybe these are all plagiarized.

620
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,720
False comfort is a sarcasm to intelligence.

621
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,920
Can't you see

622
00:32:58,920 --> 00:32:59,960
this time

623
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:02,320
is the same as the previous Haute Couture?

624
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,600
Is there anything else?

625
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,560
Zhao Moyuan doesn’t have any.

626
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,080
Her girlfriend and the restaurant do have some.

627
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
recent activities.

628
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,040
Discount promotion.

629
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,320
Zhao Moyuan hated discounts the most.

630
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,240
Why did he

631
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,960
make a big business this time?

632
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,680
His girlfriend

633
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,840
his girlfriend is in charge now.

634
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,080
And Zhao Moyuan wants to change into clothes now.

635
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,080
He can close the store

636
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,360
he can close the store.

637
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,040
No way.

638
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,480
Have you seen a shop that's closing?

639
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,480
open public accounts and online stores?

640
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,800
and do online marketing?

641
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,320
Honey, why are you back?

642
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,960
Why didn't you tell me?

643
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,440
Someone from the organizing committee sent me a message.

644
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,320
I have no chance

645
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:03,680
I have no chance.

646
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,440
Then why did you go to the award ceremony?

647
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,679
Why did we...

648
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,560
Because Zhao Moyuan...

649
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,440
What are you doing?

650
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,560
Looking for him.

651
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,480
I listened to you

652
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,800
I didn't trouble him

653
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,600
to let you vote for him.

654
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,600
But he's getting worse.

655
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,480
You can't go.

656
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,639
Go now.

657
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,320
Business competition.

658
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,440
I can do anything with him.

659
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,400
Now he's on your head.

660
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,639
You are a woman.

661
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,600
Lingyun is behind him now.

662
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,480
I don't want you to suffer anymore.

663
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,199
It's better to get rid of your enemies than to get married.

664
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,719
The past

665
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,800
the past.

666
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,880
Can you let it go?

667
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,600
There are many things

668
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,800
in the circle.

669
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,480
Okay, stop crying.

670
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:15,160
Okay, stop crying, okay?

671
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:17,880
Promise me.

672
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,360
officially promise me.

673
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,480
no matter his reputation

674
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,720
or successful,

675
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,640
it has nothing to do with us.

676
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,080
Okay, I promise you.

677
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,240
I promise you formally.

678
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,560
Don't cry.

679
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:36,920
This has nothing to do with you.

680
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,160
Don't be sad, okay?

681
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,920
You're lucky.

682
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,400
Mr Shen

683
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,680
won't fight with Zhao Mo anymore.

684
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,040
We passed.

685
00:35:59,080 --> 00:35:59,920
This dress

686
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,720
suits your body very well.

687
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,880
Your shoulders look flat.

688
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,360
And here.

689
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,480
there's a little special ribbon.

690
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,640
It'll look nice this way.

691
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,320
It's pretty

692
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,680
Wait a minute.

693
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,280
Boss.

694
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,160
Why are you here?

695
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,920
I have an appointment with the style editor this afternoon.

696
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,560
and talked about the interview.

697
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,560
and stopped by.

698
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,640
There are so many customers in a shop.

699
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,560
It's really good.

700
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,160
There's a discount. The sales will go up naturally.

701
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,240
How about

702
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,560
on the weekend?

703
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,480
It's better to empty the inventory.

704
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,160
Roger.

705
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,960
How's the new product?

706
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,320
We're talking about a lot.

707
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,160
Hurry up.

708
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,720
The most fearful thing in the retail store is out of stock.

709
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:41,960
Okay.

710
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:46,880
I want this one.

711
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,360
Sure, I'll wrap it up for you.

712
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:50,880
Okay.

713
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,120
I'm leaving.

714
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,240
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

715
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,840
It's okay. Go back and look after the store.

716
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,600
It's okay.

717
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,040
Good job. Keep it up.

718
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,640
I'm leaving. Bye.

719
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,480
Bye.

720
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,080
Look at you.

721
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,400
You didn't have lunch on time.

722
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,160
She even went there

723
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,040
to support her.

724
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,160
That's me.

725
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,960
I'm not jealous.

726
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,960
You know I'm so busy

727
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,160
to eat.

728
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,320
He even talked to me

729
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,480
He said he was sick.

730
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,560
and lied to me.

731
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,560
Come on, take the medicine.

732
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,680
I'm almost

733
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,920
a week soon.

734
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,160
I have to create a chance

735
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,240
to be alone.

736
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,360
When I think about going to the south,

737
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,480
to the south,

738
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,120
I...

739
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:59,200
The south region is not remote.

740
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,480
Besides,

741
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,400
I asked you to attend a new project mobilization meeting.

742
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,440
I'm not sending you to join the army.

743
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,160
A place without you.

744
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,360
That's a deserted planet.

745
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,720
Are you...

746
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,040
I'm really busy lately.

747
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,360
I don't have time to watch dramas.

748
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,560
I'm just being honest.

749
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,160
I mean

750
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,400
you haven't recovered from your cold.

751
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,240
Remember to take your medicine.

752
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,320
Tie it for me.

753
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,240
See if it's right.

754
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,320
I remember everything.

755
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,160
Ding Yike gave me the medicine.

756
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,480
Why are you bringing it up again?

757
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,080
Because she reminds me of

758
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,240
I was ten years ago.

759
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,080
many times

760
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,600
I lost everything in a flash.

761
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,120
But as long as I'm not dead,

762
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,400
I will find a way

763
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,200
to climb up the cliff again.

764
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,400
Don't worry.

765
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,200
This will never happen again.

766
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,720
I will try my best

767
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,440
to catch you.

768
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,680
Someone told me that before.

769
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,160
But then?

770
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,640
That's because they don't know you.

771
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,120
They only care about your appearance

772
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,200
and your talent.

773
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,640
I want to use you.

774
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,320
I'm different.

775
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,200
I like you

776
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,840
because I can see

777
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,360
in your heart.

778
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,840
She was holding a dagger tightly

779
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,600
and guarding the door.

780
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,240
and didn't want anyone to go in.

781
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,200
As for me,

782
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,400
I just want to persuade her

783
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,040
to put down the knife.

784
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,640
Tell her

785
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,160
I'll guard that door for her.

786
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,600
Let's go. I'll get you some clothes.

787
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,120
Are your luggage packed?

788
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,960
Yes, I've packed my underwear.

789
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,600
Charger. Charger.

790
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,880
Call me when you get there.

791
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,840
We'll keep in touch.

792
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,360
Mr Xu.

793
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,080
Thank you.

794
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,320
You rarely

795
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,480
come to the company recently.

796
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,320
I can rest assured with you guys in the company.

797
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,640
Sit.

798
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,640
Kobayashi, you did a good job recently.

799
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,880
Especially this time,

800
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,840
you're very brave.

801
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,560
No.

802
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,200
I just adjusted myself for a long time.

803
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,240
I just caught up with the company.

804
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,960
You're quite modest.

805
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,840
I heard you had a fight with Wenwen, right?

806
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,120
Her mother is very worried about her.

807
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,720
No, just a little conflict.

808
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,880
She's still mad at me.

809
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,400
But I've never stopped

810
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,160
every day.

811
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,080
She didn't answer any of them.

812
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,680
You have no choice if she doesn't answer the phone.

813
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,040
Use your brain.

814
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,960
Isn't Liu Bei always here?

815
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:56,480
Yes.

816
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,320
I was going to pick her up after work.

817
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,840
Send me the latest research report

818
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,920
to me.

819
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,480
What are you waiting for?

820
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,040
The company is still working.

821
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,720
The Hong Kong stock is on leave today.

822
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,080
I'll give you a day off. Go.

823
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,160
Thank you, uncle.

824
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:16,920
Go.

825
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,640
Sorry, no one agrees to Building 4 507.

826
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,160
We can't let you in.

827
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,320
Kylin, I'm here to see my girlfriend.

828
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,080
She's sick now.

829
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,920
and in a bad mood.

830
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,840
Please make an exception.

831
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,160
Sorry, sir, you can't go in.

832
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,720
You got it wrong.

833
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:10,080
Building 4, 507. It's been vacant for over two years.

834
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,640
No one lives here.

835
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:13,200
Impossible.

836
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,040
This is the place I took her back last time.

837
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,160
Building 4, 507. That's right.

838
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,200
Why would I lie to you?

839
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:19,640
Sir, come here.

840
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,480
Ask him if you don't believe me.

841
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,160
Two days ago,

842
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,240
I brought someone to Building 4 507 to check the room.

843
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,640
Yes, it's like this.

844
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,160
The owner gave them the keys.

845
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:29,880
Yes.

846
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:30,880
All right.

847
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,880
Go back.

848
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:34,880
Go back
