1
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,440
I think you should

2
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,320
call your old client

3
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,000
and ask them to come over to pay for you.

4
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,800
One order is enough.

5
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,880
Why are you looking at me?

6
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,280
Hurry up and call. It's too late.

7
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,919
Who said it's too late?

8
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,640
The number is 38010.

9
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,079
The price is 288. Bill, please.

10
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,720
Excuse me.

11
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,360
My current total sales

12
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,640
is back to 5044.

13
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:24,920
She's cheating.

14
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,400
Mr. Choi, is there a rule

15
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,440
that employees can't buy their own products?

16
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,079
No.

17
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,440
Do you hear me?

18
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,079
Sir, here.

19
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,400
Help me

20
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,000
These, these, these

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,760
all of these.

22
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,560
Are you crazy?

23
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,640
You're playing electric drill on Saturday.

24
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,079
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,240
Just a sign.

26
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,160
It'll be ready soon.

27
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,800
Another new shop?

28
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,680
Sa Hyun, are you there?

29
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,360
I forgot to tell you.

30
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,880
I have

31
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,960
apart from small and old,

32
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,760
there's another thing that's not cute.

33
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,200
It's not soundproof.

34
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,200
Anyway,

35
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,320
This will be my new home.

36
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,360
Come visit me when you're free.

37
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,520
Okay.

38
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,960
Okay, thank you.

39
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,600
You're welcome.

40
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,360
Thank you. See you.

41
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,600
Take care.

42
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,240
Waist, you've worked hard today.

43
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,720
Let me give you a massage.

44
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,480
Damn pickles.

45
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,000
I tried so hard.

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,159
You're going to die with that face?

47
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,440
Forget it.

48
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,640
Have some confidence.

49
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,600
He gave you a like the day before yesterday.

50
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,160
Whatever.

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,960
She is extremely intelligent and talented.

52
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,880
Ding Yike, Ding Yike.

53
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,159
I'm done.

54
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,080
Oh.

55
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,240
Let's go.

56
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,840
Let's go.

57
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,120
What are you doing so early?

58
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,440
Forget it.

59
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,680
This is the real world.

60
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,360
Get up.

61
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,240
Are you done?

62
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,040
I didn't call the card. Don't move.

63
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,960
Hurry up.

64
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,680
Darn it.

65
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,080
Is anyone there?

66
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,760
Open the door.

67
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,640
Hey! Hey!

68
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,120
Ma'am.

69
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
Can you turn off

70
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:58,960
on the balcony?

71
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,440
Who's responsible for ruining our art?

72
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,200
We don't have pipes.

73
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:02,680
Who are you?

74
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,000
Qian, are you ready?

75
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,080
I'm coming.

76
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,760
What are you doing?

77
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,840
I'll turn off the pipe.

78
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,120
No. Get out.

79
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,000
I'll call 110 if you keep doing this.

80
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,040
Go ahead.

81
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,320
What are you doing? Stop!

82
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,480
Why are you hanging the mop in the morning?

83
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,840
Hello?

84
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,200
Stop!

85
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,080
Are you crazy?

86
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,080
I wish you go bankrupt today.

87
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,160
Close the door tomorrow.

88
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,320
Who are you scolding? Come out!

89
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,560
I'll hit you.

90
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,400
That's enough.

91
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,679
How ugly it is to scold a woman.

92
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,559
Just scare her.

93
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,320
Are you crazy? So what if you're rich?

94
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,080
You'll be punished.

95
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,160
Come on, stand still.

96
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,440
Come on, get ready to take photos.

97
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,640
Let me count down.

98
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,200
Look here. Come on.

99
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,840
Three, two, one.

100
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,960
Open!

101
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
What happened?

102
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:29,960
What happened?

103
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,560
Bad luck.

104
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,960
Are you crazy? So what if you're rich?

105
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,640
You'll be punished.

106
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,960
I'm sorry.

107
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,320
We're opening a shop downstairs today.

108
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,680
Sorry to bother you.

109
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,040
This is a gift for you.

110
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,760
It's nothing.

111
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,120
I promise

112
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,040
before midnight, okay?

113
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:39,960
so that you can have a good nap.

114
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,600
Young man, you're so polite.

115
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,120
It's okay.

116
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,160
Look at you. It's my duty.

117
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,080
Such a handsome young man.

118
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,320
You're welcome. He's so nice.

119
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,120
Without you,

120
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,680
What are you doing?

121
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,760
Young lady,

122
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,440
You shouldn't do this.

123
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,480
We are neighbors from now on.

124
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,440
You should

125
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,080
should be broader.

126
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,160
What do you want?

127
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,880
Give her some chocolate.

128
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,240
What do you want?

129
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,120
I don't understand Chinese.

130
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,720
He's a foreigner.

131
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You and I need to be friendly.

132
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
We're family.

133
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,520
She's a foreigner, young man.

134
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,400
Let's leave her alone.

135
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,720
I asked you

136
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,320
if you have a boyfriend.

137
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,360
Not yet.

138
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,520
You're so handsome.

139
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,680
You sell your looks.

140
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,520
Let me introduce someone to you.

141
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,360
Sure.

142
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,320
Do you have a good candidate?

143
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,000
It must be the best.

144
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,760
Forget it.

145
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,960
Didn't you watch the live stream?

146
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,880
What?

147
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,560
It's over there.

148
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,040
I heard that even Eliwa Tang went there.

149
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,960
Really?

150
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,080
Where is she? Why didn't I see her?

151
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,600
Oh my god.

152
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,880
Are you okay?

153
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,840
Bad luck.

154
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,400
What happened next?

155
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,680
Then I apologized to him.

156
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,600
But he didn't listen.

157
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,360
The ceremony has to continue.

158
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,400
He left and I went upstairs.

159
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,200
That's it?

160
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,400
If only it's over.

161
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,120
You didn't see the way he looked at me

162
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,240
when he left.

163
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,080
Add some water.

164
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,440
It can turn red.

165
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,400
What should I do?

166
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
He will definitely take revenge on me.

167
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,520
I'll take revenge.

168
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,120
I think it's fate

169
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,440
to be hated by such a handsome man.

170
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,160
Are you sure?

171
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,360
Don't think too much.

172
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,480
Your Highness.

173
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,560
Today is your wedding day.

174
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,600
You must be happy.

175
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,960
Yes, Mr. Jiang.

176
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,080
You have to protect me from now on.

177
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,480
Please.

178
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,080
Please.

179
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,680
It's really funny.

180
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,680
Morning, boss.

181
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,680
Morning, boss.

182
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,720
You have a good taste.

183
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Boss, how about this?

184
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,880
Then I'll...

185
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:00,800
Hurry.

186
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,840
Then I'll put this T-shirt

187
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,880
Then I'll

188
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,160
T-shirt and garment line.

189
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,360
Why is she here?

190
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,960
Why is she back?

191
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,320
Yeah, she came back to work.

192
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,960
I heard that the city investigation report

193
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,680
Meeting.

194
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,400
It's her.

195
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,080
Meeting time.

196
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,960
How did you come back?

197
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,120
No way. So many people left.

198
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,280
Keep the change.

199
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,760
Those who are not here have been eliminated.

200
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,160
I hope you're not the next one.

201
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,680
For the past half month,

202
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,920
I've taught you a lot.

203
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,360
But unfortunately,

204
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,400
there are thousands of light years

205
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,760
to make me satisfied.

206
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,160
I've asked the headquarters

207
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,960
to send buyers here as soon as possible.

208
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,000
So among you,

209
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,520
I will only leave six of you.

210
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,360
Six.

211
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,920
But the good news is

212
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,400
those who are left behind

213
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,200
will get a 50% raise.

214
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,640
and a higher rank.

215
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,120
The Purchase Department before May

216
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,760
Except the purchase and product,

217
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,960
the only creative thing

218
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,640
is to work with the Design Department

219
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,840
with the Design Department.

220
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,320
But after I came,

221
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,120
buying hands

222
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,640
is the key to

223
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,200
and sales strategy.

224
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,520
If you want to live up to your expectations,

225
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,720
you have to show your strength.

226
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,760
Otherwise, the seniors in the company won't accept it.

227
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,200
Those who are eliminated will be unhappy.

228
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,080
I've sent you

229
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,840
I've sent it to your email.

230
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,760
After the meeting,

231
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,640
you choose your partner as soon as possible

232
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,440
and give you points during the project execution.

233
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,040
My team

234
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,360
will only leave the best ones.

235
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,480
Dismissed.

236
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,600
Boss is cultivating Gu.

237
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,680
Are you scared?

238
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:46,960
Yes.

239
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,600
I was afraid you would leave if I stayed.

240
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,440
No way.

241
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,560
What should I do?

242
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,960
I'm so stressed.

243
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,200
I have to think of a way.

244
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,880
Good luck. What else can I do?

245
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,200
Two.0 version.

246
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,280
What does she mean?

247
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,960
What's with that look?

248
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,880
I just feel very exciting.

249
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,119
It's like a spy movie.

250
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,280
Well, our market value in May

251
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,280
compared to a small country in Africa.

252
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,640
Can't I play 007?

253
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,480
Yes.

254
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,280
No.

255
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,120
I have to meet her.

256
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,320
You can't even knock?

257
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:42,720
Mr. Du,

258
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,200
Did you swallow your manners?

259
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,080
Director Lei,

260
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,560
When I just passed by the meeting room,

261
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,520
I heard that

262
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,120
What promotion plan? The 2.0 version.

263
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,000
What's going on?

264
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:54,840
Sign it.

265
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:04,960
Why didn't you discuss with me

266
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,120
Why didn't you discuss with me?

267
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,400
Then why don't you keep

268
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,200
for tomorrow's Qingming next year.

269
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:11,560
Mr. Du.

270
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,920
If your business school is not for nothing,

271
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,880
you should be able to read it.

272
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,680
Hey, Leo.

273
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,600
You're going to take the purchase rights from me, right? You're going to take it from me?

274
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,160
No problem.

275
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,960
If you want to do a promotion, empty your savings,

276
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,960
I'm all for it.

277
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,840
But you want these dealers

278
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,880
to cooperate with the sales?

279
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,520
It's absolutely impossible. Let me tell you.

280
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,720
But you can only agree.

281
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,200
Do you really think you are the queen?

282
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,520
You're always so arrogant.

283
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,320
The task assigned by headquarters

284
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,280
If you fail,

285
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,320
I'll die.

286
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,200
The quarter report is not good. The stock price is falling.

287
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,560
the Du family will lose money.

288
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,240
Fine.

289
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,480
Can we talk nicely?

290
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,880
Talk nicely, okay?

291
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,160
Don't be like Trump.

292
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,960
It's like a TV website in America.

293
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,680
I'm busy. I don't have time.

294
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,200
Please listen to me.

295
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,320
Okay? Just one word.

296
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,720
After our deep talk that night,

297
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
I definitely believe that we are from the same country.

298
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,920
I'm afraid you'll be bullied

299
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,840
you'll be bullied.

300
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,040
Your skills have improved.

301
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,160
Go on.

302
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
These dealers

303
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,320
have been working for May for more than ten years.

304
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
They are all stubborn.

305
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,000
If you keep pressing the task,

306
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,640
it won't work.

307
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,840
The higher-ups in the company

308
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,400
find something against you.

309
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,160
You're suddenly so kind.

310
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,440
I'm not used to it.

311
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,800
Director Lei

312
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,480
to our May.

313
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,680
I should return the favor, right?

314
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,840
After all, I have to take care of a girl.

315
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,000
A beauty like you

316
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,800
Beauty.

317
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,720
You deserve it.

318
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,960
You're quite bold today.

319
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,720
Ever since

320
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,280
I was hit by Director Lei,

321
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,120
I became cheerful.

322
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,040
Director Lei,

323
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,400
I advise you to be realistic.

324
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,440
Although you dress yourself

325
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,720
all day long,

326
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,920
But after all,

327
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,440
you can't go to the bathroom with me.

328
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,280
Think about the promotion plan and change it.

329
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,440
Even if we went to the bathroom together,

330
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,040
I'm the only one who can do it.

331
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,960
Sign it.

332
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,040
Get lost!

333
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,280
What are you looking at? Go back to work.

334
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,560
Mr. Du.

335
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,440
Why are you panicking?

336
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,680
You and Director Lei...

337
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,600
Who told you to install CCTV in her office?

338
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,240
No, you told me

339
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,520
except the bathroom,

340
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,600
except the bathroom

341
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,400
where Director Lei appeared?

342
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,280
I didn't ask you

343
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,280
in her office.

344
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,160
I'm not a pervert.

345
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,840
Cut the wire.

346
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,840
Even if we went to the bathroom together,

347
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,440
I'm the only one who can do it.

348
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,120
Tina.

349
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,560
How about we team up?

350
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,240
What do you think?

351
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,160
What do you think?

352
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,280
Do you want to team up with me?

353
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,240
Are you sure?

354
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,640
I just came back to the headquarters.

355
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,560
I'm not as good as you guys.

356
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,240
I'm sure.

357
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,320
Why me?

358
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,760
Isn't the reality show

359
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,440
is just a reality show.

360
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,920
And what you're best at

361
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,360
is to battle with others.

362
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,440
Let's work together to kill them.

363
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,040
Okay?

364
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,120
Of course.

365
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,560
Although I know

366
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,160
she looked down on me before,

367
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,720
But the workplace chicken soup also said

368
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,680
compared to friendship,

369
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,160
it's more believable

370
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,520
is more believable.

371
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,360
What are you doing? Let's go.

372
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,320
Coming.

373
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,440
Why are we here?

374
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,720
Boss changed the promotion plan of Wuyi.

375
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,080
to clear the inventory.

376
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,640
Let's pick the category first.

377
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,320
When we get the task,

378
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,400
Relax.

379
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,400
Pick out what's written on this.

380
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,040
Okay.

381
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,000
TSQ 321 black dress.

382
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,680
This one.

383
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,160
30 percent.

384
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,880
30% of lace combination.

385
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,760
Palace style.

386
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,360
To Daniel Use's classic style.

387
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,600
I think this one will sell well.

388
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,200
Sure.

389
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,360
You didn't miss much at the store.

390
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,680
But I'm not optimistic about this one.

391
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,280
The European version is too long.

392
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,400
According to the average height of Chinese girls,

393
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,640
I can't hold it

394
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,840
Next DC

395
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,680
Tina

396
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,200
Since we are a team,

397
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,440
please respect my opinion.

398
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,080
Okay?

399
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,360
Even if we are in the same team,

400
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,880
we can share different jobs.

401
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,560
You have a good relationship with the boss.

402
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,800
You're quite familiar with the store.

403
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,120
From now on,

404
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
in these aspects.

405
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,080
But...

406
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,920
[I'm here in May.] [I'm in Huanya.]

407
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,640
I've been a fashion buyer

408
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,640
for three years.

409
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,360
It's not only about experience.

410
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,800
but also the spirit and taste.

411
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,160
Since you are so confident,

412
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,400
prove it to me.

413
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,240
If you like this sample

414
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,680
at the order meeting,

415
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,080
How will you persuade the designer

416
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,080
and develop it?

417
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,720
A flat skirt.

418
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,440
It's the European and American casual style.

419
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,640
It suits our customers very well.

420
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,880
And this color

421
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,200
is also the main color

422
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,840
of Anna Summer next year.

423
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,800
Read after me. It's Anna Sui.

424
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,360
Don't follow the sound.

425
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,760
Read it as Anna Su, OK?

426
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,800
Go on.

427
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,520
The word O is very cute.

428
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,920
Oh my darling

429
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,000
This isn't "O".

430
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,680
It's supposed to be A.

431
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,000
I can see that you memorized a lot of information.

432
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,280
But these have nothing to do

433
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,680
have nothing to do with it.

434
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,600
Coco.

435
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,280
I'm not trying to deny your efforts.

436
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,360
But there are things

437
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,320
is useless.

438
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,400
A team with leadership

439
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,480
is more competitive.

440
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,400
I don't want internal consumption.

441
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,400
Let's focus on fighting the public, okay?

442
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,520
Okay.

443
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,720
No way.

444
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,080
Okay, thank you.

445
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:25,840
What?

446
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,280
He asked us to talk about

447
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,680
with the sales manager?

448
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,080
This is the financial work.

449
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,000
Yes.

450
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,640
You are lucky.

451
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,440
Do you think we do sales?

452
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,160
Remember to take your medicine and drink more water.

453
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,000
Where are thousands of sets of data?

454
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,320
But boss said

455
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,760
buyers don't only buy but also sell.

456
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,640
We have to take full responsibility

457
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,680
of the company.

458
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,920
If the promotion is not good,

459
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,280
I guess

460
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,600
will be our team.

461
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,880
Come on.

462
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:04,880
Sure.

463
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,120
What mission did you receive?

464
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,760
Delivering goods to the franchise store.

465
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,760
to brainwash them and complete the mission.

466
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,160
So many?

467
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,080
Yes.

468
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,560
And I have to make

469
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,480
the whole promotion plan.

470
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,960
Can you handle it?

471
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,480
I have to.

472
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,560
I'm the future gold buyer.

473
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:35,760
Here, I'll give you a gold medal in advance.

474
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,920
The weather has changed so fast lately.

475
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,080
It's easy to catch a cold.

476
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,880
Don't be like me. It's painful.

477
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,560
You take this medicine too?

478
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,360
Everyone takes this medicine.

479
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,840
I used to...

480
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,840
Never mind.

481
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,600
Let bygones be bygones.

482
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,160
Work hard.

483
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,760
Come on!

484
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,000
Look at what you did.

485
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,920
You humiliated me.

486
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:11,240
That’s not the first time.

487
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,160
You always think I'm useless.

488
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,560
If you can't, hurry up and have another child.

489
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,120
I know a lot of pretty girls.

490
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,120
I also have high education. Do you want it?

491
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,400
Stop talking nonsense.

492
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,360
Hurry up.

493
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,160
Close your stupid clothing store.

494
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,000
Shanghai is a big gold place.

495
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,720
in such a big city.

496
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,960
You're really interesting.

497
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,400
It's not easy for you to make money.

498
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,240
My money comes from the wind.

499
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,680
But millions

500
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,320
to embarrass yourself here.

501
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:37,680
Is it worth it?

502
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,120
What can I do?

503
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:40,720
Besides,

504
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,280
this is called marketing.

505
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:44,640
You don't understand. This is a scandal hype.

506
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,440
to increase the exposure of my shop.

507
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
No, I don't understand.

508
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,840
I paid you to study abroad.

509
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,480
So you're here to sell clothes?

510
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,440
Should I sell electronic parts with you?

511
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,440
What's wrong with electronic parts?

512
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,080
If I hadn't...

513
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,320
If you hadn't been

514
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,760
selling drumsticks in the market,

515
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,720
I can't stand in front of you

516
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,760
in front of you.

517
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:10,280
OK.

518
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,240
You've said it many times.

519
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,000
Can you change to something new?

520
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,680
Zhao Moyuan.

521
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,120
You've grown up, right?

522
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,880
You've grown up.

523
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,120
You don't need me anymore.

524
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,680
Is this fun?

525
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,120
The apartment you live in

526
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,520
is under the company's name.

527
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,440
Since you don't want to go back,

528
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,960
please

529
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,520
Move out.

530
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,880
Okay.

531
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
Can you live here?

532
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,480
Why not?

533
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,120
There are ghosts living upstairs.

534
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,680
Besides,

535
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,240
when I studied abroad,

536
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,280
I lived more shabby than here.

537
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,680
Look at you.

538
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,920
It's not like that

539
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,320
It's not like that.

540
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,360
He did it for your own good.

541
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,200
My dad

542
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,240
is that

543
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,560
I'm too control.

544
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,560
In the past, I didn't want to study abroad.

545
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,800
He insisted on sending me out.

546
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,120
After I learned it,

547
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,400
he still doesn't like me.

548
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,640
He thinks

549
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,480
design clothes

550
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,120
It doesn't match his.

551
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,120
Right?

552
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,280
Now that I've opened a shop,

553
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,560
he still thinks I'm a disgrace.

554
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
I've thought it through.

555
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,000
If one day

556
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,440
I could really fly to space.

557
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,880
He's afraid that I'll take too much steps in space.

558
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,360
He's afraid I'll break it. Do you believe me?

559
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,880
This shop just opened.

560
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,440
It will take a few days

561
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,120
it'll take a few days, so...

562
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,400
I'll keep an eye on him until then.

563
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,480
What else can I do?

564
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,760
Okay, just make do with it for a while.

565
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,280
I brought you this.

566
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,160
The environment is tough. Take good care of yourself.

567
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,960
Okay, you do it. I'm going down.

568
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,440
Okay.

569
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,160
I've sent you the data.

570
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:34,960
Come on.

571
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,240
You're done.

572
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,640
Okay, bye.

573
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,560
I have a question.

574
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,240
I can't figure it out.

575
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,360
We are both humans.

576
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,200
Why can some people

577
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,480
always hand in the paper in advance easily?

578
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,480
And every time after the exam,

579
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,520
after the exam.

580
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,960
It's like peeling a layer of skin.

581
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,240
Am I really worse than others?

582
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,560
Will my hard work the day after tomorrow

583
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,240
can never catch up with the innate advantage?

584
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,360
I've prepared everything

585
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,640
My family has already prepared it.

586
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,040
A house and a car.

587
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,880
If you compete with outsiders like me,

588
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,480
you may never

589
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,120
lack confidence.

590
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,440
If they take a step back, it's a big world.

591
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,040
As for me,

592
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,560
If I take a step back,

593
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,920
will be smashed into pieces.

594
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,760
Why is fate so unfair?

595
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,840
I've contacted the major websites.

596
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,400
I deleted all the videos I could delete.

597
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,720
I'm afraid someone might screen it.

598
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,120
I told you not to let me touch it again.

599
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,720
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it yesterday.

600
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,320
What's the point of apologizing?

601
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,080
Let's go.

602
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,200
I'm annoyed when I see her.

603
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,760
You can't let her go.

604
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,960
My principle is not to mess with women.

605
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,640
That's it.

606
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,160
Go back and write

607
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,080
in May.

608
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,320
Yes.

609
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,600
She can't run away even if May is unlucky.

610
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,920
What are you doing?

611
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,840
What are you doing to my company?

612
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,920
What are you doing?

613
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,239
What are you doing?

614
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,800
I won't tell you. I won't tell you.

615
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,679
I won't tell you.

616
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,800
Open the door!

617
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,480
What do you want?

618
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,639
Come at me!

619
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:56,840
How dare you

620
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,160
to my company?

621
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,040
Open the door!

622
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,800
Open the door!

623
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,600
Don't send me anything again.

624
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,040
Wenwen doesn't like me drinking coffee.

625
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,200
Who is it in the middle of the night?

626
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,440
Why are you playing music?

627
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,800
Despicable.

628
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,520
Open the door.

629
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,480
Don't knock. You're going to confront him.

630
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,880
He'll come to you later.

631
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,160
Can you defeat him?

632
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,560
I'm waiting for him.

633
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,120
to apologize to him sincerely.

634
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,560
You always play dirty tricks.

635
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:11,600
If he dares to come,

636
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,760
I'll take a photo of him right away

637
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,680
and post it online.

638
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,960
and let him see it again.

639
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,240
He's here. I'm going to open the door.

640
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,600
Ding Yike, calm down.

641
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,480
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

642
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,040
Are you crying?

643
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,040
How dare you dodge?

644
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,560
I'm sorry.

645
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,760
How dare you dodge me!

646
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,760
I'll teach you a lesson today.

647
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,120
What are you doing, buddy?

648
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,040
It's none of your business.

649
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,680
Believe it or not, I'll beat you too.

650
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
Are you sober now?

651
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,400
Yes.

652
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,520
Let go. Let go.

653
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,120
Let me tell you.

654
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,880
This girl is really annoying.

655
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,920
She needs to be punished.

656
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,560
But

657
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,920
you're a man.

658
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,920
hit a woman.

659
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,880
Does it look bad?

660
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,360
If you have a problem with her,

661
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,560
you can throw durian

662
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,000
on her.

663
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,680
After eating the soup of instant noodles,

664
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,720
you can pour it

665
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,040
into the door, right?

666
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,840
Yes

667
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,560
Right?

668
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,840
Yes.

669
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,680
Wait. I'll deal with you later.

670
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,600
What did you say?

671
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,800
Come back!

672
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,280
Will you come back?

673
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,320
No, no.

674
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,080
Let's go.

675
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:30,680
Hello? Hello?

676
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:32,840
You...

677
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
Stay away from me.

678
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,920
Understand?

679
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:49,800
This time,

680
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,480
please help us

681
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,640
Please help us.

682
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,080
Because this activity

683
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:54,840
is very important.

684
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,920
Our headquarters also attaches great importance to it.

685
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,200
We will provide you

686
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,480
to you.

687
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,080
If you have any requests,

688
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,520
any request.

689
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,920
We can discuss it together.

690
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,800
These above

691
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,360
are the introductions I made for you.

692
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,120
I know it's not easy

693
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,240
to complete these indicators.

694
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,280
But don't worry.

695
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,360
I will do my best to help you.

696
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,320
Don't worry.

697
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,160
The mission of a beauty

698
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,640
We have to

699
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,760
to finish it.

700
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,800
Yes

701
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,680
Please.

702
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,560
It's your turn.

703
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,480
Good morning.

704
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,240
Now let me introduce

705
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,440
the specific requirements of this promotion plan.

706
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,200
Besides

707
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,240
100 minus 30,

708
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,560
please do it.

709
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,280
the VIP feedback of the store.

710
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,400
Please

711
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,560
in the way of phone promotion.

712
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,920
one by one.

713
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,840
What is a VIP of the store?

714
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,920
The VIP of the store is

715
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,400
the top ten customers.

716
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,680
No, the top 100 customers.

717
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,400
There's no record.

718
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,320
How do we know

719
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,320
who is the top 100 sales?

720
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:16,840
Yeah, yeah.

721
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,760
Right?

722
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,200
The company resource program system

723
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:19,960
It's all in there.

724
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,200
This system can't be used at all.

725
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,000
We've talked to your technical department

726
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,400
for almost a year.

727
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,480
I couldn't fix it.

728
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,560
It makes our shop

729
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,120
fill out the report with hands every day.

730
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,040
Am I right?

731
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:35,320
That's right.

732
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,480
It's not like that.

733
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,440
Actually, this square...

734
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,800
We're exhausted every day.

735
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:40,960
No, no.

736
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,160
You all misunderstood.

737
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,280
It's not like that.

738
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,720
Please be quiet.

739
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,680
Listen to me.

740
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:46,960
First,

741
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,560
these data statistics

742
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,080
are actually about buying hands.

743
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,400
We don't need to trouble you.

744
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,000
What Ms Ding said just now

745
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
is to help everyone

746
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,040
to build a concept.

747
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,120
Second,

748
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,120
The theme of today's mobilization meeting is interaction.

749
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,040
If you have any opinion,

750
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,240
you can discuss it.

751
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,560
The plan can be modified.

752
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,760
Isn't that good?

753
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,120
Miss Zhou is smart.

754
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:08,600
Some people

755
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,800
are only doing sales for half a month.

756
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,360
and you want to tell us what to do?

757
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:12,960
This is...

758
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:13,920
Oh.
