1
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,880
It's like this, understand?

2
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,960
It's all right angle.

3
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,040
So

4
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,200
Because it's wide.

5
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,600
When you show it, you need to do it sideways.

6
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,400
Hey.

7
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,680
You're distracted.

8
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,920
No.

9
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,680
You were distracted.

10
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,760
No, I remember everything.

11
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,040
There's another question.

12
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,560
I don't understand.

13
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,400
Why are all your designers

14
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,640
are all exaggerated?

15
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,120
Those on the show

16
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,640
men's skirts and pants

17
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,560
Female models wear big cloaks

18
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,400
Who can wear it in real life?

19
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,840
Let me answer this question.

20
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,760
In real life,

21
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,760
who would drink wine with petals?

22
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,000
So the costumes on the show

23
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,200
are actually tools and means.

24
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,280
Designers need to express their designs

25
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,480
in the shortest time.

26
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,400
and leave a deep impression

27
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,640
to the audience.

28
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
So many shows

29
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,400
are not for ordinary people.

30
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,560
It's just a kind of concentration

31
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,360
many marketing styles.

32
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,120
Understand?

33
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,200
So you mean

34
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,920
to seize the popularity

35
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,280
of men's fashion week.

36
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,840
are the most exaggerated

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,000
the most obvious part.

38
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
That's right.

39
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,400
I see.

40
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,640
That's the lantern sleeve.

41
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,200
The flowers are thick stripes.

42
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
Am I right?

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,920
There's no right or wrong about fashion.

44
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
Right or not,

45
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,400
to the market.

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,480
I can only teach you

47
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,640
how to choose. What is the method?

48
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,280
What does it mean?

49
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,120
We'll be together in the future.

50
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,760
Do you have to say that?

51
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:56,920
Miss,

52
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,200
What you just summarized is very right.

53
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,640
You're almost there.

54
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,120
Which elements do you want to add?

55
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,400
to make clothes.

56
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,040
Yes, so, Prince Charming,

57
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,040
For example, Prince Charming.

58
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,280
his favorite shoulders and wrinkles.

59
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,280
The ordinary fabric

60
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,360
can’t be made.

61
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,000
You are fast-selling garments in May.

62
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,760
with cheap fabric.

63
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,920
It's useless to learn

64
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,000
The shoulder line, right?

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,040
Is it this kind of wrinkle

66
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,760
The shoulder line is here.

67
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,280
Nice handling

68
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,920
Right?

69
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,960
My eyes don't feel well today.

70
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,560
There seems to be sand in my eyes.

71
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,920
Nothing.

72
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,200
Do you have eye drops?

73
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,040
How dare you joke about me?

74
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,680
How dare you?

75
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,520
I'll let you taste my love, okay?

76
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,800
I'll provide you with love.

77
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,040
Love supplies

78
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,240
That's fine.

79
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,520
Auntie.

80
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,120
You don't deserve my son.

81
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,520
Girls shouldn't be so despicable.

82
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,200
I won't allow you to be together.

83
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,840
Aunt, don't say that.

84
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,400
I really love your son.

85
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,400
Please help us.

86
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,080
No matter what you say,

87
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,560
I won't let you go.

88
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,760
You can hear me from so far away.

89
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Please.

90
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,200
At 8 p.m.,

91
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,240
in the 8 o'clock show, okay?

92
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,680
How did you deal with

93
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,080
deal with these vulgar mothers?

94
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
Prince charming.

95
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,040
I found it strange

96
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,360
I found it very strange.

97
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,120
You take care of her for no reason.

98
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,280
Is it because she looks like...

99
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,640
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,080
You and Sa Hyun

101
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,640
with Sa Hyun recently.

102
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
That video

103
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,520
I came here

104
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,680
when watching the video.

105
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,960
Ding,

106
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,080
I'm an open-minded mother.

107
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,960
You need to get back together with Sa Hyun.

108
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,400
I understand.

109
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,760
Young people

110
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,560
It's normal to be a little enthusiastic.

111
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,680
But after that,

112
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,080
Auntie.

113
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,920
I've been dating Sa Hyun for seven years.

114
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,280
I'm not being impulsive.

115
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,240
I know you think I'm not a local.

116
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,520
I don't have a house in Shanghai.

117
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,640
But my residential permit

118
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,520
for three or four years.

119
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,560
I can transfer the money in a few years.

120
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,800
I'm working well now.

121
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,080
And Sa Hyun loves me too.

122
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,560
I taught Sa Hyun since young.

123
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,120
Don't look at the process.

124
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,120
It depends on the result.

125
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,080
You can be together.

126
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,640
But let me tell you,

127
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,960
I will never accept it.

128
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,080
You can be happy

129
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,680
without their blessing.

130
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,680
You don't know, do you?

131
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,360
The house he's living in

132
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,480
It's still my name on the property certificate.

133
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,200
Even if you don't want anything,

134
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,200
With your little salary,

135
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,960
when can you

136
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,280
afford the down payment?

137
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,520
Besides, if you have a child in the future,

138
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,080
who will help you?

139
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,080
We are...

140
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,800
If you really love Si Xian,

141
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,960
why can't you

142
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,480
love more selfless?

143
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,520
You should let go

144
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,480
and let him find a new life.

145
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,640
Ding, I'm not blaming you.

146
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,800
You're not young anymore.

147
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,800
Why are you still so naive?

148
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,920
We can change the household register.

149
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,680
But...

150
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,520
Can you change the 31010

151
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,920
Can you change it?

152
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,560
You really trust yourself.

153
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,520
As long as you work hard,

154
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,400
Sa Hyun will love you again.

155
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,680
My son.

156
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,240
I'm not a fool.

157
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,800
Go help her.

158
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,680
Let's get this over with. Hurry up.

159
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,680
Who do you think you are?

160
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,960
Who do you think you are?

161
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,760
How dare you bully my sister?

162
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
That's too much.

163
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,800
Stop it.

164
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Why can't I?

165
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,520
My son cheated on me because he was poor.

166
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,480
I'm proud of being a mother.

167
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,920
Why?

168
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,080
Is your son that good?

169
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,360
Listen, my sister

170
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,800
is his body.

171
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,200
Can't you just kick him after one or two years?

172
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,240
Grandma.

173
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,080
Look at this.

174
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,080
What are you making?

175
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,520
messy friends.

176
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,680
Okay.

177
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,360
When you want to cry,

178
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,120
look up at the sky.

179
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,560
That way, even if you have tears,

180
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,960
even if you have tears.

181
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,799
Thank you.

182
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,000
You're welcome.

183
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,240
I'm just a dog.

184
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,800
Today you and Xu Fei

185
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,120
taught me so hard today.

186
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,120
I don't understand much.

187
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,800
Tell me, no matter how hard I try,

188
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,920
no matter how hard I try?

189
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,360
Am I not suitable for this industry?

190
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,680
I beg you. Tell me the truth.

191
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,320
To be honest, yes.

192
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,040
In fact, fashion is not about

193
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,920
Just work hard.

194
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,440
depends on luck and inspiration.

195
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,040
The first day I taught Xu Fei,

196
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,160
he knew my shoulder line

197
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,600
between my shoulders and decoration art style.

198
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,680
I've taught you for so long,

199
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,720
but you still don't understand.

200
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,920
Why are they both white?

201
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,120
There's a difference between cold and warm.

202
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,880
If you want to say you work hard,

203
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
the tailors from Dong Ka Wah

204
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
can get up at 4:30 to tailor.

205
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,920
But they are very likely

206
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,120
is very likely

207
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,120
the starting point

208
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,560
The starting point of a kid who doesn't study.

209
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,440
That's all.

210
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,800
What do you think I should do?

211
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,600
What should I learn?

212
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,160
You still don't understand?

213
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,880
You don't learn fashion because of passion.

214
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,120
You just take it

215
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,880
a tool for love competition.

216
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,040
If you don't have

217
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,680
your passion and passion,

218
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,320
you will never open

219
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,480
the door of fashion.

220
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,800
I don't believe it.

221
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,360
Is passion

222
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,920
passion?

223
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,560
Is persistence

224
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,800
can't be another kind of passion.

225
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,120
I don't believe Tina and the others

226
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,480
love fashion more than I do.

227
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,320
I don't believe

228
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,360
You can sentence me to death

229
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,040
by your own judgment.

230
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,800
What do you want to do?

231
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,680
Tell me.

232
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,920
Aren't you going on a business trip this week?

233
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,320
Take me there.

234
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,480
Give me two days.

235
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,320
Let me see how the real buyer

236
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,320
how a real buyer works.

237
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,720
Let me learn it one last time.

238
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
If I still don't get it these two days,

239
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,120
I'll give up on being a fashion star.

240
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,720
Otherwise, I'll never be satisfied.

241
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,360
Go get a visa.

242
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,560
I've only been abroad once in my life.

243
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,240
It's still a tourist island. Will it work?

244
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,120
You're lucky.

245
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,120
Once you go to Huan Ya,

246
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,040
you'll be exempt from signing there.

247
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,680
for 15 days.

248
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,360
This is a new policy.

249
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,800
The plane only takes two or three hours.

250
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,560
Great.

251
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,040
We can have lunch

252
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,800
at the city center.

253
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,720
Dream on.

254
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,440
Take a look at this schedule.

255
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,160
There are two different brands

256
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,320
in Central Plaza this afternoon.

257
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,440
There will be a small party after the meeting.

258
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,480
There are two exhibition hall tomorrow morning.

259
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,000
and then return to Shanghai

260
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,680
before 5 p.m.

261
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,120
I have an interview with my character.

262
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,800
You've done so many things in such a short time.

263
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,800
in such a short time?

264
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,800
Welcome to the real world of buyers.

265
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,360
Okay, I like it.

266
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,360
It's just a plane.

267
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,720
Why are you wearing high heels?

268
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,920
Business trip.

269
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,160
Can we go now?

270
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,720
Sure, let's go.

271
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:21,920
Where are you going?

272
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,320
Let's go.

273
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,800
That's China.

274
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,720
Sit.

275
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,800
You know someone?

276
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,920
No, they just look alike.

277
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,720
I thought I was mistaken. It's really you.

278
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,000
What?

279
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,320
It's been a few months.

280
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,720
I'm in economy class.

281
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,800
Zhao Moyuan.

282
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,800
Are you talking to me?

283
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,120
Are you playing dumb?

284
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:47,920
Sir.

285
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,160
Your zipper is loose.

286
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,800
I mean the zipper here.

287
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,360
The gate of the plane is closing.

288
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,120
Sir,

289
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,040
Please return to your seat as soon as possible. Thank you.

290
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,560
Thank you.

291
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,240
We're friends.

292
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,680
You didn't let anyone bully me yesterday.

293
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,000
I can't

294
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,120
let others bully you.

295
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,160
Him?

296
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,440
Why are you laughing?

297
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,600
Nothing.

298
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,040
You must be thinking

299
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,600
in your mind.

300
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,240
or an awful scene.

301
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,120
Right?

302
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,120
He didn't bully you.

303
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,800
You must have bullied him.

304
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,720
It's like you hate him for love.

305
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,360
That face.

306
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,360
That's what the novels say.

307
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,800
Sleep for ten minutes.

308
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,440
Get up to class after parallel flight.

309
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,920
My name is Kiki.

310
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,800
I'm 23 years old.

311
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,800
I'm 1.63 meters tall.

312
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,120
I graduated from London, England.

313
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
I majored in finance.

314
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,120
I like traveling, reading,

315
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,320
and small animals.

316
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,120
Do you like small animals?

317
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,040
I don't like hairy animals.

318
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,680
Sorry, I have an important WeChat.

319
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,240
I like Hitchcock. What about you?

320
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,240
Is it your cat?

321
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,920
It's a person. It's a director.

322
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,680
The phone is ringing.

323
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,720
Sorry, I have to take this call.

324
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,560
I have to go. I'm on a blind date.

325
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,440
I'll call you later.

326
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,160
You're having coffee with someone behind my back.

327
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
Thank you so much.

328
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,440
Let's clear up

329
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,200
of the Purchase Department.

330
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,440
We're friends.

331
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,720
between friends.

332
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,200
I don't like

333
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,320
and work.

334
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,040
This friend is not that friend.

335
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,080
I'm one year younger than you.

336
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,120
So I'm a kid.

337
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,480
Just kidding.

338
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,840
I've never seen you in casual clothes.

339
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,560
So you come out on weekends too.

340
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,240
Shopping?

341
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:43,800
Mr. Du,

342
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,600
Do you think market collecting is a game?

343
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
It seems that your boss

344
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,560
you won't enter other women's boutique

345
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,320
besides buying clothes with your girlfriend.

346
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,320
Who said that?

347
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,080
I went shopping with my mom.

348
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,720
I think this one is nice.

349
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,080
It suits you very well.

350
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:05,920
Look.

351
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,600
Instead of caring about me,

352
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,200
instead of caring about me.

353
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,600
It's 1501 downstairs. Turn left downstairs.

354
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,200
I'm not going.

355
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,440
I want to learn from you

356
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,200
how to do market survey for competitors.

357
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,440
You weren't so mysterious last time.

358
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,800
What trick did you learn

359
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,720
in Moments?

360
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:27,960
I'm not

361
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,440
who just walked out of the school.

362
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,080
Your third-rate movies

363
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,360
are invalid to me.

364
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,120
And I don't know why

365
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,120
why you keep pestering me.

366
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:36,840
But let me tell you,

367
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,200
Don't get in my way.

368
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,480
I'm interested in you.

369
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,680
I'm curious.

370
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,960
why you are so devoted to

371
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,080
to turn Oh-wol into a handmade?

372
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,920
He even went against

373
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,360
against all the elderly in the company.

374
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,200
Why are you working so hard

375
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,960
so passionately?

376
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,240
I've seen many workaholics.

377
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:57,960
For example, my dad.

378
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
He works so hard

379
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,800
because Oh-wol belongs to him.

380
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,840
He had no choice.

381
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
And you?

382
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,040
As a professional manager,

383
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,440
even if Lingyun Headquarters has demands for you,

384
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,040
you wouldn't have wasted your time

385
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,600
to work on the weekend.

386
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,960
Unless...

387
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,720
Unless you have an ulterior motive.

388
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,600
I was right.

389
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,320
Are you trying to

390
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,200
to achieve your goal?

391
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,080
Then I have to keep an eye on you.

392
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,320
After all,

393
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,480
May is the Du family’s business.

394
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,480
I don’t want

395
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,680
the Du family's business

396
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,960
being used by others.

397
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,440
You should be honored.

398
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,800
At least you have the right to be used by me.

399
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,600
I also

400
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,440
I also told others.

401
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,200
Mr. Du,

402
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:48,920
Do you really think

403
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,720
I was sent to May?

404
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,120
There are so many invitations outside.

405
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,960
Any brand

406
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,120
can kill May in a second.

407
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
I came here

408
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,320
to this stinky workshop

409
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,240
because you see the market in May

410
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,720
in May.

411
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,800
Zhou Bai’an hurt me in reputation.

412
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,200
I’ll defeat him in business.

413
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,360
That's my goal.

414
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,680
So you have two choices now.

415
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,840
or go back to the old road.

416
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
and your old ministers.

417
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
and your old ministers.

418
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,840
or be my gun.

419
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,800
and come with me.

420
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,680
Within two years,

421
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,080
I'll give you a new May.

422
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,080
Which one do you choose?

423
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,480
Pay for these.

424
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,960
Send them to the Design Department on Monday.

425
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,200
Bill, please.

426
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,320
Tell me.

427
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,840
In your training,

428
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,560
did anyone tell you

429
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,600
the categories of buyers?

430
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
Three categories.

431
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,120
The most traditional one is like Diamond Tai.

432
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,440
who gathered all brands

433
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,840
from all brands.

434
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,680
All the products sold by the company

435
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,960
needs buyers to choose and purchase.

436
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,960
and face all consumers.

437
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,480
But I have a question.

438
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,600
I don't understand.

439
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,080
A department store like Diamond Department Store

440
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,600
is different from

441
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,680
What's the difference between them?

442
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,440
A department store in Europe

443
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,560
are mostly handmade.

444
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,720
The mall directly orders from brands

445
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,200
and retail operation.

446
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,960
and be responsible for the stock and sales rate.

447
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,360
It's more like a salesman.

448
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,480
On the other hand,

449
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,960
the second landlord

450
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,320
earns money by renting stores and dividing.

451
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,480
So they don't care about

452
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,840
whether the brand's sales performance is good.

453
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,720
And my distance

454
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,680
is a typical product buyer.

455
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,840
Small and expensive.

456
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,480
Designers usually don't exceed two.

457
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,680
Usually, they are bosses

458
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,920
or designers.

459
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,720
the inventory won't exceed 200.

460
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
In this case,

461
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,320
our depth is far more than wide.

462
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,680
And we only target

463
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,840
who can consume.

464
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,600
To put it bluntly,

465
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,200
if there are any nice clothes outside.

466
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:57,920
Beautiful designs

467
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,720
and buy it back.

468
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,920
I'll make a difference.

469
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,960
I sell my taste and context.

470
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
But...

471
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,440
There are only a few pieces of each dress.

472
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,240
It's so convenient to buy online now.

473
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,320
How can you guarantee

474
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,200
customers won't buy brands

475
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,720
if they try them on the Internet?

476
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,200
Will you choose vegetables

477
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,440
in the supermarket

478
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,960
and then go to the farm market?

479
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,600
You should know

480
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,240
we can survive

481
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,440
not because of the comprehensive market.

482
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,320
and a low price.

483
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,040
They can provide specific clients

484
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,600
for specific customers.

485
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,240
in other places.

486
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,440
Including shopping experience.

487
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,600
Miss, I'm not saying this.

488
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,600
you look so good in these clothes.

489
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,320
It's like

490
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,080
a luxurious sense.

491
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,080
and indifferent.

492
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,920
If it weren't for me,

493
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,200
I would have fallen in love with you.

494
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,320
I'm a designer.

495
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,960
So I know how you feel.

496
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,920
It's a contrast

497
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,600
are contrast.

498
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,440
So many famous designers

499
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,360
keep some

500
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,080
they tend to keep

501
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,720
a sense of mystery.

502
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,320
The best way is to compromise

503
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,720
Choose some specific limited editions

504
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,120
to work with the best buyers.

505
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,320
and only work with the best buyers.

506
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,320
What about

507
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,960
like me?

508
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,440
Are you looking down on the bottom of the chain?

509
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,720
Don't belittle yourself.

510
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,200
If you look at them now,

511
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,680
all these brands.

512
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,960
Have you ever thought about this?

513
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,200
Why are these brands

514
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,320
Why are they only selling these

515
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:25,960
instead of selling other goods?

516
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
In fact, every brand

517
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,800
its designers

518
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,840
design many different styles every year.

519
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,120
What are they selling?

520
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,480
depends on the buyer.

521
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,200
As for the market,

522
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,960
and consumers,

523
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,600
the brand

524
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,120
to decide.

525
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
In other words,

526
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,440
our buyers

527
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,800
the whole fashion market.

528
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,920
It's not too much.

529
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,720
How is it? Do you know more now?

530
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,080
How is it? Do you know more now?

531
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,960
Don't look at me like that.

532
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,360
I know I know a lot,

533
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,840
but I'll teach you slowly.

534
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,960
I'm thinking

535
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,040
when can I

536
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,680
be half as professional as you?

537
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,600
Work hard.

538
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,600
When you've learned enough, you can do it.

539
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,600
Am I

540
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,920
a lot now?

541
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,200
Only kids keep emphasizing

542
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,240
he has grown up.

543
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,040
What kid?

544
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,960
You're not much older than me.

545
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,920
You watched TV, right?

546
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,320
Yes.

547
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
On TV

548
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,720
all the juniors

549
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,720
when talking to elders.

550
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,440
You should call me teacher.

551
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,080
Even if you don't call me teacher,

552
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,440
you should call me brother.

553
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,440
Got it?

554
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,440
Okay, brother.

555
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,240
With your skills,

556
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,080
don't come out and make me sick.

557
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,200
Go.

558
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,080
Okay.

559
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:57,960
Shut up!

560
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,440
This is much more fashionable than going to a tourist island.

561
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,200
Let's go.

562
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,600
Come on.

563
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,480
Come on.

564
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,680
Give me the billboard.

565
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,240
Take a picture.

566
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,200
Take a photo. What's there to take?

567
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,440
Take a photo.

568
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,960
as a souvenir.

569
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:49,960
Come on.

570
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,960
Three, two, one. Cut.

571
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,600
So fast. Are you done?

572
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,680
Let's go.

573
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,080
Let me take a photo for you.

574
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,320
Is this the way to the airport?

575
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,600
The weather is so nice here.

576
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,200
I thought I wore too much.

577
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,720
Look

578
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,440
You're quite stylish.

579
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,840
Zhao Moyuan. Zhao Moyuan.

580
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,600
Zhao Moyuan. Zhao Moyuan.

581
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,720
Hello, Zhao Moyuan.

582
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,800
Where have you been?

583
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,600
Why aren't you getting in?

584
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,720
Where did you go? You scared me.

585
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,120
It's my first time abroad.

586
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,200
I was in the car.

587
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,080
You don't look at me.

588
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,960
This is my first time abroad.

589
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,840
I don't know where you went.

590
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,320
I'm sorry.

591
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,320
Put me down.

592
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,320
Let's go to

593
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,800
the show of Pusi Barton, right?

594
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,320
No, let's go to the moon.

595
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,120
Don't waste your energy.

596
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,440
Look at you.

597
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,960
no photographer

598
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,320
is willing to waste their savings.

599
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,840
You want to say that, right?

600
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Even if there's only one in ten thousand,

601
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,120
to be on camera,

602
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,080
I, Ding Yike, will also

603
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,480
No, no, no.

604
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,040
It's not your fault.

605
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,600
It's not your fault.

606
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Your English level

607
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,440
in fashion week?

608
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,840
I can't speak well.

609
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,240
I'll practice slowly.

610
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,120
Let me see.

611
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,480
I can't wipe it off, the more I wipe it.

612
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,840
What should I do?

613
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,720
It's getting darker. Come here.

614
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,600
Come here.

615
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
What is this?

616
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,720
It's spicy. What is it?

617
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,440
Don't open your eyes.

618
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,840
Did it fall?

619
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,120
Look.

620
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,040
Awesome

621
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,440
So spicy.

622
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,320
Why are you laughing?

623
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,680
This is the price

624
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,240
for beauty.

625
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,240
What about you?

626
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,360
Are you going to the show dressed like this?

627
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,080
Open your titanium alloy eyes and take a look.

628
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,320
Although Huanya Fashion Week

629
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,440
is not that high-end,

630
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,960
But we still need to prepare the suit.

631
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,480
Sure.

632
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,040
Someone will pick you up later.

633
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,240
Wait here.

634
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,440
Please look here.

635
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,720
Nice to meet you.

636
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,680
Thank you.

637
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,840
Hey.

638
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,440
Follow him and put on Bluetooth earphones.

639
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,440
Okay.

640
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,440
Thank you. This way, please.

641
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,120
Partrick.

642
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:16,840
Long time no see.

643
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,720
How are you? Long time no see.

644
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,440
How are you?

645
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,200
Yes, very good. Thank you.

646
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,480
Excuse me

647
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,120
Thank you.

648
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,840
Excuse me.

649
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:30,920
Thank you.

650
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,960
Stop looking around. Class begins.

651
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,080
The Huanya Fashion Week is more focused on promotion.

652
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,360
The local fashion

653
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,120
is very close to the film and television circle.

654
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,080
So the T-station design will be friendly.

655
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,080
The most people can sit in the first row.

656
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,440
From your eight o'clock.

657
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,320
The timeline.

658
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,320
The first piece, the chief editor of the magazine.

659
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,560
The second shopping zone is here.

660
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,200
My diagonal is the VIP zone.

661
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,680
and the guest area.

662
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,440
The fourth one, Artist Zone, Media Zone.

663
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,320
Do you understand?

664
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,960
Yes.

665
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:11,440
Kim Hye-ah, the mermaid Kim Hye-ah,

666
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,840
and Lee Jae Seok.

667
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,240
Listen.

668
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,200
Don't make a fuss here.

669
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,360
Or I'll ask someone to throw you out.

670
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,320
Believe it or not.

671
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,960
Here's the thing.

672
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,080
The area you're sitting now

673
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,200
is the worst

674
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,960
in the TTV.

675
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,360
Because most of your time

676
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,080
you can only see the back of the model.

677
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,120
After a 20-minute show,

678
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,840
The most important thing for the brand is to show you

679
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,240
the fashion elements of this year.

680
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,080
Secondly,

681
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,240
give the biggest order

682
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,080
to our buyers.

683
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,200
So they will give the best seats

684
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,040
in the first row.

685
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,360
Look, this is the main part of this year.

686
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,320
Pay attention to the inappropriate cutting of its skirt

687
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
and leather.

688
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,720
Next,

689
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,680
Air, fluid design and thin yarn.

690
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,200
Okay.

691
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,080
Basic.

692
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,920
But this time,

693
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,680
the sleeve and collar

694
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,320
with special fabric.

695
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,120
I think this one will sell well.

696
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,840
The combination and pattern of different materials.

697
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,720
But why does every piece

698
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,120
have lotus leaves?

699
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,960
It feels very different from

700
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,240
in 2017.

701
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,720
Very...

702
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,440
very dramatic, right?

703
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,320
Pay attention to the details

704
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,200
in detail.

705
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,320
Its pattern

706
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,080
and exaggerated accessories on the model.

707
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
I see.

708
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,159
And the point is

709
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,600
I was distracted.

710
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,159
No, no.

711
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,400
I just fainted from hunger.

712
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,080
I can't react.

713
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,960
Look, this video is totally different

714
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,120
is totally different.

715
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,880
You're an old commentator.

716
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,239
It's like a golden finger.

717
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,360
Fine, I'll confess.

718
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,920
I'm thinking

719
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,159
when I can be as good as you

720
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,639
sit in the first row of the show?

721
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,480
I wanted to be a buyer

722
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,679
because I wanted to be a buyer.

723
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,080
But today,

724
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,360
someone like me

725
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,639
less than 3,000 yuan.

726
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,400
It's harder

727
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,880
to sit there.

728
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,560
Not necessarily.

729
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,400
Don't comfort me.

730
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,840
I never say comforting words.

731
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,320
For a buyer,

732
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,600
for a buyer.

733
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,640
It's a show.

734
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,200
The exhibition hall is more important.

735
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,440
For a brand,

736
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,160
you may see

737
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,120
you might see at most 100 clothes.

738
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,160
In the exhibition hall,

739
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,160
at least 800 pieces.

740
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,200
You know,

741
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,600
Many shows

742
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,680
are usually exaggerated.

743
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,720
The commercial money in the exhibition hall

744
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,200
can make money for the brand.

745
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,680
to make the brand earn money.

746
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,080
Look at this.

747
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,640
Many buyers are here.

748
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,800
70% of the orders

749
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,880
happened here.

750
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,560
The other 30 percent

751
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
happened at the order meeting, right?

752
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,400
Good preparations.

753
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,320
Have you been to Yi's?

754
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
Yes.

755
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,160
Take this order.

756
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,440
and what clothes you like,

757
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,160
you can write down its style.

758
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,240
There are its codes,

759
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,040
including color and size.

760
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,600
We'll order the small orders here.

761
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,640
and place an order with the brand.

762
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,640
What about the big order?

763
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,200
We need to leave our intention behind

764
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,400
after we leave.

765
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,800
Try this on.

766
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,960
Try it on.

767
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,200
There are models here.

768
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,880
They are too tall and beautiful.

769
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,640
So beautiful.

770
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,400
Trying on clothes

771
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,040
Your figure suits me better.

772
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,200
It's for ordinary people, right?

773
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,920
You should know

774
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,240
it's quite expensive

775
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:18,920
It's quite expensive.

776
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,640
Why did I

777
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,960
bring you to Huan Ya?

778
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,920
I paid for the flight ticket myself.

779
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,440
Opportunities are priceless.

780
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,840
OK?

781
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,560
Right? A little narrower, right?

782
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,800
Not bad.

783
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,440
I thought

784
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,040
at most half an hour.

785
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,160
I have to hang in there.

786
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,840
Otherwise,

787
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,320
to learn from you.

788
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,320
I know.

789
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,160
it's useless to just work hard.

790
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,360
But for people

791
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,160
are not genius.

792
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,600
Studying is the only way to improve.

793
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,480
Right?

794
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,560
I need to sort out the order.

795
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,320
Go and practice how to choose the clothes.

796
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:08,840
Okay.

797
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,160
I'll be back.

798
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,640
Please turn around.

799
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,480
Thank you.

800
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,320
Wait.

801
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,000
What are you doing?

802
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
It's a rare opportunity.

803
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,480
Stop shooting stars.

804
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:24,400
Okay.

805
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,400
Okay.

806
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,880
Slow down.

807
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,160
Okay.

808
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,400
Thank you. Okay.

809
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,200
Okay, thank you.

810
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,160
Get me a glass of water. Thank you.

811
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,960
Okay.

812
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,200
As long as you like it.

813
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,600
next time,

814
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,400
next time.

815
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,840
in the first row.

816
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,040
Okay.

817
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:56,840
Where is the toilet?

818
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,880
The bathroom is downstairs.

819
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,680
Excuse me.

820
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,480
Okay, bye.

821
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,320
Bye. Bye.

822
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,320
Ding Yike.

823
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,640
Ding Yike, come here.

824
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,040
What are you shooting?

825
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,800
We're not having a party for you.

826
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,200
Look on the stage.

827
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:09,880
There will be many

828
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,680
a lot of famous designers

829
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,160
of this fashion week.

830
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,880
I know.

831
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,720
Phei asked me to take some photos for him.

832
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,600
You're always interested in

833
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,360
You're here too.

834
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,440
Long time no see.

835
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,400
Long time no see.

836
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,200
Why are you here?

837
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,480
Yes, what a coincidence.

838
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,040
Am I interrupting?

839
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,160
Let's have a drink.

840
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,160
Okay, I'll be there.

841
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,560
Okay, let's go.

842
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,240
Look, I look good in the photo.

843
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,600
What's wrong?

844
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,400
You looked upset when you got in the car.

845
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,400
Are you not feeling well after drinking too much?

846
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,480
Go back to the hotel and take a hot bath.

847
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,880
Who is he? He's so handsome.

848
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,960
Who is this?

849
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,920
Alexander Tang.

850
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,440
Tang Zhiyuan.

851
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,080
Why didn't I recognize you just now?

852
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,160
You were busy

853
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,200
staring at stars?

854
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,080
Gosh.

855
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,240
Why did he come to Huan Ya Fashion Week?

856
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,240
This person...

857
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,880
This is his ex-assistant Amy.

858
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,960
I wish I were her.

859
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,440
I worked with guru every day.

860
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,880
After three to four years of close study,

861
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,320
I can also perform on my own.

862
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,440
Even if he really likes me,

863
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,600
even if he really likes me.

864
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,160
What are you talking about?

865
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,480
Can you be more successful?

866
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,560
Just kidding.

867
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,440
Some jokes can't be made casually.

868
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,640
You should know that in the fashion circle,

869
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,120
in fashion circle.

870
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:48,880
Do you understand?

871
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,360
Yes, I think you don't.

872
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,080
Excuse me.

873
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:58,800
Yes, sir.

874
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,600
Please stop.

875
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,320
Here.

876
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,160
Yes, right here.

877
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:02,800
Okay.

878
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,320
What's wrong?

879
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,360
I don't want to talk to you.

880
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,720
Can you be reasonable? I...

881
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:14,920
I don't want to talk to you, okay?

882
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:15,800
Be reasonable.

883
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,880
I didn't say anything right.

884
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,160
I admit my mistake and apologized.

885
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,040
What do you want?

886
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:20,200
I'll tell you why I'm angry.

887
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,960
Because you've been perfunctory.
