1
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,840
Liu Shan.

2
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,840
Liu Shan, don't run if you dare!

3
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,600
Stop!

4
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,080
Stop!

5
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,840
Stop!

6
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,120
Liu Shan.

7
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,720
Sure.

8
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,600
Forget it.

9
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,440
We're classmates.

10
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,199
Sa Hyun, let go of me!

11
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,280
You can calm down.

12
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,759
Let go of me!

13
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,280
I must

14
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
teach her a lesson today.

15
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
Forget it.

16
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,080
OK. Liu Shan, don't run.

17
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,640
Sure.

18
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,400
Stop right there!

19
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,200
Si Xian.

20
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,480
Wenwen, why are you here?

21
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,040
You said you had a stomachache.

22
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,200
so I came to pick you up.

23
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,920
This is...

24
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,920
She's my classmate, Ding Yike.

25
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,000
Hello, I'm Lin Sixian's girlfriend.

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,760
Jiang Wenwen.

27
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,560
At that moment,

28
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,920
I realized a bloody truth.

29
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,840
The cruelest thing in the world

30
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,040
is not parting.

31
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,640
I can only

32
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,760
to come to the reunion

33
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,120
with a designer bag a few years ago.

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,640
But she

35
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,400
can drive a sports car

36
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,920
with the latest model of this season.

37
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,000
to me.

38
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,760
she has no right

39
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,120
to my boyfriend.

40
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,120
What's wrong?

41
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,640
Why are you holding your shoes?

42
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,040
Let us help you put on your shoes.

43
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
We're leaving.

44
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,640
Bye. Bye.

45
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,760
Yike, why are you still here?

46
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,120
Do you need a ride?

47
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,480
I'm leaving.

48
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,040
Don't worry, dad.

49
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,960
I will

50
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,520
I'll take care of it as soon as possible.

51
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,080
Leo's promotion plan is great.

52
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,040
Don't interfere.

53
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,400
It was established in May for more than ten years.

54
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,120
There are many old people and many bad guys.

55
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,680
It's hard to touch them when I'm here.

56
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,560
With Leo's spear,

57
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,520
She'll take the blame for offending us.

58
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,800
We have the benefits of reform.

59
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,040
Kill two birds with one stone.

60
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,240
So, don't be stubborn with her.

61
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
You have to pity her and comfort her.

62
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,360
And tell her how hard it is for you.

63
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,360
Women

64
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,400
buy a bouquet of flowers after slapping her.

65
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,960
she won't hate you.

66
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,480
You need to learn

67
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,680
these tricks.

68
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,760
Okay, I got it.

69
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,040
I'll take care of it as soon as possible.

70
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,800
Don't worry.

71
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,240
Who is it?

72
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,840
It's me.

73
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,080
Director Lei, you're still working late?

74
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,960
Although it's a new official,

75
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,960
you don't have to work so hard.

76
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,240
Don't pretend to be polite.

77
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,400
It's like we're close.

78
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,520
I'm here to apologize

79
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,680
to apologize.

80
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,520
That day in the meeting room,

81
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,360
I shouldn't have mentioned your privacy.

82
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,360
That's too manly.

83
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,080
Just eat this.

84
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,800
I'll treat you to dinner next time, okay?

85
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,680
Let's have a nice meal.

86
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,680
No need.

87
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,280
Actually,

88
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,240
I was upset about the bank loan.

89
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,240
because of the bank loan.

90
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,960
I understand.

91
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,200
Girls like you

92
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,800
to work hard.

93
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,960
First, please don't call me Miss.

94
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
Because I think this is

95
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,680
to me.

96
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,360
Besides,

97
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,200
like you

98
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,080
There are too many traces.

99
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,040
Do you need me to teach you?

100
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,760
About Zhou Bai’an,

101
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,800
I do have personal grudges with him.

102
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,120
At the meeting,

103
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,480
I didn't talk to you

104
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,240
not because I feel guilty.

105
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,960
It's because

106
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,960
is nothing to me.

107
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,080
Are you still a man?

108
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,040
You're such a sly gossiper.

109
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,280
Aren't you afraid that there'll be sores on your tongue?

110
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,240
You were acquired by Lingyun in May.

111
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,480
I'm not the culprit.

112
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,760
It's because you're lagging behind.

113
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,360
Okay, let's add

114
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,480
The world is not doing well.

115
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,680
For me,

116
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,800
if I didn't want to add

117
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,240
the medal to turn the tide,

118
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,800
I won't accept

119
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,360
such a glamorous

120
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,760
that has a rotten core.

121
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,480
So please don't

122
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,840
don't bother me anymore.

123
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,680
Okay?

124
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
Remember.

125
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,240
Come back.

126
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,280
Sign it.

127
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
A friendly reminder.

128
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,680
From now on, those who attack me with my personal life

129
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,560
be ready to get back at me.

130
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,520
Didn't you just say

131
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,200
you didn't care about it?

132
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,200
That's because I don't want to talk to you.

133
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,840
Let's go.

134
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,680
By the way, honey.

135
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,360
I'm going on a business trip to Tokyo on Monday.

136
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,560
I'll be home late.

137
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,240
I'll pick you up.

138
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,480
No, I have a driver.

139
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
Besides,

140
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,800
Aunt said you've been working overtime lately.

141
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,920
I don't want you to get sick.

142
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,240
Well, in the restaurant,

143
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,320
Ding Yike and Liu Shan...

144
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,720
I...

145
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,640
Oh.

146
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,440
That girl's name is Ding Yike.

147
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,040
What's wrong with her?

148
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,920
Nothing.

149
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,560
That's good.

150
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,120
I'll get going then.

151
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:43,920
Bye.

152
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:44,720
Bye.

153
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,680
Drive safe.

154
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,920
Sure.

155
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,720
Why are you...

156
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,320
Why am I here?

157
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,560
I was waiting for you.

158
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,480
I wanted to show off

159
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,120
to show off in front of you tonight.

160
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,800
I even cut my hair.

161
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,320
I didn't expect

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,160
I was humiliated.

163
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Jiang Wenwen is good.

164
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,360
She's better than me in everything.

165
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,920
No wonder you're with her.

166
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,880
Sure, actually...

167
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,120
I'll get you back.

168
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,040
That day,

169
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
that day.

170
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,880
I never agreed to it.

171
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,800
I know.

172
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
you chose Jiang Wenwen

173
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,440
because your mother

174
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,560
never liked me.

175
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,040
Because she's from Shanghai.

176
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,240
and I'm just a Shanghai drifter.

177
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,600
But it's okay.

178
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
I'm working hard now.

179
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
I believe in the near future,

180
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,120
I will be better

181
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,160
and better than her.

182
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,920
By then,

183
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,000
we can be together again, okay?

184
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,600
Don't say no.

185
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,320
You don't have to feel pressured.

186
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,600
Before I get you back,

187
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
you can still be with her.

188
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,040
with her.

189
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,320
Because I like you

190
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,360
or get you back,

191
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,600
it's just my own business.

192
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,920
Thank you.

193
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,360
Thank you.

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,560
for helping me

195
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,120
in front of my classmates.

196
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,560
And thank you

197
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,920
for breaking up with me.

198
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,040
so that I can find

199
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:38,120
more motivated and more energetic.

200
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,120
In the future,

201
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,600
I will chase you like crazy

202
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,360
I'll pursue you like crazy.

203
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,240
Be prepared.

204
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,480
You're blushing.

205
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,440
Okay, I'm leaving.

206
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,000
Good night.

207
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,480
Bye.

208
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,160
Ding Yike, are you crazy?

209
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,920
He kicked you.

210
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,320
but you still want to chase him.

211
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,560
I'm not crazy.

212
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,360
What does pride mean to love?

213
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,240
You've been trembling

214
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,360
you've been trembling.

215
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,600
You still like him.

216
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,000
People will laugh at you if they find out.

217
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,040
Don't you think

218
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,920
laugh at you now?

219
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,040
Sure.

220
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,680
Don't be silly again.

221
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,480
No matter how good you become,

222
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,800
I won't be with you.

223
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,160
I have changed my mind.

224
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,320
The only person I love is Jiang Wenwen.

225
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,400
Do you hear me?

226
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,120
Do you hear me, sir? Don't stop. Keep driving.

227
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,240
What did you say? I can't hear you.

228
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,920
You're a good girl.

229
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
But marriage and love are different.

230
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,800
I'm a scumbag who's disloyal.

231
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,680
Don't waste your time on me.

232
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,040
Remember to take stomach medicine. Bye.

233
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,240
Sure.

234
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,680
Miss,

235
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,480
You're really pretty.

236
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,320
Truth.

237
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,320
Thank you.

238
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,800
It's not free.

239
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,320
Remember to give me

240
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,160
five-star review later.

241
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,880
That's life.

242
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,600
It's an inspirational drama,

243
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,560
and then a soap opera.

244
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:56,440
Later.

245
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,040
It's a light comedy again.

246
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,800
It's me, Director Lei.

247
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,040
Come in.

248
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,480
The receptionist said

249
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,360
you must be in the office

250
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,560
He must be in the office.

251
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,120
I'll return this to you

252
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,480
before everyone goes to work.

253
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,880
I've already done the laundry.

254
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,880
Thank you.

255
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,920
This is the best dress

256
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,360
in my life.

257
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,960
How was the result last night?

258
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:07,720
I lost.

259
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,319
But I plan to enter the long battle.

260
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,200
You're brave.

261
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,079
Is it worth it?

262
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,839
Yes.

263
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,119
You have five days

264
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,800
five days left.

265
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Don't worry.

266
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,920
I promise I'll complete the mission.

267
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,680
I'm going to move bricks.

268
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,440
It's hot. Consider it a thank you.

269
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,720
I forgot to ask which shop it belongs to.

270
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,360
Forget it. I can't afford it.

271
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,720
Welcome. Please come in.

272
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Watch the steps.

273
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,960
Okay, thank you.

274
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,440
As long as you try hard,

275
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,080
even if I study in pieces,

276
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,920
he can teach me a lot of tricks.

277
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,080
For example, customers

278
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,440
are not willing to find

279
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,840
who looks better than me.

280
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,800
Buy clothes.

281
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,320
So I never wear lipstick

282
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,200
Because this

283
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,960
is the most

284
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,680
to attract people's attention.

285
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,600
You're the only one who deserves this.

286
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,680
If I were you,

287
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,840
I wouldn't be able to control it.

288
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,560
I'll take this one.

289
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,200
Sure.

290
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,080
This way, please.

291
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,800
For example, when you're doing sales with customers,

292
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,440
you can add some specific

293
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,680
emotional description.

294
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,040
This is called stage marketing.

295
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,600
Honey, this dress

296
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,920
is especially suitable for a date.

297
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,960
Imagine it.

298
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,800
Under a dim light,

299
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,040
under a dim light.

300
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,720
Doesn't she look like a princess?

301
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,320
Yes.

302
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,200
Remember to wear it on your date.

303
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,240
Okay, thank you.

304
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,720
Bye.

305
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,480
Bye.

306
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,240
The new model is here.

307
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,200
I'll text you.

308
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,720
Okay, thank you.

309
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,840
Bye. Thank you.

310
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,560
Remember to use orange lipstick.

311
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,080
Thank you.

312
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,080
Thank you for coming

313
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,800
Thank you for coming.

314
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,040
She seems to be enlightened

315
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,320
She signed so many orders.

316
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,560
It's not as much as mine.

317
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,200
I can't stand the momentum.

318
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,120
Those who have been an Internet celebrity are different.

319
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:58,720
If she becomes

320
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,960
the sales champion this month,

321
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,840
Our bonus and commission this month

322
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,440
in this month's bonus and commission.

323
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,800
One more sandwich, please.

324
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,120
Welcome.

325
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,600
Hello

326
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,720
Hello this way please

327
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,080
Hello.

328
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,120
We have a special offer today.

329
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,920
Do you want to take a look?

330
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,560
Sure.

331
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,960
Mr. Choi.

332
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,080
What's wrong?

333
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,560
Sister Yang.

334
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,040
The company rules that

335
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,800
We take turns.

336
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,600
Don't you know?

337
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,440
I know.

338
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,720
Are you talking about those clients?

339
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,440
They are my old clients.

340
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,200
He came for me.

341
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,920
It's not good for me to leave him alone.

342
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,440
It doesn't matter.

343
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,320
Four or five times is an old client.

344
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,040
Yes.

345
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,320
So I think it's strange too.

346
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
It's as if they agreed

347
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
to come together.

348
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,240
You don't believe me?

349
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,200
You can ask them.

350
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,600
Even so,

351
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,240
shouldn't you

352
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,560
inform your colleagues

353
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,040
and explain to your colleagues.

354
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
Okay, Mr. Choi.

355
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,920
I'll ask them to come in groups next time.

356
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,960
Okay, focus on your work.

357
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,600
It's okay. Don't worry.

358
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,800
Ding,

359
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,240
If you need anything next time,

360
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,720
just tell Yang.

361
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,960
There's no need to trouble Mr. Choi.

362
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,080
Yes.

363
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,960
You're a rookie. It's okay.

364
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,120
I can teach you slowly.

365
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,200
You should know your place at work.

366
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,960
What are you so proud of?

367
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,920
Do you think these tricks

368
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,840
are useful to me?

369
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,040
Yes, I'm still young.

370
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,840
And you are indeed old.

371
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,960
So you must have never seen

372
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
Half-shaped straight tree, right?

373
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,440
What tree?

374
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,200
Hello Welcome

375
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,720
Hello.

376
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,440
These are our new styles of autumn and winter.

377
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,720
You can try them on if you like them.

378
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,360
Okay let me see

379
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,840
You look very elegant.

380
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,720
There's a skirt here.

381
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,840
I think it suits you very well.

382
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,840
Really? Let me see.

383
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,080
This color is very good.

384
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,720
Because macarons are very popular this year.

385
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,600
Look, this is macaron.

386
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,840
This is long.

387
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,360
And a short one.

388
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,440
Look at your skin color.

389
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,360
Right, honey?

390
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,080
Your temperament

391
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,720
You look

392
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,960
very unique.

393
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,560
This macaron color

394
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,840
makes you look vulgar.

395
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,720
Now, let's

396
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,720
Let's go over there.

397
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,680
Okay.

398
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,240
Look at this.

399
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,200
This one

400
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,320
is very fashionable.

401
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,960
This is a real war.

402
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:19,960
Do you want to bet?

403
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,720
Let's see who wins.

404
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,680
Mr. Choi.

405
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,840
Get back to work.

406
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,680
I'm going out now.

407
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,240
Keep an eye on them.

408
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,600
Don't let them go too far.

409
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,480
Okay.

410
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,600
Don't go too far.

411
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,440
It means...

412
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,560
Leave them alone for now. Let them fight.

413
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,840
Sister Yang.

414
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,680
She's always using her old qualifications to talk.

415
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,560
Do you want to take the chance

416
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,680
to kill her?

417
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
It's possible.

418
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,240
This is

419
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,840
is our new autumn and winter.

420
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,360
And they're all best-sellers.

421
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,360
You can try it on.

422
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,680
Yes, this dress.

423
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,120
I suddenly remembered

424
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,800
there is a coat that suits you very well.

425
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,080
This way. Come and have a look.

426
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:08,840
Okay.

427
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,840
Is this one nice?

428
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,120
Okay.

429
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,360
There's only one left.

430
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,680
An old client

431
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,720
asked me to keep it for her.

432
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,720
She'll buy it after dinner.

433
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,360
Do you want to try it on first?

434
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,960
I'll leave it to you if you dress well.

435
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,080
I think you look better in it than her.

436
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,720
Really?

437
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,320
This flower is quite special.

438
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,720
Yes, only one left.

439
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,720
It's so pretty.

440
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,360
Let's vote.

441
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,480
Okay.

442
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,920
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

443
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,320
Okay.

444
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,080
Look at other styles.

445
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,800
Okay.

446
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:50,960
Are you filming me?

447
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,840
Yes.

448
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,600
You look so good in this dress.

449
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,440
You must

450
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,240
on Moments later.

451
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,440
Look.

452
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,680
My profile is better than your selfie.

453
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,320
It's pretty.

454
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,080
Right?

455
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,920
Send it to me.

456
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,560
Sure.

457
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,320
Honey.

458
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,240
Well...

459
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,200
Why is the signal not good?

460
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,240
Shall we go out?

461
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,200
Okay?

462
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,840
Get out.

463
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,440
The signal is great outside.

464
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,200
Yes.

465
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,920
Honey.

466
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,960
To be honest, don't be angry.

467
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,920
It's okay. Go ahead.

468
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,320
Your clothes

469
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,080
is very pretty

470
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,320
under the white light.

471
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,040
But when you walk out,

472
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,560
under the natural light,

473
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:41,720
That makeup looks a little dirty.

474
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,480
Take a photo for me.

475
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,080
Okay.

476
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,360
Take a look.

477
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,200
Right? It's too different.

478
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Honey.

479
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,320
I don't want this dress.

480
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,720
I'll get you the ticket.

481
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,320
I don't want this dress.

482
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,080
I don't like it.

483
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,440
Wasn't it good just now?

484
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,960
Honey, don't worry.

485
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,120
I know there is

486
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,080
under the natural light.

487
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,040
under natural lights.

488
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,320
Let me show you, okay?

489
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,680
Which one? Show me.

490
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,320
Okay.

491
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,120
No, honey.

492
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:08,960
Look carefully.

493
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,080
Why don't you want it all of a sudden?

494
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,960
I've already booked a ticket for you.

495
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,600
Why don't you want it?

496
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,720
Ding Yike.

497
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,840
What are you doing?

498
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,560
Here, honey.

499
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,680
Remember to give a good review

500
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,560
on the public comments.

501
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,560
Don't worry.

502
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,360
I'm leaving. Bye.

503
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,040
Thank you.

504
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,960
Thank you for coming.

505
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,720
That's enough.

506
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,720
You really want to make your blood pressure explode?

507
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,120
I just want to teach someone

508
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,600
What do you mean by that?

509
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,840
What?

510
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,800
He looks like a pervert.

511
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,240
He keeps touching me.

512
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:10,840
Sir.

513
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,960
The clothes you're looking at

514
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
has been sold out.

515
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,200
and the sample clothes were ordered.

516
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,080
How about you...

517
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
What should I do?

518
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,600
Fashion industry is basically

519
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,800
where copyright can't be used.

520
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,680
Because the change of trend

521
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,480
is always faster than the patent application.

522
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
So protect your design

523
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,560
to prevent the copyright

524
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,960
is very important.

525
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,560
Be careful of those

526
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,200
who spy on our design.

527
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,440
They usually have the same feature.

528
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,560
Their clothes are weird.

529
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,920
He has various cameras.

530
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,240
I like to stand in the corner

531
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,720
the clerk easily ignores.

532
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,080
They care more about the details of cutting,

533
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,440
not like normal customers.

534
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,480
will be attracted to

535
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,480
and colors first.

536
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,440
Hello?

537
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,800
If you want to steal it,

538
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,560
Buy some at least.

539
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,080
and come to the shop to copy.

540
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,960
Do you want more?

541
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,360
disturb others?

542
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,720
I'm sorry, everyone.

543
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,560
You can understand me, right?

544
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,920
What are you doing?

545
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,720
Wipe your tears.

546
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,600
I said it's none of your business.

547
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,080
I don't want to.

548
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,480
You were standing across me just now.

549
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,440
Let me tell you.

550
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,600
no man

551
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,040
feel sorry for a woman like her.

552
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,080
I'll only think she's pitiful and annoying.

553
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,080
Can you have some guts?

554
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:49,920
Yes.

555
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:53,960
Bag.

556
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,320
Humph.

557
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,240
I stole it.

558
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,040
Okay.

559
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,240
I don't care what you're doing here.

560
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,120
Anyway, please leave.

561
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,600
Don't disturb our business.

562
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,080
The shop is open here.

563
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
Why are you kicking me out?

564
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,840
If you don't leave, I'll call security.

565
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,320
Interesting.

566
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,080
It's none of your business.

567
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,360
We're shopping for normal people.

568
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,440
Not for you.

569
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,840
a psycho touch.

570
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,800
Who's a psycho?

571
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,800
Stop talking nonsense, okay?

572
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,840
I've seen a lot of people like you

573
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,720
with copying copies.

574
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,600
If you don't leave,

575
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,840
I'll call security.

576
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,720
Ding Yike.

577
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,320
How can you talk to a customer like that?

578
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,200
What?

579
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,920
You sold more clothes

580
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,120
after selling a few more clothes.

581
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,960
Sister Yang, don't worry.

582
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,600
Sir,

583
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,440
I'm really sorry.

584
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,720
She just came here.

585
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,440
She knows nothing.

586
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,680
All you do is shouting here.

587
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,040
I can see

588
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,720
You know nothing.

589
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,800
It's good to yell.

590
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,200
Who is he?

591
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,040
He's a customer.

592
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,440
What's a customer

593
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,080
Customer is God.

594
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,920
You have no evidence.

595
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,600
without any evidence.

596
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,720
You've disgraced

597
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,320
in May.

598
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,240
No, he...

599
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,040
Sir,

600
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,240
I sincerely apologize to you.

601
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,560
I know

602
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,840
you must be

603
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,920
at this moment.

604
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,840
This is our complaint form.

605
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,840
Please write down

606
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,560
what happened just now

607
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,960
and sign your name.

608
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,720
I'll help you with the rest.

609
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,680
Don't worry.

610
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,040
The company will give you

611
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
a satisfactory explanation.

612
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,680
Yang Qiao, what are you doing? This is personal.

613
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,600
Stop talking nonsense.

614
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,320
You were the one who snatched my client.

615
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,720
You took my client first.

616
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,600
Whoever takes the client first

617
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
will never get married.

618
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,800
Say that again.

619
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:15,800
I'll rip your mouth!

620
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,480
Come on.

621
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,440
Tear it off!

622
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,440
You think I dare not?

623
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,480
Ding Yike, come on, tear it.

624
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,720
Come on. Tear it off.

625
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,200
Ding Yike, let me tell you.

626
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,080
Don't think that

627
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,840
become an Internet celebrity,

628
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,120
and you're a celebrity.

629
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,960
What's wrong?

630
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,120
You still got dumped.

631
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,440
You're still a shopkeeper here.

632
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,080
Don't blame others if you break it yourself.

633
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,440
You're not alert at all.

634
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,960
You even speak for a commercial spy.

635
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,080
Are you out of your mind?

636
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:34,840
I'm not alert. Are you crazy?

637
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
How did you know he was a business spy?

638
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Don't think

639
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,800
your menopause is up.

640
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,320
All right.

641
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:38,960
Old woman.

642
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,760
What do you know? Stop talking. Okay.

643
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,760
Are you going through menopause? Go away.

644
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,480
Are you getting old? Ding Yike,

645
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,680
Say it again, you old woman.

646
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,080
You're a yellow-faced woman.

647
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,960
You don't deserve it.

648
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,440
Shut up!

649
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,320
You yellow-faced woman.

650
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,720
The one I just saw

651
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,840
and the two on the model.

652
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,320
I bought them all.

653
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,680
From now on,

654
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,040
I'll pay. Can you shut up?

655
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,320
Bill, please.

656
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,440
You too.

657
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,200
A commercial spy?

658
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,080
Mr. Choi!

659
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,840
That man bought all his clothes.

660
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,960
Really. Yike is silly.

661
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,240
Everyone later said

662
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,120
that man

663
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,720
He's crazy and perverted.

664
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,320
Otherwise, how could he...

665
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,440
I quarreled with Yike just now.

666
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,560
In the blink of an eye, I dumped her.

667
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,600
Such a big order.

668
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,200
This is called good luck.

669
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,680
I can't stop it.

670
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,720
Who is it?

671
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,320
Didn't you say you need a stupid topic?

672
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,080
Take it.

673
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,320
No, Zhao Moyuan.

674
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,080
What happened to your face?

675
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,320
Don't tell me it was scratched by a cat.

676
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,800
I'll beat you if you keep talking nonsense.

677
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,840
Gucci, what are you doing?

678
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,200
Disinfect.

679
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,320
What? You don't want to leave?

680
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,560
Aren't we brothers?

681
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,320
You don't want to leave?

682
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:02,960
Yes.

683
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,720
Do you?

684
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,040
Don't throw it away.

685
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,920
If you fall again,

686
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,080
See if it's good.

687
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,240
Oh-wol.

688
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,480
Sure.

689
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,600
Thanks.

690
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,600
I'm worried that it's not hard enough.

691
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,720
No.

692
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,440
What happened to your face?

693
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,200
Never mention it.

694
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,680
If people are unlucky,

695
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,840
water will get stuck in my teeth.

696
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,720
By the way,

697
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,080
my new store will open the day after tomorrow.

698
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:30,960
Are you coming or not?

699
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,440
How can I be a human if I don't come?

700
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
Not only did I come,

701
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,560
I also made you

702
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,600
with you.

703
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,960
News manuscript, Software, Internet publication,

704
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,080
I'll cover it for you.

705
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,080
and do a live stream for you.

706
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,920
TV station app

707
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,840
both lines at the same time.

708
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,200
Are we good friends?

709
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,960
Thanks

710
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,960
Aren’t you worried that Shen Jin will make trouble?

711
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,840
I don’t care if he comes.

712
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,440
Of course.

713
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,960
Mr. Lin, your coffee.

714
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,080
Thank you.

715
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,320
When did the company

716
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
such a good coffee?

717
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,960
The company is not that good.

718
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,680
This is from your girlfriend.

719
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,960
from your girlfriend.

720
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,880
You must be mistaken.

721
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,800
My girlfriend never buys coffee.

722
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,560
You don't believe me?

723
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:13,920
See for yourself.

724
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,880
Enjoy.

725
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,960
Don't say it's not good.

726
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,400
Great!

727
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,080
Did you receive my coffee?

728
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,880
I was wrong. This way.

729
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,840
Hurry up, okay?

730
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,440
Coming.

731
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,160
Young lady, how about lighting?

732
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,240
Once the door is closed, it's exclusive.

733
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,400
Auntie.

734
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,640
This place is so small.

735
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,880
You want to charge me 5,500 yuan?

736
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,640
What kind of place is this?

737
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,480
This is the city center, historical area.

738
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,560
It takes three steps to the central business area.

739
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,040
The most appealing part in Jiangcheng.

740
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,040
5,500 yuan is too expensive.

741
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,640
Will you rent it or not?

742
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,640
If you don't, forget it.

743
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,480
Go outside and pay 1,000 yuan.

744
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,800
and ask the agent to find you a good one.

745
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,120
Auntie.

746
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,160
I'll rent it.

747
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,080
OK?

748
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,080
Director Lei.

749
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,720
How's the store's result this week?

750
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,640
I'll get the report for you.

751
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,120
Hello, Director Lei.

752
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,800
I'm going to fix my makeup.

753
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,960
Come down now.

754
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,160
Now?

755
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,600
Didn't you say

756
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,880
close at nine?

757
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,920
How would I know that Tiger Lei

758
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,120
He's coming over now.

759
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,680
Yes, come down now.

760
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,360
How about this?

761
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,200
I'll add 1,000 yuan to you, okay?

762
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,480
Okay.

763
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,440
Thank you

764
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,840
Come down now. Hurry up.

765
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,880
Ding Yike, Ding Yike.

766
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,400
A tiger doesn't show its power.

767
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,400
Do you think I'm a Kitty cat?

768
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,240
You tore and beat me.

769
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,880
I almost missed the full martial arts.

770
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,240
You just crossed the line.

771
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,400
Is this all you've got?

772
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,360
You passed 61 points.

773
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,400
Anyway, I'm a man of my word.

774
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,400
Director Lei,

775
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,360
You think I'm okay too, right?

776
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,200
Otherwise, you wouldn't come to see me

777
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,800
on Friday night.

778
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,160
You're good at acting.

779
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,240
I dare not.

780
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,240
Okay, you've done it.

781
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,200
Ding, your client is back.

782
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,640
Miss, take a look.

783
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:54,040
The pants are full of threads.

784
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,560
Here.

785
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,640
And here.

786
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,920
What is this? How can I wear it?

787
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,080
It's okay

788
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,200
This little thread

789
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,640
won't affect the overall effect.

790
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,160
I'll cut it right away.

791
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,880
Hold on.

792
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,200
No, I need a refund.

793
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,960
Let me tell you.

794
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,880
Three packets are the right

795
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,360
to each consumer.

796
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,600
Honey, look.

797
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,640
This little thread

798
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,160
It really doesn't affect the pants.

799
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,160
These pants are very beautiful.

800
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,400
Don't tell me that.

801
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,440
I want to return it now.

802
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,720
Miss, look.

803
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:21,560
This pair of pants

804
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,880
is limited-edition in our store.

805
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,920
This is the only one.

806
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,160
It's a pity if you don't buy it.

807
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,640
What's wrong?

808
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:26,600
You don't want me to return it, right?

809
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,560
It's so pretty, you know?

810
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,080
No, no.

811
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:28,640
No no

812
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,200
Come and have a look.

813
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,400
You can't return what you bought here.

814
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,240
This girl

815
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:33,880
sold me

816
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,960
a trouser with quality.

817
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,440
Is this how you do business?

818
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,560
All right.

819
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,120
Miss.

820
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,160
Stop arguing, okay?

821
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,640
I'll give you a refund.

822
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,360
Okay.

823
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:44,640
Return this lady.

824
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,720
It's $308.

825
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,880
You did it, right?

826
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,920
What do you mean?

827
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,160
Look how anxious we are.

828
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,120
But no matter how anxious you are,

829
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,480
You can't talk nonsense

830
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,320
in front of the store manager and President Lei

831
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,680
Sir, do you know me?

832
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:07,480
Who are you?

833
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,720
Look, we don't know each other at all.

834
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,600
Let's find a way

835
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,960
to help them.

836
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,320
It'll close in a few decades.

837
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,800
If she can't finish her performance,

838
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,160
she will leave May.

839
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,360
I think you should

840
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,200
call your old client

841
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,720
and ask them to come over to pay for you.

842
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,560
One order is enough.

843
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,840
Why are you looking at me?

844
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,200
Hurry up and call. It's too late.

845
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,640
Who said it's too late?

846
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,440
The number is 38010.

847
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,880
The price is 288. Bill, please.

848
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,600
Excuse me.

849
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,200
My current total sales

850
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,480
is back to 5044.

851
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,800
She's cheating.

852
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,240
Mr. Choi, is there a rule

853
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,320
that employees can't buy their own products?

854
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,120
No.

855
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,440
Do you hear me?

856
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:20,960
Sir, here.

857
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,320
Help me

858
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,880
These, these, these

859
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,640
all of these.

860
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:42,440
Are you crazy?

861
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,560
You're playing electric drill on Saturday.

862
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:45,960
I'm sorry.

863
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,160
Just a sign.

864
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,080
It'll be ready soon.

865
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,720
Another new shop?

866
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,600
Sa Hyun, are you there?

867
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,240
I forgot to tell you.

868
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,800
I have

869
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,880
apart from small and old,

870
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,640
there's another thing that's not cute.

871
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,120
It's not soundproof.

872
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,120
I don't care.

873
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,200
This will be my new home.

874
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,240
Come visit me when you're free.

875
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,400
Okay.

876
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,880
Okay, thank you.

877
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,480
You're welcome.

878
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,240
Thank you. See you.

879
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,480
Take care
