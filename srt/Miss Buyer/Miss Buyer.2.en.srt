The documents have been sent to your email.

3
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,390
Dismiss.

4
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,510
You are really suitable for May.

5
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,110
Is she

6
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,830
the one in the reality show?

7
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:10,910
Yes.

8
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,750
Can someone with no fashion experience

9
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,150
be a buyer?

10
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,110
The fashion industry

11
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,470
is the world of Internet celebrities.

12
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,550
Look at Kendall.

13
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,070
She's walking like a ghost.

14
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,990
Chanel still invited her

15
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,550
to walk the haute couture show.

16
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,590
Let's make a bet.

17
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,750
How long do you think she can stay?

18
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,990
Half a month?

19
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,110
How can you look down on her like that?

20
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,510
At least three weeks.

21
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,270
Three days.

22
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,070
No way.

23
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,230
The boss

24
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:39,910
just said she was suitable for May.

25
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,790
You think that's a compliment?

26
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,950
Wasn't it?

27
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:43,790
Yeah.

28
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,390
What May is best at

29
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,230
is copying big brands.

30
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:50,630
The headquarter is still in a copyright lawsuit.

31
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,950
Think about it.

32
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,070
Since Miss Lei is

33
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,790
from the headquarter,

34
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,590
would she like a newcomer

35
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,150
who copied her ?

36
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,830
That makes sense.

37
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,390
Yes, that makes sense.

38
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,990
In the workplace, you need to learn

39
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,470
to get the undermeanings.

40
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,510
Personal ability is outstanding,

41
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,350
means you don't have teamwork.

42
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,230
How have you been?

43
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,670
means I haven't received your work report

44
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,910
for a long time.

45
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,750
If one day,

46
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,230
your boss suddenly compliments you

47
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,190
in some ways.

48
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,150
Congratulations.

49
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,790
You'll soon become a cannon fodder.

50
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,750
If in a TV drama,

51
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,310
I should have opened the door

52
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,190
of the bathroom

53
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,230
Applause for them gracefully

54
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,710
and humiliate those bitches

55
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,390
to the Mariana Cave.

56
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,710
Unfortunately,

57
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,870
those words

58
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,510
were conveyed to me by Jiang Jie.

59
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,110
Compared to tearing them up,

60
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,670
I'm in a hurry to deal with other difficulties.

61
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,350
This is a previous one.

62
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,710
Just follow it.

63
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,510
Thank you.

64
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:12,150
Rhombus, geometric shape,

65
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,390
bell-type sleeve,

66
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,269
I know every word.

67
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,029
But when I put them together,

68
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:18,269
I don't understand at all.

69
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,910
I really don't understand.

70
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,670
It's just a dress.

71
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,990
Why did they write so many

72
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,230
unreadable words for consumers

73
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,230
who won't read or understand them?

74
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,350
Jie, I'm going to buy braised pork rice from Family Mart.

75
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,510
What do you want to eat?

76
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,510
Braised Pork Rice?

77
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,310
Then what should I eat?

78
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,830
Come on, you're in the fashion industry

79
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,870
and a foreign company.

80
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,870
The calories of braised pork rice are so high.

81
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,350
Don't you want to keep fit?

82
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,070
What do you want to eat?

83
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,030
Vegetables.

84
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,590
Yes, you can only eat vegetables.

85
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,470
If a person can't even

86
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:27,230
control his body,

87
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,190
how can he control his own life?

88
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,830
In this industry,

89
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,590
Size S is superior than size M.

90
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,150
Size L is hard to survive.

91
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,750
Take work food delivery for example.

92
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,310
There's a chain of contempt.

93
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,630
Vegetables eaters look down on boxed lunch eaters.

94
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,110
but they are never as good as

95
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,030
Japanese food eaters.

96
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:44,990
Even salad eaters

97
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,430
are not all equal.

98
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,990
Look, mine is better than Jessie's.

99
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,030
Because mine has vinegar berry

100
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,150
and boiled protein.

101
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:51,909
And hers

102
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,390
has egg yolk.

103
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,230
Read it.

104
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,990
This season's design is full of

105
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:23,230
romantic atmosphere of Proceven.

106
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,790
The S-shape silhouette adds to the beauty and elegance.

107
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,310
When did Provence become

108
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,390
Proceven?

109
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,350
Whether it's A-shaped or S-shaped

110
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,630
you don't know, do you?

111
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,830
Sorry, I can revise it.

112
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,110
Your apology is worthless.

113
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,470
I just want to know

114
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,950
before you send

115
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,630
this flawless email.

116
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,550
Why didn't you ask your colleagues to review it?

117
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,230
You didn't mention it in the email.

118
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,310
I haven't let you breathe yet.

119
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,510
How did you know to breathe?

120
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,710
Please give me another chance.

121
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,950
After all, I just joined this industry.

122
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,070
I have no experience.

123
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,630
I can learn.

124
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,750
The company is not a school.

125
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:00,910
No one is willing to give you a chance to make mistakes.

126
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,310
I've emailed the HR.

127
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:04,230
Go get your salary.

128
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,070
I signed a contract with May

129
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,510
for a year.

130
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,950
If you fire me like this,

131
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,870
I'll report it to the media.

132
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,790
Suit yourself.

133
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,150
Anyway, Du Xiuqi brought you here.

134
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:18,150
It's his business to mind.

135
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,830
But I don't want to leave. I want to be a buyer.

136
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,150
Then I want to be a president.

137
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,190
Young people like you

138
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,830
aren't working for the first time.

139
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,990
Why are you acting so self-righteously

140
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,830
while you're actually very amateur?

141
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,230
I really don't want to waste time with you.

142
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,030
Go now.

143
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,270
Close the door. Thank you.

144
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,670
Director Lei,

145
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,390
I really want to be a buyer.

146
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,390
No matter what it takes,

147
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,470
I will be a buyer

148
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,550
and become the best one.

149
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,230
Tell me the reason first.

150
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,350
My boyfriend dumped me.

151
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,510
That mistress

152
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,110
from what I heard is smart and capable

153
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,110
and is a PR manager of a fashion company.

154
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:16,430
I'm not convinced. I don't want to admit defeat.

155
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:19,310
I'll prove to Lin Sixian that

156
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:20,230
by dumping me

157
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,990
he made the biggest mistake in his life.

158
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,310
So I took part in the reality show

159
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:25,990
and took the offer from PR department

160
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,310
of May.

161
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,670
Because I want to prove

162
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,150
that I can be better

163
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,030
than that woman.

164
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,470
Why don't you go to the PR department?

165
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:36,309
You said

166
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:38,030
there are chains of despicable in the fashion circle.

167
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,789
I checked a lot of information last night.

168
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:41,789
I think it's the same for industry divisions.

169
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,669
PR serves the products.

170
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,110
Products are created by designers.

171
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:46,950
And designers need buyers

172
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,710
to choose them.

173
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,110
So,

174
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,510
on top of the chain of despise in fashion industry

175
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,390
are buyers.

176
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,950
So I want to be a buyer.

177
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,230
I want to know

178
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,670
how it feels to decide someone's fate.

179
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:15,270
Okay, I'll give you a chance.

180
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:17,390
So,

181
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,470
my fate was changed.

182
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,230
Yes, that's too disrespectful.

183
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,870
This...

184
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,270
She's a boss after all.

185
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,990
What are you talking about so happily?

186
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:30,030
Let me help you.

187
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,910
Slowly.

188
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:33,910
Thank you.

189
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:34,990
You're welcome.

190
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,030
What are you talking about?

191
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,390
Nothing.

192
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,630
Put that over there.

193
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:45,030
You must want to know

194
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:47,110
why I'm here.

195
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,190
Because you want to be a buyer,

196
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,190
I have to grant your wish, right?

197
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,630
Why don't you change your English name again?

198
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,950
How about Cinderella?

199
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,310
You can call me Lady Gaga.

200
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,070
Director Lei,

201
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:02,870
You usually cherish words when you send emails.

202
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,270
But you've been talking to me for so long today.

203
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,950
In fact, deep down,

204
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,910
you don't really want to kick me out, do you?

205
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,350
Fine, I'll give you another chance.

206
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,430
The ultimate goal of the buyer

207
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,470
is to sell goods.

208
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,990
The monthly sales target

209
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,310
for each store in May

210
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,150
is 100,000 yuan.

211
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,470
I'll give you half a month.

212
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,110
If your performance reaches 50,000,

213
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,790
you can come back to the Buyer Department.

214
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,990
But...

215
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:30,990
It's up to you whether you do it or not.

216
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,390
50,000 in half a month.

217
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,830
The clothes I bought in my whole life

218
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,310
hasn't cost that much.

219
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,510
But in order to stay in

220
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,630
the Buyer Department,

221
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,070
I have to make it.

222
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,190
Jiang Jie said

223
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:50,350
it's more important to practice

224
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,270
for a newbie to be a veteran.

225
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,830
Welcome. This way, please.

226
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,310
What would you like to see?

227
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,470
Nothing. I'm just looking.

228
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,750
Thank you.

229
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,190
Take a look at these clothes.

230
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,110
It's the latest design of this year.

231
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,310
This one.

232
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,230
This one is on sale.

233
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,110
Take a look.

234
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,270
Thank you.

235
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,310
Welcome.

236
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,030
Hello.

237
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,390
Anything you like?

238
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,390
I want this one.

239
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,430
And this one.

240
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:17,990
Okay.

241
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,630
This way, please.

242
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,830
Watch the steps.

243
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,590
Okay, thank you.

244
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,230
May I help you with the bill?

245
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:27,950
I was just trying on.

246
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,870
Wasting time and energy

247
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,630
on useless people.

248
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:39,190
This is the most common mistake of an amateur.

249
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:41,070
The customer scanned the clothes with a phone when she entered.

250
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:42,670
and tried on several at once.

251
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:43,750
This is obviously that

252
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,070
she found discounts online

253
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,310
and just come here to try the clothes on.

254
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,470
This one

255
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,910
must have an interview nearby.

256
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:51,070
It's not time yet.

257
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,350
She's here to kill time.

258
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,510
A celebrity in reality show?

259
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,470
You have no sense at all.

260
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,350
Ms. Yang, Yike is new here.

261
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:04,550
She hasn't found her way yet.

262
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,270
Teach her when you're free.

263
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,710
Don't worry, manager.

264
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,150
I'll teach her well.

265
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,550
If the customer tells you,

266
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,310
I'll check again.

267
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,030
Don't just stand there.

268
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,430
You have to tell her

269
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,710
I think this color suits you.

270
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,710
or this style

271
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,510
looks good on you.

272
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,510
Keep talking, okay?

273
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,750
Okay, thank you, Ms. Yang.

274
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:24,790
You're welcome.

275
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,910
Welcome.

276
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,150
Hello, how can I help you?

277
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,510
She will succeed this time.

278
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,870
Excuse me.

279
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,190
The fitting room is over there.

280
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,110
We have a skirt

281
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,750
for this dress.

282
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,630
I suggest you

283
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,150
try one set if you want to.

284
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,510
This will be more good-looking.

285
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,630
Let me take you there.

286
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:46,550
Okay.

287
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,030
Here.

288
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,670
Remember to come again.

289
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,430
Bye.

290
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,830
Thank you for coming.

291
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:56,110
Not bad.

292
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,630
How did you think of

293
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,230
put those clothes together?

294
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,870
I just made them

295
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,910
according to the design book.

296
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,230
I think

297
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:06,150
it'll be easier for customers to pick.

298
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,630
I didn't expect it to work.

299
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,190
It does.

300
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,670
But besides these,

301
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,950
you can also practice marketing skills.

302
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,430
I know.

303
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,230
4,300 is still far from 50,000 yuan.

304
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,630
But after all,

305
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:27,470
it's the first order in three days.

306
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:29,390
Good luck!

307
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,470
I'm gonna be like Luffy

308
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,150
to smile at every test.

309
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,870
Whatever. After work,

310
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:34,870
I'm going to study secretly.

311
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,750
Bye.

312
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,510
Bye, manager.

313
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,470
Have a good rest.

314
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:37,990
Bye.

315
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,590
Bye, manager.

316
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,230
Bye.

317
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,030
Goodbye. Please come again.

318
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,430
Hello.

319
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,270
Hello.

320
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,750
What clothes do you want to see?

321
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,670
Which one do you think suits me?

322
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,590
You are so pure and cute.

323
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,390
This one.

324
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:35,630
It's a pity

325
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,470
if you don't buy it.

326
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:38,710
This is a limited edition.

327
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,430
And there's only one left.

328
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,470
How about this?

329
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:42,310
You keep looking.

330
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,750
I'll keep it for you.

331
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,270
This is a limited edition.

332
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:48,470
How about this?

333
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:49,590
You keep looking.

334
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,070
I'll keep it for you.

335
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,710
I know her.

336
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,110
I heard she likes women.

337
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:57,510
She is a lesbian.

338
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,550
A T?

339
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,190
Why a director at the headquarter

340
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:01,630
is still a director in May?

341
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,710
Yes, really.

342
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,230
Director Lei is here.

343
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,870
You want to transfer to Buyer Department?

344
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,590
Yes.

345
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,990
I know every supplier in May

346
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,750
well.

347
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,590
I'm sure we can get the best price.

348
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,910
Then tell me

349
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:26,030
which three would be our most popular

350
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,430
for next spring and summer?

351
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:33,990
I think

352
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:36,910
This, this, and this.

353
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,230
You go back first. I'll think about it.

354
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,190
Thank you, Director Lei.

355
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,230
What were you talking about in the corridor?

356
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,910
We were talking about taking a break.

357
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:51,870
Okay, you can go back.

358
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,110
Hello, have you been tired recently?

359
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,470
Of course.

360
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:02,070
The rest of the Purchase Department

361
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:02,830
are some who are

362
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,550
not gifted but think they're smart.

363
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:06,270
I can only look for someone

364
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,069
from the newbies.

365
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,190
I won't believe

366
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,670
that in such a big company as May,

367
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,310
I can't even find a person

368
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,109
to be a buyer.

369
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:14,750
I have one.

370
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,630
The basics are weak.

371
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,670
Don't just focus

372
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:19,869
on the buyer.

373
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,230
In these days,

374
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,030
many people in May

375
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,790
enquired the headquarter about you.

376
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,270
You and that...

377
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,390
Enough, stop talking.

378
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,990
What year is it now?

379
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,230
You don't even know how to make a form.

380
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:47,510
Do you think you're qualified to be a store manager?

381
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,030
When you get off work tomorrow,

382
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,510
give me the new electronic report

383
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,750
or your resignation letter.

384
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:55,830
The alarm is off.

385
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:56,870
Wanda Shop said

386
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,550
Director Lei's car is already in the inner ring.

387
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,270
She probably went to the shop on Binjiang Road.

388
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:03,550
All right.

389
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,390
Get back to work.

390
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,710
You scared me.

391
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,230
Qin called me

392
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,430
saying she hasn't seen such a way of patrolling

393
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,950
during her 6-year-stay in May.

394
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,110
For one afternoon,

395
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,630
four people were fired

396
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,750
in three shops.

397
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,470
Even speaking to customers

398
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,710
in local dialect was fined.

399
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:21,790
Yike.

400
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:24,110
Aren't you from Buyer Department?

401
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,310
Director Lei,

402
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,990
what kind of person is she?

403
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:28,670
I just came to the company.

404
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,630
How would I know?

405
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,870
What else can it be?

406
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:33,630
A new official who just took up position

407
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,670
would look for sacrifices when she felt upset.

408
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:37,270
I've seen many people like her

409
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,670
who are not capable

410
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,750
but got promoted for unjustified reasons.

411
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:41,710
Ms. Yang,

412
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,390
I suddenly remembered

413
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,790
this scarf just arrived.

414
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,630
Did you make a record?

415
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,550
I did.

416
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,510
She knows only how to make men happy.

417
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,950
She won't be happy for long.

418
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,710
Do you know Meng Shayi,

419
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,430
the beauty CEO?

420
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,190
Let me tell you.

421
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,310
Ms. Yang,

422
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,230
Is this how you tie a rose knot?

423
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,070
Yes.

424
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:02,270
Ding Yike.

425
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,150
What do you mean?

426
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,590
You deliberately

427
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,910
interrupted me?

428
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,710
No.

429
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,430
I really didn't know how to tie.

430
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:12,670
So I wanted to ask you.

431
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:14,230
You're a good actor.

432
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:16,390
It's a pity that you're not an actor.

433
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,110
You've been banished here.

434
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,670
and you're still flattering her.

435
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,670
Ding Yike, you are really something.

436
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,350
Who do you think you are?

437
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,310
All right.

438
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,150
What are you doing?

439
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,910
It's my fault.

440
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:28,150
It's all my fault, manager.

441
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:29,510
I was going to

442
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,870
ask Ms. Yang something.

443
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,310
But she was busy with something else.

444
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:35,870
Sorry, Ms. Yang.

445
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,390
Ms. Yang.

446
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:39,110
Ding is new here.

447
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,710
Please bear with her.

448
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,350
Everyone used to be a newbie.

449
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,750
I know, manager.

450
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,470
Ms. Yang, don't be mad at me.

451
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,870
I'm new here.

452
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,550
I don't understand many things.

453
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,990
Sorry for the trouble.

454
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,710
How about this?

455
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:53,110
I'll buy you milk tea.

456
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:53,910
I'm sorry.

457
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:56,710
All right.

458
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,470
Go back to work.

459
00:19:58,790 --> 00:19:59,510
Alright, Ms. Yang.

460
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:00,270
Don't mind it.

461
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,990
No, I'm not.

462
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,270
Is it my fault?

463
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,270
Hello, Jie.

464
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,310
What took you so long to answer my call?

465
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,190
Listen.

466
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,030
I invented

467
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,030
by myself

468
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,190
a way to deal with gossipers.

469
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,990
It's the people in our shop.

470
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,030
You know

471
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,190
Director Lei

472
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,350
You went out

473
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,990
at 3 p.m.

474
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,870
Ms Ding, you're quite free.

475
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:39,590
No, I...

476
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,190
Who is Yang Qiao?

477
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,030
Me.

478
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,150
According to the Item Exceptions Feedback Form,,

479
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:57,070
you should fill in the process within three days.

480
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,430
Why is there so much empty here?

481
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,590
I've been busy these days,

482
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,670
so I forgot.

483
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:03,910
I'll fix it right away.

484
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:05,950
Go back to your work.

485
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:08,710
Ding Yike.

486
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,390
Director Lei.

487
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,310
Tell me

488
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,030
what should you do with your absenteeism?

489
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,110
I didn't.

490
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:20,190
The manager knows that too.

491
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,350
Does that mean she indulges you?

492
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,230
No.

493
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:26,310
I just remembered that the store has rules

494
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,990
that we can adjust

495
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,510
our lunch break.

496
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,510
I didn't leave the counter this noon,

497
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:33,990
so I can take a break to buy milk tea.

498
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,150
It's not against the rules.

499
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:38,310
If you don't believe me, you can check the CCTV.

500
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:39,710
I didn't rest overtime.

501
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:43,030
It's been a week.

502
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,270
You only sold for over 10,000 yuan

503
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,710
while your target is 50,000.

504
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:46,470
What do you say about it?

505
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,150
Isn't it

506
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,270
that it hasn't been half a month?

507
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,870
I‘m good at catching up.

508
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,030
Catch up.

509
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:56,510
You won't be able to.

510
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,590
I don't think you're cut out for this.

511
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,790
I've seen your reality show.

512
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,350
In the show,

513
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:02,710
you repeatedly and implicitly mentioned

514
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,470
that fashion is useless, vain,

515
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,910
and flashy.

516
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,430
I don't know if these negative impressions

517
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,350
are related to

518
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,310
your rival in the fashion circle?

519
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,310
But I'm sure

520
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,510
a person who hates fashion industry

521
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,190
can never be a good buyer.

522
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:15,470
So I advise

523
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,150
you should leave with dignity.

524
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,030
Since you've seen my show,

525
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,110
you must know

526
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,470
I've been through several challenges

527
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,470
to get

528
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,470
the contract of May.

529
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:25,550
So even for this salary,

530
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,270
I will never resign.

531
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,310
Please stop persuading me to get lost.

532
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,910
I have eight days until the deadline.

533
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,230
Even if I have to risk my life,

534
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,470
I will complete the task.

535
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,230
But the numbers on your performance

536
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,030
can't support

537
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:37,990
your ambitious words.

538
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,150
You can't blame me for poor performance.

539
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,270
The overall performance of Rainbow Shop

540
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,630
has been declining for these two months.

541
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,230
Why compare this way?

542
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,470
The performance is not good.

543
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,070
It's not all our fault.

544
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,390
The company's policy

545
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,950
has many problems.

546
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,150
For example, the price.

547
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,030
The sweater gone viral du to KOL Liu Yunyun.

548
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:58,190
The boyfriend-style sweater.

549
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,070
Sai Ta's price is 488.

550
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,950
Xue Yi Xue's is 399.

551
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,150
Yundu Beauty's is 422.

552
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,470
Only May's is 508.

553
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,190
without any special offers.

554
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,110
Customers are not fools.

555
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,390
For almost the same style,

556
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,470
why do they have to buy ours?

557
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,710
What about the short coat in the jacket series?

558
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,510
The price is not bad.

559
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,710
Sai Ta and Xianggeyun

560
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,150
have higher price than ours.

561
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:25,230
But they designed well.

562
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,150
No matter how old-fashioned I am,

563
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,150
I know the macaron pallette is outdated.

564
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,670
They've been using

565
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,230
moss green, lilac purple,

566
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,510
these colors.

567
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,110
In May, we are still pink.

568
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,790
How did you get these data?

569
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,630
You said

570
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:43,590
the ultimate goal of a buyer is to sell goods.

571
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,590
Of course I have to collect these data

572
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,950
and keep them for analysis.

573
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,470
Did you ask me to come here

574
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,710
just

575
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,910
to be a good salesperson?

576
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,950
A brainless person indeed doesn't deserve

577
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,150
to stay in Buyer Department.

578
00:23:56,790 --> 00:23:57,870
Send me a report

579
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,190
about what you said to me.

580
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,990
Attach with suggestions.

581
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:02,150
Yes, madam.

582
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,790
But

583
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,230
it takes time to write a report.

584
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:08,790
Look.

585
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,430
Do you want to negotiate with me?

586
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,670
Negotiation is also a must-have skill

587
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:14,430
for a buyer to practice.

588
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,390
I don't ask for much.

589
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,550
I just want to lower the sales volume

590
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,830
from 50,000 to 40,000.

591
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,390
Negotiate with me

592
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,030
when you are competent enough.

593
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,350
Goodbye, Director Lei. Goodbye, Director Lei.

594
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,310
Goodbye, Director Lei

595
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,190
Alright, get back to work.

596
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:42,230
You flattered her from distance.

597
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:45,150
In the end, you were still scolded.

598
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,910
You would get lost if you can't fulfill your performance.

599
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:50,270
How dare you talk back to me?

600
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,150
Ms. Yang,

601
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:54,630
Guess what, if I submit my report tomorrow,

602
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,430
your commission this month

603
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,150
will be zero.

604
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:58,470
I don't believe.

605
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,390
some are just stupid.

606
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,830
They insist on training at the grassroot

607
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,310
means a fallen phoenix is worse than a chicken.

608
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,230
It's your fault too.

609
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,830
She's the champion of Men & Women in Workplace.

610
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,870
How could the headquarter

611
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,630
make her a ordinary salesperson?

612
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,550
No.

613
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,510
Although Director Lei looks like a late mother,

614
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,110
but when she left,

615
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,350
she smiled to her.

616
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,550
Ms. Yang, why don't you

617
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,030
stop talking?

618
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:45,510
This is the new market analysis

619
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,630
of our Buyer Deparment.

620
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,550
As you can see,

621
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,670
the sales decline of May

622
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,030
in this season

623
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:52,990
is directly related to Design Department.

624
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,550
So I suggest

625
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,710
the company should adjust

626
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,830
our design system.

627
00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:00,070
Our buyers should

628
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,470
base on the market analysis

629
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,590
and guide Design Department more.

630
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,270
rather than allow our designers

631
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,830
to play around.

632
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,990
Director Lei, you manages too much.

633
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,430
Not only did you mess up the Purchase Department,

634
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:11,990
but now

635
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:13,070
our Design Deparment.

636
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,830
I have no choice.

637
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,630
The headquarter asked me to be responsible for my performance.

638
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:17,950
Of course I have the right

639
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,990
to be strict with everyone.

640
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,710
Director Lei likes

641
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,710
talk about the group.

642
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,150
But I think we should

643
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,510
work hard on ourselves.

644
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,230
Don't always involve other departments.

645
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:31,310
The company has been changing frequently recently.

646
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,590
The sales team is unstable.

647
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,470
which is inevitable.

648
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,510
What do you think, Director Lei?

649
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,750
Don't worry, Director Liu.

650
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,430
The headquarter will soon

651
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,110
investigate your false report of the inventory.

652
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,710
Lei Ou, you're making trouble on purpose.

653
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:45,070
You want the world to be in chaos, right?

654
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:47,510
May is a listed company.

655
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:48,550
Only with clear finance

656
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,790
can we be responsible for the investors.

657
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,790
Am I right?

658
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,550
Mr. Du,

659
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,910
all departments in our company

660
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,470
have always done their own duties.

661
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,430
Now why

662
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,590
the leader of the marketing department

663
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,710
comes to our Design Department

664
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:58,910
to tell us what to do?

665
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,390
The Design Department that can't even figure out

666
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,070
the trendy colors in the market

667
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,110
should be dismissed.

668
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:02,710
You...

669
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,110
Director Luo.

670
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:07,830
Director Lei is sent by the headquarter.

671
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,990
Her opinion represents the headquarter's opinion.

672
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,230
We must listen to it

673
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,350
But Director Lei,

674
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,510
May has always

675
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,350
had our own operation style.

676
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,190
You can't always copy

677
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,190
the experience in the headquarter.

678
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:22,190
After all, we are old-fashioned

679
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,670
who have never gone abroad.

680
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,190
We are neither Mary, Susan,

681
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,270
nor Vincent.

682
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:29,590
What do you think?

683
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:34,750
Who is Vincent?

684
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:35,870
Who else?

685
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,430
Vice President of Lingyun,

686
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:38,750
The CEO of Orange

687
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,630
slapped someone.

688
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,030
That woman's husband?

689
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,030
No wonder Director Lei looked different.

690
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,350
A woman who mibehaved like her

691
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,910
is not confident enough.

692
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,990
Actually, Director Lei

693
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:52,310
is quite capable.

694
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,830
Besides,

695
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,030
that is still a rumor.

696
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,190
Maybe it's a misunderstanding.

697
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,070
Misunderstanding?

698
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,430
Listen.

699
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,390
flies don't bite seamless eggs.

700
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,390
If she acts properly,

701
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,230
why the vice president's wife

702
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,390
didn't slap anyone

703
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,510
except her?

704
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:07,270
And I think

705
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,310
she's a problematic person.

706
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,390
Hello, honey?

707
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,310
No, I'm in May.

708
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:17,310
In the bathroom.

709
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,750
Let me tell you.

710
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,070
I didn't expect

711
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,670
that there are so many gossipers

712
00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:25,470
in a fashion company.

713
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:26,670
Why are these women

714
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,150
act in an unfashionable way?

715
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,070
We are all women, right?

716
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:35,110
But they're better than any man

717
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,510
in humuliating other women

718
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,390
and calling them sluts.

719
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,870
It's embarrassing.

720
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,390
It's really you.

721
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,710
You scared me.

722
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,550
Are you crazy?

723
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,630
Do you want to offend everyone?

724
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,630
Dear,

725
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,750
I just pinched my nose and said it.

726
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,310
Who else can tell that  except you?

727
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:13,790
What did Lei Ou

728
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,350
feed you?

729
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:18,590
She has banished you to the store.

730
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,070
Why are you still helping her?

731
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:23,390
I'm not helping her.

732
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:25,190
People need to have

733
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:27,030
the basic sense of right and wrong.

734
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,350
How many boyfriends does Lei Ou have

735
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,710
is none of their business.

736
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:31,350
They can't beat her in work,

737
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,110
so they bad-mouth her in personal affairs.

738
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,230
It sucks.

739
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,350
They said

740
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,190
they want to be the Chanel in China.

741
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,950
Chanel have had

742
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:41,950
many boyfriends.

743
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,630
Why are you getting more and more angry now?

744
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:46,550
I remember you weren't like this before.

745
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:54,270
A breakup

746
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,670
is like rebirth.

747
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,990
What do I hate to hear the most now?

748
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:58,990
A fly doesn't bite the seamless egg.

749
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,510
A slap doesn't make a sound.

750
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:02,030
I'll slap her

751
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,070
and see if it makes a sound.

752
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,070
Alright, baby.

753
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,430
It's all in the past.

754
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,390
It's okay. Let's go.

755
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,230
Let's go.

756
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:40,990
By the way,

757
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,310
why are you here now?

758
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,630
The indicators are all done today.

759
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,510
Lei Ou is quite efficient.

760
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,590
Not long after she went back yesterday,

761
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:48,790
she gave all the stores

762
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,510
10% of the bid price for promotion.

763
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,550
I made another big order this afternoon.

764
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,270
So I don't have to work overtime today.

765
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,230
By the way, I have something to discuss with you.

766
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,750
Your bag is a Louis Vuitton bag, right?

767
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,150
Can I borrow it?

768
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,030
Just for one day.

769
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:09,070
Borrow the bag for what?

770
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:13,750
My college classmate

771
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,990
is having a birthday party tomorrow.

772
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,670
I want to go.

773
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,790
You must go

774
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:20,110
and dress beautifully

775
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:22,030
to kill Lin Sixian,

776
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,390
making him regret it so much.

777
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,030
What are you going to wear tomorrow?

778
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,150
Is it a floral shirt again?

779
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:32,950
No way.

780
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,830
I'm at least

781
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:35,870
working in the fashion circle.

782
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:37,390
There's a sample of a black dress in the store.

783
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:37,950
It looks nice.

784
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:38,790
I borrowed it from manager.

785
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:39,670
And you

786
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,750
know nothing at all.

787
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,430
Why are you here?

788
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,310
Choose clothes and shoes.

789
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,910
Think about it.

790
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,790
Since the mistress is a PR agent in Zuantai,

791
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,390
she must have worn a lot

792
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:56,990
black skirts.

793
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,510
You?

794
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,630
You're not used to wearing high heels.

795
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,950
How can you compete with her?

796
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,590
She won't come.

797
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:06,510
Whether she comes or not,

798
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,350
you have to let Lin Sixian learn something new.

799
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:10,950
In a classmates reunion party,

800
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:11,830
you should make

801
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,430
the boys want to flirt with you,

802
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,270
and the girls want to hit you.

803
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:16,990
otherwise there's no need to go.

804
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:23,070
Here, try these on.

805
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,350
Can I do this?

806
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,910
I should get the manager's permission.

807
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,230
Why do you care so much?

808
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,430
Didn't Lei Ou ask you

809
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,590
to choose clothes here?

810
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,870
There are so many clothes here.

811
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,030
Who can remember them?

812
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,350
It's just for one day anyway.

813
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,830
Nobody would know.

814
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:39,870
By then,

815
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,630
Director Lei.

816
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,190
Busy?

817
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:45,670
No. Yes.

818
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:47,990
Go on.

819
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,030
I don't care.

820
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,990
You are off duty.

821
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,550
Then just this black and white outfit.

822
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:56,110
Black and white are classic.

823
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:56,550
Yes.

824
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,470
Good.

825
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,430
Go ahead.

826
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,990
How do you know if it fits without trying?

827
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:03,470
Do you really think you're a supermodel?

828
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,550
You look good even in a piece of rag.

829
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,030
Jiang Jie, tell me

830
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:35,630
why you chose that outfit

831
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,310
for her?

832
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,590
White shirt and black pants.

833
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,590
is a classic combination of YSL.

834
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:46,350
Industry insiders say it is omnipotent.

835
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,190
It means

836
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,990
when you don't know what to wear,

837
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,510
it's always right to wear this combination.

838
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,630
Yike. Your hair.

839
00:33:58,910 --> 00:33:59,510
Okay.

840
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:02,110
Director Lei, look.

841
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:02,790
Not bad, right?

842
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,150
Trash.

843
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,710
Not all clothes

844
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,510
can be called a smoking suit.

845
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:14,670
Bring the clothes A07 and B09

846
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,590
in the display cabinet.

847
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,870
Go get changed.

848
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:32,510
I'll go then.

849
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:11,230
What do you think?

850
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,830
It's also white shirt and black dress.

851
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,750
Why are they so different?

852
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,150
You tell her.

853
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,670
This should be made by Egyptian cotton

854
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,710
over 200 counts.

855
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,550
Wrong.

856
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,030
It's 300 counts

857
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,550
island cotton from the West Indies.

858
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:31,790
That's why it's as light as silk

859
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,230
but is till supportive.

860
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,990
It has beautiful silouette.

861
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,910
Plus the slant cut,

862
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,630
the fabric seems floating.

863
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:41,270
This is the quality of high fashion.

864
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:44,190
There's a pair of black earrings over there.

865
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:44,910
Bring it.

866
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,230
Put it on and take a picture.

867
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,830
Is it beautiful?

868
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,870
Do you still think fashion is hypocritical

869
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,630
and vain?

870
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:20,870
Go.

871
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,550
Come back with a beautiful victory.

872
00:36:22,870 --> 00:36:23,710
But remember,

873
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,670
get your hair done

874
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,550
before that.

875
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:29,470
Okay.

876
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,510
Sorry, I'm late.

877
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,630
Is this the Yike, our classmate?

878
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,190
Yes.

879
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,830
I don't even dare to admit it.

880
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:53,710
That's right.

881
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,470
Let the class monitor see.

882
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:56,390
What did you do

883
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,310
to yourself?

884
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:01,150
You stupid men.

885
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,030
Yike is a celebrity now.

886
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,790
She's changed, you know?

887
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,670
The eyeliner is so beautiful.

888
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,830
Is it made by a makeup artist?

889
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,550
No, I did it at home.

890
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,390
By the way,

891
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:15,390
Happy birthday.

892
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:16,150
Thank you.

893
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,990
Yike, I have to criticize you.

894
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:21,470
You look so beautiful tonight.

895
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:22,670
You even brought Louis Vuitton.

896
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,630
What?

897
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:26,350
Are you trying to steal the limelight with our birthday girl?

898
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:27,750
No.

899
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,950
I’m here to be a sidekick.

900
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,150
When there are too many women, the chaos will rise.

901
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:34,110
Yike. Come, sit here.

902
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:34,830
No one bothers you here.

903
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:35,550
Yes, come on.

904
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,030
OK.

905
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,110
Don't just talk.

906
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:38,030
Have a seat.

907
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,150
Come, have a seat.

908
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,110
Come on.

909
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,710
I know

910
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,750
why you look so beautiful today.

911
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:49,310
Am I right?

912
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,870
Speak of the devil.

913
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:54,310
Indeed.

914
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:54,990
I'm sorry.

915
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:56,630
-I'm late. -You finally come.

916
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,910
There's always traffic jam.

917
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:01,630
Come, have a seat.

918
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,950
Have a seat, handsome guy.

919
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,670
Today is our old classmate,

920
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:05,590
Ling Ling's birthday.

921
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:07,030
Happy birthday to her.

922
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,150
Come on.

923
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,950
Happy birthday.

924
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,230
Happy birthday.

925
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:14,630
Don't sit idle.

926
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,150
Eat up.

927
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,070
Yes. Eat up.

928
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:16,910
The wine is good this time.

929
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:18,990
Let's sing a birthday song for the birthday girl.

930
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:22,710
Happy birthday to you

931
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:26,350
Happy birthday to you

932
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:29,710
Happy birthday to you

933
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,470
Thank you.

934
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:31,750
Happy birthday.

935
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,710
Thank you.

936
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,390
Happy birthday.

937
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,070
Monitor.

938
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,110
Long time no see.

939
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,150
Long time no see.

940
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,950
How have you been?

941
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,070
Not bad.

942
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,790
Yike looks so different tonight.

943
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:46,870
I almost didn't recognize her.

944
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:47,470
Really?

945
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,110
Yes.

946
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,070
Look at the monitor.

947
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,550
He's still our former class monitor.

948
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:55,070
You've changed a lot.

949
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:55,990
Monitor,

950
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:57,550
I don't feel well.

951
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,430
I need some fresh air.

952
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,710
Okay, go ahead.

953
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:00,790
You've gained much weight since I last saw you.

954
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:01,230
Really?

955
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,150
Yes, did you watch it?

956
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:02,870
Did you watch my show?

957
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,670
Of course.

958
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,150
Let me tell you.

959
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,750
My girlfriend is your fan now.

960
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,150
Really?

961
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:11,790
Okay. Thank you.

962
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:32,990
Thank you.

963
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,270
You're welcome.

964
00:40:38,350 --> 00:40:38,990
Yike.

965
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,750
You look pretty today.

966
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,270
Really?

967
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:52,990
Thank you.

968
00:40:57,470 --> 00:40:59,230
How are you doing in the new company?

969
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:02,190
I'm fine. I'm just busy.

970
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,150
By the way,

971
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,790
I've been watching your reality show.

972
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,190
Really?

973
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:12,950
Thank you.

974
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,230
You didn't see

975
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,990
how pretentious she was just now.

976
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,110
She drank water

977
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,230
like a chicken,

978
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:21,110
sip by sip.

979
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:23,350
She really thinks she's become a goddess

980
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,790
from a leftover woman.

981
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:25,790
and can make Lin Sixian

982
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,270
change his mind immediately?

983
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:32,150
That's right. And she performed miserably in the show,

984
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:34,830
saying she was dumped and unemployed.

985
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:37,070
If she is so innocent,

986
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,750
why after being together for so many years.

987
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,590
Lin Sixian

988
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,230
would suddenly dump her.

989
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,270
It must be her

990
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,350
own problem.

991
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,590
-Don't you think so? -Yike, Yike...

992
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:47,310
Say it. If she...

993
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,510
Go on.

994
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:51,150
Liu Shan, it's a pity that

995
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,390
you're not a screenwriter.

996
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,670
Shanshan, you misunderstood.

997
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:56,710
Because I don't care about her enough,

998
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:57,910
so she broke up with me.

999
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:58,830
I didn't dump her.

1000
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:00,150
That's right.

1001
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,590
Just kidding.

1002
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:04,670
We are old classmates.

1003
00:42:05,030 --> 00:42:06,830
Let's forget about it.

1004
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,790
I have the final say.

1005
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,350
Who do you think you are?

1006
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:14,150
Ding Yike, stop it.

1007
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:15,430
Lin Sixian was saving you face,

1008
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,790
and you're taking advantage of it.

1009
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,390
Everyone knows

1010
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,870
his current girlfriend

1011
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,550
is beautiful and virtuous.

1012
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,190
She's 100 times better than you.

1013
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,470
With your bad temper,

1014
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,990
anyone would break up with you.

1015
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:28,270
Say that again!

1016
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:28,990
What are you doing?

1017
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:29,670
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1018
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:30,110
Splash it.

1019
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:30,630
Yike.

1020
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:31,390
Say that again!

1021
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:32,510
Yike.

1022
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:33,510
Let go of me!

1023
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:34,950
Yike.

1024
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:37,630
Come here! Liu Shan!

1025
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,350
Liu Shan, don't run if you dare!

1026
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,590
Stop!

1027
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:42,910
Stop!

1028
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:44,670
Stop!

1029
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:46,910
Liu Shan.

1030
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,830
Yike. Yike.

1031
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:49,430
Forget it.

1032
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:50,230
We're classmates.

1033
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:51,470
Sixian, let go of me!

1034
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,030
-Calm down, Yike. -Let go of me.

1035
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,510
I must teach her a lesson today.

1036
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,270
Forget it.

1037
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,910
