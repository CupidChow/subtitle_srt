1
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,680
Please come in.

2
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,920
Uncle, sorry to keep you waiting.

3
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,320
Wenwen.

4
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,800
Long time no see. You're pretty again.

5
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,320
Here, sit here.

6
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,640
Thank you.

7
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,040
This is Lin.

8
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,120
Hello, Mr. Xu.

9
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,760
You're welcome.

10
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,840
Just call me uncle with Wenwen.

11
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,360
I was in a hurry, so I ordered a few dishes.

12
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,640
I don't know if you like them.

13
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,280
It’s fine. It’s already a feast.

14
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,040
Lin.

15
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,200
Wenwen told me that you want to come to Chenxing.

16
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,440
Private funds are much more challenging than public funds.

17
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,440
Are you ready?

18
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,400
My research last year

19
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,960
was the highest score in our company.

20
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,880
And...

21
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,720
You're really young.

22
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,760
Who cares about the research?

23
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,000
In private,

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,920
performance is always the only standard.

25
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,280
Yes.

26
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,480
Uncle.

27
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,000
You've been

28
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,120
for five years.

29
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,640
Of course.

30
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,960
Sa Hyun is just

31
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,080
a senior employee.

32
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,120
Look, you're going out already.

33
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,040
Wenwen has been torturing me for you.

34
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,040
Be good to her.

35
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,480
Otherwise, I won't forgive you.

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,880
Sure.

37
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,440
I've read your information.

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,440
I'm experienced.

39
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,160
The school is not Beijing.

40
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,320
nor a registered financial analyst

41
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,400
in business management.

42
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,360
You're a little inferior.

43
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,640
Normally,

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,800
in this situation.

45
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,960
But since Wenwen told me,

46
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,240
I'm willing to give you this chance.

47
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,040
How about this?

48
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,360
Next time,

49
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,560
I'll give you the phone number of HR.

50
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Talk to them about your employment.

51
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,520
Thank you, uncle.

52
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,760
Thank you, uncle.

53
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,160
I knew you were the best to me.

54
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,200
I watched you grow up.

55
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,320
How could I not treat you well?

56
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,480
Bye.

57
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,240
Are you happy?

58
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,040
From now on, you belong to the morning star.

59
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,159
I'm happy.

60
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,360
What's wrong with you?

61
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,840
Did you just...

62
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,400
Uncle said you were unhappy

63
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,240
Are you upset?

64
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,159
No.

65
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,920
When I first joined the company,

66
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,600
they looked down on me.

67
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,960
They said I didn't graduate from a prestigious university.

68
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,360
I majored in luxury management.

69
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,040
What about now?

70
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,280
They are all my subordinates.

71
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,840
Sa Hyun.

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,040
I think a smart and capable person like you

73
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,840
should know the truth better than me.

74
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,120
I'm not as capable as you.

75
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,240
I'm just luckier than you.

76
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,760
to find

77
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,960
like you.

78
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,760
You're so sweet now.

79
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,240
Why were you so nervous

80
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,640
Why can't you let go?

81
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,800
Just now...

82
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,160
It's our first meeting

83
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,520
I'm a little shy.

84
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,040
Bye.

85
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,600
Sir, let's go to JiangHuai Building.

86
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,280
Hurry up.

87
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,320
Hello, Mr Chen.

88
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,800
I'm sorry.

89
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,920
My phone was muted. I was in a meeting.

90
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,240
Yes.

91
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:26,880
Hello?

92
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,440
I had something urgent

93
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,760
Something urgent came up.

94
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:31,840
Yes.

95
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,440
But I'm on my way to the office.

96
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,400
In the car.

97
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,360
Mom.

98
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,480
Where are you?

99
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,560
Why didn't you reply

100
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,040
for over an hour?

101
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,520
Really? Great.

102
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,360
Wenwen

103
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,680
I have nothing to say.

104
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,480
Mom likes it very much.

105
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,520
Tell her to come back for dinner tomorrow.

106
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,000
I'll make her the best food.

107
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,080
Remember.

108
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,800
to buy her a gift.

109
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,080
She put a lot of effort into this.

110
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,520
Without her,

111
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,760
you wouldn't have

112
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,000
such a big company?

113
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,280
Mom, I see.

114
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,640
Anything else?

115
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,400
Yes.

116
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,040
send a message to thank her uncle.

117
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,880
Let him know

118
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,360
your future nephew-in-law is polite.

119
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,160
I'll take care of you more in the company.

120
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,000
Mom! Mom!

121
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,040
I beg you.

122
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,480
Stop teaching me to fawn on others.

123
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,240
OK?

124
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,280
I can do it myself.

125
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,920
I don't rely on others or other connections.

126
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,400
I can still get into other funds.

127
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,280
Got it?

128
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,840
Feifei.

129
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,960
Again kick you

130
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,840
Become the landlady

131
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,880
She's two meters tall. Good.

132
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,080
How dare you talk like that?

133
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,400
Take it. This is for you.

134
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,320
This is...

135
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,480
Oh my god.

136
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,200
Prince Charming.

137
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,760
Can you take me as your second wife?

138
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,920
I think about you, right?

139
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,240
I'll go upstairs first.

140
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,360
Do you want to get changed?

141
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,600
Let's have dinner together tonight.

142
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,280
Sure.

143
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,880
Western food.

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,680
Bye.

145
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
I really want to burn

146
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,360
burn you to death.

147
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,720
who got a good man.

148
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,920
Get lost!

149
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,480
By the way, Prince Charming,

150
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,480
Mr. Sakata

151
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,680
sent a fax upstairs.

152
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,040
Remember to take a look.

153
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,280
What era is this? Fax?

154
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,280
Only Japanese love fax.

155
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,360
You have no idea.

156
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,680
that your friend

157
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,960
The hair record.

158
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,679
It's all fax.

159
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,280
They don't send emails.

160
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,200
To be honest,

161
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,880
When we first met,

162
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,240
Caramel pudding is very delicious.

163
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,680
Remember to pack one for me tonight.

164
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,600
Nice to meet you.

165
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,720
You need to

166
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,560
in the evening.

167
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,320
I booked it for Prince Charming.

168
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,880
Okay, no problem.

169
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,360
Wait, I have to answer a call.

170
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,640
Hello?

171
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,520
Yes, it's me.

172
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,480
I'll go back now.

173
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,240
Coco.

174
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,960
Take a look.

175
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,200
the third photo

176
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,320
in my WeChat assistant.

177
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,640
What's that?

178
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,400
Take a look.

179
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,080
Okay, wait a moment.

180
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,040
Let me take a look.

181
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,560
The first one is

182
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,000
93% mulberry silk.

183
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,400
100% lamb hair.

184
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,360
The second one

185
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,960
is 100% lamb hair.

186
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,800
Yes.

187
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,360
It's very little.

188
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:29,800
Our boss

189
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,720
went to New Zealand to pick them for you.

190
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,440
Yes, too little.

191
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:33,920
Okay.

192
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,360
I'll keep an eye on these two.

193
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,280
What would you like to drink?

194
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,000
Red wine or holy water?

195
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,640
Which one do you want?

196
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,920
Let's drink wine today.

197
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,120
What do you think?

198
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,600
I want to drink soju.

199
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,760
Okay, let's order a champagne.

200
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,680
It's okay. Let's make wine.

201
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,920
It's cheap,

202
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,680
It's not as expensive as champagne

203
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,040
but still beautiful.

204
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,800
You're a big boss. I'll listen to you.

205
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,800
Why are you suddenly

206
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,320
so generous today?

207
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,200
I've always been like this.

208
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,360
Have you forgotten?

209
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,520
When we first met,

210
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,240
I just broke up.

211
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,160
The whole cafe

212
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,480
Cover your ears.

213
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,040
You were really ugly back then.

214
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,760
Everyone was looking at you.

215
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,200
and tears.

216
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,280
I was wondering.

217
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,320
why

218
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,040
fall in love with you?

219
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,480
It must be you who brought me a curse.

220
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,880
What was Leo like before?

221
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,440
Tell me.

222
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,280
My colleague who bought hands

223
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,240
checked Guge and Baidu.

224
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,200
But her experience before 25

225
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,480
before 25.

226
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,360
She wasn't Leo before.

227
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,280
She changed her name. Why?

228
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,240
Some people

229
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,640
doesn't want to talk about the past.

230
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,720
Since she doesn't want to tell us,

231
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,360
why should we care?

232
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,480
She used to be excellent.

233
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,840
and sharp.

234
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,960
She's different from now.

235
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,200
But even if I see her cold,

236
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,160
the fire in her eyes

237
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,000
in her eyes.

238
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,200
So you want to use the cooperation with Oh-wol

239
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,120
to light up her flame again?

240
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,120
You know me best.

241
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,560
You know me well.

242
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,720
It seems that

243
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,360
heard us badmouthing her.

244
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,600
Hello?

245
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,920
Photographer, right?

246
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,480
No problem. You met Qian last time.

247
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,280
Yes.

248
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,640
I'll coordinate.

249
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,800
Just a few minutes.

250
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,520
Give it to

251
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,480
to our legal department, okay?

252
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,240
Of course.

253
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,600
I won't be too harsh.

254
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,400
I can only work with May for one year.

255
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,640
Okay.

256
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,560
It's different from your usual garments.

257
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,720
I need to use the bathroom.

258
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,480
No problem.

259
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,880
It's about tax.

260
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,920
Do you know

261
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,040
asked me?

262
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,240
He said...

263
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,200
Miss, what are you looking at?

264
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,800
Hey!

265
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,600
A cartoon called One Piece.

266
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Is it funny?

267
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,800
Not really.

268
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,080
I just don't want to cry.

269
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,680
So I can only laugh.

270
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,120
Sa Hyun.

271
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,120
Why are you here?

272
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,080
Are you passing by?

273
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,920
No.

274
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,640
Your mom sent you something.

275
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,840
It's my address.

276
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,680
So I brought it here.

277
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,280
My mom said you live nearby.

278
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,360
Thank you. Thank you.

279
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,000
This is heavy.

280
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,080
Let me carry it to you.

281
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,440
Where do you live?

282
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,280
It's okay.

283
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,880
I can carry it myself.

284
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,800
I'll go up first.

285
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,200
I have a stomachache.

286
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,440
Can I go to your place

287
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,680
to take some medicine?

288
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,040
Okay.

289
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,440
Can we talk about the rest tomorrow?

290
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,680
Bye.

291
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,600
Bill, please.

292
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,200
Bill, please.

293
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,440
The lady just bought it.

294
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,600
When did she leave?

295
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,680
It's been a while.

296
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,680
Thank you.

297
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,400
Come in.

298
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,400
Let me get you some water.

299
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,119
Okay.

300
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,800
Take your medicine.

301
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,520
It's too hot. Drink it when it's cold.

302
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,080
Since we...

303
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,400
You've been living here?

304
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,440
Yes, it's very convenient here.

305
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,720
It's close to the company.

306
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,520
Even if you join a fashion company,

307
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,280
you don't want to spend money.

308
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,480
You're so generous.

309
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,160
If you have the money, why don't you save it first?

310
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,280
I'm sorry.

311
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,360
Actually,

312
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,920
to persuade you now.

313
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,680
I'm the one who should apologize.

314
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,320
If I told my mom earlier

315
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,200
we broke up,

316
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,560
I don't need to bother you.

317
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,640
You're welcome.

318
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,360
Are you not going to treat me as a friend?

319
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,840
No way.

320
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,080
You've changed.

321
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,680
You never

322
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,080
talk to me like this.

323
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,040
But I've changed too.

324
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,520
In the past,

325
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,240
in a bad mood,

326
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,240
he came to his ex's house to smoke.

327
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,640
and made excuses on purpose.

328
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,920
to come up and sit down.

329
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,320
I can never do that.

330
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,400
How do you feel?

331
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,800
You finally confessed to me.

332
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,360
You had another girlfriend

333
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,440
before me.

334
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,600
Take your medicine and leave.

335
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,400
I was wrong.

336
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,960
He must have given you that bag.

337
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,120
You're right.

338
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,840
After all, he is an international designer.

339
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,080
He's capable.

340
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,440
Is he good to you?

341
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,400
Yes.

342
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,120
Look at that teddy bear.

343
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,880
We clipped the doll together.

344
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,800
And that bag

345
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,280
We bought it together.

346
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,240
We just

347
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,680
with you just now. You're lying.

348
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,800
We've been together for so long.

349
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,880
Are you really happy?

350
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,640
Are you really happy?

351
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,320
I can see that.

352
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,280
I can feel it too.

353
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,360
If he really treats you so well,

354
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,680
you wouldn't have come back alone.

355
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,560
Am I wrong?

356
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,680
[The person you have reached is unavailable.]

357
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:43,760
Here.

358
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,520
No need.

359
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,360
Thank you.

360
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,400
You're right.

361
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,000
Things didn't go well between us.

362
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,560
But it's not strange.

363
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,200
Just like in the past,

364
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,520
you thought I was not good enough.

365
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,680
Besides, an international guy like him

366
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,720
would never trust me.

367
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,400
Fortunately, I've figured it out.

368
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,040
It's like

369
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,360
a love game.

370
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,680
It's not bad

371
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,720
to play with me for a while.

372
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,920
At least,

373
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,840
he can teach me a lot.

374
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,200
So don't pity me.

375
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,120
Take your medicine.

376
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,680
If you're late,

377
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,200
your girlfriend or your mom

378
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,520
will be worried.

379
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:53,760
What's wrong?

380
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,800
Sa Hyun, are you okay?

381
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,080
Sa Hyun.

382
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,400
Are you okay?

383
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,360
Yes.

384
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,120
Thank you.

385
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,520
You saved my life.

386
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,560
You don't have to repay me.

387
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,320
Be happy in the future.

388
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,960
and have a baby with your girlfriend.

389
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,280
Also,

390
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,000
don't come here again.

391
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,920
I'm afraid my boyfriend will misunderstand.

392
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,200
Okay?

393
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,800
I wish you happiness.

394
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,760
I wish you happiness too.

395
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,440
What's going on?

396
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,640
Zhao Moyuan.

397
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,800
Can you save some self-esteem for yourself?

398
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,400
Leo.

399
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,320
Why didn't you tell me

400
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,480
when we met yesterday?

401
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,280
If I hadn't read the email when I was working,

402
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,200
didn't you go to

403
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,560
with Mr. Bai yesterday?

404
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,920
I'm afraid he might find out.

405
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,560
that his trusted aide was slapped in the face.

406
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,800
I'm not feeling well.

407
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,520
But you saw the email.

408
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,640
Then say something. Who do you support?

409
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,680
Of course I support you.

410
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,840
Although Yu

411
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,440
has been with my father for more than 20 years,

412
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,880
But he doesn't know what's important

413
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,040
with an important project.

414
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,200
I can't stand that.

415
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,640
I'm sorry.

416
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,360
Why are you sorry?

417
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,640
I thought

418
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,520
these old ministers

419
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,360
have put their mind at ease.

420
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,160
But I didn't expect

421
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,240
to protect me.

422
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,480
It's not necessary.

423
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,040
You can handle this impartially.

424
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,600
Leo, let's not

425
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,480
everything clearly, okay?

426
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,120
Did I?

427
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,800
I guess I'm used to it.

428
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
Do you know why I named myself

429
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,120
named Leo?

430
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,120
I want to be like a lion.

431
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,960
The lion

432
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,840
other than the resuscitation of everything,

433
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,840
physical factors,

434
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,560
I've been hunting alone for most of my time.

435
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,600
I'll get going.

436
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,920
There are a lot of people in the company.

437
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,400
Take action in five minutes.

438
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,960
What is it?

439
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,560
The communication between Zhao Moyuan and May.

440
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,440
I want to quit.

441
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,400
Come in and talk. Close the door.

442
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,520
Why?

443
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,440
Zhao Moyuan broke up with me yesterday.

444
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,280
Your eyes are normal.

445
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,480
No crying, no insomnia.

446
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,840
There's no insomnia.

447
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,880
can't be solved by a meteorosin.

448
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,440
If not, two.

449
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,120
You're quite calm.

450
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,360
Go on.

451
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,000
Why did you break up?

452
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,240
He cheated on me and had a fight.

453
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,960
Or did he forget something?

454
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,360
I repeat.

455
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,600
Zhao Moyuan texted me on WeChat

456
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,640
to break up with me.

457
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,000
As for the reason,

458
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,840
maybe because last night,

459
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,480
last night.

460
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,160
He left after his work call.

461
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,720
That's why he hurt his pride.

462
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,880
In a situation like this,

463
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,440
I'm not suitable

464
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,920
to communicate with him.

465
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,960
But I still want to

466
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,800
other parts of this project.

467
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,760
If you're willing,

468
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
you can use me as an article.

469
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,720
and make those higher-ups think

470
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,080
our cooperation

471
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,240
is really in danger.

472
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,320
and then clean up

473
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,680
those obstacles.

474
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,320
I have to thank you

475
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,560
for sacrificing yourself for me.

476
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,480
Ding Yike.

477
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,040
If you really want to help me,

478
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,400
please take back

479
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,840
your arrogant temper.

480
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,040
Go ask Zhao Moyuan.

481
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,520
what happened

482
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,880
between you two?

483
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,520
What if he also

484
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,880
and stop playing with Oh-wol?

485
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,840
No.

486
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,720
The only reason he cooperated with Oh-wol

487
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,400
is you.

488
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,640
You might have forgotten him.

489
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,320
But all these years,

490
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,880
in his heart,

491
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,880
you've always been his only goddess.

492
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,080
In the beginning,

493
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,240
I was just

494
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,480
to get close to you.

495
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,440
I think you think too much.

496
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,000
Okay, I got it.

497
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,240
Go back to work.

498
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:23,920
Thank you.

499
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,480
Xu,

500
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,600
Your sales data hasn't been updated.

501
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,600
Yes, I'll patrol the shop this afternoon.

502
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,200
Okay, let's meet and talk.

503
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,400
Hello, Manager Deng.

504
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,640
I'm Coco from May.

505
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,280
These data

506
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,000
are very urgent today.

507
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,040
But the goods are in a hurry.

508
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,920
I hope it can be delivered next Wednesday.

509
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,080
Okay.

510
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,640
Okay, no problem. I'll check.

511
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,320
Okay, bye.

512
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,080
Xiaojie.

513
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,960
When you were in Trida,

514
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,400
we purchased the ingredients ourselves

515
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,240
or seasoning?

516
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,000
If it's less than 5,000 pieces,

517
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,320
I'll let them do it.

518
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,240
When you collect the goods,

519
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,160
ask the quality management

520
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,280
Keep a close eye on it.

521
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,040
Okay.

522
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,160
What's wrong with you today?

523
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,640
I was particularly excited this morning.

524
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,840
I'm so busy.

525
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,320
The love line is broken.

526
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,560
I have to catch up with my career line.

527
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,680
I'm kidding. I'm going to copy it.

528
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,160
Oh, right.

529
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,560
There will be a Asura field over there.

530
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,280
What about you?

531
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,680
see if there's any mole in HR.

532
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,800
You can collect some gossip.

533
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:31,920
Okay.

534
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,400
[Your call cannot be connected.]

535
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,640
Please wait.

536
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:43,920
I'm sorry, miss.

537
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,400
We can't take photos here.

538
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,240
Boss.

539
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,920
You've watched it for a while.

540
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,400
That's enough. Thank you.

541
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,360
You're welcome.

542
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,520
Our boss is...

543
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,120
Let's go downstairs.

544
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,800
There's more downstairs.

545
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,680
Xu Fei, come here.

546
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,040
Give me your phone.

547
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,040
What are you doing?

548
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:01,760
Let me use it.

549
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,240
Here.

550
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:15,120
Feifei, what's the matter?

551
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
Not only the corporate resource program system needs to be reformed,

552
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,520
but also the style of May

553
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,280
has to be reformed.

554
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,400
We're a co-investment company now.

555
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,800
It's not someone's place to stay.

556
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,120
Director Lei,

557
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,720
About the reform

558
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,600
about the reform.

559
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,760
I want to hear your opinion.

560
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,640
to upgrade

561
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,560
corporate resource program system.

562
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,880
It's a big project.

563
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,480
I don't think the company

564
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,760
in such a hurry.

565
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,360
Okay, that's all for today.

566
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,040
Dismiss.

567
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,600
Director Lei, please stay here.

568
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,000
I have something to tell you.

569
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
Why are you so nervous?

570
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,480
Nothing.

571
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,159
You rub your hands whenever you're nervous.

572
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,639
Look at you. Your hands are red.

573
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,400
You caught me.

574
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,440
A friend from the headquarters

575
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,560
sent me a message.

576
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,440
He said there's something wrong

577
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,440
in the PR budget.

578
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,360
Lingyun's buddies

579
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,520
are really stingy.

580
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,040
She insisted on waiting for the CEO Linda

581
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,440
to Shanghai,

582
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,760
I'll decide after seeing the sample.

583
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,600
How can we make it?

584
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,320
Zhao Moyuan’s blueprints are not complete yet.

585
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,120
We can't decide the fabric.

586
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,639
let alone sample clothes.

587
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,440
Those big shots don't care about that.

588
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,360
So the most important thing now

589
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,400
I’ll go to Zhao Moyuan’s studio

590
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,719
to knock on the door with him.

591
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,280
Over there!

592
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,160
Leo!

593
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,720
What are you doing here?

594
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,160
Coco said she couldn't come.

595
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,280
Please go out for coffee.

596
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,040
I have something to discuss with Patrick.

597
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,880
Slit, wrinkle.

598
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,240
The combination of light fabric and thick fabric.

599
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,680
Now I know

600
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,040
why I have a strange feeling

601
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,560
your design?

602
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,680
You know everything?

603
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,800
Tell me.

604
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,880
When did you start copying me?

605
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,840
The first year I went to St. Martin.

606
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,240
From the first time

607
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,640
at Peter's exhibition room,

608
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,280
in Peter's exhibition room,

609
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,320
you've been my inspiration.

610
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,600
Xiuqi called me.

611
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,040
You are too reckless.

612
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,320
You didn't discuss with me

613
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,200
without consulting me.

614
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,800
Now you lost.

615
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,440
You came back to me to hit the clock.

616
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,760
It’s too late.

617
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,240
Mr. Du, it's not that simple.

618
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,880
I found that there's always

619
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,280
always flirt with each other.

620
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,200
Many things

621
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,000
for many things.

622
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:27,920
What?

623
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,480
Mr Shen, the fruit is tiring.

624
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,080
These photos

625
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,200
were taken by me

626
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,360
in Zhao Moyuan's studio.

627
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,400
in Zhao Yuyuan's studio.

628
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,880
These two fabrics

629
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,440
are the fabric

630
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,880
for sample dresses.

631
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,040
The fruit is exhausted.

632
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,840
That's it for now.

633
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,880
Their design progress

634
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,960
is like this.

635
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,680
Actually, Mr Shen,

636
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,640
I don't know if I should say this.

637
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,400
Go ahead.

638
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,440
I think we should deal with Zhao Moyuan.

639
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,200
Is it not enough

640
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,320
not enough?

641
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,080
We're too passive now.

642
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:30,360
What if he didn't change it?

643
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,040
I mean what if.

644
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,440
But we can't

645
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,600
let him go.

646
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,200
What do you think?

647
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,720
I think we should take the initiative.

648
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,480
and think of other ways.

649
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,440
For example, find someone to check the fire from a distance store.

650
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,480
taxes,

651
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,760
Or find someone to check

652
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,280
any violations?

653
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,560
Or later,

654
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,120
find someone to steal that dress.

655
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,560
Say that again.

656
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,320
I said to find someone

657
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,400
to steal that dress.

658
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,080
Say it again.

659
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,040
Do you think

660
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,000
I'm as despicable as Zhao Moyuan?

661
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,360
No, no.

662
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,640
Do you think

663
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,840
Oh-wol won't care about what you did?

664
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,120
Impossible.

665
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,200
Then why did you steal her sample clothes?

666
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,920
Aren't you embarrassed?

667
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,160
Yes, I do.

668
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:24,960
First,

669
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,720
I’m not that kind of person

670
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
Second, I can’t afford to lose face.

671
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,800
I'm a decent businessman.

672
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,520
I don’t get along with Zhao Mo.

673
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,480
because he's a copycat,

674
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,000
not because I don't want people to be nice.

675
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:37,960
Understand?

676
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,760
Yes.

677
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,320
A villain's heart. Get lost.

678
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:43,880
Mr Shen, let me explain.

679
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,520
Get lost!

680
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,360
What's wrong, Kong?

681
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,320
Mr Shen is not satisfied with the photos again, right?

682
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,720
What can he not be satisfied with?

683
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,520
He asked me about my suggestion to deal with Zhao Moyuan.

684
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,440
I told him to get lost.

685
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,120
Isn't it normal to get scolded at a part-time job?

686
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,840
Mr Shen scolds me every day.

687
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,040
Besides, it's not necessarily a bad thing for him to scold you.

688
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,840
You...

689
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,520
No problem.

690
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,360
Think about the details.

691
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,120
Di, Di, Di.

692
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,040
Do you think Mr. Shen

693
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:36,240
hate Zhao Moyuan the most?

694
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,200
Yes.

695
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,480
Does Mr. Shen worry about

696
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,920
Zhao Moyuan is working with Wuyue?

697
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,000
Yes. What's wrong?

698
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:49,600
Nothing.

699
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,760
Zhao Moyuan, May.

700
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,080
I won't let you two work together.

701
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,200
it'll be over.

702
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,160
A sowing discord?

703
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,640
Although I entered the school

704
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,680
after you graduated,

705
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,160
But your design concept

706
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,560
including how you use

707
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,480
the way you use it

708
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,280
deeply influences me.

709
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,760
I even changed the first series

710
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,600
my first series as Linlin.

711
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,160
Because I want everyone to know

712
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,640
I almost got it back then.

713
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,600
the American Fashion Designer Association

714
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,240
the name of

715
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,400
Chinese female designer.

716
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,720
She is definitely not

717
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,800
a despicable plagiarism.

718
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,280
but a real genius.

719
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,720
I almost forgot

720
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,360
I used to call this name.

721
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,360
Senior.

722
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,520
You are definitely better than me.

723
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,600
And more than ten times.

724
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,800
You shouldn't waste your time

725
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,800
waste your time

726
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,280
like May.

727
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,480
I've been looking for you all these years.

728
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,200
and get your news.

729
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,080
Do you love me?

730
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,320
Ah.

731
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,040
You did everything you could

732
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,280
because you have a crush on me

733
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,120
to get close to me.

734
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,720
You even gave up your collaboration with Oh-wol

735
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,960
to cooperate with Oh-wol?

736
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,800
You misunderstood.

737
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,680
Senior, I admire you very much.

738
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,960
Or more precisely,

739
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:19,640
I really feel sorry for you.

740
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,960
I think those unfortunate experiences

741
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,400
shouldn't have happened to you.

742
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,400
You are so excellent.

743
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,160
I just hope

744
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,680
through working with you,

745
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,680
I'll find a chance for you to pick up your paint brush.

746
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,600
I'm not interested.

747
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,600
You only admire illusions

748
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,440
and illusions created by rumors.

749
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,560
That's not me.

750
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,360
Now I only want to do business.

751
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,520
I'm not interested in design.

752
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,000
And I don't want to hear

753
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,840
anyone

754
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,000
mentioned Linlin in front of me,

755
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:44,840
in front of me.

756
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,600
Okay.

757
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,000
Next week at Lingyun Headquarters,

758
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,520
will send a senior manager to Shanghai next week.

759
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,480
She wants to see you.

760
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,520
She wants to see all the design manuscripts.

761
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,920
and more than two sample clothes.

762
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,280
It determines whether our project

763
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,440
can get more than 10 million

764
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,440
of more than 10 million yuan?

765
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:09,960
Can you help me

766
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,160
my request?

767
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,920
I'll do my best.

768
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,880
Are you sure you can do it?

769
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:16,800
A designer who is emotional

770
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,200
because of a breakup.

771
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,360
Can you really control it?

772
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,200
That unprofessional thing

773
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,560
will never happen to me.

774
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,680
Don't forget that I'm a designer too.

775
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,120
You're lying to an amateur.

776
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,120
I don't know why

777
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,360
you want to break up with Coco.

778
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,000
But I think

779
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,600
you have low EQ.

780
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,000
Otherwise, why do you keep

781
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,160
in front of others?

782
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,440
I always

783
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:43,520
as my muse.

784
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,960
Are you sure she won't get the wrong idea?

785
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,080
and get jealous?

786
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,800
She said she quit this morning.

787
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,760
She seems more sad

788
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,640
than the last time.

789
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,360
Why did she resign?

790
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,400
How would I know?

791
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:57,640
At this time,

792
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:58,680
at Linjiang Store

793
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,840
at Linjiang Store.

794
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,760
Three hours left.

795
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,400
It's up to you.

796
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,760
If you can't even

797
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,040
to say it face to face,

798
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,160
you call yourself a man?

799
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:12,000
Zhao Moyuan, don’t make me look down on you.
