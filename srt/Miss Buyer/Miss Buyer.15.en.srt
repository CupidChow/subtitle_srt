1
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
We've read

2
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,640
your first design manuscript.

3
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,880
The style.

4
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,800
It's perfect for May's new positioning.

5
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,640
I think it's good.

6
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,320
We can move on.

7
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,560
After that, we will discuss

8
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,880
we will have internal discussion

9
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,600
and give suggestions.

10
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,560
Wow, internal discussion.

11
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,800
It sounds stressful.

12
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,160
Mr. Zhao doesn't think

13
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,440
as long as it's your own design,

14
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,600
will be accepted in May.

15
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,800
Mr. Du, do you have less communication

16
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
with other designers?

17
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,880
If you had similar experience,

18
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,960
you wouldn't ask that, would you?

19
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,800
balance between art and market.

20
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,440
is a compulsory course for every designer.

21
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:30,880
Although Partrick only did haute couture,

22
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,079
but he probably fought with his own business

23
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,520
with our own business.

24
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,520
You know it too well.

25
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,520
They fight every time.

26
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,320
It's so noisy.

27
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,800
If Lingyun has more garment-making lines,

28
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,680
will you make more trouble than before?

29
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,720
Yeah, but I'm used to it.

30
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,079
Big head.

31
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,600
Should we move on

32
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,720
should proceed with the contract?

33
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,960
This is our draft.

34
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,600
Okay.

35
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:01,800
Here.

36
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,960
I'll give this to the legal department.

37
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,320
Okay?

38
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,240
But our legal procedure

39
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,160
continue.

40
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,520
Don't stop the other process.

41
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,320
I'll show you

42
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,600
I'll show you 15 styles.

43
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,520
to get ready.

44
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,520
Within a week,

45
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,680
in one week.

46
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Within a month,

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,520
in a month.

48
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,520
It can be delivered in September.

49
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,520
It happens to be October.

50
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,160
in October.

51
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,880
Okay?

52
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,440
15.

53
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,960
Are you sure it's 15?

54
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,079
I told you.

55
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,600
It's the first series of Partrick Cho.

56
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,440
This time,

57
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,880
show more sincerity this time.

58
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,320
It's not Patrick Cho.

59
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,880
It's Partrick and Oh-wol.

60
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,240
It's all up to you.

61
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,160
Come on. Cheers.

62
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,079
Why don’t you care about your boyfriend?

63
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,960
Mr. Du, be professional.

64
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,320
They are talking about work.

65
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,600
Talking about work? It's all up to you.

66
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,520
He thinks

67
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,160
he's a bossy president, right?

68
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,800
I'm the boss.

69
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,160
Why are they eating there?

70
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:11,880
and do nothing?

71
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,040
I'll pay here.

72
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,960
Sir, your card.

73
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,560
Please vote according to this.

74
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,279
Yes, sir.

75
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,000
He didn't ignore everything.

76
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,240
Moyuan has motivated

77
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,600
of his brand.

78
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,280
From magazines to new media,

79
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,280
from the magazines to new media.

80
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,080
It’s all money, Mr. Du.

81
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,840
Do I need money?

82
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,320
Yes.

83
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,960
The debt rate of 72% in May

84
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,000
Last year, the profit was still negative.

85
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,560
Otherwise,

86
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,400
you wouldn't be so active

87
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,840
for this collaboration.

88
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,840
Listen, Ms. Ding.

89
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,320
don't forget

90
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,840
who

91
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,320
who pulled you out

92
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,400
from the reality show.

93
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,400
Mr. Du, don’t forget

94
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,880
I recorded something

95
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,680
in my recorder.

96
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,800
I'm just trying to remind you.

97
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:03,800
Don't...

98
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,440
don't listen to the elderly.

99
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,840
When your boyfriend falls in love with someone else in the future,

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,080
What's the use of blaming me?

101
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,840
You can manage Director Lei.

102
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,000
I haven't become a regular employee yet.

103
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,560
A regular employee?

104
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,840
You two are already underground.

105
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,280
Since when?

106
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:24,960
Was it you

107
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,800
or you two?

108
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,320
Stop.

109
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,560
Don't talk about it.

110
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,600
It's about the company's senior management.

111
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,600
Say no more.

112
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,600
I see.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,800
What do you know?

114
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,440
I know.

115
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,400
When you fall in love with someone

116
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,280
you thought it would never be.

117
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,159
will be different.

118
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,360
Being generous will become jealousy.

119
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,680
Pain becomes acceptance.

120
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,280
But this road is really hard.

121
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,160
Come on.

122
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,160
Come on.

123
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,000
Together.

124
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,560
What are you doing?

125
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,600
Mr. Zhao Moyuan,

126
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,560
Coco and I are buddies.

127
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,560
Mr. Du, she is just your employee,

128
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,720
not your friend.

129
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,880
Not even friends.

130
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,440
Just kidding. Are you jealous?

131
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,520
Just kidding. Don't worry about it.

132
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,159
The painkiller works well, right?

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay, let's do as we said.

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,120
In three days,

135
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,880
to the media in three days.

136
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,960
Send me your contact.

137
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,159
Show me the list.

138
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:48,440
Okay?

139
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,000
No problem.

140
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,720
I look forward to working with you.

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,520
Let's go.

142
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:53,960
Bye.

143
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,680
Here's your receipt.

144
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,320
Thank you.

145
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,159
You're welcome.

146
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,120
Just kidding. Let's go.

147
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,600
You have a company besides a shop?

148
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,840
I've never heard anything about it from Feifei.

149
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,600
In America.

150
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,600
What's wrong?

151
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,880
You've been acting weird since you came out of the restaurant.

152
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,720
Nothing.

153
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,280
There must be something. What's wrong with you?

154
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,280
What do you think?

155
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,120
He just held you like this.

156
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,880
You won't move.

157
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,960
I'm going to help you.

158
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,240
You told me to leave it alone.

159
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,400
What are you doing?

160
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,960
Are you angry because of this?

161
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,560
I said it was a joke.

162
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,560
Besides, with you and Leo around,

163
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,000
what can he do?

164
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,280
Please be a girl.

165
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
Okay?

166
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He's pursuing Leo.

167
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,800
Can't he just eat your tofu?

168
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,120
Fine, I was wrong.

169
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
I'll stay away from him next time.

170
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:49,880
Okay.

171
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,280
Impossible.

172
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,680
All right.

173
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,560
I apologized to you.

174
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,120
Okay, I'll be more careful.

175
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,600
Stay away from him, okay?

176
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,720
Zhao Moyuan.

177
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,120
Patrick.

178
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,000
My prince charming.

179
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,880
Don't be angry, okay?

180
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,880
I don't care at all.

181
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,600
Zhao Moyuan.

182
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,320
You're not my real boyfriend.

183
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,800
Why are you so nosy?

184
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,280
You think I'm nosy?

185
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,440
I see.

186
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,000
You actually

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,320
you actually like him, right?

188
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,560
If I hadn't been cheap that day,

189
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,039
I had to drive you away.

190
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,520
Just follow him to the car

191
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,600
and have dinner with him.

192
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,200
Go on a date with him.

193
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,159
Go watch a movie with him. Enough!

194
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:37,799
I don't know.

195
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,400
You know he likes Leo.

196
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,200
Can't you see that I like you?

197
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,600
Stop it, okay?

198
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,640
Stop it.

199
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,080
Let go of me!

200
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,040
Stop it.

201
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Let go of me!

202
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
Let go of me!

203
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,160
Let go of me!

204
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,280
Let go of me!

205
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:14,640
Stop it.

206
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,360
Let go of me!

207
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,400
Or I'll kiss you.

208
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,040
What are you doing?

209
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,760
What do you think?

210
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,920
Shouldn't you

211
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,080
Shouldn't you close your eyes?

212
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,520
You said you liked me.

213
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,080
Why are you scared?

214
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,520
That's too much.

215
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,480
That's too much.

216
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,080
How can you bully me like this?

217
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,720
Yes.

218
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,960
I like you.

219
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,600
So when you cut the steak for me,

220
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,960
my heart will pound.

221
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,400
When you say, my family can.

222
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,160
I feel so beautiful.

223
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,960
But I know

224
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,160
there is

225
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,080
between us.

226
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,840
So I kept telling myself

227
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,960
Don't think too much.

228
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,760
You pretended to be a couple

229
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,200
to get close to Leo.

230
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,160
This is just another form.

231
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,600
in another form.

232
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,600
I've tried very hard

233
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,760
control myself.

234
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,080
I've worked hard till today.

235
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,080
But you knew everything.

236
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,520
Why are you doing this to me?

237
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,400
If you only care about Leo,

238
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
don't bother me anymore, okay?

239
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,040
I'm not flirting with you.

240
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,640
Leo and I

241
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,080
what you think.

242
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,960
I care about you.

243
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,600
I like you.

244
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,720
Are you

245
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,400
falling down?

246
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,080
Even if

247
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,960
to lie to me,

248
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,640
to comfort me.

249
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,840
I don't regret it anymore.

250
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,160
I really want to call Lin Sixian.

251
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,840
I want to ask him.

252
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,160
He has been with you for eight years.

253
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,640
Didn't he teach you

254
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,600
how to tell a man's true heart?

255
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,400
Watch when driving

256
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,200
when you're driving.

257
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:16,960
Come on, stop looking.

258
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,160
Really, stop looking.

259
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:23,960
Director Lei.

260
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,600
Leo.

261
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,520
Leo.

262
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,640
Are you a dog?

263
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,400
Don't you know I'm one year younger than you?

264
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,280
I was born in the year of ox.

265
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,960
Then why are you like a chihuahua?

266
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,960
Just a little bit of trouble,

267
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,360
you'll scream more than anyone else.

268
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,720
Do you know

269
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,160
Zhao Moyuan

270
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,200
is our partner.

271
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,040
If you can't control

272
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:42,960
your emotions,

273
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,640
to me,

274
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
For May,

275
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,640
for May.

276
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,520
Du Xiuqi.

277
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,600
Enough. Stop it.

278
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,520
I promise

279
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,760
it won't happen again, okay?

280
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,280
Besides,

281
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,720
Zhao Moyuan misunderstood.

282
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,400
Ding Yike and I are good friends now.

283
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,160
Good buddies.

284
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,920
It's so good that we're in the copy room.

285
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
We talked for half an hour.

286
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,960
and hurt his waist.

287
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,080
Are you jealous?

288
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,760
Take it away.

289
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,840
If you're willing,

290
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,760
I can be a dog.

291
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,080
But can we not be chihuahua?

292
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,840
What do you think of Teddy?

293
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,080
Can you be serious?

294
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,080
No, no.

295
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,720
Drive

296
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,600
Drive.

297
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,520
What?

298
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,040
Still thinking about what happened just now?

299
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,280
about what happened just now.

300
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,600
No.

301
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,960
I'm just thinking about work.

302
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,600
What's there to think about?

303
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,040
I told you.

304
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,760
Half of the time is in May.

305
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,280
Half of the time is with me.

306
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,840
My team will come tomorrow.

307
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:50,960
Also,

308
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,840
Qian has an empty studio.

309
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,520
It can be my office.

310
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,520
I didn't know

311
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,400
you had a company in America.

312
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,760
You know my embarrassing situation.

313
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,760
But I don't

314
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,600
about you.

315
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,720
Don't worry.

316
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,080
You'll know eventually.

317
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,600
Okay?

318
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,320
Yes.

319
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,920
Relax, okay?

320
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,400
I'm still

321
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,720
You knock on the floor upstairs.

322
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,520
I'm downstairs.

323
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,400
who sneezes.

324
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,080
How do we live in the past?

325
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,640
How are we going to live in the future?

326
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,400
Why isn't she picking up?

327
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,400
I don't know what to say to her now.

328
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Okay, I'll go upstairs then.

329
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,280
Let me give you a ride. Let's go.

330
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,600
Don't get into the character so soon, okay?

331
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,000
It's just a small road.

332
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,400
Are you afraid I'll fall down?

333
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,720
You told me to be natural.

334
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,280
Bye.

335
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,920
Bye.

336
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,480
I'm leaving.

337
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,360
It's all up to you.

338
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,960
Have a good rest.

339
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,480
Bye.

340
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:33,960
Bye.

341
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,160
Leo is my goddess.

342
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,760
But the person I like...

343
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,640
is you.

344
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,240
If I see this in my Moments,

345
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,120
I'll be scolded.

346
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,120
He's a scumbag, right?

347
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,480
But why

348
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,760
he said it so naturally

349
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,880
so naturally?

350
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,120
And I...

351
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,880
Even so,

352
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,080
I still fell in love.

353
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,960
To be able to love someone,

354
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,760
and pursue it without hesitation.

355
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,520
Not only is it beautiful,

356
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,120
but also

357
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,120
I need courage.

358
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,480
I must be crazy.

359
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,280
I must be crazy.

360
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,160
Did you hear that?

361
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,480
Yes. What are you doing?

362
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,240
This is the Morse code for good night.

363
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,000
Got it?

364
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,240
Foul, foul.

365
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,760
It's a total foul.

366
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,240
Forget it.

367
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,400
He flirted with me and then

368
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
I'll run away if he's a scumbag.

369
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,760
Whatever.

370
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,600
That's all. Start studying.

371
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,880
Hey, Leo.

372
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,480
I have a question.

373
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,240
if you have

374
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,640
Did anything happen

375
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,480
with your colleagues?

376
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,360
Okay, you're welcome.

377
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,000
That's it. Bye.

378
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,720
You have a stiff neck.

379
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,720
No, Coco.

380
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,000
I haven't talked to her yet.

381
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,640
She threw the breakfast away.

382
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,720
She must be in a hurry to work.

383
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,520
Oh, right.

384
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,760
book two rooms tomorrow.

385
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,520
Luna and Eric

386
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,360
will fly to

387
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,120
They're coming.

388
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,480
Is the new project about to start?

389
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,880
Yes.

390
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,880
Go deal with our resources.

391
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,120
Get some good supermodels.

392
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,120
OK.

393
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,760
If Shen Jin knows about this,

394
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,960
if Shen Jin finds out?

395
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,000
After we hit him last time,

396
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,120
he hasn't stopped doing this.

397
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,640
Ask the Navy to smear us.

398
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,360
Last time you said our art exhibition

399
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,120
that our art exhibition is just a water cargo.

400
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,880
Of course I know.

401
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,520
But this time,

402
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,640
I have to take the initiative.

403
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,480
Mr Shen, Di.

404
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,000
Sit.

405
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,840
Sorry, I'm late.

406
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,600
Sit down.

407
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
Tell me, what's going on?

408
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,120
Mr Shen, here's the thing.

409
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,520
Last Tuesday, Zhao Moyuan

410
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,160
with Qingcheng last Tuesday.

411
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,520
Last weekend, he and his friends

412
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,480
with his friends.

413
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,640
Based on my deduction,

414
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,400
one of them

415
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,720
one of them

416
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,480
Maybe his new girlfriend.

417
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,720
A new girlfriend?

418
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:29,280
Yes.

419
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,160
She...

420
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,480
It's her.

421
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,400
Any business movements?

422
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,880
Did he go to London or Paris?

423
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,880
He seems to be in Shanghai for a month.

424
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,600
I think...

425
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,640
Did he go or not?

426
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,120
I did.

427
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,240
No.

428
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,360
Gong.

429
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,760
When you came to the interview,

430
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,000
when you came to the interview.

431
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,640
Right?

432
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,240
What are you talking about?

433
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,240
He's good at business.

434
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,160
I've worked for years.

435
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,240
Wait, wait.

436
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,280
What happened?

437
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,480
the performance was a mess.

438
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,120
This is the last chance

439
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,360
is the last chance I give you.

440
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,360
Mr Shen, I'll work hard.

441
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,760
Hello, honey.

442
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,760
[Did you read]

443
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,880
Did you read it?

444
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,640
No.

445
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,880
I'm watching.

446
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,840
As you know,

447
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,960
Zhao Moyuan and I are good friends.

448
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,640
He is a designer genius.

449
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,120
I don't know.

450
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,760
when his first garment-making series will be launched.

451
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,480
But he said it was almost done.

452
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,120
But now I can't wait.

453
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,880
I will always support him.

454
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,280
With such a

455
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,640
a big fan.

456
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,080
We will look forward to

457
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,120
the garment-making series of Zhao Moyuan and May.

458
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,240
Don't worry.

459
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,480
I won't let him succeed.

460
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,400
I'll go to the reporters

461
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,000
to expose his copyright.

462
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,000
No.

463
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,760
I'm going to

464
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,720
the Lusenberg Pink Day Award.

465
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,000
If something happens at this time,

466
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,080
it will affect

467
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,480
my image in the organizing committee.

468
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,240
Okay, I'll listen to you.

469
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,360
Anyway, don't worry.

470
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,280
Just focus on the game.

471
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I'll think of a way.

472
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,960
He lost inspiration on the couture.

473
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,160
It's not easy to turn over in the ready-made clothes.

474
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,080
Remember to eat on time.

475
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,160
Bye.

476
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,760
Mr Shen.

477
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,520
Would you like to take a look at this?

478
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,480
Zhao Moyuan has a new news.

479
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,960
Your news will be released soon.

480
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:26,760
Yes.

481
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,360
I'm working with Oh-wol right now.

482
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,640
It'll be released next fall.

483
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
Of course.

484
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,000
And it's my first show in Asia.

485
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,000
Many good friends told me

486
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
to come and support me.

487
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,960
Thank you so much.

488
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,360
Can you tell us

489
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,720
which friends would you have?

490
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,640
A lot.

491
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,400
like Dusi and Yin Wen from the supermodel.

492
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,640
The designer's Moke, Little Puson.

493
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,840
It's business.

494
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,160
I invited many

495
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,080
the best buyers in Asia.

496
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,640
I have to mention

497
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,960
my best friend Mr Shen Jin

498
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,120
I met him

499
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,520
in Beijing.

500
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,520
He also told me

501
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,640
he hoped that

502
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,840
in the television.

503
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,280
But I'm still thinking about it.

504
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,360
No matter what,

505
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,640
I will give him the first place.

506
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,880
Zhao Moyuan.

507
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,880
I thought you were just making clothes.

508
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,760
but you're playing tricks with me.

509
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,520
Good.

510
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,840
Mr Shen.

511
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,480
Should we

512
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,960
draw up a statement?

513
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,120
No need. I'll handle it myself.

514
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,640
You...

515
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,080
check

516
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,480
if Zhao Moyuan

517
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,760
Is there anyone else?

518
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:49,720
Okay.

519
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,880
Also, if you can't handle it,

520
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,240
resign.

521
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,760
Go.

522
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,320
Oh.

523
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,600
Mr Shen, I'm leaving.

524
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,720
Go.

525
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,400
My phone.

526
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,160
Look at this dress.

527
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,160
Its shoulder line is very ugly.

528
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,760
Right?

529
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,080
It doesn't match, right?

530
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,160
Is that Mr. Partrick?

531
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,640
Hello, Ms. Miyazaki Hiroko.

532
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,360
Hello.

533
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,120
This is Cocoa-san.

534
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,480
So pretty.

535
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,000
Hello

536
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,480
Your design for this season is amazing.

537
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,400
Do you really think so?

538
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,360
Yes.

539
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,400
I want all your clothes

540
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,000
I want them all, okay?

541
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm sorry.

542
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Why?

543
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,000
Because of me.

544
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,000
We just signed an agreement.

545
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,880
All their limited editions

546
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,120
to you.

547
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,880
It's just the beginning.

548
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,360
What a pity.

549
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,400
Yeah.

550
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,480
Excuse me.

551
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,000
Prince Charming,

552
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,120
Aren’t you afraid

553
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,400
Aren’t you afraid he’ll blow it up?

554
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,280
What are the hidden rules in the circle?

555
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,360
You'll die if you wear long johns.

556
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,640
I was wrong.

557
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,720
No matter what blood feud we have,

558
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,720
we can only stab him in secret.

559
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,000
Unless we die together.

560
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,640
we can't fight in public.

561
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,360
If you lose your style and style,

562
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,160
people in the circle will look down on you forever.

563
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,880
Got it.

564
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,880
Just smile on your face.

565
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,360
I'll stab you to death in my heart.

566
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,960
Anyway,

567
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,880
Shen Jin and I

568
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,880
are business partners.

569
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,880
He used to attack and defend.

570
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,480
This time, I got the right to serve first.

571
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,000
I have to let him suffer a mute loss.

572
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,480
My handsome, dark-hearted prince charming.

573
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,880
When did you become so bold to attack?

574
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,000
Because all of a sudden,

575
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,000
start a new life.

576
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,760
I'm going back to the studio. I'll leave it to you.

577
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,760
and start a new life.

578
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,640
Oh my god.

579
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,240
His clothes are so wet.

580
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:43,400
Yeah.

581
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,240
Come on, she's a big designer.

582
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,760
Oh my god.

583
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,760
Look at the color. So handsome.

584
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,640
Yeah.

585
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,240
Not as handsome as me.

586
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,120
Heman, are you crazy?

587
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,760
Super cool.

588
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,120
Can I play it again?

589
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,760
Do you think

590
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,640
if I wear this?

591
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,840
No.

592
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,760
When you wear it,

593
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,400
the difference between selling shows and buying shows.

594
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,640
Yes, you're only suitable for Taobao.

595
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,640
Is everything that happened last night

596
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,880
was an illusion?

597
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,760
Is there any other follow-up

598
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,640
Is there any follow-up?

599
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,000
Ke Ke, tell me the truth.

600
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,840
How did you

601
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,880
such a great boyfriend?

602
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,000
That's right.

603
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,520
Tell us! Tell us!

604
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,400
He's so clingy.

605
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,480
Killing off a building and seducing

606
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,480
Play it again.

607
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,360
Don't.

608
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,280
That's enough. Work hard.

609
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:48,360
Nana.

610
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,160
Did you get the order

611
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,360
the order you ordered

612
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,000
Why is it different from mine?

613
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,280
That batch of pink shirts.

614
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,400
I downloaded 2,000 pieces on size M.

615
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,640
1,000 pieces on size S.

616
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,240
But your order is completely reversed.

617
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,000
No way. Did you get it wrong?

618
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,960
Although I'm in charge of

619
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,600
the review and orders of the monthly committee,

620
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,120
But it's only a nuclear price.

621
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,640
How can I change the amount for you?

622
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,000
Can you read it for me?

623
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,400
You didn't read the diary, did you?

624
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,280
The first version of orders

625
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,640
as you said.

626
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,080
But after Director Lei's inspection,

627
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,120
she changed it for you.

628
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,640
I made the order according to her version.

629
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,960
When do suppliers start to produce

630
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,120
after receiving the order?

631
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,400
I don't know.

632
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,400
But it's almost midnight.

633
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,360
I guess they will

634
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,880
they'll upload the contract.

635
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,760
Okay. Thank you.

636
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,280
Hello.

637
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,600
I'm Ding Yike who buys hands.

638
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,600
Yes, that's the order.

639
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,840
Please control it for me.

640
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,880
I'll order again.

641
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,360
You want me to order again?

642
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,440
Yes.

643
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,199
Because the first order is right.

644
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,199
Then you have to

645
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:24,840
the procedures

646
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,159
in the corporate resource program system.

647
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,440
But the problem is

648
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,000
Director Lei is in a meeting

649
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,480
He doesn't have time.

650
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,760
to enter the company resource program.

651
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,280
But the supplier said

652
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,239
the duration is tight.

653
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,679
Help me control a little.

654
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,400
Why don't you place the order as I say first?

655
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,600
When Director Lei comes out,

656
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,120
I'll ask her to sign again, okay?

657
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:45,679
Honey, please help me.

658
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,520
I just became a regular employee.

659
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,880
If this order goes wrong,

660
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,440
the bonus will be gone by the end of this month.

661
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,080
Okay.

662
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,880
But send an email right now

663
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,000
to confirm it in a letter.

664
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,480
Send it to Director Lei and Manager Liu.

665
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,400
and Director Yu.

666
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
Okay, no problem.

667
00:34:59,400 --> 00:34:59,920
Thank you.

668
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,280
You're welcome.

669
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:00,920
Thank you.

670
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,200
Are you ready to go

671
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
Where are we going?

672
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,000
To your male ticket studio.

673
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,920
Have you forgotten?

674
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,480
From now on,

675
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,240
I'm going there every afternoon.

676
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,600
Partrick?

677
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,440
Yes.

678
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,920
Wait for me for a minute.

679
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,120
Hurry up.

680
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,600
This is too hasty.

681
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,400
Without detailed evidence,

682
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,720
We know you have many ideas.

683
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:41,200
to realize.

684
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,120
But we only have four months.

685
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,440
We're worried.

686
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,520
It's not hasty.

687
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,360
Four months isn't long enough?

688
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,200
Do you have to spend half a year

689
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,400
to prepare and verify?

690
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,640
Why didn’t Zhao Moyuan

691
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,720
choose another brand?

692
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,920
Ruizi, Moses,

693
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:00,000
are older than May.

694
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,520
and more mature than May.

695
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,600
It only takes one and a half months

696
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,240
to go public.

697
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,520
I think Director Lei is right.

698
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,280
risk is an opportunity.

699
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,120
I believe Lingyun acquired May

700
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,600
to guard the city.

701
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,520
We agree to raise a special budget

702
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,520
for this project.

703
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,920
But the details

704
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,360
we need more evidence.

705
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,240
Okay, I'll wait for your good news.

706
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,840
Why are you so serious when you see each other every day?

707
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:49,880
We have

708
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,240
his American team today?

709
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,000
On behalf of May,

710
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,200
on behalf of May.

711
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,920
The tenth floor is here.

712
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,200
Let's go.

713
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,200
Mr. Zhao.

714
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,280
Miss Zhou Tianna, right?

715
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,880
Meeting is better than being famous.

716
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,480
Hello.

717
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,680
Just call me Tina.

718
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,880
Just call me Partrick.

719
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,600
This way, please.

720
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,520
Everyone, please come here.

721
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,960
Let me introduce.

722
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,680
This is

723
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,440
from May.

724
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,120
Ms. Cocoa.

725
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,160
Eric.

726
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,200
This is our best designer assistant.

727
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,240
Luna, our PR Fairy.

728
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,360
Mingming.

729
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,200
The reincarnation of Superman is double M.

730
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,360
Marketing and management.

731
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,120
The general manager of the US and I

732
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,160
to show mercy

733
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,880
so I transferred him here.

734
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,640
It's hard to invite him.

735
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,160
Now you know each other

736
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:31,920
Let's get to work.

737
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,400
These are the three manuscripts I designed.

738
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,200
You can take a look.

739
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
This.

740
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,160
And this.

741
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,440
If you have any objections,

742
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,600
you can sit down and talk.

743
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,000
Please.

744
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,680
Okay.

745
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,360
You can use

746
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,080
your manuscript

747
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:57,760
your manuscript

748
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,440
and bring it back to May.

749
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,680
to other colleagues.

750
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,440
Okay.

751
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,120
I also

752
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,920
also made an initial schedule.

753
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:03,640
In fact, there are

754
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,720
in China and abroad.

755
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,920
It's just a set of designs.

756
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,760
After you acknowledge it,

757
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,160
we'll make the original version.

758
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
After some adjustment,

759
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,400
we'll do it.

760
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,000
But isn't this

761
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,400
before it's done.

762
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,400
That's how you cut it.

763
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,840
Like Patric,

764
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,120
such a haute couture designer

765
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,880
must have been used to D-cutting long ago.

766
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,960
The layout is to use the welding cloth

767
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,600
and pearl needles.

768
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,200
Then take it off and modify it.

769
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,240
and then start the demonstration.

770
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,240
Stabilization is not suitable for mass production.

771
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,680
So in the production of garments,

772
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,240
it's usually used

773
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,480
combination.

774
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,840
Then I don't think

775
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,200
use our copywriter in May.

776
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,880
He'll do it himself.

777
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,480
These are very important.

778
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,400
So the size and paper in the middle

779
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,200
We can do it ourselves.

780
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,840
We can do it ourselves.

781
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,920
But as for the promotion,

782
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,920
you are more experienced than us.

783
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,920
After all, we're only in the European and American market.

784
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,200
Okay, we'll do this.

785
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,280
Okay, let's continue.

786
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,520
Take a look at this design.

787
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,080
Patrick.

788
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,880
Isn't this...

789
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,200
Maybe we need to adjust it.

790
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,480
This

791
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,400
This part.

792
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:18,640
Here?

793
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:19,080
Yes.

794
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,920
Because the positioning before May

795
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,120
before May.

796
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,000
Pull it higher.

797
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,920
How about here?

798
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,600
I think it's good.

799
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,280
How about this?

800
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,080
How about reducing

801
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,280
a little bit.

802
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,080
ten collaboration products.

803
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,440
The price should be obvious.

804
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,280
If the price is too high,

805
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,840
it may affect the overall purchase rate.

806
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,400
I hope one or two

807
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,960
It's a popular cheap item.

808
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,920
For example, a T-shirt with a logo.

809
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,160
I don't think it's a good idea.

810
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:46,400
Haute Couture designer

811
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,280
usually avoid

812
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,920
with signatures everywhere.

813
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,200
Like Patric's previous design,

814
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,520
I don't think so.

815
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,680
But the marketing group of garments and haute couture

816
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,200
are different.

817
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,960
Customers need stepping feet

818
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,440
you can touch.

819
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,640
Fold it.

820
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,080
Use creative printing flowers to replace the logo.

821
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:07,840
Okay.

822
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,720
I agree.
