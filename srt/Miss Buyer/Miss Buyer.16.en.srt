1
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,280
Okay.

2
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,200
Okay, that's all for today.

3
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,560
Okay.

4
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,800
I'll send all the news

5
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,640
to Leo.

6
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,160
We'll get the feedback tomorrow.

7
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,800
No problem.

8
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay.

9
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,920
Thank you for your efficient work.

10
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,320
You’re welcome.

11
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,000
By the way, Luna,

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,520
I’ll summarize your opinions

13
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,280
to our PR department.

14
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,320
OK. Do you have WeChat?

15
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,120
Let's form a group chat.

16
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,840
Okay.

17
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,680
Okay, see you tomorrow.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
See you tomorrow.

19
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,480
Who asked you to leave?

20
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,800
No, stay.

21
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,200
There's something delicious.

22
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,960
Thank you.

23
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,480
Your cooking skills have dropped recently.

24
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,000
Maybe a little tired.

25
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,280
Are you unhappy?

26
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,320
No.

27
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,840
Tell me.

28
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,160
Is it because of Jiang Jie

29
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,240
or Tina

30
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,240
more professional than you today?

31
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,400
So you're unhappy?

32
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,360
How do you know about Jiang Jie?

33
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Silly.

34
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,360
Of course I care about you.

35
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,920
I care about everything about you.

36
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:44,440
Friendship is like

37
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,160
the gold in this bag.

38
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,200
No matter how expensive it is,

39
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,160
it will fade after a long time.

40
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,000
About Tina,

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,440
about Tina.

42
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,720
She acted more professional than you

43
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,600
because she is more experienced than you.

44
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,280
I promise.

45
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,440
After the whole press conference

46
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,040
the whole press conference,

47
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,480
you must be more professional than her, okay?

48
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:03,960
Trust me.

49
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,480
Cheer up.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,480
It's like you always cheer for me

51
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,720
I can move forward.

52
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,360
What did you say?

53
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,640
Nothing.

54
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,079
Wait.

55
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,400
How about this?

56
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,200
When I'm done,

57
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,520
we'll go for a walk together.

58
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,920
Think of it as inspiration.

59
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,600
Okay.

60
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,920
Can we go now?

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,840
I'll finish this soon.

62
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,320
I heard Jennifer

63
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,560
is coming to China for a tour this year.

64
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,440
I want her to come and see my show.

65
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,680
Jennifer.

66
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,720
Which Jennifer?

67
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,240
Is she your cousin or the American sweetheart?

68
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,120
For this project,

69
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,960
for this project.

70
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,640
You should do everything you can.

71
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,440
Let's go.

72
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,120
Let's go.

73
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,360
I want to eat octopus meatballs.

74
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,120
Okay, let's go.

75
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:41,840
Where?

76
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,960
Over there.

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,440
Let's go.

78
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,320
We can watch another film by the way.

79
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,720
Watch a video.

80
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,840
After that,

81
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,920
let's have dinner before we go back.

82
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,120
You don't have to work early tomorrow?

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,120
Are you okay?

84
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,520
Hey, Leo!

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,040
Partrick.

86
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
I've already received

87
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,240
about this season.

88
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,800
I also received

89
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,920
I also received it.

90
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,720
Now the situation is

91
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,120
we're in the Asian market after all.

92
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,880
The proportion of Asian people

93
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,040
is flat.

94
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,600
So I hope

95
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,000
you can stand out

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,080
in the waistline.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,640
Okay, I'll change it as you said.

98
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,600
Well, send me the email.

99
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,800
I'll change it right away, okay?

100
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,600
Thank you. Bye.

101
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,680
Leo just called me

102
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,720
and gave me some suggestions.

103
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,360
I feel inspired.

104
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,280
I'm afraid if I go back late,

105
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,480
I'll lose my inspiration.

106
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,120
Okay, let's go back.

107
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,200
Let's go.

108
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,400
Are you angry?

109
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,520
No, I'm not that petty.

110
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,720
Tell me if you're angry.

111
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,159
It's okay.

112
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,520
Tell me if you're mad.

113
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,760
It's okay.

114
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,040
Don't be shy.

115
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,640
I need to take this call.

116
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,080
I just saw your email.

117
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,560
Why did you

118
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,680
change the order?

119
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:56,360
Here's the thing.

120
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,080
I think there's something wrong with the order.

121
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,560
I wanted to ask for your permission,

122
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
But you were in a meeting.

123
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
You didn't answer my calls.

124
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,920
But the manufacturer

125
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,160
can't book the version if it's late.

126
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,160
I booked it myself when I was anxious.

127
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,680
If you were in such a hurry,

128
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,720
why didn't you knock?

129
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,680
Just tell me.

130
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,800
What's wrong with my order?

131
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,800
Why aren't you saying anything?

132
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,680
Do you think

133
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,080
the company is working with Zhao Moyuan?

134
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,600
You're so confident.

135
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,440
You think you're an old bird.

136
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,440
You can change my order at will.

137
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,680
No.

138
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,160
Then explain your behavior to me.

139
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
Because I think you're wrong, Director Lei.

140
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:36,960
I guess

141
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,760
you added S code

142
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,960
so you added size S.

143
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,320
The M size is reduced.

144
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,559
But according to my investigation,

145
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,080
70% of the stores in May

146
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,720
are distributed to the north of the Yangtze River.

147
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,120
The average height is

148
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,640
than in Hong Kong.

149
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,320
So we should increase the M size.

150
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,960
We should reduce size S.

151
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,520
And the sales last month

152
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,280
The M size is better than size S.

153
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,080
So,

154
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,480
if you think you did the right thing,

155
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,080
without

156
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,840
without any approval

157
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,160
send an email directly.

158
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,440
Did you cross the line?

159
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,480
That's not what I meant.

160
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:10,960
Ding Yike.

161
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,440
You're no longer a newbie.

162
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,640
If you can't even

163
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,080
the basic workplace rules,

164
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,520
If I need to remind you again and again,

165
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,440
I'll be very disappointed in you.

166
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,320
Tomorrow morning,

167
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,400
I want to see your self-criticism.

168
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
Bye.

169
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,280
Was I wrong?

170
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,840
She's the one who's different.

171
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,000
She said she only cares about results.

172
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,560
What did you say?

173
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,520
I like my subordinates being braver.

174
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,640
But now?

175
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,320
I'm childish again.

176
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,720
I thought

177
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,360
she is my teacher and friend now.

178
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
It's okay.

179
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,640
Everyone in the company has left.

180
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,000
Only the two of us left.

181
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,440
What's wrong? Are you upset?

182
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,360
Nothing.

183
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,200
The email makes my head ache.

184
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,680
Headache?

185
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,160
I heard it just now.

186
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,200
Don't lie to me.

187
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,480
I guess I've been too tired lately.

188
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,520
I can't believe I made such a mistake.

189
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,480
As a professional,

190
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,040
I lost to a newbie.

191
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,720
Am I getting old?

192
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,040
Our proud Director Lei

193
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,000
finally

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,800
accept my failure.

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,760
Who is it? Two days ago,

196
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,840
laughed at me every day.

197
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,440
I can't even lift my chopsticks.

198
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,640
Smile.

199
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,760
It's okay. You're just tired.

200
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,640
You're just not in the right state.

201
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,360
Actually,

202
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,840
all you think about

203
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,880
when Zhao Moyuan and May

204
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,800
will be listed, right?

205
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,280
When

206
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,160
defeat Zhou Boan?

207
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,040
I don't need your comfort.

208
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,000
A mistake is a mistake.

209
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,440
I'm not comforting you.

210
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,080
I'm reminding you.

211
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,760
Don't always think about becoming the Count of Christian.

212
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,440
Life is simple.

213
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,720
There are many easy goals

214
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,840
to face.

215
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,720
For example,

216
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,520
Smile.

217
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,560
Smile like just now

218
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,240
You look pretty when you smile.

219
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,440
What kind of romance movie are you making up?

220
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,480
Do I have to watch more romantic movies?

221
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,200
I have

222
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,960
a romance movie now.

223
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,320
Leo, take a look at this.

224
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,480
I think it's more like it.

225
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,120
Take a look.

226
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,840
Sure.

227
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,080
Oh no.

228
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
Oh no.

229
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,760
Oh no.

230
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,040
Oh no.

231
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,720
Tell me the truth.

232
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,720
Did Zhao Moyuan really draw this?

233
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,120
Yes.

234
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,120
Stop pretending.

235
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,480
What's the relationship between Mr. Shen and Zhao Moyuan?

236
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,600
Mr. Shen would know.

237
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,400
Wasn't this drawn by Zhao Moyuan?

238
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,520
No, Di.

239
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,160
I...

240
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,480
Let me tell you.

241
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,840
If I hadn't pressed it down

242
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,280
before Mr Shen saw it.

243
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,880
You're dead today.

244
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,920
Di, you are my brother.

245
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,480
Let's go. Where are we going to drink?

246
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,560
Don't...

247
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,720
Listen.

248
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,920
Don't try to trick me.

249
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,800
Have you made any progress in the past four years?

250
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,800
If it weren't for our old friendship,

251
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,520
and pushed you here,

252
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,640
I'm telling you.

253
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,480
I won't care about what you did today.

254
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
No, Di.

255
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,360
You really wronged me this time.

256
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,720
I paid a lot. I tried my best.

257
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
You have no idea.

258
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,560
Zhao Moyuan

259
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,760
His security measures are like the White Palace.

260
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,200
I've searched

261
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,040
near his house.

262
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,000
There's nothing left.

263
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,680
I even spent a lot of money

264
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,840
I hired hackers.

265
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,720
I wanted to hack into his email.

266
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,320
And then?

267
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,600
There's nothing in the mailbox.

268
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,120
Di, this painting

269
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,240
I spent a lot of money

270
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,800
to find a postgraduate

271
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,720
for me.

272
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,880
Mr Shen has spoken to me.

273
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,000
You heard it last time.

274
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,680
If I fail this time,

275
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,520
I'll really leave.

276
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,320
But you can't fool me

277
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
with a fake thing.

278
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,320
Mr Shen hates this the most.

279
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,920
Give me an idea.

280
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,640
For some things,

281
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,040
you can't go all the way to the dark.

282
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,800
As the saying goes,

283
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,520
there is no turning wheel.

284
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,560
You have to turn if the water doesn't turn.

285
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,240
How can I turn?

286
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,880
Zhao Moyuan has a girlfriend, right?

287
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,480
What are you looking at, Prince Charming?

288
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:33,640
Look.

289
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,920
This is...

290
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,040
He's trying to defeat us.

291
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,240
He's trying to tease the media

292
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,120
to ask about your disbandment.

293
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,320
Let them do it.

294
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,880
I have a clear conscience

295
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,640
I have a clear conscience.

296
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,520
Besides,

297
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,760
Qian has

298
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,120
disinfect my shares maliciously.

299
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,200
The evidence to drive me out of the sight

300
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,920
It's all ready.

301
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,840
I'm prepared. I'm relieved.

302
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,760
Why didn't I see

303
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,640
your breakfast?

304
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,960
Maybe I slept late last night.

305
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,040
I didn't have time to buy it.

306
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,400
How did you know?

307
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,880
she slept late last night?

308
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,079
Tell me, what did you do?

309
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,640
It smells like an adulterer.

310
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,000
Get lost.

311
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,160
I didn't deny it. I guess it right.

312
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,120
Tell me.

313
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,600
When did you two pretend to be real?

314
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,040
When did you start dating?

315
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,320
Did you do anything

316
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,680
last night?

317
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,880
The day before yesterday.

318
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,080
I didn't do anything yesterday.

319
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,200
Leo suddenly gave me a new mission.

320
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,960
So I worked overtime.

321
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,480
She was with me

322
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,640
with me.

323
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,240
No, you were together the day before yesterday.

324
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,640
and did nothing yesterday.

325
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,760
What are you doing?

326
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,680
Of course, there's no way we didn't do anything.

327
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,480
Working together, right?

328
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,560
In the afternoon in the studio,

329
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,360
We had dinner together.

330
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,080
That's more like it.

331
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,160
What did you eat?

332
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,200
She made me an octopus sausage.

333
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,280
Prince Charming.

334
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:10,640
Do you have a fever?

335
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,240
What do you mean?

336
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,840
How could you do something

337
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,160
It's not done by human.

338
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,960
What do you mean?

339
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,200
The first day of love is so romantic.

340
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,800
You asked him to work overtime with you.

341
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,080
and cook for you.

342
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,160
No, I used to

343
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,560
this way before.

344
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,280
No, this...

345
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,480
It used to be.

346
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
You can't be like this.

347
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,360
Forget it. Didn't you have

348
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,320
many girlfriends before?

349
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,360
Don't you know how to chase girls?

350
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,280
They used to chase me.

351
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:38,720
No.

352
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,360
You're courting a girl.

353
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,480
You have to watch a movie, right?

354
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,520
We have to go on a date, right? Candlelight dinner?

355
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,880
Kiss under the moonlight, right?

356
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,160
You and the female editor

357
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,960
and female models

358
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,200
are quite familiar with it.

359
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,440
Why do you start

360
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,520
we've been married for so long.

361
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,960
No wonder the breakfast broke.

362
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,160
No, I have to find her.

363
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,480
What? Sit down.

364
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,240
I have to find her.

365
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,680
Sit down.

366
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,760
Explain it.

367
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,320
I didn't expect to teach you one day.

368
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,040
You must listen to me.

369
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,160
You can't go to her now.

370
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,560
If you want to find her,

371
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,960
not only will you make her unhappy,

372
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,840
but also make her sadder.

373
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,440
Why?

374
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,800
You just remembered to find her?

375
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,760
to find her now?

376
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,080
Right?

377
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,760
I'll teach you.

378
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,160
What about you?

379
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,280
Will she come to the office this afternoon?

380
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,400
Of course.

381
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,120
You can find her in the afternoon.

382
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,000
When she's so disappointed,

383
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,200
give her a big surprise.

384
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,760
Then, come here.

385
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,120
And then?

386
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,480
Got it?

387
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:43,680
You little...

388
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,240
You didn't even focus on the right way.

389
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,720
Great. Go on. Come on.

390
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,680
Well, I...

391
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,920
I don't understand

392
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,320
why you can be

393
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,240
with Coco?

394
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,880
Your ex-girlfriends

395
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,600
like this?

396
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,360
Isn't it all like this

397
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,960
It's like this

398
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,520
Sometimes when you drink too much wine

399
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,760
when you drink too much wine.

400
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,440
As time goes by, you've experienced it.

401
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,120
you still feel

402
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,160
This plain thing

403
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,240
The more you taste it, the more you taste it

404
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,440
What about the taste?

405
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,480
is the ordinary life after being together.

406
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,320
You've learned a lot.

407
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,600
Coco.

408
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,440
Go to the B2 meeting room.

409
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,680
What meeting?

410
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,280
There's no notice in the office system.

411
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,160
You made an order yesterday, didn't you?

412
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,080
I think something happened.

413
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,440
Director Yu of HR belongs to Mr. Du.

414
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,720
She has been against Boss.

415
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,120
The team training plan she proposed a few days ago

416
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,280
in front of all the executives.

417
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,560
in front of all the executives.

418
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,680
It's like pyramid scheme.

419
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,840
Wang Yuan said her face turned green.

420
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,520
Anyway, the way I looked at her was wrong.

421
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,760
I guess she wants to take this

422
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,040
with this.

423
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,280
Be careful.

424
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,560
Go.

425
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,320
Okay, got it.

426
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,800
Without the approval of the business department director,

427
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,560
without permission.

428
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,640
Industrial Resource Plan.

429
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,600
This is a serious violation.

430
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,440
Don't tell me there's an exception. Make an exception.

431
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,880
A buyer can make an exception.

432
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,360
Can all buyers

433
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,840
can make an exception?

434
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,400
If everyone is exception,

435
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,840
why do we need the company system?

436
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,600
Director Lei.

437
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,400
I remember at the executive meeting,

438
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,600
you promised

439
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,000
that even if we change the purchase system to buying manufactures,

440
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,880
it won't mess up May, right?

441
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,600
Director Yu, what do you want to say?

442
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,400
Just be straightforward.

443
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Don't beat around the bush.

444
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,880
For finance,

445
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,280
rules are life.

446
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,960
As the person in charge of company discipline,

447
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,040
I suggest

448
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,080
to dismiss Zhou Na Na

449
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,080
for dismissal.

450
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,480
Liu, what do you think?

451
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:04,600
Isn't it too much to resign?

452
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,920
Then pay the fine and resign voluntarily.

453
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,440
Okay.

454
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,160
The direct person in charge of the Finance Department

455
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,720
I have a solution.

456
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,840
Director Lei.

457
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,320
What about the direct person in your department?

458
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,520
What are they doing here?

459
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,320
I don't know.

460
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,440
Take this away.

461
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,680
What are you doing?

462
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,160
You want

463
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,840
to leave May, right?

464
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,400
You should know that

465
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,960
if Ding Yi can leave May,

466
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,760
Zhao Mo and May

467
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,280
this project is very likely

468
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,440
in the belly.

469
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,520
I was the one

470
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,120
to the headquarters,

471
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,080
I may be held accountable.

472
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,520
Without the support from the higher-ups,

473
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,680
I should be the one to get lost next.

474
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,400
right?

475
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,640
Director Lei,

476
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,320
You're so imaginative.

477
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,120
Or are you going to protect her

478
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,440
you have to protect her.

479
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,280
Are you telling me

480
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,160
Ding Yike didn't break the rules?

481
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:06,800
You ordered her

482
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,920
to pass through the company resource program system.

483
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:09,960
But

484
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,840
Zhou Na Na didn't say that just now.

485
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,880
Ding Yike's behavior

486
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,280
didn't bring

487
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,520
to the company.

488
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,960
I think some people

489
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,400
have to make a fuss.

490
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,080
So I have to think about it.

491
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,520
Without economic loss,

492
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,520
the company's system

493
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,840
the company's system?

494
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,040
Director Lei,

495
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,040
Your management is really international.

496
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,200
Anyway,

497
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,480
after the investigation,

498
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,200
we'll buy hands

499
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,040
when we buy the hand.

500
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,240
What's there to investigate?

501
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,920
Isn't it clear already?

502
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,880
It has come to this.

503
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,560
You can't

504
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,000
you can handle.

505
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,880
At the beginning of this year,

506
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,160
according to the company's rules,

507
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,120
any company

508
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,000
corporate resource program system

509
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,320
of the company resource program system

510
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,920
must be handled by our personnel.

511
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,920
You called me here for a meeting early in the morning

512
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,040
because you want to drive Ding Yike out

513
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,120
while Mr. Du is away.

514
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,360
As for the company rules,

515
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,560
the company rules.

516
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,760
Isn't Director Lei

517
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,760
advocate efficiency the most?

518
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,080
Director Liu.

519
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
Ding Yike's personal belongings

520
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,120
has been sorted out.

521
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,680
All rights of the information system are closed.

522
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,600
You've gone too far!

523
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,920
I'm still here.

524
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,800
Do you dare to skip me and fire me?

525
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,320
Director Lei, don't worry.

526
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,080
The company does have this rule.

527
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,200
Ding Yike, what are you shooting?

528
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,400
I've recorded

529
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,560
your conversation.

530
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
Director Yu.

531
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,480
According to Article 43 of the labor contract,

532
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,360
clearly states that

533
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,640
If the employer wants to

534
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,000
to terminate the labor contract.

535
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,880
We must inform the union of the reason in advance.

536
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,560
Chairman of the union in May.

537
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,120
It seems to be Mr. Du.

538
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,560
Did you inform him in advance?

539
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,480
Director Yu.

540
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,960
You may have forgotten

541
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,840
I was selected

542
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,520
through participating in the reality show.

543
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,200
If I don't have a chance

544
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,440
give me a chance to explain,

545
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,680
He kicked me out

546
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,040
without telling me.

547
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,240
I promise

548
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,400
the news about you breaking the Labor Law

549
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,880
will be everywhere.

550
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,720
Director Yu. Director Liu.

551
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,000
This is a misunderstanding.

552
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,360
Coco didn't break the rules.

553
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,560
Let me explain.

554
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,720
The purchase of the shirt order

555
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,280
the purchase of shirts

556
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,520
during the handover.

557
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,200
Coco wanted to modify the order.

558
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,400
But it was inconvenient for Director Lei

559
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,200
so he called me.

560
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
After all, I'm the purchasing manager.

561
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,160
According to the company rules,

562
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,520
we don't need to review

563
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,240
without the review.

564
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,560
But I was outside.

565
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,680
So I just used

566
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,000
the company resource plan system

567
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,080
It's been placed.

568
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,880
But the order was placed.

569
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,240
but we can't

570
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,720
the company's mainframe.

571
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,360
So I asked Keke

572
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,760
to tell Nana about this.

573
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,440
Then Nana ordered it.

574
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,800
That's right. That's what happened.

575
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,400
That's also a violation.

576
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,040
Without

577
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,440
the financial assessment process

578
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,200
can't enter the financial review process.

579
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,960
Director Yu,

580
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,200
You may not know if you're not in the business department.

581
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,080
our company

582
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,240
of our company.

583
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,600
always gets into trouble.

584
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,880
I've been complained a lot before.

585
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,520
So the technical department and purchase department

586
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,440
from last year,

587
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,320
since last year.

588
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,520
Any order can't be uploaded

589
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,200
because of the system failure,

590
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,560
can be retrieved

591
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,560
in 24 hours.

592
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,880
Look.

593
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,120
This is the screenshot of my order.

594
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,920
There's still time up there.

595
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,520
I made the contract review

596
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,760
because I remember this notice.

597
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,920
But this morning,

598
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,200
the HR people came to question me

599
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,400
came to question me.

600
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,720
How can I explain to them?

601
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,840
They don't understand.

602
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,320
Since it's a misunderstanding,

603
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,600
just explain it.

604
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,600
I always believe that

605
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,360
Director Liu.

606
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,320
The professionalism of the Finance Department.

607
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,640
I told you.

608
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,520
Yu asked me to attend a meeting this morning.

609
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,760
I was a little confused.

610
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,840
I wasted an hour.

611
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,120
I watched a play.

612
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,400
But it's good. It's worth it.

613
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,400
You, immediately

614
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,360
Return Ding Yike's things to its original place.

615
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:13,800
Okay.

616
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,400
Dismiss.

617
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,440
Yu,

618
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,920
This time, you're too eager to take revenge.

619
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,760
Even Zhou Nana

620
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,480
as a sacrifice flag for you.

621
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,600
In the end,

622
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,040
If that's the case, forget it.

623
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,160
We're short of staff too.

624
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,120
Right?

625
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,880
Wait for me.

626
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,880
you edited it?

627
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,080
No, I just changed the time.

628
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,080
Good job.

629
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,160
Go back first.

630
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,440
Coco and I need to talk.

631
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,640
Sit.

632
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,600
Sorry.

633
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,400
Do you still think

634
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,840
making a fuss yesterday?

635
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,200
If it weren’t for Jiang Jie,

636
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,240
even if you manage to protect yourself,

637
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,160
you got Zhou Nana into trouble.

638
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,560
I almost lost my job.

639
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,160
I was wrong.

640
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,040
I left you

641
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,360
to buy hands

642
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,120
because I like your talent.

643
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,320
But talent

644
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,760
can't feed you.

645
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,080
During training,

646
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,560
the coach can encourage the players

647
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,800
to attack freely.

648
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,120
But you have to

649
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,280
you have to follow the rules.

650
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,960
Otherwise, if you cross the line,

651
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,120
it won't work no matter how wonderful it is.

652
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,000
If you don't want them to score,

653
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,840
can we

654
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,320
make a crossing?

655
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,120
Tell me.

656
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,680
I want to write a proposal.

657
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,560
Complaint company?

658
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,000
The company resource program system is old,

659
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,800
and the management system is stiff.

660
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,120
and caused a lot of trouble to the business department.

661
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:33,960
Besides,

662
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,640
the leader of the technical department

663
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,840
of the technical department

664
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,720
It's like Director Yu.

665
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,760
You're working for Mr. Du, right?

666
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,160
You're the one who caused trouble.

667
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,600
You're the one who's shaking your wits.

668
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,240
But you don't have to

669
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,680
you don't have to rush into the battle.

670
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,440
They're after me.

671
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,280
Leave the attack to me.

672
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,520
Go back to work.

673
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,280
Don't do it again.

674
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,960
Thank you, boss.

675
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,000
Thank you.

676
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,200
You're welcome.

677
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,680
Where is Jiang Jie?

678
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,600
How did you deal with Na Na?

679
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,320
Saving you is protecting her.

680
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,840
As long as she can make it through,

681
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,880
she will cooperate no matter what I say.

682
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,280
Besides, I've been in the company

683
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,680
for so many years.

684
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,600
I've dealt with the Finance Department

685
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,960
than you.

686
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,440
I can tell

687
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,840
What went wrong?

688
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,960
Thank you.

689
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,600
Or I'll be dead this time.

690
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,080
You're welcome.

691
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,600
You helped me

692
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,680
you helped me too.

693
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,960
Boss told me everything.

694
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,720
I know you pleaded for me

695
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,360
so I could stay.

696
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,440
I was really shocked

697
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,080
That's why I put the blame on you.

698
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,480
In fact,

699
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,680
you've been cold to me.

700
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,360
Is that why you're mad at me?

701
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,560
I'm sorry.

702
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
But you can.

703
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,760
I really don't mean to hurt you.

704
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,400
Can we be friends again?

705
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,400
No.

706
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,520
We've always been friends.

707
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,080
Why do we have to be friends again?

708
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,720
Haagen Das has a new taste.

709
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,440
You know?

710
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,600
It doesn't matter.

711
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,240
I'll bring it to you tomorrow morning.

712
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,160
No.

713
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,160
The calories are so high.

714
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,400
Don't be afraid. We'll get fat together.

715
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,760
What's wrong? You seem distracted.

716
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,000
You haven't recovered yet?

717
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,320
Yes.

718
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,280
It feels like a palace maid

719
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,720
in the palace robbery.

720
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,760
I'm quite scared.

721
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,400
But it's worth it.

722
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,080
I've accumulated a lot of experience points.

723
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,280
Have you

724
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,520
in your company before?

725
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,480
I see.

726
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,160
At that time,

727
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,680
you're not even a palace maid.

728
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,200
I'm almost at my boyfriend's place.

729
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,280
Please try to

730
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,800
you're always full of superiority.

731
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,320
Okay?

732
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:53,800
Oh.

733
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,240
Is he really your boyfriend?

734
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,880
During the meeting yesterday,

735
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,440
he didn't even

736
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,640
a chair for you.

737
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,960
That's because he doesn't want you to know

738
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,480
my relationship with him.

739
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,320
That's not right.

740
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,320
Even Director Yu of HR knows about it.

741
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,760
Why is he hiding it?

742
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
You're here.

743
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,000
Leo sent an email.

744
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,920
I checked the design manuscript.

745
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,320
I need to check the fabric.

746
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,280
Coco, come with me.

747
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,840
Tina, Eric is working on the detailed version.

748
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,600
Please keep an eye on it.

749
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,200
Okay.

750
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,720
I'll get going then.

751
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:13,639
Let's go.

752
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,920
This is the best in China.

753
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,840
the best fabric library in China.

754
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,080
The place designers love the most.

755
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,040
one of the top ten.

756
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,440
If

757
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,159
fashion is a beauty,

758
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,000
the design is her soul.

759
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,199
And the fabric is her body.

760
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,440
I hope our joint design

761
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,960
is different from other garments.

762
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,040
Let's start with the fabric.

763
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,199
Do you still remember

764
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,120
my designs?

765
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,480
Pick some fabrics for me.

766
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,840
Look at your eyes.

767
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,160
Okay.

768
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,840
There's more over there.

769
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,720
Hey!

770
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,000
How about this one?

771
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,280
This one.

772
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,240
This one.

773
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,080
Is it suitable for that short skirt?

774
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,000
Just so.

775
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,240
It's not suitable

776
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,760
Open it and have a look.

777
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:41,680
Maybe

778
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,200
There are other designs inside.

779
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,000
The color is also ordinary

780
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,080
The fabric is not very advanced.

781
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,640
You...

782
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,720
I cold you yesterday.

783
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,360
Are you upset?

784
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,760
Silly.

785
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,680
I like to see you

786
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,920
when you feel wronged.

787
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,240
Zhao Moyuan.

788
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,640
Don't do this in public.

789
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,800
What are you going to do?

790
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,800
How can you do it?

791
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,200
Didn't you say you were going to look for the fabric?

792
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,360
Why did you bring me here?

793
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,000
Officially,

794
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,400
I do need a whole afternoon

795
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,480
to look for inspiration from different brands.

796
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,240
From my personal point of view,

797
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,320
I'm just doing this for my personal gain.

798
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,920
I need to be with you.

799
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,280
And I want to do

800
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,360
what I wanted to do yesterday

801
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,800
Do it again.

802
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,480
I don't think it's a good idea.

803
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:21,760
Let's go back.

804
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,880
You're here. Do you still want to play?

805
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,120
You can do it, right?

806
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,000
Right?

807
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,200
Put me down.

808
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,080
It's not fair.

809
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,920
You ride Harley. Of course you have experience.

810
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,200
We should race.

811
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,000
You lose everything.

812
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,320
You have to admit defeat if you want to bet. Hurry.

813
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,520
You seem experienced.

814
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,240
Of course. Like you said,

815
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,520
Under my suit pants,

816
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,760
under my suit pants.

817
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,960
Be good to me, you know?

818
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,320
There won't be this shop after this village.

819
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,640
How dare you!

820
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,520
You have face, right?

821
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,400
How dare you? What?

822
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,400
I like it.

823
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,040
Classic. Not bad.

824
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Let's go inside.

825
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,640
No, it's not my style.

826
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,640
Why not?

827
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,960
Go in if you like it. Let's go.

828
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,880
No need

829
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,600
It's inconvenient to carry so many things.

830
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,320
You're so boring.

831
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,520
You know?

832
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,720
You have a weakness.

833
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,920
You're like a cow when you act tough.

834
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,440
You're like a turtle when you feel inferior.

835
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,080
Like yesterday.

836
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,880
Do you have a problem with me?

837
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,760
You think I'm not good enough

838
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,680
Are you unhappy?

839
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
Why didn't you tell me directly?

840
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,040
How many times have you yelled at me?

841
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:11,960
Have you forgotten?

842
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,760
I'm not inferior.

843
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,320
That's great. Prove it to me.

844
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,320
Let's go.

845
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,680
Maybe another day.

846
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,040
What's wrong?

847
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,600
I wanted to take the chance

848
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,720
to be nice to you.

849
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,120
But you rejected me ruthlessly.

850
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,000
So my heart

851
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,000
hurt.

852
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,840
If you were better at acting,

853
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,400
I might believe it.

854
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,520
I'm not good at acting.

855
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,360
Can we discuss something?

856
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,280
Do you have to be so stubborn in the future?

857
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,280
I know you have strong self-esteem.

858
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,400
But it doesn't mean

859
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,960
I can't buy things

860
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,160
for the girl I like?

861
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,640
Of course.

862
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,240
I like the flowers you gave me.

863
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,840
How about

864
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,160
give me the clothes you designed?

865
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,400
It’s haute couture.

866
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,680
It's not cheaper than this bag.

867
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,360
Do you have to be so stubborn?

868
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,680
It can't be helped.

869
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,160
It's because I'm a golden ox.

870
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,840
It's all your fault.

871
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,520
You insisted on bringing me here.

872
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,720
This is great.

873
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,360
I can only eat dirt for the second half of the year.

874
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,360
If I can't afford the rent,

875
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,160
you have to take care of me.

876
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,920
How about

877
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,200
move in?

878
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,360
What are you talking about?

879
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,440
Hey, Sa Hyun.

880
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,480
Where are you?

881
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,920
They're coming.

882
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,840
Hurry up. I'll wait for you.

883
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,080
Wenwen.

884
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,880
Why are you sweating all over?

885
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,360
I just ran up from the parking lot.

886
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,800
I told you to call a taxi.

887
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,520
You know that.

888
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,720
Mall takes the most time.

889
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,840
It's traffic jam at noon and hard to get a taxi.

890
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:43,760
I don't know why

891
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,880
why I have to make an appointment at noon.

892
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,040
Sa Hyun, I'm not blaming you.

893
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,840
I'm afraid something happened to you on the way.

894
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,920
And Uncle asked us to have dinner.

895
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,960
I have no choice.

896
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,160
It can't always be like this.

897
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,720
We were at the restaurant last time.

898
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,000
but he said he won't come.

899
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,080
Wenwen, he's your uncle.

900
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,560
Can't you tell him

901
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,400
to change time at noon?

902
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,800
I'm busy at work.

903
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,400
Last time, the US stock fell so we couldn't separate.

904
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,200
I guess when you enter the morning star,

905
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,400
you'll be as busy as him.

906
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,800
Good luck.

907
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,040
Do well later.

908
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,280
By the way, don't look at your phone

909
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,600
when eating.

910
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,200
My uncle

911
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,040
doesn't like people who don't focus.

912
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,480
Okay.

913
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,120
Are you okay today?

914
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,640
Let's go.
