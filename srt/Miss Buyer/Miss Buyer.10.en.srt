1
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,800
You have to know that in the fashion circle,

2
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,920
in fashion circle.

3
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,039
Do you understand?

4
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,360
I do.

5
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,280
I don't think you understand.

6
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,280
Hey.

7
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,960
What's wrong?

8
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,000
I don't want to talk to you.

9
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,240
Hey, be reasonable.

10
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,800
I don't want to talk to you, okay?

11
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,600
Be reasonable.

12
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
I didn't say anything right.

13
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,840
I admit my mistake and apologized.

14
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,560
What do you want?

15
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,200
I'll tell you why I'm angry.

16
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,480
Because you've been perfunctory.

17
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,520
The fashion circle looks glowing.

18
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,440
But under the bubbles,

19
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,840
under the bubble.

20
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,320
I've seen many good girls.

21
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,240
If one of them fails to stand,

22
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,440
will be dragged into this.

23
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,560
And you may be the next one.

24
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,560
Do you know how hard it is

25
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,920
to put someone in a set show?

26
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,600
Do you know how many people

27
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,000
to join the later party?

28
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,360
You never cherish these opportunities.

29
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,880
You've been playing. What are you doing?

30
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
Are you watching a male star?

31
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,800
What are you talking about?

32
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,080
I knew you were like this.

33
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,400
I really regret coming to Huan Ya.

34
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,200
Are you done?

35
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,280
There are two shows today.

36
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,040
160 clothes in total.

37
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,120
87 of them

38
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,400
are all earth colours.

39
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,800
I think this will be

40
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,400
the mainstream color of next year.

41
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,640
Two designers and four series.

42
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,040
There are 43 clothes in total.

43
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,160
They all used several colors and middle tube socks.

44
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,560
I also think this will be a hit next year.

45
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,280
I'm an amateur who just entered the fashion industry.

46
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,680
But I'm very sensitive to numbers.

47
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,200
Leo

48
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,320
because he liked me.

49
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,480
so he made an exception for me to buy hands.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,079
You brought me to the Fashion Week.

51
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,400
for bringing me to Fashion Week.

52
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,400
But no matter where you are,

53
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,840
I'm not playing.

54
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,160
I did follow the star.

55
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,600
But do you know what I'm looking at?

56
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,520
From the exhibition hall,

57
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,240
I've been staring at him.

58
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,240
Kim Myung Hwan.

59
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,360
A fashion consultant

60
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,440
fashion consultant.

61
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,000
The three dramas with the highest ratings this year

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,920
He's also the fashion guide.

63
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,840
In the three seasons of TV series,

64
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,960
each series has warmed up four items.

65
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,280
Each copy of China

66
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,480
is worth tens of millions.

67
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,680
So the style he chose in the exhibition hall

68
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,280
is very likely

69
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,360
the trend of the next season.

70
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Of course I have to watch him desperately.

71
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,520
Yes.

72
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,480
I'm not as talented as you.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,800
I'm not

74
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,520
like you.

75
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,240
Even if I watch 100 shows,

76
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,400
I can't become

77
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,520
with good taste and taste.

78
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,600
But I have a clear goal.

79
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,800
I'm doing my best.

80
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,520
step by step

81
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,760
step by step.

82
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,560
You said

83
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,320
the Huanya Fashion Week

84
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,040
is very close with celebrities.

85
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,960
No matter how tacky I am,

86
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,640
I can't be a stupid fan

87
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,400
at the party.

88
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,800
I'm not looking at them.

89
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,840
I'm looking at

90
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,880
might be popular.

91
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,159
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,080
I misunderstood you.

93
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,480
Anyway,

94
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,080
I shouldn't affect you

95
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,880
because I'm emotional. So...

96
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:54,800
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,760
It's okay.

98
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,360
I finally became

99
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,640
in a drama.

100
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,280
On the streets of Huan Ya,

101
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,600
and complained about handsome guys.

102
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,200
It feels good.

103
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,560
What?

104
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,520
I told you many times.

105
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,920
Take a rest if you're tired.

106
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,840
Cry if you feel wronged

107
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,760
It's painful to hold it in.

108
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,120
I don't want to.

109
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,640
I cried a little.

110
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,360
A busybody

111
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,320
came out.

112
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,400
Let me see it with my phone.

113
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:43,880
Let me see

114
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,280
how ugly I am now.

115
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,440
This is you now.

116
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,480
Let me tell you.

117
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,600
no man

118
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,000
feel sorry for a woman like her.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,200
I only feel pity and hate her.

120
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,040
I'm scared too.

121
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,240
I'm afraid someone might come out

122
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,840
saying I stole the edition.

123
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,880
We're shopping for normal people.

124
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,560
Not for you.

125
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,760
a psycho touch.

126
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,080
Who's a psycho?

127
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,480
Cheapskate.

128
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
Arrogant.

129
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,160
Male chauvinist.

130
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,560
Airport.

131
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,720
Let's go.

132
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,040
Hurry up.

133
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,000
How about beer?

134
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:36,840
Sure.

135
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,480
Okay.

136
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,280
For your dream.

137
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,600
For your dream.

138
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,760
Are you happy?

139
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,800
Yes.

140
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,520
Hey.

141
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,240
You're drunk now.

142
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,200
Let's discuss

143
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,240
Let's discuss it.

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,680
Don't flip it again, okay?

145
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,000
What's wrong?

146
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,040
You're a celebrity.

147
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,120
It's not good to get caught.

148
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,880
I had a scandal with Leo.

149
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,360
I don't want to tell you again.

150
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,080
Let me tell you.

151
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,520
everyone will be able to shoot us today.

152
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,880
With your appearance,

153
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,960
no one will believe you.

154
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,760
When you're with that handsome guy in black,

155
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,920
people will believe you.

156
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,360
Look.

157
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,560
Over there.

158
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,640
And there.

159
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,360
Old-fashioned.

160
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,560
But it works.

161
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,360
This is the classic power.

162
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,120
Class is over, Ms. Zhao.

163
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,240
What?

164
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,520
Mainly,

165
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,040
I'm interested in you.

166
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,720
You should be honored.

167
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
At least you have the right to be used by me.

168
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,760
As for the vice president of the headquarters,

169
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,640
and the general manager of Orange, Zhou Boan,

170
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,080
You mean Vincent?

171
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,560
That's right.

172
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,040
I have personal grudges with him.

173
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,360
Mr. Du,

174
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,840
Do you really think

175
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,080
in May?

176
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,120
Zhou Bai’an hurt me in reputation.

177
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,160
I’ll defeat him in business.

178
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,240
That's my goal.

179
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,240
Something bothers me again.

180
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,160
Dad, why did you come down?

181
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,800
Have a seat.

182
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,400
What's wrong?

183
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,840
It's about the company.

184
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,160
Director Lei.

185
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,680
You're still not satisfied

186
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,760
I gave her.

187
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
I think

188
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,560
she just wants to

189
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,040
into handmade.

190
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,080
But as you know,

191
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,280
those old employees and old directors in the company

192
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,560
They refused and refused.

193
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,960
Recently,

194
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,160
learn to watch TV series online.

195
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,720
I didn't have time when I was busy.

196
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,640
It's good to see it now.

197
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,040
I read a story about the Gangnam Dynasty

198
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,840
There's a Hexun in it.

199
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,560
Always with…

200
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,800
Ji Xiaolan.

201
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,240
Ji Xiaolan.

202
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,200
Ji Xiaolan asked the emperor

203
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,240
He said you should come out and say something fair.

204
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,160
Whoever makes sense

205
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,560
who has the right.

206
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,920
Do you know what Qianlong said?

207
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,200
Qianlong said you were wrong.

208
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,760
You two.

209
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,080
Whoever dares to give me money from the Ministry of Revenue,

210
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,000
I’ll stand on the side of him.

211
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,120
Listen.

212
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,920
Those storytellers

213
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,440
You're right.

214
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,320
I see.

215
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,240
What do you think?

216
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,480
The makeup on your face must be 3 kilos thick today.

217
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,080
Everyone knows that

218
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,080
is the best this time.

219
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,600
I don't want to embarrass you

220
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,800
in the exhibition hall.

221
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,320
You've done your homework. Not bad.

222
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
Take this down

223
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,120
Put this in your bag. Hurry.

224
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,600
Why?

225
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,200
This bag is a KOL bag. It's very trendy.

226
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,920
The matching is too deliberate.

227
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,640
There's no point if it's all the key points.

228
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,600
Remember this.

229
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,600
Low-key means luxury, understand?

230
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,680
Yes, sir.

231
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,000
Look at this dress.

232
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,920
Its shoulder line is very ugly.

233
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,480
Right?

234
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,880
It doesn't match, right?

235
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,960
Is that Mr. Partrick?

236
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,440
Hello, Ms. Miyazaki Hiroko.

237
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,200
Hello.

238
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,080
This is Cocoa-san.

239
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,200
So pretty.

240
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,800
Hello

241
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,320
Your design for this season is amazing.

242
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,240
Do you really think so?

243
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,160
Yes.

244
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,240
I want all your clothes

245
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,760
I want them all, okay?

246
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,680
I'm sorry.

247
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
Why?

248
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,960
Because of me.

249
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,800
We just signed an agreement.

250
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,720
All their limited editions

251
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,720
to you.

252
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,640
It's just the beginning.

253
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,160
What a pity.

254
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,240
Yeah.

255
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,280
Excuse me.

256
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,680
Just tell me what you want to ask.

257
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,680
Do you want to ask?

258
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,960
what happened

259
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,000
What's going on?

260
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,080
When I'm embarrassed,

261
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,080
when I'm embarrassed.

262
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,000
It's embarrassing. Stop it.

263
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,680
It's just Hiroko Miyazaki.

264
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,920
Exactly.

265
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,760
With your current status,

266
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,960
is no match for

267
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,840
a real estate business.

268
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Miyake is gone.

269
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,720
And oil Yake, salt Yake.

270
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,080
And we also picked

271
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,000
a lot of good goods.

272
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,480
I'm sure he'll complete the mission.

273
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,080
How do you know his surname is Shen?

274
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,840
I just checked.

275
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,680
What did you find?

276
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,920
He is the visual supervisor.

277
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,480
He was yours before.

278
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,400
Go on.

279
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,600
You used to be good friends.

280
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,880
Then we fell out.

281
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,120
And the conflict must be serious.

282
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,080
After all,

283
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,760
is influential in the country.

284
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,800
If you didn't

285
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,920
you couldn't stay here anymore,

286
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,880
I'm sure he won't set up his own business.

287
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,000
As for the reason,

288
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,320
we can't find any gossip online.

289
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,640
So I think

290
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,920
it must be pressed on purpose.

291
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,240
If so,

292
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,600
it's usually not because of

293
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,480
business problems.

294
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
Why?

295
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,560
Love killing, scandal,

296
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,840
and scandals.

297
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,360
Right?

298
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,160
If you're so good at making up stories,

299
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,400
why don't you become a scriptwriter?

300
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
You can write a journal of Ding Yike's promotion.

301
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,520
It must be a hit.

302
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,600
You told me to tell you.

303
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,360
When will we arrive at the airport?

304
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Our community

305
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,440
is the most comprehensive price

306
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,280
in the neighborhood.

307
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,720
It's close to the school

308
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,680
and the mall.

309
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,880
is close to

310
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,880
to your office.

311
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,120
Just you two.

312
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,440
you just proposed.

313
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,320
choosing our community

314
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,200
to choose our neighborhood.

315
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,240
What I just told you,

316
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,400
Do you have any questions?

317
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,560
Can we use the housing fund?

318
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,640
I'm sorry.

319
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,240
Our house

320
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,720
We don't support public funds now.

321
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,720
When choosing a room,

322
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,880
the full payment comes first.

323
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,600
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,680
Full payment.

325
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,480
Full payment?

326
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,960
The realtor said

327
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,680
how much interest rate can you make in the first set?

328
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,280
Xiaojie

329
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,680
Xiaojie

330
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,800
What are you looking at?

331
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,040
The Wi-Fi on the plane is quite useful.

332
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,800
Is she going back or not?

333
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,840
I don't know.

334
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,240
Xiaojie

335
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,240
Xiaojie

336
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,280
Do you think

337
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,760
Ding Yike

338
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,440
really regard me as a friend?

339
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,040
When she first joined the company,

340
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,360
I helped her a lot.

341
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,880
But now?

342
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,320
Going to Huan Ya is a big deal.

343
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,880
She didn't even tell me in advance.

344
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,600
Here, have some coffee.

345
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,840
Didn't he say he's with his friends?

346
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,520
Maybe he went to be romantic.

347
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,760
Stop thinking about it.

348
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,600
You like

349
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,920
Soo Seol's cosmetics?

350
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,040
Tell her to bring two boxes.

351
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,160
Buy them at the tax-free store. It'll be cheaper.

352
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,560
She was dumped by Lin Sixian.

353
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,080
Who can she be romantic with?

354
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,040
We even go to Huan Ya to watch Fashion Week this weekend.

355
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,120
With friends.

356
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,920
What friend?

357
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,160
It must be Leo.

358
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,960
He's trying to hide it.

359
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,120
I just want to show off.

360
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,760
Why do I hear something sour?

361
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,240
Are you jealous of her?

362
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,320
I'm jealous of her.

363
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,160
I'm now T7. She's only T6.

364
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,960
I'm worried about her.

365
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,680
Let me show you.

366
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,440
This is Leo.

367
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,080
Tell me.

368
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,960
She dresses like this every day.

369
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,480
She's always been quite special to her.

370
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,760
It's the weekend.

371
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,040
I took her abroad

372
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,920
without telling everyone.

373
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,080
What if...

374
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,120
No way.

375
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,400
Many people in this company saw it.

376
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,200
Leo treated her like this.

377
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,320
This...

378
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,200
Why can't you

379
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,480
remind her earlier?

380
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,560
But honestly, Ding doesn't look like

381
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,480
he doesn't look like someone who plays with other things.

382
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,680
It's your fault.

383
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,080
I remember last time,

384
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,200
you asked her to

385
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,320
in front of Leo, right?

386
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,640
Aren't you doing this

387
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,840
to send the sheep into the tiger's den?

388
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,200
What are you talking about?

389
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,360
What kind of person do you think I am?

390
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,960
Do you really think Ding Yike is a fool?

391
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,080
You don't understand Leo's move?

392
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,960
What do you mean?

393
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,840
Besides,

394
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,240
Did I force her to go to Huan Ya?

395
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,160
She's the one who wants to get close to Leo.

396
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,040
Why is it my fault?

397
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,160
Okay, don't be angry.

398
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,960
There are so many people.

399
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,920
It's all your fault.

400
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,600
can't buy a wedding house alone.

401
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,560
Otherwise, I wouldn't

402
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,400
beg here and there.

403
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,600
For a tiring and annoying job,

404
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,680
for a tiring job?

405
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,520
Since I was with you,

406
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,960
I've never been abroad.

407
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,880
I only dare to buy second-hand bags.

408
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,000
What do I want from you?

409
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,800
Enough, Xiaojie

410
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,160
Xiaojie, where are you going?

411
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,760
Xiaojie

412
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,360
What's wrong with me?

413
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,800
Why did I make you angry all of a sudden?

414
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,280
I didn't mean it.

415
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:19,720
Xiaojie

416
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,840
Xiaojie, please forgive me.

417
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,880
I didn't mean it.

418
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,360
I didn't. Go away.

419
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,920
Xiaojie, no.

420
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,360
Xiao...

421
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,360
Xiaojie

422
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,840
Why are there so many people?

423
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
If the police see this,

424
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,760
they'll think I'm suspected of kidnapping girls.

425
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,560
Jiang Jie.

426
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:42,880
It's all my fault.

427
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,640
It's all my fault, okay?

428
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,400
Please spare your husband.

429
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,560
Xiaojie is the best.

430
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,280
What are you doing? Get up.

431
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,160
Can you forgive your husband?

432
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,960
Xiaojie is the best.

433
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,000
Alright, I forgive you.

434
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,560
Get up.

435
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,320
Do you really forgive me?

436
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,560
Yes.

437
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,880
Okay.

438
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
Silly.

439
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,400
But let me tell you.

440
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,240
If you dare to say

441
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,520
that stupid thing again,

442
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,120
you'll never get a permanent position.

443
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,120
There are many people chasing me.

444
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,640
Everyone has a house and a car.

445
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,160
Yes, Mrs. Tang.

446
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,120
Mrs. Tang, if I say something wrong again,

447
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,280
can you forgive me too?

448
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,360
All right.

449
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:22,800
Let's go.

450
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:23,440
Let's go.

451
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,080
Mr. Tang.

452
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,040
To be honest,

453
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,160
I could be a little jealous.

454
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,120
At first, she knew nothing.

455
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,160
She knew nothing.

456
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,360
She has to ask me everything.

457
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,280
I have to help her with everything.

458
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,640
But gradually,

459
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
become

460
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,600
she's hiding everything from me.

461
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,400
I asked her to go shopping, but she didn't come out.

462
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,280
I want to see what she's learning.

463
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,120
She said it's inconvenient to have copyright.

464
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,280
She didn't even tell me

465
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,560
without telling me why.

466
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,120
I just feel awkward.

467
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,480
I really treat her as a friend.

468
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,520
I understand.

469
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,720
I understand. Don't think about it.

470
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,720
He used to be my best friend.

471
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,440
He also joined St. Martin.

472
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,280
But he is not gifted in design.

473
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,480
Just like other students,

474
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,880
he also went to the platinum.

475
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,360
But later I found that he loves doing business.

476
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,000
He has a good eye and a unique wrist.

477
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,520
He's amazing.

478
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:29,840
Before graduation,

479
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,600
he bought an apartment

480
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,280
and bought an apartment at the Sparrow Pier.

481
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,680
After that, my first show

482
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,240
he spent a lot of money

483
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,600
to hire the best designer

484
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,080
to design for me.

485
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,240
After that,

486
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,560
he posted this poster

487
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,160
the famous designer John Fuler.

488
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,040
on the mailbox at the door.

489
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,560
Then John Fuler

490
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,520
really went to my show.

491
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,480
After that,

492
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,600
New York Fashion Week invited me

493
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,320
After working in New York for a while,

494
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,360
we decided to go back to Asia.

495
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,240
So we went back to China and opened a television.

496
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,240
At that time, we were ambitious.

497
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,200
We must

498
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
as the best buyer in China,

499
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,040
we did it.

500
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,400
At that time,

501
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,720
Diorama was one of

502
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,200
in Shanghai.

503
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:15,680
After that,

504
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,800
something happened.

505
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,000
he was instigated by others.

506
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,040
We have a problem

507
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,920
in design concept.

508
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,480
He even suspected

509
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,400
I was a copycat.

510
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,120
After that, he made some moves.

511
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,240
It's like I'm out of sight.

512
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,560
After I left,

513
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,120
I did nothing for a year.

514
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,400
Then we started an exhibition.

515
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,880
Later, I was so angry

516
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,440
I opened a long restaurant.

517
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,880
I'm telling you this

518
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,720
is not that I can't hold back and want to tell you.

519
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,720
I have an interview this afternoon.

520
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,600
The reporters are gossipy.

521
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,720
If they ask about this,

522
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,040
please change it for me.

523
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,840
I don't want to hurt

524
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,480
I created.

525
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,640
I don't want to hurt their reputation.

526
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,920
Are you listening to me?

527
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,080
What are you thinking about?

528
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,560
I...

529
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,120
Say it.

530
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,480
You won't cheat others.

531
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,440
It must be someone else.

532
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,560
Also,

533
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,400
my best friend suddenly changed.

534
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,280
You must be upset.

535
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,160
I'm not talking about the fight.

536
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,720
Betrayal and angry.

537
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,080
It's just because

538
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,600
just because

539
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,440
a relationship you really value

540
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,120
suddenly disappeared.

541
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,440
Sometimes you doubt

542
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,560
that you have a problem with your taste.

543
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,400
Sometimes I think

544
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,680
because I'm too narrow-minded,

545
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,840
because I'm too petty?

546
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,960
Actually, my best friend and I

547
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,160
were a little...

548
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,960
Forget it.

549
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,520
Anyway, I think

550
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,520
it depends on fate.

551
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,960
Harmony leads to parting.

552
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,360
If you're nice to me, I'll be honest with you.

553
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,560
If you don't treat me well,

554
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,000
I'll be indifferent.

555
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,120
If one day

556
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,720
make a scene one day,

557
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,600
Then...

558
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,960
Then let it be.

559
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,880
Anyway, there's only one principle.

560
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,320
You'd rather suffer to death

561
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,240
than yourself.

562
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,080
If you really

563
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,280
so clear,

564
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,480
you wouldn't have

565
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,840
be so timid

566
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,480
as a coward.

567
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,520
I was right.

568
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,120
I used to be a coward.

569
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,000
but it doesn't mean I'll be a coward in the future.

570
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,960
I won't rely on Lin Sixian anymore.

571
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,520
Really?

572
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,400
I pursued him

573
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,280
because I couldn't let him go.

574
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,920
But it doesn't mean I'll be heartless

575
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,840
I'll put up with everything.

576
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,320
I read too many comics.

577
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,400
I thought if I put in effort,

578
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,320
you'll achieve your goal.

579
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,360
But what happened?

580
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,640
I was obsessed with love.

581
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,480
I didn't touch anyone.

582
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,200
I only touched myself.

583
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,120
I still want to thank his mother

584
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,160
for enlightening me.

585
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,360
That kind of stupid thing

586
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,960
without asking the result.

587
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,720
I don't want to do it anymore.

588
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,680
Come here.

589
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,000
What?

590
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,160
What?

591
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,400
No.

592
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,640
You're lying.

593
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,480
Eyes don't lie.

594
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,760
I'm sure you haven't let go of Lin Sixian.

595
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,000
I...

596
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,880
I said I don't want him.

597
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,960
is different from letting him go completely.

598
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,560
It's not that easy

599
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,160
It's not that easy.

600
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,360
break up so easily.

601
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,680
You need three months to lose weight

602
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,040
to lose weight.

603
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,520
What if it bounces back?

604
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,400
It doesn't matter.

605
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,840
At worst,

606
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,240
I can't control myself.

607
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,160
If I do that again, I'll go after him.

608
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,840
Then he ignores me.

609
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,040
and then you mock me.

610
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,440
Then I'll give up.

611
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,920
One or two more times,

612
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,760
I'll get tired.

613
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,680
I read psychology.

614
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,480
This is called a series of allergies.

615
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,240
You're quite optimistic.

616
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,680
You have to think it through.

617
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,480
Shameless.

618
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,200
It's better than being stubborn.

619
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,360
I can't let others

620
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,200
after others are done.

621
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,200
Am I right, Guru Zhao?

622
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,160
No.

623
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,040
I mean,

624
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,720
it's not right for you to pursue him.

625
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,800
To fall in love with someone

626
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,160
and pursue it without hesitation.

627
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,240
Not only is it beautiful,

628
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,760
but also

629
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,680
I need courage.

630
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,160
Did I shock you just now?

631
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,840
I have to explain.

632
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,840
It can't be helped. He's too charming.

633
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,840
He always

634
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,400
out of the room.

635
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,360
It's just a coincidence, not you.

636
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,360
I wasn't electrocuted by you.

637
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,680
Why are you blushing then?

638
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,280
Do you dare to say you weren't imagining anything?

639
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,480
Yes, I was.

640
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,560
But do you know what I'm thinking?

641
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,520
About what?

642
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,840
I’m thinking

643
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,640
the way you talked about Shen Jin

644
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,680
when you mentioned Shen Jin.

645
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,440
are a couple

646
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,040
who killed people.

647
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,120
You said you wouldn't hit women.

648
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,520
You said you wouldn't hit women.

649
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,320
But seriously,

650
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,760
you are just good friends.

651
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,840
This article is quite good.

652
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,160
Can you give it to us?

653
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,480
Of course.

654
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,720
I heard your show

655
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,920
will be canceled

656
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,240
half of the clothes will be ordered.

657
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,840
Almost.

658
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,080
As a minority,

659
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,800
of the majority,

660
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,000
Why didn't you stay in London, New York?

661
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,480
to create your own brand,

662
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,520
but to come back

663
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,880
and start a buyer.

664
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,080
I’m in Haute Couture.

665
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:45,600
So every year,

666
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,560
I don't need to do too many designs

667
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,800
I can support myself.

668
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,640
I often ask myself

669
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,040
Is she really the best designer

670
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,280
among Chinese?

671
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,480
Of course.

672
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,520
The answer is denied.

673
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,720
I just went smoothly

674
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,760
on the way.

675
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,080
During my first show,

676
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,920
I met someone like John Fuler.

677
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,880
Gold fingers.

678
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,320
But other designers

679
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,480
have such a chance.

680
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,880
So in my distant store,

681
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,639
other than the works of

682
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,440
of famous designers,

683
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,880
there are many works

684
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,040
I carefully selected.

685
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,960
Do you want to

686
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,480
your international popularity

687
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,520
to open a fast access for them.

688
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,159
Of course.

689
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,719
I think I have the obligation and responsibility

690
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,840
to do this.

691
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,520
You must have fallen for him.

692
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,800
I was like that too.

693
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,400
Look at his legs. They are so long.

694
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,440
Look at his handsome face, right?

695
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,040
You would like it too.

696
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,880
right?

697
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,320
In that case,

698
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,360
why did you choose

699
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,719
leave the television?

700
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,639
I’ve also checked the change of the shares.

701
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,320
Four months ago, your shares

702
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,000
suddenly decreased to three percent.

703
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,480
Is it because

704
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,159
what happened

705
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,239
between you and your good friend?

706
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,239
I think you are really gossipy.

707
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,560
It's very simple.

708
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,159
It sounds like

709
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,960
like a palace fight.

710
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,120
It's simple. I'm a designer.

711
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,760
I don't know how to make money.

712
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,640
I don't care.

713
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,520
It's just like me

714
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,080
Just like me.

715
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,520
small

716
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,120
and exquisite.

717
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,600
I can handle it.

718
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,960
It won't affect my main business.

719
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,000
So you voluntarily withdrew from the diorama.

720
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,320
And your Parterrick Cho

721
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,880
will continue to launch new series this year.

722
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,480
Right?

723
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,880
Maybe.

724
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,240
Have you got some inspiration

725
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,800
Or are you going back to New York

726
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,800
with other designers

727
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,320
with other designers?

728
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,720
When you interview me next year,

729
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,720
when you interview me next year.

730
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,560
Okay?

731
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,200
Okay, thank you.

732
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,640
That was close

733
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,960
You know about Shen Jin?

734
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,880
He told me

735
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,680
He also told you about the copyright?

736
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,680
Yes.

737
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,520
Oh no.

738
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,000
I'm afraid

739
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,680
would play a substitute.

740
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,560
It must be true love.

741
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,360
It'll be so convenient

742
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,560
in the future.

743
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,440
Mrs. Su, I look forward to working with you.

744
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,320
What is this?

745
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,600
Stop pretending.

746
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,440
You were insulted and hurt.

747
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,360
[decided not to hang yourself on that crooked tree.]

748
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,640
My prince charming reached out his warm hands

749
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,160
to take you to a thousand miles.

750
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,880
Then you'll be in the Gangnam style.

751
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,080
in Gangnam style.

752
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,520
It sparks with passion. Enough.

753
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,840
Stop thinking nonsense.

754
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,000
That's not true.

755
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,880
Hey, kid.

756
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,360
Don't lie if you did something bad.

757
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,720
My eyes that are good at discovering adultery

758
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,000
I could smell

759
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,320
I could smell

760
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:34,480
of love.

761
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,240
There's a picture and the truth. See for yourself.

762
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,480
How romantic.

763
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,160
I've been with my prince charming for so long,

764
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,440
he never took me to

765
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,280
a fashion week abroad.

766
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,560
You're blushing

767
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,120
What are you blushing about?

768
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,280
That's not true.

769
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,640
Yes, I've decided to give up.

770
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,000
to pursue my ex.

771
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,720
But it has nothing to do

772
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,480
Zhao Yuyuan.

773
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,320
He took me to Huan Ya Fashion Week

774
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,760
to teach me

775
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,280
how to become a buyer.

776
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,240
100% work relationship.

777
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,680
Don't talk nonsense.

778
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,000
If he doesn't teach me,

779
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,520
I'll be mad at you.

780
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,520
No.

781
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,520
No. Are you acting in an idol drama?

782
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,440
I only have

783
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,880
Work, work, work.

784
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,400
If I get eliminated this time,

785
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,040
I can't even afford to live here.

786
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,960
There's a spy?

787
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,360
Look.

788
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,280
Environment and atmosphere

789
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,520
can create romantic delusions.

790
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,840
But reality only wakes people up.

791
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,280
Don't worry.

792
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,160
Although

793
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,440
a little bit,

794
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,000
But I know very well

795
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,640
I read three books. He studied St. Martin.

796
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,120
I take the subway and he drives Harley.

797
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,800
He can talk to the president's daughter

798
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,760
in the first row of the show.

799
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,960
And I

800
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,400
I can only stand on my toes

801
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,000
in the corner.

802
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,520
Although they are all upstairs and downstairs,

803
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,840
Although they are all temporary,

804
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,520
but I had no choice.

805
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,680
It depends on his mood.

806
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,320
It's not a romance movie.

807
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,040
There aren't so many Cinderella.

808
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,080
Right?

809
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,520
But

810
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,320
after hearing what Xu Fei said,

811
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,840
sounds quite romantic.

812
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,480
Whatever

813
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,200
Reasonable fantasy. Good body.

814
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,560
Ding Yike, stop thinking.

815
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,800
Don't think about it.

816
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,240
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow.

817
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,320
Come on.

818
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,440
Go to bed.

819
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,800
Mr. Lin, time for the meeting.

820
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,560
I was so tired last night.

821
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,160
I'm so sleepy.

822
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,040
I saw the document at 3:00 p.m.

823
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,640
Okay.

824
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,240
Morning.

825
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,840
Your clothes are so beautiful. Where did you buy them?

826
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,800
It's from Huan Ya.

827
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,960
It's a new one.

828
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,760
You did a good job with the details.

829
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,640
What brand should I look at?

830
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:00,560
Yeah, what brand?

831
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,480
It's a nice combination.

832
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,560
Pailinka.

833
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,080
Well...

834
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,800
One, one, one, one, one, one.

835
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,200
independent designer.

836
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,800
It's good. The style is good.

837
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,760
The fabric is good too.

838
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,240
This bag looks nice too.

839
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,400
Yes, close your waist.

840
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,600
Not bad, Coco.

841
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,680
You're wearing high-quality goods already?

842
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,680
No.

843
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,800
This is his sample.

844
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,960
The area I live in

845
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,920
are all foreign stores.

846
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,720
Take it seriously.

847
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,480
There will be one or two top products.

848
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,720
Which shop?

849
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:26,760
Send me the address.

850
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,680
Okay, I'll send it to you.

851
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,640
You should be more careful when buying hands.

852
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,240
You don't wear your own clothes

853
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,800
instead of wearing your own clothes.

854
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,960
If you go to Victoria one day,

855
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,480
you'll have to carry two big wings to work.

856
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,400
Boss. Boss. Boss.

857
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,160
Morning, Mr. Du. Morning, Mr. Du.

858
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
Don’t you go to work?

859
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,400
Go to work.

860
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,400
That's Ding Yike.

861
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,760
New clothes.

862
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,960
has changed.

863
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,000
Mr. Du.

864
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,480
Which meeting

865
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,680
Which meeting room is it?

866
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,760
Hold on. I'll check it.

867
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,000
In A1.

868
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,760
Got it.

869
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:37,960
Now you're watching

870
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,200

871
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,200
After that,

872
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,600
you can go to the exhibition hall

873
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,000
to the exhibition hall

874
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,920
to order.

875
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,640
Remember, your budget

876
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,600
only 200,000 yuan.

877
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,160
The sales will be sold in a week.

878
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,280
You guys go ahead.

879
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:02,640
