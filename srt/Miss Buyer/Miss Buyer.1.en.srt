00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,550
This is the Fifth Qualification Competition

3
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,630
of Men & Women in Workplace in 2019,

4
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:06,750
a quality interactional job hunting show.

5
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,310
Seven candidates from the previous four competitions

6
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,430
have successfully advanced.

7
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,669
Among the four candidates today,

8
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,430
who will be the one to laugh till the end?

9
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,670
Who will it be?

10
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,230
The answer will still be revealed

11
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,070
by the board of review of open auction guests,

12
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,790
who is formed with

13
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,670
16 professional HR media people and boss mentors.

14
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:27,870
Rules.

15
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,070
The candidates who get two votes

16
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,150
of the boss mentor board

17
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,310
will be qualified.

18
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,430
The boss mentor board abstained from voting.

19
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,870
Board of review will vote.

20
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,590
Vote for the retest and the final. The audiences will vote.

21
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,230
May,

22
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,390
as the new power of Chinese fashion,

23
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,800
it also represents the rising place of Chinese fashion

24
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,510
in the world.

25
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,310
We welcome talents with international visions

26
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,310
to join us

27
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,510
and grow together with us.

28
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:49,870
Hello.

29
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,150
We're Shanghai Yuanxi Film and Television Company.

30
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:54,430
We are a new emerged company

31
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,310
with core competitiveness.

32
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,310
We welcome all candidates

33
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,230
to join our company.

34
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,150
Good luck.

35
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,150
Welcome to

36
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:01,070
the second season Men & Women in Workplace by iQIYI.

37
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,590
I'm the host, Li Xiaoai.

38
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,710
I don’t follow the script. What’s wrong?

39
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:07,510
What's wrong if I don't follow.

40
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,510
What's wrong if I don't follow the script?

41
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:08,950
What?

42
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,790
I got dumped and unemployed.

43
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,150
If it were you, wouldn't you be upset?

44
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,670
My name is Ding Yike.

45
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,510
Before I was born,

46
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,070
my dad said he liked both boys and girls.

47
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,150
But after I was born,

48
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,790
he said,

49
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,390
"A girl will do, right?"

50
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,430
That's the origin of my name.

51
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,150
26 years old.

52
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,590
I graduated from Wujiang College of Economics for three and half years

53
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,230
and was unemployed for four months.

54
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,310
No one has an incurable disease in my family.

55
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,950
I never had any car accidents either.

56
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,870
I thought reality show was a lie.

57
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:46,390
But they told me

58
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:48,070
I can get 2,000 yuan

59
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,510
if I can get in the second round.

60
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,030
So I came.

61
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,950
Whether I'm a rock or a diamond,

62
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,430
it depends on

63
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,310
how much you pay me.

64
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:07,870
You said you were fired before.

65
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,070
Tell me the specific reason.

66
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,070
Are you not capable enough

67
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,790
or you can't adapt to the workload?

68
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,150
My previous company

69
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,030
is right next to Microsoft.

70
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,950
In that place,

71
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,990
all employees

72
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:19,070
are capable ones in the industry.

73
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,149
Later, the mobile business of Microsoft was shut off.

74
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,270
Suddenly,

75
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,830
thousands of people were fired.

76
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,550
Then you tell me,

77
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,510
are they not competent?

78
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:28,710
Or they don't want to work overtime?

79
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,110
You just said you graduated only three and half years ago.

80
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,390
Why does your resume say

81
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,590
you have five years of experience?

82
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,870
I work four to six hours overtime a day

83
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:41,110
even on holidays.

84
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,990
I calculated it with primary school math.

85
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,870
If I don't talk about the insurances and housing fund

86
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,710
and overtime salary,

87
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,270
do I talk about dreams with you?

88
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,670
Your senior executive's annual resignation rate

89
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,390
is 37.85%.

90
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,270
You want me to work for three years first.

91
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,670
But three years later,

92
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,230
maybe you would have left long ago.

93
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:53,150
Congratulations, Ding Yike.

94
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,870
I hate fashion.

95
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,110
It cheats people to spend much money

96
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:37,430
by putting a layer of fake shell

97
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,990
on something not so good.

98
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:41,390
Add a few drops of hyaluronic acid,

99
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,550
and say it's the essence of the deep sea pearl,

100
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,830
and sell it at a high price.

101
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,110
It's fine for women to be fooled,

102
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,830
but men are so stupid as the same.

103
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,710
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,790
It's her.

105
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,830
You lied to me.

106
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,990
It's because your mom thinks I'm an outsider.

107
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,710
And I don't have a house in Shanghai.

108
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,870
I only have 1,500.

109
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:23,950
Yike.

110
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,070
If you can't make it, just go back to the hometown.

111
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,710
I'm not going back.

112
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,270
I must find a way

113
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:33,110
to stay in Shanghai.

114
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,070
I must live a decent life

115
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,150
and make Lin Sixian regret.

116
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,550
But that woman is from Zuantai

117
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,590
and studied in England.

118
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,870
How can you compare with her?

119
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,870
It's all Lin Sixian's fault.

120
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,270
You treated him so well.

121
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,110
He's not human.

122
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,710
I'm talking about her.

123
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,550
I really like her sharp tongue style.

124
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,110
Yes, I've only watched one episode.

125
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,110
I've become a fan.

126
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:24,710
Right?

127
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,710
Then you tell me

128
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,430
whether they are not competent

129
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,830
or they don't want to work overtime?

130
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,830
You just said you graduated only three and half years ago.

131
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,270
Why does your resume say

132
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,590
you have five years of experience?

133
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:37,909
I work four to six hours overtime a day.

134
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:38,909
My name is Ding Yike.

135
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,270
I'm 26 years old.

136
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,070
I graduated from Wujiang College of Economics.

137
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,270
I hope I can find a job that can make me...

138
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,910
Sis, do you think I'm an immortal?

139
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,950
I'm just a host.

140
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,390
In reality show,

141
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,590
you just need the audiences to vote for you.

142
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,150
Right?

143
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,590
Sis, you should really

144
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:54,710
watch reality shows.

145
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:55,830
In reality shows, you should...

146
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,070
Otherwise,

147
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,030
you can just act in exaggeration, right?

148
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,390
Or you act in a passive way.

149
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,510
Cry, will you?

150
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:05,350
Or you can do whatever you want.

151
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,470
Anyway, you have to be special.

152
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,910
Otherwise, the audience won't remember you.

153
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,070
Right, what can I do?

154
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,830
I can just ask two more questions.

155
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,830
That's all I can do.

156
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,070
Then, you can see me now.

157
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,590
Yes, I'm getting used to

158
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:22,830
this sharp-tongue style gradually.

159
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,270
It's better than

160
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,590
the stupid sweet girl

161
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,830
who dated Lin Sixian

162
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,950
for seven years

163
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:29,710
and got dumped.

164
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,270
She is not that good indeed.

165
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,270
But if I press the pass button first

166
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,630
and send her to the final,

167
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,590
it will increase the popularity of May

168
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,710
on the Internet.

169
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,030
Everything,

170
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,710
either be the first one to do it

171
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,830
or the last.

172
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,710
No one will remember the ones in the middle.

173
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,150
I have to go.

174
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:55,950
I have a phone call.

175
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,950
Xiuqi.

176
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,710
Hello, Dad. What's wrong?

177
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,510
I'm in the hospital.

178
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,390
You're in the hospital?

179
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,830
Okay, I'll be right there.

180
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,510
It's nine o'clock New York time.

181
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,150
Lingyun Group, one of the three world fashion groups,

182
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,390
announced that

183
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,190
it has got

184
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,150
the controlling stake of May,

185
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,270
a top three fashion companies in China,

186
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:42,950
I work four to six hours overtime a day

187
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,270
even on holidays.

188
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,830
I calculated it with primary school math.

189
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:49,830
You said you were fired before.

190
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,910
Tell me the specific reason.

191
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:52,150
Are you not capable enough

192
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,830
or you can't adapt to the workload?

193
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,630
My previous company...

194
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,510
Why are you watching it?

195
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,390
You have broken up.

196
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,950
And they suddenly fired thousands of people.

197
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,710
Then you tell me,

198
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,510
whether they are not competent...

199
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,030
Mom,

200
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,270
why don't you like her always?

201
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,630
It's not that I don't like her.

202
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,830
I just can't accept

203
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,030
a daughter-in-law from another city.

204
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,390
Not only that,

205
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,830
her family background is just at an average level.

206
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:29,710
It won't help you at all.

207
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,830
Mom, we are still young.

208
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,590
And we are both capable.

209
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,830
We can rely on our own efforts.

210
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,710
Let me ask you.

211
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,630
When her parents get old,

212
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,830
will they want to come to Shanghai for hospital?

213
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:43,270
Do they want to live in their daughter's house and enjoy their retirement?

214
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,390
If you are with Yike,

215
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,710
I think

216
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:48,270
you will never

217
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,150
live in the city for the rest of your life.

218
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,190
Wenwen is different.

219
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,390
She's from Shanghai.

220
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:56,470
She earns a lot

221
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,350
in her company.

222
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:01,270
And her uncle is a fund manager.

223
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,070
You're also in this field.

224
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,270
I'm sure he can help you in the future.

225
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,150
Everyone,

226
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,590
who can be

227
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,950
the champion of the iQIYI show

228
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,510
the second season of Men & Women in Workplace?

229
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,590
Who can get

230
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,590
the annual salary contract worth 200,000 yuan?

231
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,590
Let's applaud to congratulate Ding Yike.

232
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,590
Thank you. Thank you.

233
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,150
Congratulations.

234
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:43,830
Thank you.

235
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,270
Thank you.

236
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,590
Thank you.

237
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,510
Congratulations. Congratulations, Yike.

238
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,150
Come on.

239
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,270
During the final,

240
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,950
three judges showed you

241
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:53,830
pass.

242
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,510
In other words,

243
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,350
it's time for you to choose.

244
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,350
Then your fate will be decided

245
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:00,590
by the lucky wheel.

246
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,750
Let's take a look.

247
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:13,630
No fashion company.

248
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,390
Congratulations. It's May. Congratulations.

249
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,590
Congratulations.

250
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,910
Can I go to iQIYI?

251
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:26,270
Well, I don't have an interest in fashion.

252
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,070
Look at the camera. Smile. No.

253
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,150
They all say

254
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,270
Men & Women in Workplace has changed my destiny.

255
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,270
But does luck means

256
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,190
giving you

257
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,910
a cake you hate the most?

258
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:01,950
I'm sorry. I want to give up.

259
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,470
You have no right.

260
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,950
You have nothing.

261
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,150
What can you give up?

262
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,190
Well,

263
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,830
I'm going to the PR department.

264
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,710
Hello.

265
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,590
I'm here to register.

266
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,590
Hello, Director Lei. Hello, Director Lei.

267
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,070
Print 10 copies of the document I sent you

268
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,270
for the Purchase Department.

269
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,510
Tell them to have a meeting at 10.

270
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:08,150
Okay.

271
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,510
Morning, Director Lei.

272
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,630
I've only been here for seven days and you're three times late.

273
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,390
Send his attendance report to HR

274
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:15,950
and make him resign.

275
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:17,070
Okay.

276
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:18,190
Director Lei, Director Lei.

277
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,350
Hello.

278
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,390
I'm Ding Yike to register here.

279
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,830
Who asked you to recruit her?

280
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,710
Didn't you say

281
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:28,390
Duo Liang's pass

282
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,830
can increase the popularity

283
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:30,590
of May?

284
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,590
I only asked you to be the guest for me.

285
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,030
I didn't ask you to make a decision for me.

286
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,470
The company is almost others'.

287
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,830
Look at you.

288
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,630
Why did you recruit so many

289
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,270
useless people?

290
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,350
Who is it?

291
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,390
Mr. Du.

292
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,830
The Purchase Department will have a meeting in five minutes.

293
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,510
Director Lei,

294
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,390
this is the company.

295
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,350
Please call me Manager Du.

296
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,270
Manager Du, will you come later?

297
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,710
I'm busy.

298
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:56,830
It's okay.

299
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,590
I'm just

300
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,390
informing you out of courtesy.

301
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,350
Director Lei,

302
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,950
since you are so polite,

303
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,390
don’t forget that the company still belongs to Family Du.

304
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:06,830
For now, right?

305
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,150
What did she say?

306
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,390
She...

307
00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:17,950
A good man doesn't fight with a woman.

308
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,710
The board of the company sent

309
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:21,590
such a woman here...

310
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,070
What do they want?

311
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,510
Is she a woman?

312
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,390
Mr. Du, then...

313
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,150
Ding… Ding Yike.

314
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:32,710
It’s up to you.

315
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,070
Okay.

316
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,470
Three-month compensation.

317
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,390
I've tried my best

318
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,070
for you.

319
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,470
I heard you don't like

320
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,510
fashion.

321
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,390
You can find another new job.

322
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,590
The cost of finding a new job

323
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:51,630
is definitely more than three months' salary.

324
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:53,710
Six months.

325
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:55,950
Give it to me. I'll leave right away.

326
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,070
Impossible.

327
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,150
Do you want to calculate

328
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,510
how much the PR cost

329
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,069
will be

330
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,990
if I tell the media

331
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,270
May breaks the promise

332
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,270
right after the show?

333
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,270
Keep her for now.

334
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,109
Wait until Ding Yike

335
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,869
finish the entrance training.

336
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,069
So from today on,

337
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,110
the original Purchase Department in May

338
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:30,990
will be withdrawn

339
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,470
and a new Buyer Department will be set up.

340
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:34,150
Director Lei,

341
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,630
Although you, as the director of Commercial Department,

342
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,230
is in charge of the entire sales system,

343
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:39,230
yesterday in the email,

344
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,110
I have replied to you clearly that

345
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:41,590
the construction and withdrawal of departments

346
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:42,470
must be approved by the board.

347
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,270
It's not up to you.

348
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,630
The headquarters sent me here

349
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:46,630
to help May get reincarnated.

350
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:47,990
We have to change it from a normal beef dish

351
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:49,070
into a butter fried

352
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,350
better beef dish.

353
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,510
If you don't agree,

354
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,750
I have to apply to the headquarters

355
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,350
to change the Board of Directors.

356
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,230
Anyway, the Purchase Department can't be withdrawn.

357
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,230
Then add Buyer Department.

358
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,750
The purchase system is full in headcounts.

359
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,470
Then cut some people from the Purchase Department.

360
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:04,070
We need at least 10 people

361
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,470
for Buyer Department.

362
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:08,750
Three at most.

363
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:09,390
Seven.

364
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:09,990
Six.

365
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,750
Deal.

366
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,350
Inform HR Department.

367
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,990
Buyers recruited by me

368
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:21,950
will register tomorrow.

369
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:22,630
If any staff

370
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,150
of the Purchase Department want to change their position,

371
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,470
they can send their resume

372
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:26,630
and work report this year

373
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,150
to my email.

374
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:28,150
That's it. Dismiss.

375
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:31,750
Let's go.

376
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:35,590
What is a buyer?

377
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,230
She's from the headquarter.

378
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,870
There's no need to confront her now.

379
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:41,350
I'm useless.

380
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,870
I've fought for half of my life

381
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:45,950
but I lost to an outsider.

382
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:48,590
Dad, don't say that.

383
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,270
But about this,

384
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,950
it's not that I can't stand it, but...

385
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,150
Let it go.

386
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,630
The whole industry is not good these two years.

387
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,630
It's good that Lingyun came in.

388
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,230
At least it can solve the problem of

389
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,470
insufficient capital chain.

390
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,750
It's the only way

391
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,070
to bear it and get through the situation.

392
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:10,350
Our family can only rely on you.

393
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,630
Don't worry, dad.

394
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,750
Leave it to me.

395
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:21,710
Take a look at the slides.

396
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,230
These styles

397
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:23,870
are the popular ones

398
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,630
of our company in recent years.

399
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,150
Every design on it

400
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,470
has created a sales record of over a million.

401
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:32,630
The information is in front of you.

402
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,750
You can take a look.

403
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,270
I know you all have some experiences

404
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,350
in the industry.

405
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,270
You can give us

406
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,230
valuable advice.

407
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,270
Since you're in May,

408
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:55,270
I want to know

409
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,070
why you came to May.

410
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,990
I came to May

411
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,870
to become

412
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:00,870
the Chinese Chanel.

413
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,470
I hope you can help me

414
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,630
to realize this wish together.

415
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,950
Ms. Ding,

416
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,870
why did you come to May?

417
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,870
To make a living.

418
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,830
What else?

419
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:20,230
Nothing else.

420
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,630
You shouldn't think like that.

421
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,590
You must love this industry.

422
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,590
So you must focus on...

423
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,990
Not everyone

424
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,350
is interested in fashion.

425
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,630
Ms. Ding.

426
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:33,990
Can you stand up

427
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,870
and answer my question?

428
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,390
OK.

429
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:41,990
I hope everyone here

430
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,630
can have passion

431
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,070
towards the future.

432
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,070
Even in movies,

433
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,230
if a person doesn't have a dream,

434
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:49,630
it's worse than a salted fish.

435
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:50,870
The salted fish in the supermarket

436
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,390
is worth dozens of yuan for half a kilo.

437
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,950
Who can afford it without salary?

438
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,470
Ms. Ding,

439
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:00,270
you are completely irresponsible

440
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,110
for your career.

441
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,990
Madam,

442
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,390
I think being honest

443
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:06,230
is to be responsible for your future.

444
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,950
You want to be the Chinese Chanel?

445
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,390
Is that possible?

446
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:13,110
By the way, my English name is Coco too.

447
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,870
Before I came to this company,

448
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,590
I studied her file.

449
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,230
She was a genius designer.

450
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,630
And she had a boyfriend who was not ordinary as well.

451
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:23,750
If we were capable,

452
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,630
why are we still working here?

453
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,110
So the fake big words are liked.

454
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,230
Making money to support the family

455
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,830
will become the king’s new clothes.

456
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,350
Mr. Du, I suggest to end

457
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,630
Ding Yike's probation period as soon as possible.

458
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,630
Let Ding Yike

459
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,110
quit the training

460
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,750
and go directly to Buyer Department.

461
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:57,230
It's time for Director Lei

462
00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,070
to have a headache.

463
00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:00,870
Mr. Du is right.

464
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,350
Compared to PR department,

465
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,150
you are more suitable to Buyer Department.

466
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:07,750
I've told you.

467
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,350
I'll go to the department

468
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,630
according to the contract.

469
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,470
It's normal

470
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,390
to have internal changes within the company.

471
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:14,870
Miss,

472
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,750
we're both working here.

473
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,070
Can't you be considerate?

474
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,230
Besides,

475
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,950
Buyer Department is really awesome.

476
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,070
It's much better than PR Department.

477
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,630
Look.

478
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:32,230
Who is qualified to sit in the first row

479
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,230
in the Haute Couture Fashion Week?

480
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,510
Not designers,

481
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,470
not devils in Prada,

482
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:37,470
but the buyers who have a right of speech

483
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,350
in fashion circle.

484
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,350
Designers create art.

485
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,990
Buyers are responsible for

486
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,630
the trend of the industry.

487
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,590
They are like hunters

488
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,630
to capture the latest products.

489
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,590
Their taste is excellent.

490
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,710
The most picky customers

491
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,110
will also praise their taste.

492
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,470
These first class regular customers

493
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,350
have tens of millions of orders.

494
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:59,150
They wear glamorous clothes and are arrogant,

495
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,350
and guide the industry.

496
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,150
Really?

497
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:02,710
Being a buyer

498
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:04,630
is better than a PR manager.

499
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,110
If I lie to you,

500
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,710
I'll never have a seat in the subway for my whole life..

501
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,070
That one.

502
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,110
Well...

503
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,070
Director Lei.

504
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,830
This is Ms. Ding, new here.

505
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:42,630
Hello, Director Lei.

506
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,510
-My name is Ding... -Just sending me

507
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,870
whoever it is.

508
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,110
Do you think this is a shelter?

509
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:46,750
No.

510
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,110
Mr. Du said

511
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,350
Ms. Ding is

512
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,350
carefully selected by him

513
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,470
from Men & Women in Workplace.

514
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,470
Good soldiers should follow strong commandors.

515
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,390
If he likes her,

516
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,470
why didn't he keep her for himself?

517
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,150
It's to support

518
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,630
our newly established Buyer Department.

519
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,830
Does he think

520
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,150
everyone can be a buyer?

521
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,870
Does she know the basic quality

522
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:08,110
a buyer needs?

523
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,470
Has she ever visited the production line?

524
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,870
Does she know what marketing,

525
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,990
data integration, competition analysis?

526
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,750
Does she know how to deal with designers

527
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,870
and how to

528
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,750
train the stores?

529
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,630
How many clothes in this room

530
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,630
belong to earth tone?

531
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,990
Is this bag made of bay crocodile skin

532
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,230
or Mississippi crocodile skin?

533
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,470
Can she tell?

534
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,470
What is mark down?

535
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,270
What is OTB?

536
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,950
I'm sure not many old employees of May

537
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,990
know about this,

538
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:33,510
let alone a newbie.

539
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,270
15.

540
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,990
If what you mean by earth tone

541
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:43,070
is cream color and pale brown,

542
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,710
there are 15 pieces in total.

543
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,270
Did you include olive and khaki?

544
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,870
Not including silk scarves and bags,

545
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:54,630
olive six,

546
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,470
and no khaki.

547
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,470
What did you do before?

548
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:00,750
Analyst of a consulting company.

549
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,990
Mark down is discount rate.

550
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,110
OTB refers to Open to Buy.

551
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,470
I still don't know

552
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,390
what crocodile skin

553
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,390
and snake skin is.

554
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,750
But when

555
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:09,990
I did company transformation before,

556
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:11,270
I went to the clothing factory with my boss.

557
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,990
I know what data analysis is.

558
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,710
If I want to know

559
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,990
the sales volume of him, you and me,

560
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,350
what function do we use in excel?

561
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,230
Vlookup.

562
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:22,070
But I'm more used to SAP.

563
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,830
Your previous job

564
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:23,990
has nothing to do with fashion.

565
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,470
Why do you want to come to May?

566
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,270
I lost my job and my boyfriend.

567
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,870
I have nowhere else to go.

568
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,110
So I want to take a bet

569
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,590
to change my life.

570
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,510
Bet. Do you think we run casinos?

571
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,870
All commercial activities are gambling.

572
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,990
Just like buyers

573
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,630
make decisions based on data analysis.

574
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,390
Similarly,

575
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:44,710
playing cards is based on the calculated probability by remembering the cards.

576
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,510
And fashion is changing at any time.

577
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:48,710
When buyers make decisions

578
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:49,630
by their own judgment,

579
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,470
isn't it like the god of gambling,

580
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:53,870
just buying and deciding without regrets?

581
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:55,350
Yes.

582
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:56,630
Didn't the Internet say

583
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,590
place your bets and wrong love will not be revised?

584
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,870
Arrange a seat for her.

585
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:02,110
OK, Director Lei.

586
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,350
Thank you, Director Lei

587
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,630
By the way,

588
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:07,990
what's your name?

589
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,350
Ding Yike.

590
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,590
Yi

591
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:12,990
Ke(explaining it with Chinese expressions),

592
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,990
not whoever it is.

593
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,350
When you can stay here,

594
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,390
you can emphasize your presence.

595
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,950
She means

596
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,390
I might not be able to stay.

597
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,510
It's rare that

598
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,990
she can take you in.

599
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,750
You don't know.

600
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:36,270
She was sent

601
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,590
by Lingyun

602
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:38,830
after the acquisition of our company.

603
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,990
On the first day of office, she said

604
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,950
the HR structure in May was redundant.

605
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,470
All departments should claim to

606
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,150
the layoff plan on my hand.

607
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,990
Just due to those words,

608
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,470
within a week,

609
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:52,350
one fifth of the employees were...

610
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,470
It seems that Mr. Du

611
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,070
sent me here out of "kind heart".

612
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:01,830
Jessica.

613
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,630
This is Yike, a new comer.

614
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,630
Please arrange a seat for her.

615
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,590
Yike.

616
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,990
Jiang Jie.

617
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,430
Shh!

618
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,470
Be quiet.

619
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,110
Work hard.

620
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:18,350
You're just like when you were in high school.

621
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,750
You haven't changed at all.

622
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:23,110
You're talking about me? You changed a lot.

623
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,990
I thought

624
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,750
you were some female celebrity just now.

625
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,830
Come on.

626
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:28,870
Not bad.

627
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:29,990
I remember you didn't like flowers

628
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,350
or dressing up

629
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:32,710
when you were little.

630
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,950
Why are you here in May?

631
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,470
You don't like watching TV, do you?

632
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,830
I work overtime every day.

633
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:40,510
I have to serve Tang Li when I go home.

634
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,870
I don’t have the spirit.

635
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,710
Are you married?

636
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,110
Soon.

637
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,590
I'm looking for a house.

638
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,150
Awesome.

639
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,230
What about you? Are you married?

640
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,070
Where did you buy it?

641
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,750
A bachelor like me

642
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:53,870
whose balance has two digits less

643
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:56,390
than the password

644
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,270
can only rent a house.

645
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,350
Tang Li and I are renting a house together now.

646
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,830
Anyway, it’s good that you’re here.

647
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,230
I'll protect you from now on.

648
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,630
No matter what,

649
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,510
I've been here in the Purchase Department for five years.

650
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,470
If it weren't for...

651
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,750
I should have been promoted to deputy manager next month.

652
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,990
It's already lucky

653
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,630
that I was not fired like Jiajia.

654
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,750
You're the supervisor. She came from the air.

655
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,230
If she wants to stabilize the position,

656
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:25,390
she has to kick and pull with both hands.

657
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:26,990
She must use you

658
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,230
since you are still here.

659
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:29,070
Don't worry.

660
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,710
You'll get a promotion if you do a good job.

661
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,750
Not bad.

662
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:33,390
You're indeed an experienced consultant.

663
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:36,470
I’ll count on you

664
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,590
in the future.

665
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,350
OK.

666
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:39,750
Hurry up.

667
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,230
Give me the documents.

668
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,110
I bragged big just now.

669
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,990
I didn't have

670
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,230
any confidence at all.

671
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:46,950
By the way,

672
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,270
what's the difference

673
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,470
between buyer and purchaser?

674
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,870
No difference.

675
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,150
Buyer is purchaser

676
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,230
if it's translated.

677
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,990
They both do the selection and order.

678
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,470
Only with a foreign name,

679
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,470
it will seem international.

680
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:00,470
Why is Leo Lui

681
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,630
not Leo Lei?

682
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,230
It's Hong Kong pronunciation.

683
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:05,710
She doesn't speak Cantonese at all.

684
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,350
She's probably an impostor.

685
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:08,630
What era is it now?

686
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,350
Does she think only people from Hong Kong are popular?

687
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,870
What are you afraid of?

688
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:13,710
She can't manage our Finance Department.

689
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,470
She's only been a few days,

690
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:17,110
and she's made the situation so tense.

691
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,070
Our director has long disliked her.

692
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,630
Don't you have a supplier

693
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,710
who does OEM

694
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:23,630
for Lingyun 23KEY?

695
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:26,110
Why don't you ask about her background?

696
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,230
Time to get off work.

697
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,990
I'll read a while more. You leave first.

698
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:40,990
Bye.

699
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,750
Bye.

700
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,950
Smoky grey, light grey, moon grey.

701
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:04,470
Charcoal grey, smoky grey, moon grey.

702
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,430
Light grey.

703
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:22,230
Who can tell

704
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:24,310
the differences between these cloth?

705
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:57,550
Notify these people

706
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:58,790
to come to the meeting at 9:20 tomorrow morning.

707
00:30:59,430 --> 00:30:59,790
Okay.

708
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:03,870
Go home.

709
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,470
Buy yourself

710
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:06,230
some decent clothes.

711
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,990
Even if May is not that good,

712
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,350
we're still a fashion company.

713
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:11,430
It's improper to dress like this.

714
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,350
My clothes are also from Xiuyi House.

715
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,390
There are three layers in the chain of distain in fashion industry.

716
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:18,750
Haute Couture despises made-to-measure.

717
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,150
Made-to-measure despises ready-made clothes.

718
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:21,550
A quick fashion brand

719
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,750
like Xiuyi House

720
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,070
is even unqualified to be despised.

721
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,270
Buyers buy clothes.

722
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,670
Is it that important what they wear?

723
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,510
Steve Jobs only wore jeans

724
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,950
and black pullovers in four seasons.

725
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,630
His black pullover

726
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:37,230
is custom-made by Issey Miyake.

727
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,590
Zuckerberg

728
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,950
wears T-shirts worth only dozens of yuan.

729
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,510
But he's willing to spend 30 million dollars

730
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,630
to get all the neighbors

731
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,990
of his house worth six million US dollars

732
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,830
move away.

733
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:45,990
If you can't

734
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,070
understand this,

735
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:47,830
I suggest you

736
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,870
to leave smoothly

737
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,510
or

738
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,550
forget your English name Coco.

739
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,390
Puppy or Kitty is more suitable.

740
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,270
I’ll be a good buyer.

741
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:58,550
You've watched too many cartoons.

742
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,750
That's enough.

743
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,750
Leave me alone.

744
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,110
I don't want to.

745
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,630
But you're affecting others.

746
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,390
Right?

747
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:28,230
Sorry, everyone.

748
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:32,150
I was fired yesterday.

749
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,870
I just...

750
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:36,950
broke up.

751
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:41,110
Can you understand me?

752
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,830
Thank you.

753
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,750
See? This is the present you.

754
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:00,710
Let me tell you.

755
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,270
No man

756
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,750
thinks that such a woman is worth of pity.

757
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,510
They will only think she's pitiful and annoying.

758
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,430
Can you have some backbone?

759
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,510
Yes.

760
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:15,710
Your bag.

761
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,110
It turns out

762
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,030
what encouraged me for so long

763
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,950
is just a joke to others.

764
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,790
But I have to

765
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:09,390
get up from the mud.

766
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:11,350
Why should I care about what others think of me?

767
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,070
Come on.

768
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,070
Everyone,

769
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,950
if you are the buyers of May,

770
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,910
would you order such clothes?

771
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,750
I don't think so.

772
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,670
The color of this clothes

773
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:05,150
doesn't suit Asian people's skin tone.

774
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,110
I think customers

775
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,350
might not like

776
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:08,830
an old-fashioned feeling.

777
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,510
And using a cartoon T-shirt as un undergarment

778
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:13,950
is not classy and tasteless.

779
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:16,510
It's a disaster.

780
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:17,790
I agree.

781
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,190
This kind of acrylic fiber

782
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,510
can cause static electricity and pills.

783
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,670
The customer experience is bad.

784
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:23,390
If it were me,

785
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,630
I would choose cellulose acetate.

786
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,230
You can't even choose your own clothes,

787
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,910
and you still want to be a buyer for others?

788
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,190
I'll give you five minutes.

789
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,230
Go to the sample room

790
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:34,510
and pick out clothes that can be seen.

791
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:35,870
If you still have

792
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,870
such an unbearable taste,

793
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,430
don't ask for a probation period.

794
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:39,670
Go now.

795
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:01,950
I'm here.

796
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:04,230
Yike.

797
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:05,670
Yike.

798
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,110
Take off

799
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,230
your annoying bandage.

800
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:17,950
Okay.

801
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,350
Take a look for me.

802
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:20,230
What should I wear?

803
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,830
Yike, you can wear this.

804
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:23,790
It's safe.

805
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:24,550
Okay.

806
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,350
I see.

807
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:36,870
I want that one.

808
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,870
You all think you are the buyer.

809
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,590
But in my opinion,

810
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,310
you are just purchasers,

811
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:47,190
Purchasing and following others to purchase without brain

812
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,550
can even accomplished by high school students.

813
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:50,710
A real buyer

814
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:51,990
needs to decide the production chain

815
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,270
of the whole company.

816
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:16,950
But it's okay.

817
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,590
There are not many real buyers

818
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,510
in China.

819
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,270
So I'll give you a chance.

820
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,710
This is the following work arrangement.

821
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,870
You have three months

822
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,630
to prove to me

823
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:34,390
whether you are really capable

824
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,110
to be buyers.

825
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,990
I'm the only judge.

826
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,870
And I don't rank 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

827
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,630
There are only two roads ahead of you.

828
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,190
Either go or stay.

829
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:43,350
Understand?

830
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:44,630
Yes.

831
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,870
The documents have been send to your email.

832
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:47,630
Dismiss.

833
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,830
You are really suitable for May.
