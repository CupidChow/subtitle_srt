1
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Look at her.

2
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,520
We were scolded, but she

3
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,560
Qunhua was taken down.

4
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:01,160
The small dealers down there also obeyed.

5
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,720
Of course she should keep smiling.

6
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,280
Tina, you're the best.

7
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,320
You chose her as your partner.

8
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,720
Your task is almost done, right?

9
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,440
One or two more.

10
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,120
Tina, come on.

11
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,960
Don't let Ding Yike beat you.

12
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,800
What are you doing? Can't you see I'm copying it?

13
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,760
Something urgent came up. I need to plug in.

14
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,360
No.

15
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,600
First come, first served.

16
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,800
Talk to me first come first served.

17
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,840
When I was in the president's office,

18
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,720
you didn't graduate high school.

19
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,800
Even a cleaner can enter the president's office.

20
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,040
The buyers are all T6 in the company.

21
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,520
What about you? Are you in T5 now?

22
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,240
What did you say?

23
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,240
So what if you're a buyer?

24
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,120
So what?

25
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,240
He's just relying on Leo.

26
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,960
Did Leo transfer all the resources

27
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,520
to you

28
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,600
to you.

29
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,720
So what?

30
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:28,520
Go tell Mr. Du if you dare.

31
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,640
Little girl, don't provoke me.

32
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,400
What's wrong with learning at such a young age?

33
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,480
You're flattering me.

34
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,120
I'm warning you today.

35
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,480
Don't flatter yourself too much.

36
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,960
you'll become neither a man nor a woman.

37
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,600
Who are you talking about?

38
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,040
Forget it.

39
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,640
It's not like I'm a man or a woman.

40
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,560
I'll say who's not a man or a woman.

41
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:43,920
But

42
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:44,880
I'm used to it.

43
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,079
The Purchase Department is really interesting.

44
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,160
What do you mean?

45
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,640
You told me today

46
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,160
First come, first served.

47
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,360
What do you mean?

48
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,160
Guo Youming.

49
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,120
You're at the reception.

50
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,240
Why is the document on the floor?

51
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm not blaming you, Tina.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,240
You can't even get the document.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,959
Are you okay?

54
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,640
I'm fine.

55
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,000
Don't act tough. I heard it.

56
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,040
When you're alone,

57
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,520
when you're alone.

58
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,960
We're born with no advantage.

59
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,280
I heard you've taken care of Qunhua.

60
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,440
Yingling, Mushroom Girl,

61
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,840
and all the stores

62
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,760
All done.

63
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,280
How about you?

64
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,880
I'm almost done. There's one or two more.

65
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,640
Come on. Don't push yourself.

66
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,880
If it doesn't work,

67
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,920
let me do it.

68
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,400
Okay, you do it.

69
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,680
Jiang Zhijie’s boss is hard to deal with.

70
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,600
I’ve been worried about him.

71
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,000
Coco, I'm glad you're willing to help.

72
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,680
A heart.

73
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,720
Sure.

74
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,640
Where is my package?

75
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,640
There's no package for you.

76
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,040
Impossible. Ding Yike just...

77
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,360
Ding Yike.

78
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,200
Are you kidding me?

79
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
Okay.

80
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,600
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

81
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,000
Don't get carried away.

82
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,600
Jiang Zhijie is at the bottom every year.

83
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,680
Because he has a strong backing.

84
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,760
Even if Ms. Jiang

85
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,920
plays games every day,

86
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,840
or karaoke.

87
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,680
In May,

88
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,000
no one dares to be tough with him.

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,840
Now it's good.

90
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:55,800
You take the blame yourself.

91
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,880
Baby, what happened yesterday?

92
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,600
I've been waiting for you downstairs.

93
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,640
Why don't you come down?

94
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,800
Come on.

95
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,320
Drink.

96
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,760
I need to use the toilet. I’ll be back soon.

97
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,880
Ms. Jiang.

98
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,760
For this promotion mission,

99
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,320
I've accepted

100
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,200
They all picked up.

101
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,360
but you didn't.

102
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,400
I'm afraid the higher-ups will blame me.

103
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,080
saying Jiang Zhijie is a bad example.

104
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,120
It's not appropriate

105
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,440
to deal with you.

106
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,240
Right?

107
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,000
And this

108
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,360
was opened by my father

109
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,040
lent money to my uncle.

110
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,720
Try to deal with one for me.

111
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,880
Ms. Jiang,

112
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,520
I'm not trying to get away with this.

113
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,080
She went too far.

114
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,000
Today, I just

115
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,000
to make it clear.

116
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,680
Do it or not?

117
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,120
Whatever.

118
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,680
But you must remember

119
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,440
on the first day she came to the company,

120
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,040
she told us

121
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,560
the entire Sales Department

122
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,400
of the Sales Department.

123
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,920
Firstly, the layoff.

124
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,640
They started to demote

125
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,960
our supervisors.

126
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,200
If she

127
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,000
make the sales of Wuyi

128
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,040
the consequences

129
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,880
It's good.

130
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,720
Lin Sixian and I are really good.

131
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,320
Don't worry, okay?

132
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,760
Mom, I gotta go.

133
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,280
Oh my god.

134
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,560
Okay.

135
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,800
It's about the show, right?

136
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:20,480
No problem.

137
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,680
I'll write you this recommendation letter.

138
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,520
Leave it to me.

139
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,360
Bye.

140
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,480
You're helping me again.

141
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,320
Aren't you tired to be the central air conditioner every day?

142
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,200
You don't know

143
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,920
Models

144
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,840
It's also hard inside.

145
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,880
It's not easy for anyone.

146
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,160
We can help them if we can.

147
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,120
Besides, not everyone can help me.

148
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,640
I'm just helping those who deserve help.

149
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,640
Be careful.

150
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,280
Don't let anyone be the back-up of the clouds.

151
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,120
No.

152
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,360
She always thinks we're...

153
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,480
Darn it.

154
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,640
Let me tell you.

155
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,240
I was wondering why

156
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,200
but no one succeeded.

157
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,560
It's all your fault.

158
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,760
You have to pay me back.

159
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,640
Get lost.

160
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,400
The word “money comes back” and “ethics”

161
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,360
can't appear

162
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,320
at the same time.

163
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,360
Okay.

164
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,560
But you know,

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,920
the female editors

166
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,040
female editor, female supermodel,

167
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,960
with the popularity and views,

168
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,720
It's nothing compared to Ding Yike's underwear.

169
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,280
It's a blessing

170
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,360
It's a blessing in disguise.

171
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,240
What?

172
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,440
with that girl?

173
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,120
your grudge is over.

174
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:31,720
I have no choice.

175
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,960
A soft-hearted person.

176
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,800
She's short-handed.

177
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,000
Besides, she didn't mean it.

178
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,760
She even went to the hospital for you.

179
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
How can you let it go?

180
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,720
You're so generous.

181
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,000
Tell me then.

182
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,080
Why are you so stubborn

183
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,040
with Dad?

184
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,040
Mo Yuan,

185
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,840
Your shop is really not suitable for living.

186
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,240
If you move back,

187
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,120
What if you get sick again?

188
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,000
It's been years since our mother's incident.

189
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,760
Why do you have to go out with your own father?

190
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,000
What's wrong? There's water everywhere.

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,920
I'm sorry.

192
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,040
I'll dry it right away.

193
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,960
Sorry.

194
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,920
It's leaking.

195
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,200
What's wrong with this?

196
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,960
The water pipe is broken.

197
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,520
Did you turn off the main switch?

198
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,920
Yes.

199
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,920
Be careful. The floor is slippery.

200
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,520
Are you out of your mind?

201
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,320
Can a tape

202
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,360
Can it stop the water? Oh my god.

203
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,920
You're out of date.

204
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,760
This is a professional glue.

205
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,120
Really? That's amazing.

206
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,960
Where did you buy it?

207
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,120
An omnipotent network.

208
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,840
There are quite a lot of tools.

209
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,000
Of course.

210
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,280
Anyone who rent a cheap house

211
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,640
Everyone has experience in dealing with emergencies.

212
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,920
Keep the water and electric switch in mind.

213
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,520
It's too expensive to rely on yourself.

214
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,120
Cold medicine for laxative trauma.

215
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,280
and three treasures for rent.

216
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,960
Canal powder, toolbox and glue.

217
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
What?

218
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,640
Let me do it.

219
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,360
Don't get wet. Here.

220
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,360
You know everything.

221
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
What is your boyfriend doing?

222
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,480
He said he likes independent girls.

223
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,560
Stupid.

224
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,680
That's nonsense.

225
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,360
Let me tell you.

226
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,720
if a man likes someone,

227
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,000
he will never let this woman

228
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,240
to work outside.

229
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,520
He wants to

230
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,720
hold her in his hands every day.

231
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,760
He hopes that

232
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,600
like a parasite.

233
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,360
like a parasite.

234
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,200
Don't go anywhere.

235
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,560
Don't find

236
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,240
in finance.

237
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,680
doesn't suit you. He's too cunning.

238
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,800
Don't say that about him.

239
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,200
You still can't let him go?

240
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,840
It has nothing to do with me anyway.

241
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,600
Here.

242
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,880
Clean it.

243
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,520
It's done.

244
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,920
Thank you.

245
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,840
Why is your quilt so wet?

246
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,520
Are you afraid of leaking down?

247
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,520
Cover it with a blanket.

248
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Be smart.

249
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,440
You managed to avoid

250
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,960
from you.

251
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,880
How are you going to sleep tonight?

252
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,000
We'll talk about it tonight.

253
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,520
What's wrong?

254
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,840
I can't lift my hand

255
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,840
I don't know what's going on

256
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,200
Come on.

257
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,360
What?

258
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,320
You can never finish your work.

259
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,480
People need to rest.

260
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:47,840
Understand?

261
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,800
Does it hurt here?

262
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,720
Yes.

263
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,440
Hang in there.

264
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,000
Did you have a hard day today?

265
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,440
No, I'm fine.

266
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,720
To be honest,

267
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,720
No, really.

268
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,200
I'm not lying.

269
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,400
Although the client didn't eat it today,

270
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,760
they just ignored me

271
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
She didn't scold me.

272
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,920
My mom was a little annoyed when she called,

273
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,600
but she cares about me.

274
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,200
It's good.

275
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,080
The water pipe is broken

276
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
I fixed it too.

277
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,040
The wallpaper is not broken or leakage.

278
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,720
The landlord won't ask me for compensation.

279
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,560
Everything is fine.

280
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,800
Tell me if you're tired.

281
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,160
It's not embarrassing.

282
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,480
Okay.

283
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,840
I can't say I'm tired

284
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,480
It'll make me feel better.

285
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,040
In life,

286
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,360
you have to give yourself some blood.

287
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,480
I know.

288
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,480
You looked down on me again.

289
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,520
I feel like everyone is showing off

290
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,240
in front of me.

291
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,040
I was thinking about going back.

292
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,080
But what can I do?

293
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,240
How would I know if I don't try?

294
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,320
Even if I knew it would fail,

295
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,800
I have to try my best.

296
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,560
Right?

297
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,920
I won't do it. I'll lose if I don't do it.

298
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,960
You're too persistent.

299
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,000
You're crying.

300
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
What?

301
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,440
Girls like cleanliness.

302
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,320
There's mud on your hands.

303
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,680
Don't move.

304
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,320
There are tears.

305
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,840
At least it can prove the sadness

306
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,240
is not illusion.

307
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,840
All right, pack up.

308
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:49,760
Let's go.

309
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,080
Where are you going?

310
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,400
Aren't you tired after working all afternoon?

311
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,720
Hurry up.

312
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,800
Here, go get it at 11 o'clock.

313
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,440
What?

314
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,359
Poverty limits my imagination.

315
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,560
I didn't know

316
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,200
a dry cleaner can dry the quilt.

317
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,720
Don't you know

318
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,960
that hotels sell drinks too?

319
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,319
Half an hour ago.

320
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,640
Someone doesn't know

321
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,880
tape can replenish tubes.

322
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,319
Why aren't you eating?

323
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,520
It's not good

324
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,720
Scallion and ginger

325
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,400
Young Master.

326
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
Did you really cook

327
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,440
Did you really cook it yourself?

328
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,000
Of course.

329
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,520
Didn't you go to the hotel to pack?

330
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,640
Thank you.

331
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,680
You insulted my character

332
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,200
and praised my cooking skills.

333
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,040
Your kitchen is small.

334
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,640
Let me tell you.

335
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,280
The so-called genius

336
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,240
can make

337
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,520
with an electric rice cooker.

338
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,320
I said you're fat and you're panting.

339
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,360
Shameless!

340
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
Who's shameless?

341
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,600
Let me tell you.

342
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,480
A poor kid should have taken care of the family sooner.

343
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,520
I'm good at housework.

344
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,280
I spent two hours

345
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,640
I spent two hours

346
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,760
to clean it up.

347
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,240
The motorcycle is shiny.

348
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,800
What did you say?

349
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,800
Where are you going?

350
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,320
What's wrong?

351
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,040
Shut up.

352
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,640
What?

353
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:37,840
Shut up.

354
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,680
Or I'll break the rule, you know?

355
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,920
What rule?

356
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:43,960
A ring that doesn't kill women.

357
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,200
Let me help you.

358
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,840
No.

359
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,160
Go back now.

360
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,320
We must be having a bad time.

361
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,760
Please go home. Thank you.

362
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,120
Did I fold it wrong?

363
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,080
I just want to make it neat.

364
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,800
Miss,

365
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,520
Don't use your public chain store as an excuse. It's not a big deal.

366
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,160
of the public chain store.

367
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,640
Can you put it in my shop?

368
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
I want a sense of advancement.

369
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,880
High-class, you know?

370
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,560
I know.

371
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,880
You made it so messy on purpose.

372
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,360
Guru, tell me

373
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,240
what should I do?

374
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,120
Tell me.

375
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,560
Why do you put it like this?

376
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,600
Look, you're a buyer.

377
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,400
I'm also a buyer.

378
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,960
All buyers are a family.

379
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,880
With your level,

380
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,520
How dare you call yourself a buyer?

381
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,160
How dare you say that?

382
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,840
You're the primary and newcomer.

383
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,000
That's why I studied hard.

384
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,360
Guru, tell me.

385
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,120
why these clothes

386
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,000
these clothes in order?

387
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,800
And

388
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,560
the skirt and clothes over there

389
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,840
I've set them up.

390
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,240
Isn't this more exciting

391
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,480
customers' desire to buy?

392
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,360
For the sake of your poor day,

393
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,560
Here.

394
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,160
80% customers,

395
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,040
will walk

396
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,440
you'll walk against the clock.

397
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,200
Understand?

398
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,160
This is the most expensive

399
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,640
is the most expensive.

400
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,520
You can take a look at the label.

401
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,480
So I have to

402
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,280
put it here alone.

403
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,680
Separate all the clothes

404
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,120
The guests can see it as soon as they enter

405
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,840
In the shortest time

406
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,080
who can accept my style

407
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,000
and the price.

408
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,680
Understand?

409
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,560
Again.

410
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,280
This dress

411
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,560
You put it together.

412
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,080
That's right.

413
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,000
But this shirt

414
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,840
It suits this pair of pants

415
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,360
It also goes well with other clothes.

416
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,000
But the price is too low.

417
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,120
I have to

418
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,520
separately with other clothes.

419
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,280
in case of pollution.

420
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,440
the price of this row of clothes.

421
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:53,800
Remember.

422
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,440
New Money's family put the label

423
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,200
put it on the shoes like onions.

424
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,240
Got it?

425
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,240
What are you doing?

426
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,480
What are you doing?

427
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,120
Why are you

428
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,280
shiny?

429
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,160
I've been keeping it.

430
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,200
I've been keeping it to make it old.

431
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,440
This is called plaster, you know?

432
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,040
It's too dirty.

433
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:14,920
So I...

434
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,880
The whole store

435
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,600
to stabilize the atmosphere.

436
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,040
The customers can see it as soon as they enter.

437
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,360
As long as they accept my distant atmosphere,

438
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,960
even if I put a brick here,

439
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,840
even if I put a brick here.

440
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,640
Understand?

441
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,240
Guru, can I record it?

442
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,160
Where did you learn this?

443
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,320
Paris, New York, Tokyo,

444
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,360
and St. Martin.

445
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,040
Knowledge is money.

446
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,680
I've memorized these five words since I was a kid.

447
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,160
Now I finally understand.

448
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,560
What I said just now

449
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,400
didn't mean to provoke you.

450
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,080
I'm not trying to hurt you.

451
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,560
I know.

452
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,240
I'm sorry.

453
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,600
for causing you trouble again today.

454
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,920
Forget it. It's not the first time anyway.

455
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,760
You've done a lot of bad things to me.

456
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:15,960
My shop

457
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,480
change the furnishings every week.

458
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,320
That's it.

459
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,960
I'll go up first.

460
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,720
Bye.

461
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,040
Look.

462
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,640
The world is really cruel.

463
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,600
Those who are more talented than you

464
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,920
usually work harder than you.

465
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,240
But the crueler thing is

466
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,560
even if you are talented and hard-working,

467
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,640
but carp

468
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,560
to jump up.

469
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,120
It's a cliff

470
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,000
from the eagle.

471
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,000
is still a few dozen meters away.

472
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,520
Jiang Zhijie’s boss is hard to deal with.

473
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,480
I’ve been worried about him.

474
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,960
Coco, I'm glad you're willing to help.

475
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,480
A heart.

476
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,720
OK.

477
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,160
Ms. Jiang.

478
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,560
But...

479
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,480
Is that why a carp should give up?

480
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,600
It's not time to take the quilt.

481
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,480
Can I stay here for a while?

482
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,000
Suit yourself.

483
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,840
I think it's better not to.

484
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,040
Guru, can I have a try?

485
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,480
No.

486
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,280
There are too many colors. It's too deliberate.

487
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:06,960
Like this.

488
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,440
I take back what I said.

489
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,040
You can still be saved. You're not that bad.

490
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,240
Being a buyer in May

491
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,040
at least it's enough.

492
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,920
It's my pleasure

493
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,480
to have your guidance.

494
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,240
It's eleven o'clock.

495
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,360
Yes.

496
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,400
It's 11 p.m. now.

497
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,800
My quilt.

498
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,680
You're back.

499
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,200
Yeah.

500
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,000
Wait.

501
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,760
What are you doing?

502
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,200
You're lucky.

503
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,440
When I was in school,

504
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,440
There's a video in the hard disk.

505
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,320
and some information.

506
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,160
Go back and learn. It's a good deal for you.

507
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,760
I'll study hard.

508
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,920
Why are you so nice to me?

509
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,640
Don't get the wrong idea.

510
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,640
I was going to throw it away.

511
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,920
Here.

512
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,160
I treat all girls the same.

513
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,200
I have no distinction.

514
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,640
But I think you're a good girl.

515
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,040
You should stand higher.

516
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,320
Look further.

517
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:23,920
When

518
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,400
you can stand on Milan

519
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,680
or Paris Fashion Week.

520
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,720
and have fun with others,

521
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,840
you won't be obsessed with anyone.

522
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,040
Rest early.

523
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,640
Work hard to improve yourself.

524
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,280
Good night.

525
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,360
Will that day really come?

526
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,360
Copyright is always a problem

527
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,840
in fashion industry.

528
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,840
Because the speed of fashion changes

529
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,720
Are you busy?

530
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,680
Are you watching American dramas?

531
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,200
Jiang Zhijie

532
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,360
to accept

533
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,720
to buy hands.

534
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,600
We're not buying hands.

535
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,480
for us to buy hands?

536
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,040
Aren't they all from the company?

537
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,880
But if you fail,

538
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,160
Leo will only eliminate you.

539
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,640
Let me ask you.

540
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,240
Where is my package?

541
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,000
What package?

542
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:08,800
Stop pretending.

543
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,120
Keep pretending.

544
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,440
Ding Yike.

545
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,160
When you figure it out,

546
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,600
in front of everyone,

547
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
in front of everyone.

548
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,600
to me.

549
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,160
When can I

550
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,000
call Jiang Zhijie?

551
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,520
Thank you. Don’t bother.

552
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,640
I didn’t get Jiang Zhijie.

553
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,120
But who said

554
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,960
to complete every mission?

555
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,080
As long as I'm not the last two,

556
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,600
I can stay here.

557
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,680
I'm an eyesore.

558
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,560
But you...

559
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,480
Why does it sound weird today?

560
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,000
Are you not feeling well?

561
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:45,920
I see.

562
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,080
I have brown sugar.

563
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,440
Do you want some?

564
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,520
Kids nowadays

565
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,080
are quite eloquent.

566
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:01,880
Okay.

567
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,400
May May

568
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,880
unprecedented promotion

569
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,360
Success.

570
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,080
Come on.

571
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,600
Thank you.

572
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
Why did you pick on him?

573
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,960
He looked down on

574
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,560
We bought each of our hands.

575
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,200
Hello, Ms. Chen. What's up?

576
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,840
The promotion event next door is ahead of schedule.

577
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:37,600
You know?

578
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:38,840
I don't know.

579
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,840
We're over 600 minus 200.

580
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,560
It's 600 minus 220.

581
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,720
Hello?

582
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,440
Boss, our promotion has been intercepted.

583
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I already know.

584
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,760
What should we do now?

585
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,760
Don't panic.

586
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,520
Will we lose?

587
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,880
Tina, what would you do?

588
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,800
Avoid the price war.

589
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,160
In front of the key mall,

590
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,960
Rent the open-air promotion venue now.

591
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,680
Make sure the customers are distributed

592
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,640
before the customers come in.

593
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:21,880
Xu Wenxi

594
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
I think it can improve

595
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,000
the promotion bonus.

596
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:26,920
Coco.

597
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,400
Boss is calling you.

598
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,040
Wait, right away.

599
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,920
Let's go to the online store.

600
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,480
buy their scarfs and belts.

601
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,440
Beautiful People's online store and physical stores

602
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,560
are in sync.

603
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,400
In this season,

604
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,920
each piece is over 500 yuan.

605
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,320
The price is over 100.

606
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,760
In other words, a customer

607
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,960
buy a dress

608
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,760
and an accessory,

609
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,360
can easily meet

610
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,840
600 minus 220.

611
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,520
But what if we buy

612
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,600
from the Internet?

613
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,440
Then customers

614
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,680
buy more than two clothes

615
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,960
to achieve a perfect discount.

616
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,000
It's not worth it.

617
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,160
It's like abolishing their promotion.

618
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:03,720
Yes.

619
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,320
And the platform

620
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,960
for seven days.

621
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,680
We can

622
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,320
return it after the Golden Week.

623
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,400
I checked.

624
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,560
the purchase volume of their accessories

625
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,960
less than 5,000 pieces per season.

626
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,120
In other words,

627
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,840
the company only needs 500,000 yuan

628
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,640
to solve the problem.

629
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,680
How did you know?

630
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,600
the purchase volume of their accessories

631
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,640
won't exceed 5,000.

632
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:21,360
I checked their financial reports last year.

633
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,480
After the single price was removed,

634
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,120
you can guess it.

635
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,560
Good job.

636
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,920
Boss, can we do that?

637
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,320
Why not?

638
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,560
Besides,

639
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,520
Who said our promotion policy

640
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,640
is 600 minus 200?

641
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,680
It's a simple 60% off.

642
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,240
and 200 minus.

643
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,000
Which one will you choose?

644
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,200
You're right.

645
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,480
You're really something.

646
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,240
As expected from Lingyun Headquarters.

647
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,200
No one cares about her this time.

648
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,840
She wants to make this performance.

649
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,280
But it's a nice move.

650
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,360
I'm not convinced.

651
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,480
I knew you would be here.

652
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,600
I received an email as soon as I got off the plane.

653
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,760
We can treat

654
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,720
the girls of Qiaozi.

655
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,160
The war hasn't started yet.

656
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,840
Mr. Du, if you have time to have fun here,

657
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,360
why don't you...

658
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,320
Don't worry.

659
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,440
As for the online shopping,

660
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,320
the online shopping.

661
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,560
I won't let the platform find out.

662
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,920
And this is top secret.

663
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,320
Only you buy hands

664
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,560
and the Finance Department.

665
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,680
All other departments are kept secret.

666
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,080
But will the board mind it?

667
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,080
I revised the promotion plan

668
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,880
without permission.

669
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,680
I'm here. Don't worry.

670
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,560
Just tell them we've discussed it.

671
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:50,600
By the way,

672
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:52,960
Why did you change your mind?

673
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,320
Because business spies are everywhere.

674
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,920
You're amazing this time.

675
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,800
Congratulations.

676
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,240
Thank you.

677
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:03,760
This time,

678
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,880
you can definitely stay.

679
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,080
But we

680
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,280
we don't know.

681
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,200
No, no.

682
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,280
It depends on the actual result

683
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,160
the actual battle result.

684
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,520
Don't be modest.

685
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,040
Boss sent me an email.

686
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,280
to give you a bonus.

687
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,760
Really?

688
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,360
What's the bonus?

689
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,320
Most of the clients suggested it.

690
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,640
That's why Director Lei

691
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,720
to a straight fold.

692
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,720
Of course.

693
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,000
Otherwise, why did you

694
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,760
announce the bonus now?

695
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,480
Yes.

696
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,520
Jessie.

697
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,320
Your friend is more thoughtful than you.

698
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,440
He just came to the company.

699
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,120
You're almost the head of Director Lei.

700
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:40,720
Ke Ke.

701
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,880
It's time to treat us.

702
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,000
They're here.

703
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,400
Okay.

704
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,680
How about Haagen Das?

705
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,840
Okay, no problem.

706
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:50,920
Count it.

707
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:51,840
You, me.

708
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:52,680
I'm here. I'm here.

709
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,320
No need.

710
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,560
Xiaojie, do you want it? What flavor?

711
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,280
Just Jiang Jie.

712
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,160
Not me?

713
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,120
Yes.

714
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,720
We want it too.

715
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,760
Me too!

716
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,480
Please spare my life.

717
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,480
I haven't paid my salary yet.

718
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,680
I'll pay when I get paid.

719
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,560
We'll pay after we get paid

720
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,080
We'll pay when we get paid.

721
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,679
Comrades.

722
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,639
I'm sorry.

723
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,280
I heard it.

724
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,800
Ding Yike said she wants to treat everyone

725
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,400
to eat Haagen Das.

726
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,719
Guo, are you kidding me?

727
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,040
What are you talking about?

728
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,920
Ding Yike

729
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,480
will be promoted soon.

730
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,080
What's wrong with buying us some ice cream?

731
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,239
How about ice cream hot pot?

732
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,480
That's better.

733
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:32,360
OK? OK.

734
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,080
Sure.

735
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,920
What do you want to eat?

736
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,520
Don't ask me. Ask him.

737
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,600
I never said

738
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,880
to treat everyone to Haagen Das.

739
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,040
Someone wants to be generous.

740
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,360
No problem.

741
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,760
But I'm sorry.

742
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,520
Someone wants to be a dog.

743
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,400
But I'm not a bun.

744
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,280
Ding Yike.

745
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,400
Guo Youming.

746
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,520
Who are you calling a dog?

747
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,240
I'm talking about you.

748
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:57,960
Make it clear.

749
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,760
What's wrong with you?

750
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,680
What can you do?

751
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,600
Yes, I was a little impulsive.

752
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,000
But I think Ding

753
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,280
is too unconscious.

754
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,920
As colleagues,

755
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,640
is about integration.

756
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,160
The buyers are new.

757
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,520
The reason I suggested a team dinner

758
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,720
is based on the tradition.

759
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,120
We were rewarded before.

760
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,880
We paid for it.

761
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,640
Those post-90s

762
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,200
are delicate egoists.

763
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,760
He said teamwork.

764
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,520
I thought

765
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,160
without a team,

766
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,560
teamwork is like being a pushover.

767
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,320
Fortunately, I've done reality shows before.

768
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,840
Otherwise, I would be scared.

769
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,920
During these years of working,

770
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,000
I hate those

771
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,880
who are qualified to talk.

772
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,960
Don't talk about the overall consciousness.

773
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,760
You just want to take advantage of others

774
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,240
to take advantage of others.

775
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,440
This kind of person... Bah!

776
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,080
Who are you talking about?

777
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:53,960
I mean bitch.

778
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,560
I...

779
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,640
All right.

780
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,320
Stop arguing.

781
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,760
Come back and sit down.

782
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,760
It's clear now.

783
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,960
It's normal for colleagues to have problems with each other.

784
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,760
But it can't affect

785
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,440
the order of the office area.

786
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,080
Especially now.

787
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,560
during the promotion period of May 1.

788
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,680
At such a critical moment,

789
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,040
both old employees and new employees

790
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,000
are our employees in May.

791
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,720
Each of you will be fined 500 yuan.

792
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,240
to the department's reward fund.

793
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,160
Director Lei, what do you think?

794
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,360
I don't think it's good.

795
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,640
Is the company a kindergarten?

796
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,280
After the kids fight,

797
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,480
they will stand for half an hour.

798
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,640
This is settled.

799
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,440
I don't know

800
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,000
in May.

801
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,000
But now,

802
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,400
as a member of Lingyun,

803
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,640
I hope every employee in the company

804
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,000
has the quality

805
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,240
with international companies.

806
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,400
Old employees use traditions as an excuse

807
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,960
to bully newbies.

808
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,160
Isn't this workplace bullying?

809
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:01,560
This kind of bad habit

810
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,480
is different from bullying the bride

811
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,560
to bully the bride?

812
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,600
Is it that serious?

813
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,760
Ding and I

814
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,880
just kidding.

815
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,640
If Ding is unhappy,

816
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,080
I can apologize to you.

817
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,480
As the leader of the business department,

818
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:20,720
I think

819
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,120
to handle this matter seriously.

820
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,840
Director Lei,

821
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,480
This is too much.

822
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,440
Actually, it's not

823
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,240
is worse than

824
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,280
to the competitor?

825
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,920
I don't understand what you're talking about.

826
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,960
Isn't the view on the rooftop nice?

827
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,200
What are you implying?

828
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,520
That's right.

829
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,440
My colleagues and I

830
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,560
like to smoke on the rooftop.

831
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,640
what does that mean?

832
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,200
Director Lei,

833
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,000
I know you wanted to kick me out long ago.

834
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,760
But you need evidence for everything.

835
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,440
Mr. Du, I have no choice

836
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,040
Director Lei's behavior.

837
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,560
Objection!

838
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,280
Leo, do you have proof?

839
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,240
No.

840
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,640
But I have something else.

841
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,880
Last Thursday, you threatened Tina

842
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,400
in the tea room last Thursday.

843
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,360
After Ding Yike came to the rescue,

844
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,640
you went to the receptionist to get angry.

845
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,280
You said you wanted to deal with Ding Yike.

846
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,480
I wonder if these can prove

847
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,800
you hold a grudge against Ding Yike.

848
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,000
That's why you purposely take revenge today.

849
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,480
No, this is occasional.

850
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,720
It's just a coincidence.

851
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,720
A coincidence?

852
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,720
You said many times

853
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,360
I was neither a man nor a woman.

854
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,520
I've been sleeping all the way here.

855
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,840
He even said he wanted to taste

856
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,880
what it feels like.

857
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,640
Are these all coincidences?

858
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,720
Mr. Du.

859
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,920
I don’t care

860
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,400
I don't care if you hold him accountable.

861
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,840
But he insulted female colleagues

862
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,360
in the company.

863
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,960
threatening, blackmailing, or even fighting.

864
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,080
If someone like him stays in May,

865
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,640
won't affect

866
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,240
the morale of the company?

867
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,560
Look.

868
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,120
Coming

869
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,640
Let's go.

870
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,360
Who's a loser this time?

871
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,960
He should have left.

872
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
Bye, Mr. Guo.

873
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,960
Take care.

874
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,640
Is this really necessary?

875
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,880
I like killing-part.

876
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,400
Guo Youming is not enough.

877
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,800
You need to transfer all the leaked people

878
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,400
to the production base.

879
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,000
They are the creators

880
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,240
of my fantasy rumors.

881
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,560
I didn't expect you to hold grudges.

882
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,960
Elephants don't need to hold grudges against ants.

883
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,920
Just step on it.

884
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,280
Who are you going to deal with next?

885
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,040
Me?

886
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,320
When we had a meeting here last time,

887
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,600
I offended you too.

888
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,800
I'm not interested.

889
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,360
I told you

890
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,120
I like cooperation and win-win.

891
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,920
I don't want to be enemies with anyone.

892
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,280
If Guo Youming is smarter,

893
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,240
he won't be arrogant

894
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,280
just because you're a senior.

895
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,960
Listen to me.

896
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,880
Why should I talk to him?

897
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,480
Or you really don't know

898
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,840
where I got

899
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,400
from?

900
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,120
Mr. Du.

901
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,360
If I want to kill you,

902
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,720
the cameras you installed

903
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,200
you can say goodbye

904
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,080
to the fashion circle.

905
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,040
What camera

906
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,000
The cameras are in public areas.

907
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,080
I didn't install it in your office.

908
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:13,080
I'm not a pervert.

909
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,080
I don't like watching those.

910
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,640
It's okay.

911
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,360
I have a good body.

912
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,640
360 degrees in all directions.

913
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,440
Don't be afraid. Take a look.

914
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,080
Sure.

915
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,480
Sure.

916
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,320
Why are you spacing out?

917
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,480
Nothing.

918
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,680
I just think...

919
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,640
Forget it. It's okay.

920
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,480
I understand.

921
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,160
It's open.

922
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,520
It's a resignation, not a resignation.

923
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,840
Leo is really cruel.

924
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,640
After May,

925
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,320
will be announced

926
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,560
in the transfer list?

927
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,520
That's impossible. Don't think too much.

928
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,200
You didn't get involved in the leak.

929
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,160
How can I not think too much?

930
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,360
Only four members

931
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
Only four people.

932
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,960
But one third of the Purchase Department

933
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,040
will be transferred.

934
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,520
Tang Li and I are getting married soon.

935
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,920
What if I’m banished

936
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,080
to the production base,

937
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,560
It's a long way to work.

938
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,760
and there's less bonus.

939
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,040
What about the mortgage?

940
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,080
Actually,

941
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,280
I don't want to be ambitious.

942
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,080
I just want to have a stable job

943
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,360
and live in my small house.

944
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,400
and get married soon.

945
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,120
and have another child.

946
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:46,840
Isn't that good?

947
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,480
Sure.

948
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,400
You're Leo's trusted general now.

949
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,680
Why don't you

950
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,040
to put in a good word for me?

951
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,640
I...

952
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,240
Am I wrong?

953
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:00,040
Look, you quarreled with Guo Youming.

954
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,560
she fired her.

955
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,000
Are you going to help or not? Tell me.

956
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,000
Of course.

957
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,280
After I finish the Golden Week promotion,

958
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,880
I'll think about how to tell her.

959
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:18,520
I knew you were the best.

960
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,320
Eat something.
