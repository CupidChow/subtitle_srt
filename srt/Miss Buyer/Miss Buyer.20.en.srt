1
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,840
Not yet.

2
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,240
Coming.

3
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:00,760
Ms. Linda SWangson.

4
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,200
I'm Coco from May.

5
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,080
This way, please.

6
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,280
Our meeting will start at 9:30.

7
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,760
Our company is...

8
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,640
Please be quiet.

9
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,120
Leo, why are you standing here?

10
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,480
To welcome you.

11
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,280
This is...

12
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,680
Du Xiuqi.

13
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,040
The general manager of May.

14
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,920
Please.

15
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,480
What's wrong?

16
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,280
Women's war.

17
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,480
Former competitors.

18
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,560
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

19
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,120
This way, please.

20
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,840
Nice bag.

21
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,200
I bought it on Huaihai Road.

22
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,400
Don't mention the bag. Let's go.

23
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,560
Sorry for being late.

24
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,280
This is my team.

25
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,400
Have a seat.

26
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,760
Let me introduce.

27
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,120
This is our great designer,

28
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,079
Patrick Cho.

29
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,079
Mr. Zhao Moyuan.

30
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,360
Nice to meet you.

31
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,399
Nice to meet you.

32
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,680
Nice to meet you.

33
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,360
This is Linda from Lingyun Headquarters.

34
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,920
Have a seat.

35
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,120
Mr. Du and I believe

36
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,240
Zhao Moyuan and May

37
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,920
will become

38
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,520
in Asia Fashion.

39
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,400
So I hope the headquarters

40
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,280
can give us

41
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,800
more resources.

42
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,920
Of course I believe it.

43
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,080
Partrick's design

44
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,200
will definitely bring a wave.

45
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,240
But the problem is

46
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,400
In this wind,

47
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,280
how will Oh-wol stand?

48
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,360
As far as I know,

49
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Parterrick is really popular

50
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,960
in Europe.

51
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,960
But his haute couture is in China.

52
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,960
never

53
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,080
ever.

54
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,800
In China,

55
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,360
in China.

56
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,120
He runs two

57
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,520
in China.

58
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,240
And he just finished

59
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,040
an international nomination award.

60
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,240
modern art exhibition.

61
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,200
Say something tacky.

62
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,680
His search index

63
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,960
has been around 5,000.

64
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,920
In other words, his popularity

65
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,560
is as famous as Tom Fort.

66
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,800
and Dio.

67
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,760
Okay.

68
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,680
How will you

69
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,360
the cost?

70
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,080
This is a heavy silk.

71
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,240
Including the fabric, processing, operation cost,

72
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,240
and

73
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,280
for working with Partrick.

74
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,960
I don't think the price will be lower than

75
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,520
250 dollars.

76
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,960
How many customers

77
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,200
are willing to offer this price?

78
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,520
Don't forget.

79
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,560
the USB and Lymère series.

80
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,800
Their price

81
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,680
is less than 150 dollars.

82
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,360
You can rest assured.

83
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,400
It's just a sample.

84
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,400
If the difference

85
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,080
are too different,

86
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,520
will the customers pay?

87
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,680
We're looking for

88
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,800
that can replace

89
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,840
to replace Ssanthemum silk.

90
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,680
We will try our best to achieve the effect of sample clothes.

91
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,200
After we improve the cost,

92
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,680
the cost will decrease a lot.

93
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,040
How much? I need specific numbers.

94
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,840
And what kind of bronze droplets

95
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,360
can replace the silk?

96
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,080
I need to see it with my own eyes.

97
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,960
It will take some time to confirm.

98
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,800
How long?

99
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,520
Two weeks.

100
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,520
Okay.

101
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,520
We'll discuss

102
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,120
the public relations budget of this project.

103
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,120
Linda, if we delay it for two weeks,

104
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,480
you'll miss the best-selling season in October.

105
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,200
That's right.

106
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,960
I know you value this project.

107
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,400
But as usual,

108
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,080
is it not specific

109
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,960
to discuss the big goods?

110
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,240
Yes.

111
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,640
Because we care more about

112
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,080
we care more about

113
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,360
Everyone has their own habits

114
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,680
has their own habits.

115
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,680
I have to see

116
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,640
a very mature project information

117
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,960
to the headquarters.

118
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
to the headquarters.

119
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:27,080
Or you can design it again.

120
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,680
Leo, you know me.

121
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,520
I never talk about building buildings

122
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,840
how to build a building.

123
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,520
I won't change the design.

124
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,080
Since Lingyun is not sincere enough,

125
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,280
I'll stop

126
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,240
I'll stop here.

127
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,520
Partrick.

128
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,640
Partrick, I think you've misunderstood.

129
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,520
We're just discussing

130
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
the internal budget of this project.

131
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,560
Leo.

132
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,240
If it weren't for you,

133
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,520
Patric wouldn't have chosen May

134
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,680
in May.

135
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,120
I remember you promised

136
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,560
that Lingyun Group

137
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,360
will give us

138
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,640
a global design.

139
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
For this case,

140
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,960
our whole team

141
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,080
came from America.

142
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,040
The sample can represent our sincerity.

143
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,080
What about you?

144
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,240
I think someone

145
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,520
is acting together.

146
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,760
They want to lower

147
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,800
our cooperation price.

148
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,240
I've never seen it anyway.

149
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,120
a group leader

150
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,680
will put

151
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,080
of a single design.

152
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,200
You are so hesitant.

153
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,800
Watch your tone.

154
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,600
We received

155
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
We received it in advance.

156
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,240
Come on, bring it here.

157
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,120
What's your name?

158
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Ke Ke, Ding Yike.

159
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,680
One of the best buyers in May.

160
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,360
The best buyer.

161
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,800
Even silk and synthesis fiber

162
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
between silk and synthesis fiber.

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,360
Leo, you really surprised me.

164
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,880
The shop sent the wrong sample.

165
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,120
Wrong again.

166
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,480
Why are they always making mistakes?

167
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,920
Yes, order again.

168
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,440
Go!

169
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,240
Leo, this is your best subordinate.

170
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,040
It's my fault.

171
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,880
This supplier is an old client of May.

172
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,360
He always sends the wrong stuff.

173
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,480
So after Leo came,

174
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,600
after Leo came.

175
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,680
to buy hands

176
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,600
to correct our mistakes.

177
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,440
Chinese have never

178
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,720
about fashion.

179
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,120
I don't understand.

180
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,560
But today,

181
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,920
I do have to

182
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,600
on May.

183
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,920
Are you done?

184
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,920
Here, there, there.

185
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,240
Our patience is limited.

186
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,040
Mr. Du, if you don’t have enough money,

187
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,800
I understand.

188
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,120
Luna,

189
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,320
Just say that one of Lingyun's superiors

190
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,480
because of one of Lingyun's superiors.

191
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,880
Zhao Moyuan and May series

192
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,680
Temporarily terminated.

193
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,240
Designers have their own dignity.

194
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,600
Patrick.

195
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,120
Are you sure you want to go against Lingyun Group?

196
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,800
I forgot to introduce.

197
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,160
I'm the president of

198
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,560
of International Designer Association.

199
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,160
You just said

200
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,040
Chinese are not professional.

201
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,560
including all your threats to me.

202
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,680
I believe everyone here

203
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,800
can be my witness.

204
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,880
I believe Lingyun's opponents

205
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,440
want to hear this news.

206
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,600
You should know.

207
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,000
Dio was fired

208
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,360
for this reason.

209
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,480
John Carriano.

210
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,480
Miss Swanson.

211
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,440
I sincerely hope

212
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,480
you are luckier than him.

213
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,440
Patrick, wait!

214
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,040
I apologize for

215
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,800
I apologize.

216
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,320
Hello?

217
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Hello.

218
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,120
I'm looking for Mr. Yu.

219
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,040
Mr. Yu

220
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,480
He resigned

221
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,680
He already resigned.

222
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,160
Xiaojie

223
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,480
I may be cheated.

224
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,600
No.

225
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,360
Maybe he's on the plane now.

226
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,800
No.

227
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,480
Let me help you.

228
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,320
Thank you.

229
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,880
You're welcome.

230
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,320
What a coincidence. We meet again.

231
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,880
I've been

232
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,800
for the past few months.

233
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,160
I can give you the phone number.

234
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,440
Just contact him.

235
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,920
Ms Ding, here's the thing.

236
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,800
We know very well

237
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,240
in the industry.

238
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,240
I

239
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,800
sincerely hope

240
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,240
cooperate with May.

241
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,240
As for the price,

242
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,360
about the price.

243
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,240
Let me tell you the truth.

244
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,480
25.

245
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,800
Twenty-five. Don't lower it.

246
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,480
I should have found the problem earlier.

247
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,360
What a coincidence.

248
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,560
It doesn't matter if I can stay in the project team.

249
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,120
But Linda

250
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,920
is obviously picking a fight.

251
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,480
If this

252
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,920
affect the progress of the whole team,

253
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,040
Then I'll...

254
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,120
I'm so stupid.

255
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,160
Dear friends,

256
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,160
I have good news for you.

257
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,120
Done.

258
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,680
Linda finally let go.

259
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,320
She agreed to allocate public relations budget.

260
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,920
Really?

261
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,120
Really?

262
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,680
Yes.

263
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,560
I have to go back to the headquarters

264
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,480
to the headquarters,

265
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,680
But they are talking about

266
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,480
the cooperation details of the group.

267
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,800
Coco, your boyfriend is so handsome.

268
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Thanks to him,

269
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,480
he cruelly defeated Linda.

270
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,920
Give this kiss to him later.

271
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,480
Bye.

272
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,920
You don't have to worry now.

273
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,240
It's sunny and the clouds are gone.

274
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,800
I'll go check it out.

275
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,680
Zhao Moyuan and May

276
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,680
can catch customers as soon as possible

277
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,800
and show them

278
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,560
we are a professional team.

279
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,560
and we have a solid effect.

280
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,440
Partrick.

281
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,920
The impression you gave me today

282
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,040
very impressive.

283
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,680
I hope

284
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,040
in the future.

285
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,360
Of course, we will.

286
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,240
If one day

287
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,560
you can wear my design

288
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,480
to appear in the Asian Forum in Hainan.

289
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,040
I feel very honored.

290
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,160
Are you trying to tell me

291
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,880
you are familiar with the forum?

292
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,360
A designer like me

293
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,040
like me

294
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,480
are not qualified

295
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,120
to go to such political and commercial forum.

296
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,800
But if I work hard,

297
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,920
to get an invitation

298
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,480
for a beauty like you,

299
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,680
I don't think it's a big problem.

300
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,480
You're amazing, Partrick.

301
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,360
Bye.

302
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,440
Thank you. Bye.

303
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,360
Let's go.

304
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,880
Great.

305
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,040
Linda,

306
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,360
Are you going to take a rest

307
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,680
or do you want to

308
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,880
to visit

309
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,720
in May?

310
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,120
The following schedule will be postponed.

311
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,440
I need to talk to you about

312
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,120
about Zhao Moyuan

313
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,000
and May.

314
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,720
Objection!

315
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,120
Leo, I hope you understand.

316
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,480
I didn't mean to hurt anyone.

317
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,680
But what happened just now

318
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,800
made me really worried

319
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
about your leadership.

320
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,240
And your buyer team

321
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,000
is obviously not mature enough.

322
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,560
That's why I want to transfer my assistant

323
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,000
to help you.

324
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,560
After all, the group

325
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,800
on this project.

326
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
The cake is not in the oven yet.

327
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,680
before the cake is in the oven?

328
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,360
Linda,

329
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
You have a bigger appetite than before.

330
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,240
A Asian Forum invitation

331
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,680
Can't I feed you enough?

332
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,000
Honey, don't forget

333
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,560
you were exiled

334
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,680
to May.

335
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,720
Your exemption will be decided by the headquarters.

336
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,880
Linda, let me remind you.

337
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,560
Leo is in charge of this project.

338
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,800
Without her,

339
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Parterrick won't agree

340
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,880
to cooperate with us.

341
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,720
If you have to transfer her away,

342
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,160
Fine.

343
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,480
I can ask her to resign immediately.

344
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,920
May will give her a higher position.

345
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,600
According to the board of directors,

346
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,720
there are local employees in May

347
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,240
of local employees in May.

348
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,920
Have you both forgotten

349
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,600
the rules of competition?

350
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,320
Don't get me wrong.

351
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,000
I have no intention of

352
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,440
to kick Leo out of this project.

353
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,480
No, never.

354
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,360
But the cake is too big.

355
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,920
I need an extra chef

356
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,240
to help you.

357
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,359
to help you.

358
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,599
No way.

359
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,440
I respect you as my boss.

360
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,680
but it doesn't mean I'll accept it.

361
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,079
Don’t think Zhao Moyuan

362
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,319
value this project,

363
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,200
it means

364
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,319
the collaboration with Oh-wol.

365
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
I can also call

366
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,079
to terminate this cooperation.

367
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,079
Sure.

368
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,319
But I think I've read

369
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,680
the contract you signed.

370
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,720
Maybe you didn't see it clearly.

371
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,200
Zhao Moyuan only has one million yuan.

372
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:31,960
RMB.

373
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Leo!

374
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,480
I'm the only one in charge of the castle I've conquered.

375
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,840
If anyone else dares to dye it,

376
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,960
I'd rather destroy it.

377
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,800
Good. Very good.

378
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,960
I've finally seen

379
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,600
who fought with me again.

380
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,440
Okay.

381
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,960
I withdraw the agreement

382
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,680
I withdraw.

383
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:13,960
However,

384
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,480
as the CEO of the group,

385
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,680
about the problems

386
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,480
and your team,

387
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,960
I have to hold you accountable.

388
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
What else do you want?

389
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,440
I'll submit it to the headquarters.

390
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
to demote your marketing director

391
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,200
Manager.

392
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,720
Calm down.

393
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
You can still

394
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,240
in charge of this project.

395
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,200
Ms. SWangsen.

396
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,560
Mr. Du,

397
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,200
We are just a salesman

398
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,800
sent the wrong fabric.

399
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,080
You didn't have to go this far.

400
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,840
The supplier can deliver the wrong fabric,

401
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
But buyers can't even

402
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,800
and synthesis fiber.

403
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,720
why Lingyun became

404
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,320
a global fashion group?

405
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,200
Because we are strict enough

406
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,440
and professional.

407
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,320
After all,

408
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,440
MLH.

409
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,440
They only use our handbags.

410
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,080
with no scratch on our bags.

411
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,840
How can I stand it?

412
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,800
a team who made a stupid mistake

413
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,320
won't accept any punishment.

414
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,240
Linda. Linda.

415
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,320
I'm at a vacation house

416
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,440
in Maribou Beach.

417
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,360
It's useless to keep it empty.

418
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,080
Can we make an exception?

419
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,600
Okay.

420
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,440
Two options.

421
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,320
Leo, you either demote

422
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,480
or let your team replace you.

423
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,560
That cocoa just now...

424
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,840
let her go.

425
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,720
Leave May.

426
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,720
But maybe you don't want to leave.

427
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,720
After all, when I was in Hong Kong,

428
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,320
when I was in Hong Kong.

429
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,200
I heard she's yours.

430
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,440
But how do you feel

431
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,360
your personal feelings

432
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,320
I'm not interested.

433
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,480
I just think

434
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,840
her working style

435
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,440
doesn't match Lingyun's culture at all.

436
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,120
Linda,

437
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,320
I accept demotion.

438
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,240
No.

439
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,440
Mr. Du.

440
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,720
About the fabric,

441
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,240
was my own mistake.

442
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,200
It has nothing to do

443
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,240
with anyone in the company.

444
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,440
For this,

445
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,560
I'm willing to resign.

446
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
Where is Ding Yike?

447
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,960
She's packing and preparing for the handover.

448
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,840
We owe her a big favor.

449
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,080
Why don't you let me tell Linda

450
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,720
Zhao Moyuan and Ding Yike?

451
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,200
Don't let that woman

452
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,600
hate Zhao Mo anymore.

453
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,440
After all,

454
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,840
purely picky

455
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,480
into a competition for project interests.

456
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,600
The more details she knows,

457
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,840
the more passive we are.

458
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,480
Let her go.

459
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,040
Only then can we get the sovereignty back.

460
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,440
When you were in Lingyun,

461
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,120
in Lingyun

462
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,560
like this every day?

463
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
That's why I said

464
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,800
your tricks are nothing.

465
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,080
I should work harder from now on.

466
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,040
I can't let you live like this anymore.

467
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,960
You've done enough.

468
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,960
Not enough.

469
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,200
What are you doing?

470
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,560
I'm not terminally ill.

471
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,600
Don't flatter yourself.

472
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,840
I'm happy.

473
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,920
Finally, another competitor is eliminated.

474
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,240
From now on, Zhao Moyuan and May

475
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,040
will be mine.

476
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,840
Don't take it from me.

477
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,960
We envy you for getting out of the suffering

478
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,720
and live

479
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,120
a good life

480
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,080
a good life.

481
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,080
That's right.

482
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,920
Your boyfriend is much better than mine.

483
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,120
What?

484
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,240
Look at this bag.

485
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,120
It's all standard now.

486
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,200
Kota matching

487
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,600
Yeah.

488
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,600
By the way, I have a friend

489
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
who helps Chanel

490
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,800
for Chanel.

491
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,960
I'll get you more later.

492
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,080
Me too. Why don't you give them to me?

493
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,800
Here you are.

494
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,200
All of them

495
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,200
Thank you for everything.

496
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,840
I've learned a lot

497
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,200
I learned a lot.

498
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,240
Thank you.

499
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
Alright, see you again.

500
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,600
Let's go.

501
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,800
It's so heavy. Don't take it.

502
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,560
I'll send it to you later.

503
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,080
Yes.

504
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,240
Send me your resume.

505
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,600
Send me your resume.

506
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,240
I'll recommend it to

507
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,920
to the hunter I know.

508
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,840
If there are tickets to the sale,

509
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,200
I'll keep it for you.

510
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:32,960
Thank you.

511
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,720
If there's a show,

512
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,480
I'll definitely invite you.

513
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,720
Thank you.

514
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
Are you ready?

515
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Let me give you a ride.

516
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,720
Hello.

517
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
I'm here to report

518
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,360
Hello, Director Lei. Hello, Director Lei.

519
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,840
Print ten copies

520
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,040
to the Purchase Department.

521
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,200
Tell them to have a meeting at 10.

522
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,080
Okay.

523
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,680
Morning, Director Lei.

524
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,720
I've only been here for seven days. You're three times late.

525
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,320
Send his attendance report to HR.

526
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,080
and resign.

527
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:27,840
Okay.

528
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,320
Director Lei. Director Lei.

529
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,600
You have a good taste.

530
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,840
You think the company is a club?

531
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,840
I think you haven't learned your lesson.

532
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,360
You made such a mess

533
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,360
last time.

534
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,600
You didn't learn this time.

535
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,200
I thought I made

536
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,320
a professional plan.

537
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,440
You didn't ask me to interrogate you.

538
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,480
You just want the seller to listen?

539
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
Who do you think you are?

540
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,960
I thought this mission

541
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,720
is an assessment for us.

542
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,440
There's no saying no in the rules.

543
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,600
you can do it.

544
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,320
Did I tell you not to ask for help?

545
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,800
It's not the time to be nostalgic.

546
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,440
You'll come back.

547
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,320
You made a big mess today,

548
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,680
the company decided to suspend you for three months.

549
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,320
But don't expect

550
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,360
to send you the termination notice.

551
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,120
Three months later,

552
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,480
after three months.

553
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,320
But Linda,

554
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,320
Lingyun is just a major shareholder in May,

555
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,440
not the master of May.

556
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,040
It doesn't mean you won't attack for now.

557
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,960
You are my buyer.

558
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,840
I know you well.

559
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,960
and the sacrifice you made for me.

560
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,840
So how could I give up on you?

561
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,600
Do you think I can still be a buyer?

562
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,680
I can't even distinguish silk from bronze ammonia.

563
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,320
Talent and experience are different.

564
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,200
I was 18 when I joined Saint Martin.

565
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,720
How long have you been in May?

566
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,080
If you don't make mistakes,

567
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,720
how can you gain experience?

568
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,200
Boss.

569
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,680
Why are you so nice now?

570
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,560
I'm about to fall in love with you.

571
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,440
You can't do that.

572
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,960
Even if I lose Zhao Mo,

573
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,320
I'm afraid you can't beat

574
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,920
a domineering president.

575
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,320
Three months later,

576
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,560
remember to give her back to me.

577
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,840
Yes, sir.

578
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,440
Who told you to resign?

579
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,320
Why didn't you tell me?

580
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,360
Why are you showing off?

581
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,960
I'm afraid you'll fall out with the group

582
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,320
because of this.

583
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,320
After all, this project

584
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,560
is very important

585
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,040
to you and Leo.

586
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,840
If someone must be sacrificed,

587
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,200
Of course choosing a nobody like me

588
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,080
is the most cost-effective plan.

589
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,200
Besides, I did make a mistake.

590
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
I should take responsibility.

591
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,840
You fool.

592
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,080
This has nothing to do with you.

593
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,360
Tina gave me

594
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,480
to me.

595
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,240
I checked

596
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,080
Shen Jin's new assistant

597
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,320
These days

598
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,480
I've been fighting against Shen Jinming.

599
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,440
I didn't expect

600
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,600
I didn't expect him to attack you.

601
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,920
How despicable.

602
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:23,960
But he used real fabrics for fake fabrics.

603
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,720
for fake fabrics?

604
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,600
He doesn't have sharp eyes.

605
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
How did he know?

606
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,360
I happen to take out the fabric

607
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,080
in front of Linda today.

608
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,040
He doesn't know Linda.

609
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,040
He doesn't know we're having a meeting today.

610
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,240
But he knows you are my weakness.

611
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,600
Think about it.

612
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,440
If you think

613
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,600
as real,

614
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,720
you will lose a lot of money in May.

615
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,440
And you can't stay in May anymore.

616
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,840
If you can't stay in May,

617
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,200
he knows that with my personality,

618
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,840
I'll turn around and leave.

619
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,440
Zhao Moyuan and May series will...

620
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,320
No wonder Kong

621
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,120
insisted on providing goods in Hong Kong.

622
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,080
to avoid legal responsibility.

623
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
I'm sorry.

624
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,560
No.

625
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,840
I'm not as good as others

626
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:17,960
That's why I was cheated.

627
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,320
Let's go.

628
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:26,800
Let's go.

629
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Starting tomorrow,

630
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,840
work for me from tomorrow on.

631
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,040
It's not good.

632
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,080
Boss has so many enemies in the company.

633
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,680
What if Linda finds out?

634
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,120
what do you want?

635
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,800
Do you want rice?

636
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,080
Let me tell you.

637
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,480
I won't let you live for nothing.

638
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,680
You've been exposed so quickly.

639
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,120
the true nature of a scumbag.

640
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,720
That's not true.

641
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,720
I want you to become

642
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,480
as soon as possible.

643
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,840
and worked day and night for me.

644
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,560
Pervert.

645
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,600
What are you thinking?

646
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,440
I want you to work for me every day.

647
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,040
You want to take advantage of me again.

648
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,600
Cut it out.

649
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,360
Shameless!

650
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,080
I know what you're thinking.

651
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,200
You take advantage of me every day.

652
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,240
How could you do that?

653
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,360
No.

654
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,360
Look at you.

655
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,680
I know what you're thinking.

656
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,120
Don't talk about me again.

657
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,120
What's wrong?

658
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,680
I feel safe.

659
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,920
This time, my weakness

660
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,320
I finally have an armor.

661
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,680
I want to kiss you. What should I do?

662
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,720
Hold it.

663
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,680
All financial reports

664
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,480
are on this computer.

665
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,680
You can read it anytime.

666
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,920
And our finance is a foreign recruit.

667
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,560
He'll come to pay every Wednesday.

668
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,120
You must have seen him.

669
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,200
There's a credit card here.

670
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,440
Just use it if you need anything.

671
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,680
So soon?

672
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,680
I've been busy with a new project.

673
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,320
I haven't been thinking about the distance for a long time.

674
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,960
Where's Feifei? He can work.

675
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,960
But you asked him to buy goods and inventory.

676
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,040
and inventory.

677
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,680
We really need

678
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,200
a professional buyer to take over.

679
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,120
So Ms Ding

680
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,600
is far from my painstaking effort.

681
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,920
I'll leave it to you from now on.

682
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
Please.

683
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,920
Thank you for your trust.

684
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,560
Come on.

685
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,320
If you leave the distance to me,

686
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,720
what about Feifei?

687
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,480
Keep working here.

688
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,920
He's been here for a few days.

689
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,360
and made my place a mess.

690
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,960
It's not good.

691
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,960
He's finally on his own.

692
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,440
Suddenly a girlfriend

693
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,920
to take over everything.

694
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,120
I wouldn't be happy if it were me.

695
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,320
No, he's still a kid.

696
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,440
He can be lazy for a while.

697
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,560
He just takes a break.

698
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,440
He must be hiding in a corner

699
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,720
he must be hiding in a corner

700
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,120
and watch the Japanese comic with his phone.

701
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,080
But I think

702
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,080
he read design magazines

703
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,720
and develop product planning.

704
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,360
In the past,

705
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,440
I had many questions

706
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,840
I always ask him for advice.

707
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,320
I can't promote him to manager

708
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,840
and make you a store employee.

709
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,600
I'm thinking

710
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,840
if there is any way

711
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,360
to make it up to him?

712
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,680
How about this?

713
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,080
to take part in

714
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,320
on behalf of me.

715
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,080
I talked to him.

716
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,960
He also graduated from

717
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,480
of Donghua University.

718
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,080
Since he's willing to save money,

719
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,360
he went to America to watch Fashion Week.

720
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,200
That means

721
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,560
he won't be willing to be a clerk forever.

722
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,080
Moyuan.

723
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,960
Although he looks happy,

724
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,480
we can't ignore his needs.

725
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,040
Am I right?

726
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,080
That makes sense.

727
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,600
Okay, I promise you I'll think about it.

728
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,920
And in a short time,

729
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,480
I guess

730
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,840
you can't take over Yuan completely.

731
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,480
Right?

732
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,720
Coco.

733
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,680
I love you so much.

734
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,040
What?

735
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,080
Let go of my girlfriend.

736
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,240
Let her go!

737
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:04,960
No!

738
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,600
I'll hit you if you don't let her go.

739
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,440
Let go!

740
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,320
No.

741
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,360
Let go of me!

742
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,840
Let go of my girlfriend!

743
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,800
I'll let you join the project team.

744
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,600
OK?

745
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,720
Coco.

746
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,440
You're so realistic.

747
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,200
Coco.

748
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,800
Why are you so kind?

749
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,960
Cocoa-san.

750
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,560
Why do I like you so much?

751
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,320
What are you doing?

752
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,240
Hurry up

753
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,480
Sit here.

754
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:28,960
This

755
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,680
is the number of our VIP.

756
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,360
and email.

757
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,600
You have to send them

758
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,680
you have to send it to them.

759
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,080
This is our supplier.

760
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,600
and their contact information.

761
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,560
And this.

762
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,600
This is the financial report.

763
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:39,800
All right.

764
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,440
You don't have to give me everything now.

765
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,720
Didn't we agree that

766
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,800
you'll continue to come here half a month ago.

767
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,200
and go to the studio in the afternoon.

768
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,200
I'll miss you.

769
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,000


770
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:55,760
How about this?

771
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,520
Your prince charming is watching.

772
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,000
I can't express

773
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,200
my love for you.

774
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,280
You treat me better than my sister.

775
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,000
She only scolds me and scolds me every day.

776
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,800
She doesn't do anything or do anything.

777
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,880
How can I stay in this house?

778
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,160
All right.

779
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,560
By the way,

780
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:09,960
you can

781
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,280
you can still stay here.

782
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,200
No need to move home.

783
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,920
No.

784
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,280
If I don't move back,

785
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,680
my prince charming won't be able to move in.

786
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,560
If he doesn't move in,

787
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,160
you can't be lovey-dovey.

788
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,200
I have to

789
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,920
for

790
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,280
Be responsible.

791
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,600
Get lost. What nonsense are you talking about?

792
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,480
Really?

793
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:02,720
Say it again.

794
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,320
Di.

795
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,440
Why don't you understand?

796
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,320
Ding Yike.

797
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,400
has been fired from May,

798
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,480
right?

799
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,360
As long as Zhao Moyuan hears her scram,

800
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,360
he will definitely

801
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,400
to fight with the higher-ups.

802
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,880
We just

803
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,880
just watch them fight,

804
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,960
let's watch them from the shore.

805
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,080
Finally, the fisherman wins.

806
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,480
No way. They've announced it.

807
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:26,960
Bad luck.

808
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,159
Can you drive?

809
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,360
No, Di.

810
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,360
This can't be.

811
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,040
What should I do?

812
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,239
Now you ask me what to do.

813
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,440
Where did you go before?

814
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,199
Every time you made fake fabrics,

815
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,800
to fool me and Mr Shen.

816
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,080
If Mr Shen finds out

817
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,239
if Mr Shen finds out,

818
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,719
not only will you leave,

819
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,120
I will be implicated.

820
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,199
Di, save me.

821
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:52,880
This time, Mr Shen...

822
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,960
Don't let him know, okay?

823
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,600
Don't touch me. Drive.

824
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,440
Let's go out after the work is done.

825
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,320
Where are we going?

826
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,640
Let's go out for a drink to relax.

827
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,920
It's a good weekend

828
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,120
this beautiful weekend.

829
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,640
I don't have time.

830
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,680
You don't have time?

831
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,920
How can you be busier than me these days?

832
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,800
Why?

833
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,960
It's for your distance.

834
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,440
You're an artist.

835
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,640
You don't care about profit at all.

836
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,160
Seeing your report,

837
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,400
I was so scared.

838
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,160
I was thinking

839
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,720
how to increase your profit rate.

840
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,480
I have to explain it to you.

841
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,400
Art and market

842
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,720
between art and market.

843
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,120
Do you understand?

844
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,080
If I wanted to make money,

845
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,320
I wouldn't drive this far.

846
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,720
This distance is just to satisfy

847
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,920
my artistic pursuit.

848
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,160
I'm not stupid.

849
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,840
I know.

850
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,880
I was thinking

851
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,080
I can make it less.

852
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,040
You are so aloof.

853
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,400
I really don’t understand

854
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,560
how the U.S. High Couture team makes money.

855
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,920
Make money.

856
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,400
You're talking about making money now.

857
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,640
I think you're becoming more and more like

858
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,440
a little capitalist.

859
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,120
You know what?

860
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,440
What?

861
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,160
Let me explain

862
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,880
My cooperation with Shen Jin

863
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,120
has a clear division of work

864
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,840
I'm only responsible for art creation.

865
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,400
Because I don't know how to operate capital.

866
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,240
Shen Jin

867
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,600
is in charge of the capital operation.

868
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,880
Guru Zhao

869
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,160
There's something you don't know.

870
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:29,920
What?

871
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,080
There are many things I don't understand.

872
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,440
You'll know in the future.

873
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,160
There are many things I don't understand.

874
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,360
Look.

875
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,600
Did you write this?

876
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,240
Yes.

877
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,920
Cut the crap. It's not the first time.

878
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,600
Listen.

879
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,160
I'll ask you to get lost if you don't do well.

880
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,160
Mr. Chen, it's them.

881
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,080
Did I ask you to tell me? Why are you still doing this?

882
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,480
I said no!

883
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,960
No, no, like this.

884
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,880
That Lin Sixian.

885
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,160
He misjudged the copy twice.

886
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,440
He's not that good.

887
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,920
I heard that he's Mr Xu's relative.

888
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
Look at him.

889
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,400
He's a royal relative.

890
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,160
One more time. He'll be fired sooner or later.

891
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,960
Let's go.

892
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,600
Hello?

893
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,800
Sorry, the subscriber you dialed

894
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,320
[is unavailable.]

895
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,080
Hello, this is Oh-wol.

896
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:19,960
Hello.

897
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,640
Please help me pick up Ding Yike.

898
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,480
I'm sorry.

899
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,440
Ding Yike has left the company

900
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,720
since last week.

901
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,200
Sure.

902
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,120
[The number you've dialled is unavailable.]

903
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,640
Please try again later.

904
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,040
Sure.

905
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,160
Why are you here again?

906
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,840
No.

907
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,160
I just found out about your resignation.

908
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,240
So I came to see you.

909
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,920
Why are your dark circles so heavy?

910
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,200
Did you not sleep well?

911
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,440
I'm fine.

912
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,040
You can. Actually,

913
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,800
understand how you feel right now.

914
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,200
Don't push yourself too hard.

915
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,440
I'm really fine.

916
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,040
Listen to me.

917
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,400
I really...

918
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,480
Lin Sixian.

919
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,640
No, Wenwen.

920
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,920
Go after her!

921
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,400
Sister!

922
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,720
Why didn't you wait for me?

923
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,840
Sister.

924
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,560
Hello?

925
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,960
She's your sister.

926
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,120
Yes, she's here to help me move.

927
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,400
Your last name is Jiang,

928
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,400
and the other is surnamed Xu?

929
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,120
My mother's surname is Xu.

930
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,040
How do you know my sister?

931
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,320
Wenwen.

932
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,840
Wenwen, you...

933
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,800
Don't do this.

934
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:38,800
Go away.

935
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,640
Let me do it.

936
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:44,920
Wenwen.

937
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,440
Wenwen, don't get me wrong.

938
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,240
Actually just now...

939
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,120
Wenwen, let me explain.

940
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,160
Wenwen.

941
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:17,920
Wenwen.

942
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,480
Let me explain.

943
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,960
It's only three times.

944
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,360
Lin Sixian,

945
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,360
I've given you a chance.

946
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,600
Wenwen, don't get me wrong.

947
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,400
I heard Ding Yike resigned.

948
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,880
I was a little worried.

949
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,560
I'm not.

950
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,840
It's time to open the market.

951
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,640
What kind of worry

952
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,880
to come here?

953
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,160
If you don't want me to get into an accident,

954
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,360
don't chase my car anymore.

955
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,880
I don't want to see you these days.

956
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,400
Wenwen. Wenwen.
