1
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,280
Hello?

2
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,520
Okay.

3
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,480
Please send me

4
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,160
to me.

5
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,880
Okay, thank you.

6
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,840
The bag ratio

7
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,680
27 percent.

8
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,880
The buyer is

9
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,680
without personal feelings.

10
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,000
There are three key points to making decisions.

11
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,000
Data, data or data?

12
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,520
We have to do everything we can

13
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,400
to make customers buy more products.

14
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,600
Because this is the only standard

15
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,880
whether you are qualified or not.

16
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,640
Sir, let me pay with WeChat.

17
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,000
Okay.

18
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,160
What? Out of stock?

19
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,320
I don't care

20
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,520
I don't care.

21
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,760
Anyway, you have to make sure

22
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,560
there will be

23
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,640
on social media.

24
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,000
For this promotion,

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,720
to adjust the sales strategy at any time.

26
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,120
Because you're not an immortal.

27
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,560
Unpredictable

28
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,680
Every day is like

29
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,079
dancing on the red iron wire.

30
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,200
Every number

31
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,160
will remind you

32
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,360
to be frightened.

33
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,320
Sorry.

34
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,320
You can't put this here.

35
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,520
Why can their promotional materials

36
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,120
can be put here?

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,160
Not in May.

38
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,040
But if you're good enough,

39
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,640
the empty shelf

40
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,240
will bring you endless happiness.

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,720
Because at that moment,

42
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,680
You know you can create trend

43
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,160
You can predict people's hearts

44
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,520
How much?

45
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,880
253 million.

46
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,960
We can open the champagne.

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,360
Cheers

48
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,800
Cheers. Cheers.

49
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,120
Let's take a photo.

50
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,880
Okay.

51
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:54,960
Come on.

52
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,720
Okay.

53
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,320
Okay.

54
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:04,960
Come here.

55
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,800
Director Lei.

56
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,920
Are you happy?

57
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,200
Yes.

58
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,640
Enjoy tonight.

59
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,720
Because tomorrow,

60
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,520
Success is the past tense.

61
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,600
The two who didn't come have been eliminated.

62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,880
And you guys...

63
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,440
I'll stay and observe.

64
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,800
After all, I told you

65
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,040
I will only leave six people behind.

66
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,120
Boss.

67
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,440
Can I ask you a question?

68
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,640
Go ahead.

69
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,400
After May, the adjustment of the Purchase Department

70
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,840
Can Jiang Jie stay?

71
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,840
Don't ask me.

72
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,600
Ask her KPI.

73
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,760
Did you set

74
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,960
the KPI.

75
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,600
Jiang Jie is competent

76
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,760
and experienced.

77
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,960
Although sometimes she doesn't like to work overtime,

78
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,240
she has never had any problem

79
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,920
has never gone wrong.

80
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,000
If

81
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,320
the same situation,

82
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,320
can you

83
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,240
think about keeping her?

84
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,400
Why?

85
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,960
Because you are good friends.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,280
or because you made a small contribution

87
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
for May.

88
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,159
You used me.

89
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
Is that a good reason?

90
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,040
Among the seniors

91
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,280
among the elderly who refused you,

92
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,840
Guo Youming is a leader.

93
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,040
But you can't touch him easily.

94
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,480
Because he was Mr. Du's secretary.

95
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,640
So,

96
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,600
you could only pursue the minor mistake and suppress him

97
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,840
and set up an ambush.

98
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,120
and wait for him to make a big mistake.

99
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,840
And the bait is

100
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,760
the fake 51 promotion plan.

101
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,040
I've checked.

102
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,480
The level of confidentiality of this plan

103
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,040
is only set to level 3A.

104
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,960
In other words, other than buyers,

105
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
other departments

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,720
can be seen in T5.

107
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,760
After Guo Youming was demoted,

108
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,160
it happened to be T5.

109
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,720
I don't believe it's just a coincidence.

110
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,080
Guo Youming wanted to kick you away.

111
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:34,240
So he will definitely accept the bait.

112
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,040
As you expected,

113
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,000
he chose to leak it to Pretty Lady.

114
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,280
And he's a little smarter

115
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,800
than you expected.

116
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,400
He didn't get involved

117
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,840
and left no evidence.

118
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,159
You can't chase Guo Youming away like this.

119
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,880
So, you thought of me again.

120
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,520
Impulsive, loyal, and love to fight injustice.

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,560
When he had a conflict with Tina,

122
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,640
you know I'll do something.

123
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,440
And Guo Youming is petty.

124
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,360
He will definitely take revenge.

125
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,920
Ding Yike.

126
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,880
You tricked me.

127
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,000
When you figure it out,

128
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,520
in front of everyone,

129
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,080
in front of everyone.

130
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,400
to me.

131
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,360
When can I

132
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,280
call Jiang Zhijie?

133
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,360
As long as I'm not the last two,

134
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,040
I can stay here.

135
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,440
I'm an eyesore.

136
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,240
When the gas in the air is strong enough,

137
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,680
a little spark can cause an explosion.

138
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,000
Who are you calling a dog?

139
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,720
I'm talking about you.

140
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,440
Make it clear.

141
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,240
What's wrong with you?

142
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,160
What can you do?

143
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,960
Next,

144
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,480
One is Guo Youming's workplace bullying.

145
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,560
You committed three crimes of blackmailing and leaking.

146
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,360
On the other hand, you managed to

147
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,520
in the promotion battle.

148
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,200
So,

149
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,840
you became a worthy winner.

150
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,320
And he's the loser that everyone calls.

151
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,640
And me?

152
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,440
I just

153
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,520
all along.

154
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,880
It's just a knife.

155
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,640
That's all.

156
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,240
Yes.

157
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,720
I told you.

158
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,159
I only care about the result, not the process.

159
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,720
You spent almost two minutes

160
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,000
in almost two minutes.

161
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,280
to tell me this?

162
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,120
To clear Guo Youming's name.

163
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,080
and accuse me of being vicious.

164
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,320
Or do you want to show your intelligence

165
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,040
you can see the plot that others can't.

166
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,920
But after your love,

167
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,480
you're looking forward to my reaction.

168
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,760
Scared, regretful,

169
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
or your conscience after being exposed,

170
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,960
I had to agree.

171
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,000
your request.

172
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,440
Did I force Guo Youming to leak the secret?

173
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,120
Did I provoke your argument?

174
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,520
For someone who insulted me,

175
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,240
while he was sick.

176
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,960
What's wrong with what I did?

177
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,559
You think you are a knife.

178
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,640
feel wronged.

179
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,080
You should be glad

180
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
that

181
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,120
at least a little bit

182
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,240
to be used by me.

183
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,560
To stay,

184
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,920
to keep an eye on Guo Youming.

185
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,320
In order to stay,

186
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,000
in the advertising company

187
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,440
in the advertising company.

188
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,480
You can think of it.

189
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,800
what you can think of?

190
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,760
At least they know

191
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,000
what to say and shouldn't say.

192
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,440
You think you're special.

193
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,240
Let me tell you.

194
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,760
The elimination list hasn't been announced yet.

195
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,840
I don't mind

196
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,600
replace another person with you.

197
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,040
You won't.

198
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,280
Where did you get the confidence?

199
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,200
The strong doesn't need to threaten the weak.

200
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,080
Just do it.

201
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,080
You said so much just now.

202
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,800
just

203
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,520
to warn me.

204
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,680
You're quite smart.

205
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,880
What are you doing?

206
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,200
Talk about girls making foundation.

207
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,040
What? Are you interested, Mr. Du?

208
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,600
Can I have a word with you?

209
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,000
I see.

210
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,440
She's like this.

211
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,120
What would you do if it were you?

212
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:21,720
What?

213
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,760
Aren't you going to have a drink with me?

214
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,440
Cheers.

215
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,680
Cheers.

216
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,560
I have to apologize.

217
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,360
About what?

218
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,080
Everything.

219
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,480
I used to be against you

220
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,640
against you.

221
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,520
Now that I think about it, I'm childish.

222
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,600
To be honest, Leo.

223
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,120
In any aspect,

224
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,960
you are an excellent

225
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,160
professional manager.

226
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,960
Money is really everything.

227
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,040
Just because I helped May

228
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,080
for May.

229
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,680
In your eyes,

230
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,360
in Mr. Du's eyes.

231
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,680
You've always been a beauty in my eyes.

232
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:09,840
Can we

233
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,720
when we talk?

234
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,880
To be honest,

235
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,880
apart from a win-win colleague,

236
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,520
I think we can still be friends.

237
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,000
I dare not.

238
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,240
I'm not kidding.

239
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,560
I'm very glad

240
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,400
Lingyun sent you instead of someone else.

241
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,760
If you hadn't

242
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,800
cleared a time bomb

243
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,320
for May.

244
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,600
I really don't know what to do.

245
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,080
You're welcome.

246
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,040
I'm just doing my best

247
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,640
in my position.

248
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,840
I know there are

249
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,000
between us.

250
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,520
But it's okay.

251
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,880
We can take our time.

252
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,200
As long as you're devoted to May,

253
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,280
I can support you for everything.

254
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,480
Really?

255
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,440
Let me tell you a secret.

256
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,840
Actually, I'm afraid of heights.

257
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,880
You're back.

258
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,440
Yes, I'm back.

259
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,720
Did the sales go well?

260
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
Yes.

261
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,560
Then go back to sleep.

262
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,520
Look at your dark circles.

263
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,080
Good night.

264
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,360
Good night.

265
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,680
Why do I still feel so bad?

266
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,240
It's not like I'm really naive.

267
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,800
You should have gotten used to

268
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,520
in the workplace?

269
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,240
Or are you disappointed?

270
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,920
I realized that Leo

271
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,320
doesn't really like you that much.

272
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,280
You think you are a knife.

273
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,640
feel wronged.

274
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,280
You should be glad

275
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,680
that

276
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,080
at least a little bit

277
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,480
of being used by me.

278
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,640
When the Nth Worries at midnight

279
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,880
sprinkled on yourself.

280
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,200
Ding Yike begins to be busy at midnight.

281
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,680
High temperature grease

282
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,760
and egg with protein.

283
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,200
fully integrated.

284
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,120
Invading the flour

285
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
Full carbohydrates

286
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,520
It brings sufficient energy to a stable heart.

287
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,200
What?

288
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,120
Nothing.

289
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,680
I just think

290
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,800
you must be hungry.

291
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,440
There's nothing to worry about.

292
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,920
can't be solved with a bowl of chicken soup.

293
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,720
If it's not enough,

294
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,000
two bowls.

295
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,360
That's enough.

296
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,720
You're a girl.

297
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,320
Mind your image.

298
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,640
I don't want it anymore.

299
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,320
I thought I was smart today.

300
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,600
I'm embarrassed.

301
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,839
What are you doing?

302
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,560
Are you playing with mud?

303
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,800
It seems that

304
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,200
never seen my exhibition.

305
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,400
There's a whole area in my exhibition.

306
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,520
They are all soft potteries like this.

307
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:26,640
I've been so busy these days.

308
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,160
I don't have time

309
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,440
This weekend,

310
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,400
this weekend.

311
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,720
Your sacred light of art.

312
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,160
Tell me.

313
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,320
Why are you embarrassed?

314
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,920
He must be dumped

315
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,000
by Lin again.

316
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,640
or your

317
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,800
the boss of lace.

318
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,120
Right?

319
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,960
You brought me a bowl of noodles at this hour.

320
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,960
You're not here to show off your kindness, are you?

321
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,520
Tell me.

322
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,400
Today.

323
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,760
I'll tell her the truth.

324
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,880
I said,

325
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,680
all her recent behaviors

326
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,720
is using me.

327
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,000
So Guru,

328
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,200
Tell me.

329
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,600
What kind of person is she?

330
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,440
A nice person.

331
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,360
I like him.

332
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,080
Think about it.

333
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,400
a woman

334
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:34,920
or

335
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,800
in a scandal.

336
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,000
She went from her headquarters alone

337
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,800
to a second-tier company

338
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,760
like May.

339
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,520
can still have clear goals.

340
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,880
and methods.

341
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,560
She endures when she should.

342
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,120
She's tough when she should.

343
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,520
She can defeat the villain and the spy.

344
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,880
This is

345
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,880
a perfect leading actress in a drama.

346
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,480
Learn from her.

347
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,200
I think it saved you

348
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,600
to go to Business School.

349
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,240
Don't move.

350
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,720
It's pretty.

351
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,800
Good night.

352
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,760
Guru.

353
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
Show me another way.

354
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,040
After what happened today,

355
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,320
how should I face her?

356
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,920
Let go of her hand first.

357
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,840
How would I know?

358
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,160
What's the use of asking me?

359
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,440
Miss,

360
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,280
Use a bowl of noodles tonight

361
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,240
to exchange for the ears

362
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,840
is worth it.

363
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,760
If I were you,

364
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,680
I wouldn't spend time

365
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
to think about other things.

366
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,840
Just think about

367
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,720
how I can stay

368
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,200
the last six?

369
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,480
Okay, good night.

370
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,920
Didn't she say

371
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,720
she only wants the result.

372
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,600
Bye.

373
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,160
But what about Jiang Jie?

374
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,840
I talked a lot today.

375
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,560
Will she be implicated by me?

376
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,280
Leo is quite cruel.

377
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,840
Gosh, there are so many.

378
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,080
She's different when she comes.

379
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,440
Look, it’s one third.

380
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,800
Even Liu Ping’an and Shu Ge

381
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,520
These T6 are banished.

382
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,880
I didn't expect that.

383
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,800
I knew it.

384
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,520
Whenever she talks about something,

385
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,240
Leo will agree.

386
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,400
I don't know.

387
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,520
Should I be happy or depressed?

388
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,560
Too many times

389
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,920
no matter how hard you work,

390
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,880
no matter how hard you work.

391
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,760
Sure.

392
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,400
You're amazing.

393
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,600
What's wrong?

394
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,880
Congratulations.

395
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,560
Let's go out tonight.

396
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,600
You must go.

397
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,800
When can you give me

398
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
When can you give it to me?

399
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,440
Soon.

400
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,320
Mr. Du, the strategy meeting in five minutes.

401
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,560
Got it. I’ll be right there.

402
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:07,920
The total sales volume has increased.

403
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,200
46.75%.

404
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
The storage digestion rate has reached

405
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,720
87 percent.

406
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,360
Through these numbers,

407
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,120
I think

408
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
clearly see

409
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,120
a huge change is happening in May.

410
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,400
But the margin rate went down.

411
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,480
That's because of the previous inventory.

412
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,840
If you don't object,

413
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,960
my new plan,

414
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,000
I can guarantee that

415
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,800
the high inventory

416
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:28,320
I won't bother Oh-wol anymore.

417
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,800
What new plan?

418
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,040
Let the buyer intervene in men's clothes.

419
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,720
of men's clothes.

420
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,600
After all, our main production line is women's clothes.

421
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,400
Men's clothes are always looking for substitutes outside.

422
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,000
So it's not risky

423
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,240
It's not risky.

424
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,520
Also, we need to improve

425
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,640
on the production line.

426
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,960
I hope the design department can cooperate with us.

427
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,280
Director Lei kicked out

428
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,000
one third of them.

429
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,080
Of course the Purchase Department is short-handed.

430
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,480
Now they want our design department to cooperate.

431
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,520
I think you are in charge

432
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,600
are all under your control.

433
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,040
Are you satisfied?

434
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,040
I saw the highest stitches

435
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,120
in the sales report.

436
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,560
If I remember correctly,

437
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,200
it must be your design.

438
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,200
In front of these numbers and facts,

439
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,640
can only prove

440
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,240
your design can't be sold.

441
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,040
If we don't buy hands,

442
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,640
to design scientifically,

443
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,400
Do you need us

444
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,840
pay for your third-rate creativity?

445
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,960
Art and market are different.

446
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:28,080
First of all,

447
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
is art or not.

448
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,320
Let's not discuss it here.

449
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,480
I only say second.

450
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,400
the shareholder of May

451
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,560
never cares about art.

452
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,000
but profit.

453
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,000
Leo!

454
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,680
Calm down.

455
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,400
It's normal to have different opinions.

456
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,840
Everyone should give way.

457
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,040
We can't give in.

458
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,240
Let me make it clear today.

459
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,200
If anyone moves,

460
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,560
the independence of our design department.

461
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,160
Either I leave or she gets lost.

462
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,760
Then get lost.

463
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,720
You have no say in the design department.

464
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,480
No, Du.

465
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,160
Shut up.

466
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,080
All you care about is art and the market.

467
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,320
What are you doing in May?

468
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,760
Go to the museum.

469
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,080
Write a resignation report

470
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,640
or send three people from you.

471
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,520
and set up a single team.

472
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,440
to buy hands.

473
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,760
You choose.

474
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,280
Yes.

475
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,240
Who is the boss

476
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,160
who is in charge of business?

477
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,920
Who is responsible for the mistakes?

478
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,240
Dismissed.

479
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,440
What’s wrong with Mr. Du?

480
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,560
How can I help her?

481
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,120
Mr. Du is just bluffing.

482
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,160
He’s actually helping you.

483
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,280
Is this helping me?

484
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,240
Just three.

485
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,000
What's wrong with throwing it to Leo?

486
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,240
That's easy for you to say.

487
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,480
HR is easier.

488
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,680
No matter how hard the fire is,

489
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,200
no matter how hard it is.

490
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,600
Thank you for earlier.

491
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,680
What can I do for you?

492
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,680
Why did you lie to me

493
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,160
Why did you lie to me?

494
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,800
Did I lie?

495
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,080
Didn't I get your permission?

496
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,080
I agreed to

497
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,040
who leaked the secret.

498
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,160
But you didn't tell me.

499
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,080
Those who were transferred

500
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,120
is one third of the purchase department.

501
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,000
Maybe I've been a little tired recently.

502
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,280
I forgot to tell you.

503
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,080
There are a few more on the list.

504
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,280
But they

505
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,360
have hurt me

506
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,440
in the company.

507
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,920
It's not unfair to let them go.

508
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,240
I guess you don't hold a grudge.

509
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,200
You want to take this opportunity

510
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,120
to disband the whole Purchase Department

511
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,960
and transform May into buying manufacturing,

512
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,600
right?

513
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,520
Yes.

514
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,680
So what?

515
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,120
Since the first day I entered May,

516
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,160
I've never changed my goal.

517
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,440
But don't worry.

518
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,200
I'm not doing this

519
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,760
to seize power.

520
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,840
May's report

521
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,520
must be pretty.

522
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,360
Who do you think I care about?

523
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,960
Reports and sales?

524
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,440
What I care about is your attitude towards me.

525
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,840
As long as you're willing to communicate with me beforehand,

526
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,760
let alone the Purchase Department,

527
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,920
even if you let me

528
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,480
give up the position of general manager,

529
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,560
I'm willing to.

530
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,120
But you didn't.

531
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,400
You treated me

532
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,640
as a fool again.

533
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,920
He played a trick to move flowers and catch the wood.

534
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,200
Act first and report later.

535
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,880
I'm sorry for letting you down.

536
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,360
But I never

537
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,800
I don't like to develop friendship

538
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,680
friends.

539
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,880
So in order not to let you down again,

540
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,320
I suggest

541
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,680
not to be friends with me.

542
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,720
You and Ding Yike are close.

543
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,400
That's because I like her.

544
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,280
Which kind?

545
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,800
What do you think?

546
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,800
I don't believe it.

547
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,080
At first, I didn't believe it either.

548
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,040
But later I found

549
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,920
she's quite stubborn.

550
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,800
Otherwise,

551
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,840
she's inexperienced and stupid.

552
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,840
Why should I protect her?

553
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,440
I'm telling you, I don't believe it.

554
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,520
I don’t believe it.

555
00:27:59,400 --> 00:27:59,960
Mr. Du.

556
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,160
It's okay.

557
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:01,960
Keep eating.

558
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,040
I'm just thinking about something.

559
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,320
Leave me alone.

560
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,160
Short waist and short legs.

561
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,520
Why?

562
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,080
What did you say?

563
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,360
Nothing.

564
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,120
Go on.

565
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,680
Mr. Du, you...

566
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,960
Take a phone here.

567
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,520
like a wolf staring at a rabbit.

568
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,360
How can I work?

569
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,880
By the way,

570
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,280
I fought with someone, and I have a bad temper.

571
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,000
Seriously.

572
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,880
Mr. Du, what are you doing?

573
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,680
Nothing.

574
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,520
I'm just thinking

575
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,720
your future in the company.

576
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,760
After all,

577
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,520
recruited by me, right?

578
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,920
By the way,

579
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,520
how are you getting along with Director Lei?

580
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,360
Not bad.

581
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,960
What job did she give you?

582
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,080
As the general manager,

583
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,640
I care about my employees.

584
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,880
What's wrong with that?

585
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,640
Director Lei asked us

586
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,800
to stay

587
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,360
Work with the Purchase Department one-on-one.

588
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,920
Get familiar with the men's clothing line.

589
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,760
I remember you've never been a buyer before.

590
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,720
At noon,

591
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,480
I don't have time to eat out

592
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,320
and study alone here.

593
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,880
If you're really tired,

594
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,880
I don't think you should work at a hand shop.

595
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,800
I heard that you are talented

596
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,760
in sales.

597
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,640
The Rainbow shop

598
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,080
needs a deputy manager.

599
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:55,960
Are you interested?

600
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,480
How about this?

601
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,160
Come to me and be my assistant.

602
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,120
What do you think?

603
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,200
What's with that look?

604
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
Are you interested?

605
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,400
I’m doing this for your sake.

606
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,960
Mr. Du.

607
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,880
Since the first day I came to the company,

608
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,680
you wanted me to leave.

609
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,920
Then you tricked me into buying hands.

610
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,760
I threw it away for months and ignored it.

611
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,760
A friend I haven't seen for a long time.

612
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,400
suddenly texted you on WeChat.

613
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,200
to borrow money from you.

614
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
Similarly,

615
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,880
a boss who doesn't know you

616
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,560
suddenly cares about you.

617
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,000
99% is up to something.

618
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,280
You...

619
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,000
Are you trying to set me up?

620
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,360
It doesn't look like it.

621
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,320
You want to use me

622
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,520
to deal with Director Lei.

623
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,720
What are you thinking?

624
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,920
What are you thinking about?

625
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,360
I'm doing this for your sake.

626
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,720
I don't want to talk to you.

627
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,880
What's the same word?

628
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,120
Talk about the center.

629
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,080
Hello.

630
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,240
Are you Tang Li?

631
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,000
Yes.

632
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,120
She talks about you every day.

633
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,080
your ears are getting stiff.

634
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,560
You can find such a handsome guy among programmers.

635
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,840
Good for you.

636
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,920
Annoying.

637
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,760
I heard a lot about you from Xiaojie.

638
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,440
that you are her best friend.

639
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,440
Of course.

640
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,480
Shanghai is so big.

641
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,120
two old classmates are still in the same company.

642
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,240
It's really fate.

643
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:55,960
Yes.

644
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,840
She told me

645
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,960
thanks to you for staying.

646
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,360
Here, a toast to you.

647
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,080
No, no.

648
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,160
She helped me a lot.

649
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,120
Come on, stop the formalities.

650
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,280
Let's drink.

651
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,640
I hope our friendship will last.

652
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,400
Forever friendship.

653
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,400
What are you laughing at?

654
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,520
What are you playing?

655
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,840
Let's play a game.

656
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,880
If you lose, record a video

657
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,920
with your accent.

658
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:17,520
Look.

659
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,720
Dubbing video.

660
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,640
Sir.

661
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,760
My goodness.

662
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,040
Let's play together, okay?

663
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,120
Come on. Come on.

664
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,440
I'll turn around then.

665
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,960
Sure.

666
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,000
Come on.

667
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,800
Why is it my turn?

668
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,360
Come on.

669
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,040
I admit defeat.

670
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,920
Stop. Okay.

671
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,000
Okay.

672
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,440
Let's do it.

673
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,520
This is your phone. I'll record it for you.

674
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,520
Okay, wait a minute.

675
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,880
Let me get ready.

676
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,000
Are you done?

677
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,080
Okay.

678
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,480
Start.

679
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,920
Sir, I hit

680
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,920
I hit it.

681
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,360
It hurts so much that I sat on the ground and cried.

682
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,200
I don't want to go any further.

683
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,360
Really.

684
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,280
Okay, it's done. What do you think?

685
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,840
Amazing.

686
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,320
Amazing.

687
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,200
Do you admit defeat?

688
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:26,800
Come on.

689
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,160
Let's drink.

690
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,280
Let's drink.

691
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:32,480
Okay.

692
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,440
Come on. Go on.

693
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,480
Go on.

694
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,320
Come on, let's drink.

695
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:37,760
You...

696
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,480
It's your turn.

697
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,280
Don't deny it.

698
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,760
Record it. Don't deny it.

699
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,360
Don't deny it.

700
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,360
This is not my strength.

701
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:44,920
This one

702
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,000
Hurry. No, no.

703
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,360
Hurry up. I've already played.

704
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,280
The young man's ambitions are not worth mentioning.

705
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,160
Great!

706
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:54,400
Cheers.

707
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,840
Come on.

708
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,880
Mr. Liu, come on.

709
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
A toast to Mr. Liu.

710
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,840
Come on.

711
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:03,200
Come on, Mr. Liu.

712
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,360
Come on.

713
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,320
Come on.

714
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,320
Mr. Liu, don't drink too much.

715
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,840
Mr. Liu, Mr. Liu, I need to take this call.

716
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,480
I'll be right back.

717
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,679
What did you do?

718
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,719
I need to take this call. I'll be right back.

719
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,360
I'll be right back.

720
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,840
Hello, Mom.

721
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,080
Hey, Sa Hyun.

722
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:27,679
Mom.

723
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:29,600
What is it?

724
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,719
Are you still socialising?

725
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,360
What time is it? Why aren't you back yet?

726
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,520
I know. I know.

727
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,480
Did you drink again?

728
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,440
Me too.

729
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,480
I don't want to drink either, but...

730
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,600
I have to drink, you know?

731
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,719
Do you have to do this?

732
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,360
I know you want to go to the big fund.

733
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,120
But Wenwen's uncle

734
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,360
the boss of Chenxing Fund?

735
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,280
Hello?

736
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,760
Hello?

737
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,960
Hello, Mom.

738
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,480
Hello?

739
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,720
Hello, the signal is bad.

740
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:01,720
I can't hear you.

741
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,040
Hey, Sa Hyun.

742
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,680
Hello?

743
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:25,040
Sir, I hit the South Wall.

744
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,640
It hurts so much that I can't stop crying.

745
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,040
I don’t want to go any further.

746
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,600
Lin.

747
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,560
Where did it go?

748
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,680
Lin! Lin! Lin!

749
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,440
Coming.

750
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,080
Come here.

751
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,240
Sorry.

752
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:48,800
Lin.

753
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,760
Sorry.

754
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,720
Your call is too long.

755
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,120
Punish! Punish! Drink white!

756
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,640
Sorry, sorry.

757
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,480
Use a big cup.

758
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,200
Here comes the wine

759
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,040
Here, here, here.

760
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,840
Come on.

761
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,280
You haven't drunk enough.

762
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:00,960
No.

763
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,800
Change the big one. The bigger one.

764
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,120
White wine. Come on.

765
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,240
No, Mr. Liu.

766
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,600
Mr. Liu is here.

767
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,160
Come on. Drink.

768
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,120
Come on. Drink, Lin.

769
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,480
Drink it.

770
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,040
Drink it up.

771
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,680
Mr. Liu, cheers.

772
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,320
Yes.

773
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:15,960
Bottoms up.

774
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,360
Come on. Cheers.

775
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,600
Okay.

776
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,600
Be careful.

777
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,960
Watch the steps.

778
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,760
Mr. Liu.

779
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,960
Goodbye, Mr. Liu.

780
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,200
Good job. See you next time.

781
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,320
Sure.

782
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,040
It's your home, my dear.

783
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,880
Slow down.

784
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:07,800
You can be careful.

785
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,600
Well...

786
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,120
I'll do it next.

787
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,440
Sure.

788
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,920
Can you go back alone so late?

789
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,400
It's okay. I'll just take a taxi.

790
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,240
Be careful.

791
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,240
Okay, we're leaving.

792
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,280
Okay.

793
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,160
Sure.

794
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,440
WeChat.

795
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,800
Slow down.

796
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,680
Be careful.

797
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,120
I'm leaving.

798
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:27,760
Bye.

799
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,000
Slow down.

800
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:03,320
Jiang Jie, you...

801
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,760
No, no.

802
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,360
Forget it. It's getting dark.

803
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:53,960
Sa Xian.

804
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,080
Sure.

805
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,000
Si Xian, why are you here?

806
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,840
Let me help you.

807
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,760
Why are you alone?

808
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,320
Let's go. I'll send you home.

809
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,640
Let's go.

810
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,320
Go.

811
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,880
Sir, let's go.

812
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,960
Come down.

813
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,560
No, don't move.

814
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,280
I can walk by myself.

815
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,680
Stop it, okay?

816
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,240
I can go home by myself.

817
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,920
Okay, you can go by yourself.

818
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,040
Get up and take a look.

819
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,720
Lin Sixian.

820
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,000
Don't think I'll do anything to you

821
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,960
just because I sent you home.

822
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,600
The sour smell on you

823
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,920
can kill a pig.

824
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,680
Who's dead?

825
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,520
Get up.

826
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,760
Be good.

827
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,480
Let's go home.

828
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,120
Good boy.

829
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:48,840
I...

830
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:50,800
Let's go.

831
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,920
Don't move.

832
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:05,720
Be careful.

833
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,280
Sit down.

834
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,200
I saw

835
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,240
I saw it.
