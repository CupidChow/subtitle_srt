1
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,440
Don't put it here

2
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
Put them in front.

3
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,680
Put these two in front.

4
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,120
Hello, is Ding Yike here?

5
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,840
No.

6
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,600
Where did she go?

7
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Maybe over there.

8
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:36,880
Thank you.

9
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,320
Let me finish.

10
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,920
Let me finish.

11
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,920
After sending you

12
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,720
that text yesterday,

13
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,200
I withdrew it right away. I regret it.

14
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,880
Second,

15
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,960
I shouldn't have called you

16
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,960
when I had dinner last night.

17
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,880
and ignored your feelings.

18
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,520
Third,

19
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,560
I did see you

20
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,840
with your ex-boyfriend.

21
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,400
I admit I was too impulsive.

22
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,560
I want to make it clear.

23
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,640
But when I sent it to you again,

24
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,640
he blocked me.

25
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,800
Can you give me an explanation?

26
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,720
I think this matter

27
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,880
to me.

28
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,040
Six months ago,

29
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,480
I saw

30
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,640
my ex-girlfriend and Shen Jin

31
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,120
happened together.

32
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,600
Helmlick Emergency Act.

33
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,120
That's not right.

34
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,240
Then why did he

35
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,720
at that time?

36
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,640
What's the point of saying this now?

37
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,360
It's meaningful.

38
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,760
I care

39
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,160
Do you really

40
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,080
as your girlfriend?

41
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,120
If you think

42
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,200
you can't accept Lin Sixian,

43
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,560
come to my house at night.

44
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,440
Then why should I get used to it?

45
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,280
In your heart,

46
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,280
Leo always comes first.

47
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,120
Have I ever worn the clothes you designed?

48
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,800
Do I know any other friends

49
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,000
other than Qian?

50
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,320
Even the dating program

51
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,800
was made by Feifei.

52
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,320
You can just text me when you break up.

53
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,840
Even if I'm the mineral water you like,

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,280
you don't have to be so perfunctory.

55
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,320
I'm not being perfunctory.

56
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,040
I've been too busy lately.

57
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,120
I really don't know

58
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,880
how to work hard

59
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,160
to make you feel romantic

60
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,280
and make you happy.

61
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,320
That's why I had no choice.

62
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,200
No, you know.

63
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,720
You just don't have

64
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,880
to do for me.

65
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,720
Even kindergarten boys know

66
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,240
In order to please little girls,

67
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,160
I'll give her the best lollipop.

68
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,200
And you? No, listen to me.

69
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,520
Let me finish.

70
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,960
Yes.

71
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,640
You'll say it's because you're busy with work.

72
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,800
but the reason is simple.

73
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,240
You don't like me that much.

74
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,040
You kissed me that day.

75
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,760
you kissed me that day

76
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,560
because you pity me.

77
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,960
But pity is not love.

78
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,320
It won't drive you crazy.

79
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,440
That's why you can't

80
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,960
the role of your boyfriend.

81
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,520
OK. Don't be so self-abased, OK?

82
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,560
I want you to look at me.

83
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,800
I really like you.

84
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
It's useless.

85
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,560
Don't lie to me.

86
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,400
Stop lying to yourself, okay?

87
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,120
In your eyes,

88
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,680
in your eyes.

89
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,280
But when you look at Leo,

90
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
Leo, my God.

91
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,000
Leo is just my senior.

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,960
How many times do I have to tell you?

93
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,600
I think she's more talented than me.

94
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
I think she's too good for me.

95
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,680
I'll use all kinds of methods

96
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,480
to get her back to the design industry.

97
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,160
I don't want to care about these anymore.

98
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,320
Do you understand?

99
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,480
Yes.

100
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,520
Famous school, New York, Press Conference.

101
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,080
Your world is so advanced.

102
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,960
I don't understand.

103
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,600
I'm like

104
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,200
Alice fell into the rabbit hole.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,920
For me,

106
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,280
to me.

107
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,480
What about you?

108
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,640
You only look at me with the eyes of your eyes.

109
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,000
You only give what you want

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,840
instead of what I want.

111
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,400
So it's not about

112
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,159
Do you want to break up with me?

113
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,440
I'm tired.

114
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,280
I don't want to be with you anymore.

115
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,200
Let's stop messing around, okay?

116
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,120
Okay, I beg you.

117
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,880
Let's not beat around the bush, okay?

118
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,400
You...

119
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,840
Don't push me, okay?

120
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,480
Do you know how much effort

121
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,400
to be so calm

122
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,600
to tell you this?

123
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,120
This has nothing to do with inferiority complex.

124
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,960
It's not because of any reason.

125
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,840
It's a sober self-introduction.

126
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,560
Zhao Moyuan.

127
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,600
Go away!

128
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,520
We're not from the same world.

129
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,080
Let's stop bothering each other.

130
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,840
Okay?

131
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,480
We're still friends.

132
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:33,880
Of course.

133
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,640
If you feel uncomfortable,

134
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,600
I can move out too.

135
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,840
No need.

136
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,920
My dad has been forcing me to go back anyway.

137
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,960
I'll just go.

138
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,320
Thank you.

139
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Prince Charming, I'm off work.

140
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,600
Go ahead.

141
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,160
I might be working overtime these days.

142
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
I'll leave the store to you.

143
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,240
Okay.

144
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,720
Are you and Coco okay?

145
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,800
I'm fine.

146
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,400
Go.

147
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,600
We've become good friends.

148
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,440
I knew it.

149
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,560
I knew something was wrong

150
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,680
when you used my phone this morning.

151
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,080
She thinks

152
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,800
I don't really like her.

153
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,920
I didn't know what she wanted,

154
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,720
So she broke up with me.

155
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,680
What about you?

156
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,840
I...

157
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,760
I...

158
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,640
I feel wronged.

159
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,480
I feel wronged.

160
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,160
But it seems that she said

161
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,320
some thoughts

162
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,120
in my heart.

163
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,520
It seems that my ex-girlfriends

164
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,320
mentioned this to me, but

165
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,320
It's normal that

166
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,920
It's normal.

167
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,160
You're a guru.

168
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,080
Winter shouldn't be

169
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,360
the process of love like a mortal.

170
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,040
Look at that St. Roland.

171
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,120
He likes that muse.

172
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,600
No one knows

173
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,200
if they are together.

174
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,480
Are they married?

175
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,920
They were like good friends.

176
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,120
like good friends.

177
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,880
I think it suits you better.

178
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,640
Cocoa is suitable for housewives.

179
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,760
I think in your heart,

180
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,040
in your heart.

181
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,880
Maybe.

182
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,960
We may break up.

183
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,440
is the best choice for us.

184
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,440
That's right.

185
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,120
I think

186
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,480
it's because

187
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,080
you couldn't forget

188
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,280
So you can't forget

189
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,400
Cocoa-chan's emotions.

190
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,640
My career is in a slump. Stop it.

191
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,200
This word seems to

192
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,840
in my dictionary.

193
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,960
Go back now.

194
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,640
Or your mom and sister will nag you again.

195
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,360
Let's go.

196
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,960
You really don't want me to spend it with you?

197
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,320
What can happen to me?

198
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,600
Speaking of breaking up,

199
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,040
You should know

200
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,640
my experience is Nfold.

201
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,600
It's not a big deal.

202
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,640
Let's go.

203
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,600
Okay, I'm leaving.

204
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,040
But it wasn't before.

205
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,200
He dumped you. Enough.

206
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,640
It's not a big deal.

207
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,680
Let me tell you.

208
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,760
I'll move back later.

209
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,600
If you want to live on the second floor,

210
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,480
you can move in anytime.

211
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,960
Why are you still here?

212
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,360
Aren't you the same?

213
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,320
I'm preparing

214
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,520
for boss.

215
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,000
Next week,

216
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,400
is coming next week.

217
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,160
The marketing budget

218
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,880
the marketing budget

219
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,920
depends on her mood.

220
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,600
What about you?

221
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,200
How's it going

222
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,920
How did it go?

223
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
I don't know. I went on a patrol this afternoon.

224
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,000
Boss followed me.

225
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,720
My eyes are swollen and I put on powder.

226
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,160
You work overtime and suddenly ignore the project.

227
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,880
Did you make trouble and offend the boss again?

228
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,320
No, stop guessing.

229
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,800
There's only one truth.

230
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,720
Did you have a fight with your boyfriend?

231
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,400
Hello Conan. Goodbye Conan.

232
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,720
With my few conscience,

233
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,880
Let me remind you.

234
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,280
Partrick's condition

235
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,160
must be

236
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,520
you can meet

237
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,920
I can meet.

238
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,040
It's not worth

239
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,480
It's not worth breaking up with him.

240
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,120
Take care of him as soon as possible.

241
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,680
It's better to be wronged

242
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,760
is better than being bullied by the boss.

243
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,160
Right?

244
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,560
The poisonous chicken soup tastes good.

245
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,120
One more.

246
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,080
It seems more serious than I thought.

247
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,360
Did they break up already?

248
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,240
Then you can continue

249
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,120
you can continue.

250
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,440
Learn from friendship.

251
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,600
The best way to heal a broken heart is

252
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,040
Don't be idle.

253
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,000
In addition,

254
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,600
it's also the best time to lose weight.

255
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,000
Make good use of it.

256
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,840
Since you've broken up,

257
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,440
why don't you give me

258
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,880
to me?

259
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,840
I won't let you suffer.

260
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,600
I'll give you 10% more.

261
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,160
I bought the bag myself.

262
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
It's not from him.

263
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,560
Then you should have transferred it to me.

264
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,960
Look at that bag.

265
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,320
is not your style.

266
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,000
The injury in love

267
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,600
should be repaid financially.

268
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:22,560
What do you think?

269
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,280
No.

270
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,040
Yes.

271
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,960
Forget it.

272
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,720
I know why

273
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,080
she doesn't want to change that bag.

274
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,080
It's expensive and useless.

275
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,640
but it can commemorate her part.

276
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,200
that you might never meet again.

277
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,840
Cinderella's love.

278
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,400
Do you have

279
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,560
something similar?

280
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Like photos of Michelin restaurant

281
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,200
A souvenir for travel abroad.

282
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,520
Or

283
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,000
when they were skinny.

284
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,480
They have a common name.

285
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,480
called

286
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,680
Unwilling to leave

287
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,880
Here.

288
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,200
Dad, come here.

289
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
Your favorite braised pork.

290
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,440
Enough.

291
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,480
Don't be so attentive.

292
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,880
Here.

293
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,480
As for Xiao Yu,

294
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,880
I've blocked it for you.

295
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,240
You've gone too far.

296
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,440
How could you

297
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,800
just like that?

298
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,800
She's not suspended. She's still a director.

299
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,640
I just asked her to manage

300
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,880
the new company resource program.

301
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Let her hand over

302
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
to the vice director.

303
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,440
No suspension.

304
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,960
New projects are important,

305
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,640
but you can't let the company think

306
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,240
that you're always

307
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,400
by Leo.

308
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,640
Let me tell you.

309
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,880
He's not a good person.

310
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,600
Dad, you told me

311
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,080
we need a chance

312
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,440
a chance to change.

313
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,120
Now Leo

314
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,600
is almost done for us.

315
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,720
She's fighting in the front.

316
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,400
As the commander-in-chief,

317
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,560
I have to

318
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,400
at the back.

319
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,560
Am I right?

320
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,080
As long as you know it.

321
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,640
Why don't you

322
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,840
stay at home lately?

323
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,840
I have work to do. I have to work overtime.

324
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,120
Isn't the hotel close to the company?

325
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,800
You won't leave tonight, right?

326
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,240
Not tonight.

327
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,840
I have to check out a venue tonight.

328
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,960
I don't know what time it is.

329
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,080
If I'm not worried about your illness,

330
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,760
I wouldn't have come back to eat.

331
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:47,880
Here.

332
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,360
Thank you, Dad.

333
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,360
Drive carefully.

334
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,200
Here.

335
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:14,960
Here.

336
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,480
Here.

337
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,480
What's wrong?

338
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,280
Take a break.

339
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,040
Take a break.

340
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,200
Are you tired?

341
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,280
Take a break.

342
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:28,960
Sit down.

343
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,160
I brought you here

344
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,120
to make you relax.

345
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,040
not to risk your life.

346
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,720
What's wrong?

347
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,800
You look upset.

348
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,840
Is it because Zhao Moyuan

349
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,360
with Zhao Yuyuan?

350
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,240
There's a problem.

351
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,920
But it should be solved soon.

352
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,520
Then tell me.

353
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,760
Maybe I can help you.

354
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,920
What do you know about the design?

355
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,560
There must be something I can help you with.

356
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,160
Silence is the greatest help.

357
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,960
I lied to my dad

358
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,680
I lied to my dad

359
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,840
That's why I came out.

360
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,320
I came here with you

361
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,000
in the middle of the night

362
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
for?

363
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,360
Do you think

364
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,880
I think too much

365
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,520
You shouldn't be so nosy.

366
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,320
Tell me if it's you. It's okay.

367
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,920
Hey, Leo.

368
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,160
I know you have a lot of pride.

369
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,120
But...

370
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,800
But you can

371
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,880
lean on me.

372
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,520
Lean on me.

373
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,440
I don't have the habit of relying on men.

374
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,680
So I'm here.

375
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,680
I'm just a man.

376
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,880
What's wrong?

377
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,720
Let me do it.

378
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,000
Let me do it.

379
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,840
It's okay.

380
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,440
It's just a cramp.

381
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,880
Hang in there.

382
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,880
Just shout out if it hurts. It's okay.

383
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,840
All right.

384
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,680
It's not that I don't want to say it.

385
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,920
I just...

386
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,920
I know. I know.

387
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,520
If you don't want to say it, don't say it.

388
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,080
Tell me when you want to.

389
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
I can wait.

390
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,040
It's all my fault.

391
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,120
I made you angry because you were annoying.

392
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,080
I'm sorry.

393
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,280
If you really want to help,

394
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,000
there is one thing

395
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,320
Next week, the headquarters will send

396
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,320
named Linda.

397
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,600
That woman is very picky and difficult to deal with.

398
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,120
As a local snake,

399
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,480
find a special place for me.

400
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,720
Help me fill my face.

401
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,840
No problem. I'm good at this.

402
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,440
Let me do it.

403
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,320
No matter how hard you fight in the front line,

404
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,440
I will always be your last line of defense.

405
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,960
I'm tired. I want to go back.

406
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,680
Yes.

407
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,600
Wait.

408
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,480
Have you had dinner?

409
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,600
I happen to have some dishes

410
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,080
I made them myself.

411
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,880
It's delicious.

412
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,080
Here, take a look.

413
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,480
It's cold

414
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,160
There's a microwave in the lobby.

415
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,560
Business trip

416
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,400
A business trip?

417
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,840
Why didn't your girlfriend come to see you off?

418
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,120
Maybe she's busy.

419
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,120
Bye.

420
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,800
Don't be afraid. You just broke up.

421
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,320
You were experienced last time.

422
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,240
It hurts at first and then despair.

423
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,960
Soon, you'll get used to it.

424
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,280
You did well.

425
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,280
This is a rational decision.

426
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,760
I broke up with him.

427
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,880
It's better than being depressed later.

428
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,440
Someone is here.

429
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,120
Bei Bei, Bei 30.

430
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,960
Hit me!

431
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,840
Behind the wall.

432
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,040
Hello, Uncle Zhao.

433
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,680
What?

434
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,040
Momo moved home?

435
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,320
Yes.

436
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,160
There must be something wrong.

437
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,040
Don't worry.

438
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,760
Tomorrow morning,

439
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,240
tomorrow morning.

440
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,960
I'll ask around for you.

441
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,240
Okay.

442
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,440
Goodbye, Uncle Zhao.

443
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,120
I moved back.

444
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,640
Patric will hurry up

445
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,280
to finish his design manuscript.

446
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,720
Try to make two sample dresses

447
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,640
before next week.

448
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,440
Tina.

449
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,440
Go to the studio

450
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,760
to help him finish it.

451
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,040
The headquarters

452
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,120
asked us

453
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,400
to assist Linda.

454
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,800
Keke, I'll leave this to you.

455
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,000
Coco.

456
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,200
Did you hear that?

457
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,960
Stay in the company for the next two days.

458
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,240
and sort out the project books for Linda.

459
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,360
Also, contact the design department

460
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,560
and the factory

461
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,760
of the factory.

462
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,640
Okay, no problem.

463
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,000
Dismiss.

464
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,120
That's why the boss knows.

465
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,080
That's why he asked you not to go.

466
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,280
to avoid embarrassment.

467
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,800
I'm so jealous.

468
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,000
The treatment of trust is different.

469
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,320
In this project team,

470
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,720
in this project team.

471
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,480
I should be the one

472
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,920
should be me.

473
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,760
You're right.

474
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,640
That's why I'll work harder

475
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,000
for you.

476
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,240
As for the progress of this project,

477
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,080
I'll update it in WeChat.

478
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,040
I won't let you feel the tea is cold.

479
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,080
Thank you.

480
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,520
You're so sweet.

481
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,360
It can't be helped.

482
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,960
What if you two make up again?

483
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,040
We can meet again in the future.

484
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,960
Impossible.

485
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,880
Nothing is impossible.

486
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,400
I broke up so many times,

487
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,200
I've never had a relapse.

488
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,400
in the past.

489
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,720
Unless you're not true love.

490
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,160
Patrick, I pricked my hand.

491
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,520
Are you okay?

492
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,000
I'm fine.

493
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:03,640
Here.

494
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,440
Where's your belt?

495
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,800
Give me a belt

496
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,440
Tighten this up.

497
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,520
Luna!

498
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,360
Since Leo came yesterday,

499
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,040
since Leo came yesterday.

500
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,600
Yike, are you okay?

501
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,560
I'm fine.

502
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,440
But I think

503
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,560
you haven't finished half a sandwich.

504
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,320
I'm on a diet.

505
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,000
It's okay.

506
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,160
Go ahead. It's okay.

507
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,560
I got the wrong number.

508
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,800
It's okay.

509
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,200
I'm busy.

510
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,240
Do you have to do it now?

511
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,120
Why are you so grumpy?

512
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
Didn't you say

513
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,920
that when I have time,

514
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,520
when I'm free.

515
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,920
and make a documentary.

516
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:15,880
It’s narrow.

517
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,800
What’s wrong? Shen Jin is in trouble again?

518
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,120
A few fashion VIPs

519
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,440
suddenly posted on Weibo

520
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,680
that he was not optimistic about my cooperation with May.

521
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,960
They said

522
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,000
I didn't have any experience in making clothes before.

523
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,000
So this time, it's destined to fail.

524
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,360
Good for you.

525
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,120
Those bastards.

526
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,760
Ask Luna to make a list for me.

527
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:37,920
I’ll do it when I get back.

528
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,640
I'll help you clean up these Navy.

529
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,760
Miss, who is it?

530
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,480
Why didn't Leo ask Ding to come?

531
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,280
I heard from Feifei that you and Ding...

532
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,360
Are you done?

533
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,080
Are you done?

534
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,480
Here.

535
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:27,680
How is it?

536
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,320
Wonderful. Eyes on it.

537
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,080
Can I be honest?

538
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,280
It's normal.

539
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,760
Instead, the whole structure lost balance.

540
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,680
With all due respect,

541
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,680
it didn't work

542
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,920
your design

543
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,640
is not your usual level.

544
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,400
Patrick.

545
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,280
I think it's okay.

546
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,880
Why don't we take a photo

547
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,120
and send it to Leo?

548
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:01,640
No!

549
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,080
Boss, it's ready.

550
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,720
Please take a look.

551
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,000
Tina sent me

552
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,880
after adjustment.

553
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,960
I don't think it works well.

554
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,360
But everyone has

555
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,440
their ups and downs.

556
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,320
Do you want to

557
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,800
choose something simple first.

558
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,240
Change it to wrinkled shirt if it doesn't work

559
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,200
and not symmetrical skirts.

560
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,720
I’m familiar with these

561
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
in my college couture.

562
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,840
It's not easy to make mistakes.

563
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,360
Okay, focus on these two first.

564
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,800
We can keep in touch.

565
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,000
Sorry.

566
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,760
I'll try to adjust myself.

567
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,160
Zhao Moyuan and May Project

568
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,360
You're in front.

569
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,760
and our May.

570
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,720
If something goes wrong,

571
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,760
we will die.

572
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,960
Do you understand?

573
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,760
Yes.

574
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,000
Bye.

575
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,560
Okay.

576
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:40,880
Everyone.

577
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,400
Let's remove all the dresses.

578
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,440
Change to the stage.

579
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:44,960
From now on,

580
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,720
Let's do the wrong shirt.

581
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,840
And wrinkled skirt, okay?

582
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:48,720
Okay.

583
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,640
Okay, hurry.

584
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,440
Is this yours too?

585
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,000
Yes, this one.

586
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,240
And this.

587
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:12,920
Okay.

588
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,040
Suddenly I feel much better

589
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,840
The relationship between women

590
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,000
is really amazing.

591
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,760
They knew everything,

592
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,000
but they didn't say anything.

593
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,360
Thank you.

594
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,200
Let's go.

595
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,000
Okay.

596
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,400
Hello.

597
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,760
You turn on the lights.

598
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,480
Okay.

599
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,120
Here.

600
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,120
Done.

601
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,960
Let me see.

602
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,800
Look at the lighting effect.

603
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:56,680
is different.

604
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,800
Of course.

605
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
Are you going to hide behind?

606
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,560
Why is your face so small?

607
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,000
No, I've lost weight recently.

608
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,200
Are we rivals, rivals in love,

609
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,760
or friends?

610
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,360
I think so, but I don't think so.

611
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,040
Anyway,

612
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,360
they have shown me

613
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,800
their hidden side.

614
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,600
Then why should I look into it?

615
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,840
Are they comforting

616
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,240
or sympathy?

617
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,600
Even if I have no appetite,

618
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,680
I have to eat it.

619
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,960
Because desserts not only bring calories,

620
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,320
but also makes people happy.

621
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,080
After today,

622
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,640
tomorrow will be better than today.

623
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,600
Even a little more.

624
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,720
Dad, I'm drinking.

625
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,200
The U.S. chip is banned.

626
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,920
I lost another big order.

627
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,680
So annoying.

628
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,440
Come, have a drink with me.

629
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,840
I don't know what big order it is.

630
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:50,840
Drink it.

631
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:51,840
Stop.

632
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,000
Is it so hard

633
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,080
Is it that hard?

634
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,280
Sit.

635
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,000
Who broke up with her first?

636
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,880
Ah.

637
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,000
What?

638
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,000
If you don't tell the truth,

639
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,080
I'll call

640
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,360
Xu Fei now.

641
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,640
She wanted to break up.

642
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,440
Why are you so useless?

643
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,000
Is she still my son?

644
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,760
If she thinks I'm not good enough to her,

645
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,720
That's why we broke up.

646
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,840
That's the premise.

647
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,040
That's more like it.

648
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,800
But...

649
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,640
do you like her or not?

650
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,800
I don't know.

651
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,360
At the beginning,

652
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,920
I thought we broke up.

653
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,360
I don't think

654
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,080
not that deep.

655
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,520
But these two days,

656
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,040
I think something is wrong.

657
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,040
It's like

658
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:25,360
It's empty here.

659
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,680
I mean it.

660
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,800
You like her.

661
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,120
You broke up with that girl surnamed Jung last year.

662
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,160
You never did that.

663
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,360
Really?

664
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,520
Maybe.

665
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,000
If something is uncertain,

666
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,120
go to her.

667
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,920
Find her and ask her.

668
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,040
Back then, your mother and I...

669
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,120
It's not that easy.

670
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,640
Why not?

671
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,840
How are her parents?

672
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,680
They're all in their hometown.

673
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,600
That's easy.

674
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,320
Her parents are here.

675
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,120
Just like what's written in the novel.

676
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,920
First of all, I'm not their enemy.

677
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,320
When I was young,

678
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,120
when I was young.

679
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,800
You're not siblings, are you?

680
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,320
Dad.

681
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,440
Let me finish.

682
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,280
Besides,

683
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,640
there's no big problem.

684
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:42,560
And I think

685
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,080
your three views are quite suitable.

686
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,640
Since there's no problem,

687
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,760
it's just a fight.

688
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,240
It's just a little fun.

689
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,360
Dad, listen to me.

690
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,080
Can you listen to me?

691
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,960
Love is between two people.

692
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,960
It's not up to her.

693
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,000
I don't care if you use soft

694
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:01,760
or hard.

695
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,480
Anyway, try it.

696
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,240
If you don’t understand this,

697
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,160
let alone my son,
