1
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,199
Who allowed you to sit here?

2
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,720
Why are you crying?

3
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,840
I used to sell some clothes

4
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,040
I sold a few clothes

5
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,360
after selling a few clothes.

6
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,079
Let's go eat.

7
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,400
Boss.

8
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,600
Do you think

9
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,240
I'm just a bully.

10
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,560
He looks fine normally.

11
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,480
You have to be serious.

12
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,560
In the big scene,

13
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,560
I can't control it.

14
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,280
The slides are ugly too.

15
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,440
You stutter on the stage.

16
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,560
If Tina didn't help me today,

17
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,760
I would have ruined everything.

18
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,320
I think you haven't learned your lesson.

19
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,760
You made such a mess

20
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,960
last time.

21
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,040
You didn't learn this time.

22
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,320
I thought

23
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,920
made a very professional plan.

24
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,000
You didn't ask me to interrogate you.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,040
You just want the seller to listen?

26
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,120
Who do you think you are?

27
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,640
I thought this mission

28
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,280
is an assessment for us.

29
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,840
There's no saying no in the rules.

30
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,120
you can do it.

31
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,640
Did I tell you not to ask for help?

32
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,480
I want to live longer in the company.

33
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,560
besides obeying orders,

34
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,040
you need to learn to manage your superior.

35
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,280
Not every request

36
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,680
you have to do it unconditionally.

37
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,800
For a salesman,

38
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,320
you are a general and they are soldiers.

39
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,920
If you want them to complete the promotion mission,

40
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,560
we have to satisfy

41
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,680
all their requests.

42
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,280
Otherwise, it will be

43
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,360
like just now.

44
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,440
Boss,

45
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,680
can I ask you

46
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,960
ask the technical department

47
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,720
to ensure that every store

48
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,200
in this week.

49
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,200
Sure.

50
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,160
I want to apply for a promotion budget.

51
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,040
Can you give us another 4 million?

52
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,360
No way. One million at most.

53
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,160
Boss, please.

54
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,160
I can agree to your request,

55
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,480
or deny your expectations.

56
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,600
Be realistic, little girl.

57
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,200
What I want is a donkey that can work.

58
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,560
Not Lin Daiyu

59
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,800
who vomits blood.

60
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,280
No matter how beautiful the illusions are,

61
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,400
can you get rid of any inventory for the seller?

62
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,880
If you can help them

63
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,920
complete the promotion mission,

64
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,520
Do they have to hate you?

65
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,680
I see.

66
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,120
Thank you, boss.

67
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,320
I'll treat you to tofu pudding later.

68
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,320
Jessie.

69
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,840
Do you have any?

70
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,000
the sales statistics

71
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,960
of each store last year.

72
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,360
Yes.

73
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,400
Here.

74
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,240
Thank you.

75
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:42,720
That's right. You're a genius, aren't you?

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,520
Others are more talented than me.

77
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,680
They're on the starting line earlier than me.

78
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,280
So what?

79
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,360
It depends on the result.

80
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,880
whether you can stay in May.

81
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,320
in May

82
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,840
is how many tasks

83
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,120
for the seller, Ke Ke.

84
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,480
You should eat first.

85
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,760
I don't have time.

86
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,240
Boss.

87
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,640
I want to go to the rainbow shop this afternoon

88
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,480
and Binjiang.

89
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,440
and the manager.

90
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,480
their requirements for promotion.

91
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,280
You've been thinking about this

92
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,160
You came up with this?

93
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,840
The reflex is too long.

94
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,520
The crueler your mouth is, the more painful your heart is.

95
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,080
I found your pattern.

96
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,920
Why did you only give Ding Yike

97
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,000
Why did you only give Ding Yike

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,800
for Ding Yike?

99
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,480
Do you like her?

100
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,640
I was right.

101
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,360
To compete for favor?

102
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,360
I'll be frank.

103
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,560
Vinegar is bad for your health.

104
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,920
Okay, thank you.

105
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,440
I know better now.

106
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,160
You're welcome.

107
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,600
The previous promotion

108
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,320
the headquarters always gave out indicators.

109
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,480
and just let it go.

110
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,000
At this time, you can listen to us.

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,360
Of course we cooperate.

112
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,040
Who would feel sorry for money?

113
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,120
Yes.

114
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,320
And about the franchise store,

115
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,520
Don't worry.

116
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,880
I'll set up a party tomorrow night

117
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,760
and ask some vendors to come over for dinner.

118
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,880
We can

119
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,360
get to know each other.

120
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,360
things will be easier.

121
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,440
That's right.

122
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,120
Great.

123
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
Don't worry.

124
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,560
When the public account

125
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,720
for promotion,

126
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,440
I will put the rainbow shop and Binjiang

127
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,200
at the front.

128
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,159
That's great.

129
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,400
Great. Thank you.

130
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,480
You're welcome.

131
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,360
I'm hungry after talking for so long.

132
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,880
Shall we order?

133
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,040
Sure, let's go.

134
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,920
Let's go together.

135
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,360
What do you want to eat?

136
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,400
It's my treat today.

137
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,280
Sure.

138
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,560
I heard their pasta

139
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,280
is very delicious.

140
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,720
Two pasta.

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,520
Okay. Okay.

142
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,040
What about you? It's here. It's here. It's here.

143
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,280
Look.

144
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,400
Isn't that Patrick Cho?

145
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,480
You know him?

146
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,680
Of course.

147
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,960
There are many designers

148
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,520
in the four fashion week.

149
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,320
But

150
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,800
who won

151
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,160
is him.

152
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,640
He's a fashion designer.

153
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,560
He even had a show in the top four.

154
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,520
That's amazing.

155
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,000
No matter what,

156
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,200
as the most famous Chinese designer

157
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,200
in the four fashion week,

158
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,920
Zhao Moyuan’s shop.

159
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,159
are all worth looking forward to.

160
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,080
Who's a psycho?

161
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,440
You want to steal the edition?

162
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,120
Buy some at least.

163
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,680
and come to the shop to copy.

164
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,480
Do you want more?

165
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,240
What do you want?

166
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,840
Come at me!

167
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,120
How dare you

168
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,159
to my company?

169
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,000
Shut up.

170
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,160
Thank you.

171
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:12,560
What have I done?

172
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,560
No, I have to apologize to him.

173
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,640
Excuse me.

174
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,520
Excuse me.

175
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Hello?

176
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,360
Mr. Zhao.

177
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,360
What are you doing?

178
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,200
Do you want to kill me?

179
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,320
It's you.

180
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,080
I thought you were a thief.

181
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,280
Stop laughing. You're the thief.

182
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,200
Who let you in?

183
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,440
Get out!

184
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,240
I find you are a jinx.

185
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,640
Whoever encounters it will be unlucky.

186
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,880
I'm just being brave.

187
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,360
Where is Mr. Zhao?

188
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,360
How dare you ask?

189
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Look.

190
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,320
You caused the dust in this room.

191
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,440
Momo has asthma.

192
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,160
He couldn't take it last night.

193
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,440
He's still in hospital for observation today.

194
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,360
What should I

195
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,480
pack up for him?

196
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,080
Let me tell you.

197
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,800
He did nothing good.

198
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,760
How much did he help you?

199
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,400
Is this how you repay him?

200
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,360
If anything happens to him,

201
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,200
I don't care if you're a girl or not,

202
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,320
I won't forgive you.

203
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,560
Get out.

204
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,080
I'm packing.

205
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,080
Let's go.

206
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,120
Sorry.

207
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,200
What are you doing?

208
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,760
I didn't know

209
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,920
Oh-wol's clothes

210
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,040
was copied by Mr. Zhao.

211
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,960
I even called him a copycat.

212
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,560
and ruined your opening ceremony.

213
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,280
And now he's in the hospital.

214
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,120
Seriously.

215
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,920
This is all I have.

216
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,360
Please give it to Mr. Zhao for me.

217
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,920
As for the other losses,

218
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,800
As long as you tell me the number,

219
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,720
No matter how much it is, I'll accept it.

220
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,920
How arrogant.

221
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,560
How can you accept a few million?

222
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What?

223
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,840
I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it.

224
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,160
Fine.

225
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,240
What do you think?

226
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,960
With your poor salary,

227
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:02,960
a month

228
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,200
is not enough for a piece of clothes here.

229
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,480
Yes.

230
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,880
I can go to the new media.

231
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,360
I'll take a reality show.

232
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,960
and make that funny video.

233
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,720
I'm the champion

234
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,400
the champion of men and women.

235
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,480
Still

236
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,160
half a cool KOL.

237
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,320
Think of a way. There must be one.

238
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,200
Trust me.

239
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,200
That's enough. I'm not the real master.

240
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,400
Why are you apologizing to me?

241
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,480
Tell him yourself

242
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,400
when he gets discharged.

243
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,640
Take the money for me.

244
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,920
Consider it

245
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,520
for Mr. Zhao.

246
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,400
Okay.

247
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,760
Take it. I don't have time.

248
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,040
Take it

249
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,040
Take it.

250
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,280
I don't have time.

251
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,000
I have an interview later.

252
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,640
It's okay.

253
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,560
Take the money first.

254
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,320
Hold on. I need to take this.

255
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,320
Hello?

256
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,160
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,760
I'm stuck on the outside.

258
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,400
Half an hour.

259
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,520
I'll be there in half an hour.

260
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,440
Tell Zhi Lin.

261
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,520
I’m really sorry.

262
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:10,960
Okay

263
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,760
I'll be right there.

264
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:13,880
Well,

265
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,040
Are you in a hurry?

266
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,920
Why don't I deliver this for you?

267
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,760
Where is the hospital?

268
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,120
I'm very experienced in nursing.

269
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,600
Zhao Moyuan, IV.

270
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,880
Okay.

271
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,680
Come on.

272
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,440
Shake your fist.

273
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,480
Sorry.

274
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,520
I might have to do it again.

275
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,120
Okay.

276
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,440
It's wrapped.

277
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,040
Retract the needle. Let me do it.

278
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,520
Sorry.

279
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,480
She's new here. She's not very skilled.

280
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,440
It's okay. Let her do it.

281
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,960
A new nurse has to be a veteran.

282
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,480
It's better

283
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,320
It's better than using the kids and the old lady. Right?

284
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:04,800
Right?

285
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,840
I'm fine.

286
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,000
I should

287
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,160
until the fourth injection.

288
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,160
You haven't eaten for a long time, right?

289
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,760
That's why the blood vessel is a bit stiff.

290
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,120
Ask your family

291
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,040
to bring you some pears, wooden ears

292
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,320
and braised duck with radish.

293
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,560
The soup is good for your lungs

294
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,520
Okay.

295
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,560
The media is so annoying.

296
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,240
Look.

297
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,480
He's a very handsome and good designer.

298
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,520
I was photographed like this.

299
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,640
If not,

300
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,120
You didn't know him before.

301
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Delivery.

302
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,440
Please register over there.

303
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,280
I'm not here to deliver food.

304
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,720
I'm here to see a patient.

305
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,360
Wait a minute.

306
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,240
Get well soon.

307
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,520
Moyuan.

308
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,480
Moyuan.

309
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,960
Moyuan.

310
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,400
Moyuan.

311
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,320
How can we meet here?

312
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,080
Moyuan.

313
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,800
Uncle Liu, you're here.

314
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,480
It's really you.

315
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,400
This...

316
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,760
Why are you here?

317
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,720
Did you have asthma again?

318
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,320
How long have you been here?

319
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
No, I'm fine.

320
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,320
How can I be fine?

321
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,480
You're dressed like this.

322
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,440
You had this problem when you were young.

323
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,200
You must rest.

324
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,280
The environment here is not good.

325
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,000
Let me get you a new hospital.

326
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,160
No need. You're from a good family.

327
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,760
I'll make a call.

328
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,560
I'm going to call him.

329
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,400
I said no.

330
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,200
Look, I'm going to call you.

331
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,200
You're my dad's driver.

332
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,360
Can you leave it alone?

333
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,120
Go back now.

334
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,080
Don't tell my dad about this.

335
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,480
Once he finds out,

336
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,440
when he had a heart attack,

337
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,000
the factory will really belong to me.

338
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,640
Look, do you really have to

339
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,400
drive for me?

340
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,080
Go back.

341
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,360
I understand that you're worried about Mr. Zhao.

342
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,280
But you can't just eat instant noodles

343
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,920
You can't just eat instant noodles.

344
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,040
Ramyeon is good

345
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,880
That's right Why would we eat instant noodles

346
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,840
Someone sent us so many delicious food.

347
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,200
Is she your girlfriend or your fan?

348
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,560
Did you see that?

349
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,160
See?

350
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,960
I'm doing well.

351
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,000
I've been received food.

352
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,200
Why is she new?

353
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,640
It's all your fault if you fail.

354
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,560
No, no, no.

355
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,160
Let's go.

356
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:58,920
This...

357
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:02,920
Okay.

358
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,400
Who are you?

359
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,760
Are you okay?

360
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,680
Don't come near me!

361
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,000
You...

362
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,960
Why are you here?

363
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,359
Mr. Zhao, calm down.

364
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,800
Qian can't come because of something urgent.

365
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,280
I want to apologize to you.

366
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,200
So I volunteered to come.

367
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,840
I'm sorry.

368
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,280
Are you okay?

369
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,800
You...

370
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,920
About the copying,

371
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm a pig.

372
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,680
How dare you treat Li Kui as a ghost?

373
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,320
And about the floor smashing,

374
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,480
was my fault.

375
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,640
You had asthma.

376
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,200
I'm sorry.

377
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,640
Let me take a photo for you.

378
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,280
No.

379
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,600
Are you okay?

380
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,120
I'm warning you.

381
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,560
Can you stay away from me from now on?

382
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,840
Bed 27.

383
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,400
No matter how angry he is,

384
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,080
you can't

385
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,120
in the hospital.

386
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,920
I didn't. I'm not his family.

387
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,880
I know you.

388
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,560
You're the champion of men and women.

389
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,320
You were dumped by your boyfriend.

390
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,040
The ex you mentioned on TV.

391
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,200
Is it him?

392
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,240
Not me.

393
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,160
I have nothing to do with her.

394
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,680
Why?

395
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,920
Just fight.

396
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,320
Why did you say those hurtful words?

397
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,720
That's right. Isn't she

398
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,160
is pretty.

399
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,480
My wife is her fan.

400
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,120
Shut up!

401
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,040
Miss,

402
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,440
I've received your apology.

403
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
Happy?

404
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,640
Please take these

405
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,720
with these things.

406
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,560
If you really feel

407
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,200
in your heart,

408
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,720
Please

409
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,600
stay away from me?

410
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,480
I really think

411
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,040
we are not compatible.

412
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,160
I'm sincerely here to apologize.

413
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,960
Why don't you take a rest?

414
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,880
No, Mr. Zhao.

415
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,040
Please take a rest.

416
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,240
Have a rest.

417
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,280
Let me help you.

418
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,840
I'm sorry.

419
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,240
Little girl.

420
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,680
I was too loud just now.

421
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,680
Did I scare you?

422
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,280
You'd better not drink.

423
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,440
I'm not bothering you.

424
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,960
You just lost that scalp.

425
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,720
You'd better not drink.

426
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,800
Otherwise, the double sulfur will react.

427
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,160
People will die if it gets serious.

428
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,920
I'm not scaring you.

429
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,040
Check your phone if you don't believe me.

430
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,840
How do you know this?

431
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,000
My mom used to go to the hospital a lot.

432
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I heard it from the doctor.

433
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,040
My mom used to go to hospital often.

434
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,560
Why are you still here?

435
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,000
Stay here.

436
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,680
Hard to soak and open the stone.

437
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,040
No.

438
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,960
Isn't it the evening peak?

439
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,480
I can't get in the car even if I go out.

440
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,800
Just stay here a little longer.

441
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,760
Right?

442
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,880
If I don't forgive you,

443
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,440
what would you do?

444
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,800
Take your time.

445
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,680
My man...

446
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,240
A friend of mine once told me

447
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,480
a meaningful apology is divided into two steps.

448
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,920
One, admit the truth without excuses.

449
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,080
Two, come up with an actual solution.

450
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,040
I'll confess to you first.

451
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,720
I'll try to make it up to you later.

452
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,600
Anyway, it's been a long time

453
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,560
after a long time,

454
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,240
you will feel my sincerity.

455
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,680
How will you compensate me?

456
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,320
Go to the reality show.

457
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,800
and get a bonus.

458
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,400
It's possible.

459
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,680
This is the only part that makes a lot of money.

460
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,240
I just contacted

461
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,120
with my editor.

462
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:23,960
He said

463
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,440
there is a survival show in the wilderness.

464
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,520
It's very popular.

465
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,120
And the bonus is very high.

466
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,320
Come on. Survival in the wilderness.

467
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,520
If someone like you

468
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,440
If I give you a stick,

469
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,000
I'll let you beat the wild dog and the boar.

470
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,880
Can you do it?

471
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,240
It's not necessarily impossible.

472
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,040
When I was cheated

473
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
to scam the deposit,

474
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,840
I really used a brick.

475
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,400
Why do you use bricks

476
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
so smooth?

477
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,760
You're an expert.

478
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,720
Don't make fun of me.

479
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,400
Okay.

480
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,880
Anyway,

481
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,120
you saved my life just now.

482
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,680
We're even now.

483
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,000
Bye.

484
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,000
Wait.

485
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,200
Have you had dinner?

486
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,840
I happen to have some dishes

487
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,560
I made them myself.

488
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:07,960
It's delicious.

489
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,800
What dish?

490
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,440
Radish duck soup, wooden fungus yam

491
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,720
and Goji berries and pear soup.

492
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:16,800
And fried rice with egg.

493
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:21,760
Open it.

494
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,000
Okay.

495
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,280
Here, take a look.

496
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,240
It's cold

497
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,160
There's a microwave in the lobby.

498
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
Why are you laughing?

499
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:49,920
Nothing.

500
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,960
To be honest, don't be angry.

501
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,800
Say it.

502
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,560
St. Martin's top student.

503
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,640
A famous figure in the international fashion industry.

504
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,960
I got him

505
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,200
to the hospital.

506
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,600
Let me think. I'm a little excited.

507
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,400
You've got some nerve, right?

508
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,840
No, no, no.

509
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,080
A rookie like me

510
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,560
who just entered your fashion circle.

511
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,480
Except our boss Leo,

512
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,520
I've never seen any big shot.

513
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,120
let alone

514
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,680
people like you

515
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,560
I'm too excited. I tend to overthink.

516
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
I'm thinking

517
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,000
maybe one day,

518
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,680
a magazine

519
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,640
When you interview me,

520
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,880
I can also

521
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,920
say something.

522
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,080
I, Ding Yike,

523
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,920
walk on the fashion road,

524
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,680
Although we lived in a pavilion room

525
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,880
there is an international designer

526
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,280
an international designer.

527
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,920
What did the magazine interview you?

528
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,120
I'll sue you for plagiarism.

529
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,560
Are you really going to sue our company?

530
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,160
Maybe.

531
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,840
What? Are you scared?

532
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,600
Are you afraid

533
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,600
your company goes bankrupt,

534
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,480
you have nothing to eat.

535
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,040
I'm a little scared.

536
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,560
But the copyright

537
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,880
is indeed our fault.

538
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,160
It can't be washed.

539
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,760
You have to admit your mistake, right?

540
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,880
It's because you have a good view

541
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,480
because of your good taste.

542
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,120
Pick that up.

543
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,680
Here.

544
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,360
Give me some.

545
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,960
Thank you, boss.

546
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,400
But if you're willing,

547
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,160
you can ask Qian not to post anything.

548
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,560
If things get out of hand, it'll be hard to turn around.

549
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,960
Maybe I can talk to the boss

550
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,760
and ask her to compensate you.

551
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,400
What?

552
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,600
I'm checking if you have grass on your head.

553
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,640
Do you really think

554
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,720
your company would take the initiative

555
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,520
to pay me back?

556
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,320
Wrong.

557
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,680
All fashion companies

558
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,640
can't be helped in this situation.

559
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,480
It's hard to tell

560
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,440
is very hard to tell.

561
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,440
There are only two choices in this situation.

562
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,760
First, endure it.

563
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,520
Second,

564
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,720
Fight to the end.

565
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,920
and make them bleed.

566
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,040
It's okay.

567
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,520
my design

568
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,920
was registered by me.

569
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:18,640
Let's go.

570
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,240
What are you doing?

571
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,720
Hurry up! Hurry up! Pants! Pants!

572
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,320
What are you doing?

573
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,080
He has a stomachache.

574
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,200
Which subject is he reading?

575
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,720
Ex-boyfriend.

576
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,760
How did you know?

577
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,920
He cheated on me. Why are you guilty?

578
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,240
I'm not guilty.

579
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,800
I'm just not wearing makeup now.

580
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,200
You look better even without makeup.

581
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,920
Really?

582
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:44,840
What are you doing?

583
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,680
No, no, come out.

584
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,040
No no come out

585
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,600
I'm not doing this for me.

586
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,360
I just don't want to make things difficult for Lin Sixian.

587
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,240
The last time we met,

588
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,120
he was already embarrassed enough.

589
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,600
Aren't you

590
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,760
on purpose?

591
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,240
I beg you.

592
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,800
No, no, no.

593
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,840
He's a good-looking man.

594
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:00,960
Ding Yike.

595
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,960
Ding Yike.

596
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,240
Yike, do you hear me?

597
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,280
Do you hear me?

598
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,080
It's me.

599
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,480
What a coincidence. You are here too.

600
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,760
Yes, what a coincidence.

601
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
Why are you here?

602
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,680
He doesn't feel well lately.

603
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,760
so I came with him.

604
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,320
Really?

605
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,440
Why are you here alone?

606
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Don't you have anyone with you?

607
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,680
Right.

608
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,120
She's here to accompany me.

609
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,520
She's going to be hospitalized soon.

610
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,640
You too.

611
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
I told you.

612
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,480
We won't cook today. Let's eat outside.

613
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,600
Why did you make so many dishes for me?

614
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,480
But I should be luckier than you.

615
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,560
It's you.

616
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,520
It's me. What's wrong? Let's go.

617
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,440
Let's go.

618
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
What's wrong?

619
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,520
I'm leaving.

620
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,160
Who are you?

621
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,600
You can pull her in the middle of the night.

622
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
None of your business.

623
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,680
Don't pull me. Don't look back. Do you hear me?

624
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,400
Stop!

625
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,320
I want to get beaten.

626
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,560
Sa Hyun.

627
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,080
What are you doing?

628
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,480
What are you doing?

629
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,040
What's going on?

630
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,680
It's nothing.

631
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,720
Did you know each other before?

632
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
Turn around.

633
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,840
Turn around and see if anyone is following us.

634
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,160
No.

635
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
You hit him?

636
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,800
What? You want to avenge him?

637
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,240
Why?

638
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,840
The fund he made cheated me of money.

639
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,080
Okay.

640
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,000
If you leave this door,

641
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,920
you won't see them.

642
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,600
Understand?

643
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
Let's go. That's it.

644
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,880
Mr. Zhao.

645
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
What now?

646
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,000
That day at the cafe,

647
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,160
you saw us break up.

648
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,200
Yes.

649
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,120
What is it? What is it? It's nothing.

650
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,320
It's nothing. It's just...

651
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,320
I just suddenly realized

652
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,720
why you

653
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,480
you mocked me that day?

654
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,080
I don't know what happened.

655
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,360
But Lin Sixian is the most professional

656
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,560
I've ever met.

657
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,000
I believe he won't lie to you on purpose.

658
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,440
There must be some misunderstanding.

659
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,080
Why are you still defending him now?

660
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,400
I want to reunite with him.

661
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,440
Anyway,

662
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,240
I apologize on his behalf.

663
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,720
About this,

664
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,280
to tell him about this.

665
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,400
Does it have anything to do with you?

666
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,800
He cheated my money.

667
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,880
Why are you apologizing?

668
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,360
Go back now.

669
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,160
Don't be late for delivery tomorrow.

670
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,120
Ah.

671
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,680
Got it, Mr. Zhao.

672
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:26,720
What?

673
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,560
You fought with others before?

674
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,840
No.

675
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,560
That guy is crazy. Ignore him.

676
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,200
Okay.

677
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,120
Really?

678
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,080
You seem to care about Ms Ding.

679
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,240
You two used to be close, right?

680
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,600
Not bad.

681
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,120
Recently in the university group,

682
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,400
that she's not doing well.

683
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,960
I ran into her at the hospital.

684
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,360
I have to take care of him.

685
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:54,840
Right?

686
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,880
You care so much about others.

687
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,880
I'm jealous.

688
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,960
You didn't even pay for breaking up with a girl.

689
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,200
How unmanly.

690
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,360
Okay, thank you.

691
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,240
How much?

692
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,040
Hello, sir. 188 yuan in total.

693
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,120
Okay.

694
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,560
Wait a minute.

695
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,240
Wenwen.

696
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,160
I have something to do.

697
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,200
I'll pick you up.

698
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,920
I miss you too.

699
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:45,800
Bye.

700
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,520
You're quite busy.

701
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,560
None of your business.

702
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,640
What did you say?

703
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,480
It's none of your business. Don't you understand?

704
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,480
Can you speak English?

705
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,320
I can say something too.

706
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,760
It has nothing to do with me.

707
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,200
but it's too tasteless.

708
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,160
Understand?

709
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:16,920
Breaking up with a girl

710
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,120
Do you have to find a public place

711
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,160
in public?

712
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,720
What's going on?

713
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,040
Don't fight. Let's talk.

714
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,760
He's in finance.

715
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,720
Private fund.

716
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,320
You're the best liar.

717
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,840
You're crazy.

718
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,040
What? Haven't you slept enough?

719
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,520
Last night,

720
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,240
my mom called me

721
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,640
for two hours.

722
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,160
You want money, force me to marry you.

723
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,240
Or do you think you're a loser?

724
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,520
All parents are the same.

725
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,600
I've experienced everything you've experienced.

726
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,600
You need to thank God.

727
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,440
I'm glad they called.

728
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,800
They're just complaining.

729
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,080
not to tell you they are sick.

730
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,040
That makes sense.

731
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,920
Relax later.

732
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,560
Among these dealers,

733
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,680
Mr. Liu from Qunhua is quite easy to talk.

734
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,360
I'll deal with the Imperial Garment and you take Qunhua.

735
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,520
and take these two Castle down.

736
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,400
It'll be easy to assign

737
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,080
will be easy to distribute.

738
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,440
Okay.

739
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,080
The 21st floor is here.

740
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,480
I'll get off first. Good luck.

741
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,320
Sorry.

742
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,600
The 22nd floor is here.

743
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,320
Mr. Liu, I have several plans.

744
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,560
You can take a good look.

745
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:22,880
And this one.

746
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,800
This is

747
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,240
this time.

748
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,400
If you can't handle it, let me do it.

749
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,400
No.

750
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,960
I'll try again tomorrow.

751
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,000
I can't say anything nice.

752
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,120
What kind of deity is Tina?

753
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,040
Why can she do it every time?

754
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Why can't I?

755
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,000
I heard she promised to help

756
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
for the loan.

757
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,400
When she was in Gangnam,

758
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,679
she had a good relationship with the bank.

759
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,120
No wonder.

760
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,760
But where can I

761
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,159
find such a relationship?

762
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,840
The manager of Binjiang said

763
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,880
have a dinner tomorrow night?

764
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,360
Be smart then.

765
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,280
I might become you next time.

766
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,560
I'm trying to get along with you by eating.

767
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,560
I think

768
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,719
I don't think so.

769
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,320
I'm more miserable than you today.

770
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,760
During the regular meeting of the Purchase Department,

771
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,360
Leo made us

772
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,280
and two Buddhas were born.

773
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,440
Now,

774
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,760
buying hands is her daughter.

775
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,120
Our Purchase Department has been picked up.

776
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,000
The worst is Guo Youming.

777
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,240
Li Ronghao: Leo did it. Li Ronghao: They did it. Li Ronghao: They did it.

778
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,680
I found that their team

779
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,360
didn't follow the new rules

780
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,360
with more than three suppliers.

781
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,920
Inform the Administration Department directly

782
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,080
to demote him

783
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,600
to T5.

784
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,360
Wasn't he Mr. Du's secretary?

785
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,520
The boss didn't show any respect.

786
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,680
Make a reservation at once.

787
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,440
We'll have a meeting in half an hour.

788
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,000
The meeting room has been bought.

789
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,960
All booked.

790
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,120
All booked this week

791
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,040
Go grab it if you're done

792
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,120
Did they fart when buying hands?

793
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,440
Are you all acting?

794
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,240
What is this?

795
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,080
He's everywhere.

796
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,960
Ignore him.

797
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,160
I don't have time for him.

798
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,200
I was just saying.

799
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,320
All I think about is promotion.

800
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,720
Guru.

801
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,600
Do you have any good suggestions

802
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,520
about promotion?

803
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,560
I don't have grass on my head.

804
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,800
You have two pig ears.

805
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,280
You said you were a pig the day before yesterday.

806
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,960
I think it's true.

807
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,920
Do you really think

808
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,720
to help those villages

809
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:32,280
I designed?

810
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,400
You're right.

811
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,520
But we'll change it.

812
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,360
Leo is our boss.

813
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,000
She...

814
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,800
She spent so much effort

815
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,000
to clean the inventory

816
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,560
to transform May.

817
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,160
She said

818
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,920
the designers of our company

819
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,520
can't be a copycat anymore.

820
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,920
I can't rely on borrowing anymore.

821
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,280
Really.

822
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,120
Oh

823
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,080
Really?

824
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,560
We made up.

825
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,360
No.

826
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,560
We're just neighbors.

827
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,040
We came to deliver food.

828
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,720
Oh.

829
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,600
Mr. Zhao.

830
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,600
What else do you want to eat tomorrow?

831
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,320
I'm not eating tomorrow.

832
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,120
I'll be discharged tomorrow.

833
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:27,680
Oh, right.

834
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,480
Excuse me.

835
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,040
Take these back for me.

836
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:31,840
Oh.

837
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,520
Okay, no problem.

838
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,760
As long as you're happy.

839
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,880
Little girl.

840
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,160
Here.

841
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,720
I'll put a flower on you.

842
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,120
It's so pretty.

843
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,040
Thank you

844
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,880
You're welcome.

845
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,160
Mr. Zhao, I’m leaving.

846
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,880
It's useless to just give others benefits.

847
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,600
We have to drag them into a pit.

848
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,440
What did you say?

849
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,680
Game guide.

850
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,080
It's no use just giving people benefits.

851
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,560
We have to drag them into a pit.

852
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,040
Game strategy.

853
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,760
Hello, Mr. Liu.

854
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,560
Ding, what's wrong with you?

855
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,280
Are you threatening me?

856
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,960
I told you it's not that I don't want to help.

857
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,040
The market is really bad this year.

858
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,160
We thought

859
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:18,080
we would be lucky

860
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,320
in May.

861
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,920
The headquarters doubled the task.

862
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,160
We are not deities.

863
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,880
Of course not, Mr. Liu.

864
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,080
You've been honest with me this afternoon.

865
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,080
After thinking about it,

866
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,000
I think I need to tell you the truth.

867
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,880
In May, Lingyun bought it.

868
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,600
Everything is changing now.

869
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,120
On the surface,

870
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,680
it's about the 51 promotion.

871
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,680
But in fact, they want to take the opportunity

872
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,800
to simplify the sales team

873
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,520
If you don't cooperate,

874
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,920
Isn't that a realistic reason?

875
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,880
If you are in trouble,

876
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,880
I won't force you.

877
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,640
But your contract with May...

878
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
I heard that

879
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,200
the three seasons will expire.

880
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,280
Okay, Mr. Liu.

881
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,600
Okay.

882
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,400
Okay, bye.

883
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,040
Everyone has different faces.

884
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,520
As time goes by,

885
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,160
one by one

886
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,560
from the sand.

887
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,800
Zhao Moyuan, the first one is annoying.

888
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,680
The second one is cool.

889
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,920
The third one is very warm.

890
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,760
What about you? Do you think

891
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,960
my face is a bit weird?

892
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,040
You're lying again.

893
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,080
and threatening me.

894
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,600
Whatever.

895
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,800
I didn't hurt anyone.

896
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,960
or lying.

897
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,720
And it feels like eating chicken all the way.

898
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,440
It feels so good.

899
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,480
Done.

900
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,880
Ding Yike.

901
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,120
Mr. Liu from Qunhua.

902
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,360
called to complain about you.

903
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,280
saying you threatened him.

904
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,400
I can explain.

905
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,120
No need to explain.

906
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,120
I only care about results.

907
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:00,880
not the process.

908
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,360
How about this one?

909
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,280
The overall design is not bad.

910
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,080
The embroidery is too complicated.

911
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,080
The cost is too high.

912
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,320
I'm afraid the production base will complain.

913
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:14,720
Good.

914
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,440
Keep your strong attitude.

915
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,760
and fight for it.

916
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,840
I'm behind you. Don't worry.

917
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,680
Thank you, boss.

918
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,760
I think she's just lucky.

919
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,000
Stop talking. Get back to work.

920
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,480
What's their relationship?

921
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,680
Look at her.

922
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,880
We were scolded, but she

923
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,600
Qunhua was taken down.

924
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,640
The small dealers down there also obeyed.

925
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,080
Of course she should keep smiling.

926
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,920
Tina, you're the best.

927
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,920
You chose her as your partner.

928
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,080
Your task is almost done, right?

929
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,800
One or two more.

930
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,480
Tina, come on.

931
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,320
Don't let Ding Yike beat you.
