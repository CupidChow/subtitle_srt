1
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,240
Sure.

2
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,079
[The number you have dialled is not available.]

3
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,440
[Please try again later.]

4
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
With all due respect,

5
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,880
it didn't work

6
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,079
your design

7
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,760
is not your usual level.

8
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,440
Patrick.

9
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,320
I remember it was in this area.

10
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,160
Where did it go?

11
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,400
Let me help you.

12
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,560
Thank you.

13
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,360
You're welcome.

14
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,520
What a coincidence. We meet again.

15
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,920
I've been

16
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,240
for the past few months.

17
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,200
It's a probability that you bumped into me.

18
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,000
Really? You're a designer?

19
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,480
No, just purchasing.

20
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,920
Why? You seem upset.

21
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,720
No.

22
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,800
I'm looking for

23
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,000
a bronze glutinous silk.

24
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,480
I used to have it here.

25
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,800
I heard it was paid by a client today.

26
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,200
It won't be displayed anymore.

27
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,200
Do you mean

28
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,480
Is it the pure colour

29
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,160
It's very unique.

30
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,840
You know.

31
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,040
Let me ask

32
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,320
the demo of our company.

33
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,720
I think I've seen this before.

34
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,760
Wait.

35
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,920
I'll ask him for you, right?

36
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,560
Thank you.

37
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,040
We're in the same field. We should help each other.

38
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,760
Hey.

39
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,840
Press her down now.

40
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,280
I'll find you a picture

41
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,680
on the Internet.

42
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,320
I'll fix the code

43
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,040
and send it to you.

44
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,200
Is this okay?

45
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,720
Why not?

46
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,880
She's a rookie. She doesn't understand at all.

47
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,880
I can't tell.

48
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,680
I see. Okay.

49
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,720
How is it?

50
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,000
Take a look. Is it this one?

51
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh.

52
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,520
Yes, this is it.

53
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,480
Do you have one in your company?

54
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,880
We have a demo.

55
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,400
I can give you the phone number of the vendor.

56
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,880
Just contact him.

57
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
Sure.

58
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,240
Let me write it down.

59
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,040
Write down his number.

60
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:03,680
Okay.

61
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,280
I remember their company

62
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,840
in an industrial park nearby.

63
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,000
You can go to him directly.

64
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,440
What a coincidence.

65
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,440
Okay, I'll call him right away.

66
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,840
Hello?

67
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,720
Hello.

68
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,880
Are you Mr. Yu?

69
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,680
Yes.

70
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,480
Hello.

71
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,080
I'm looking for a fabric.

72
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,520
Are you looking for the number?

73
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,680
Wait. I need to check the inventory.

74
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,240
Hold on.

75
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,840
Why is it gone?

76
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,840
Here.

77
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,680
It's here.

78
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,840
But it's not a coincidence now.

79
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,080
I'm at

80
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,200
Sunshine Plaza.

81
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,560
I'm here to visit my client.

82
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,160
You're here too.

83
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,800
What a coincidence.

84
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,160
Let me see.

85
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,760
I'll visit the client for half an hour.

86
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,720
In half an hour,

87
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,960
we'll meet at the cafe

88
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,400
at Sunshine Plaza.

89
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,280
Okay?

90
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,760
Okay.

91
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,560
Okay, bye.

92
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,280
My name card.

93
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,440
Ms Ding, this is mine.

94
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,480
Ms Ding.

95
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,520
Ms Ding has unique eyes.

96
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,040
Our material

97
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,640
just applied for an international patent.

98
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,160
and the real silk

99
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,760
more than 95 percent

100
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,360
more than 95 percent.

101
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,880
It's hard to detect

102
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,760
their differences.

103
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,160
Don't worry about the quality.

104
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,440
It's definitely top-class.

105
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,400
Of course quality is important.

106
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,040
But I care more about the price.

107
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,120
As for the price,

108
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,600
depends on the amount you want.

109
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,480
We have

110
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,880
5,000 meters, single price is 30.

111
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,720
Talk about 10,000 meters later.

112
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,080
Thirty.

113
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,040
It's almost like silk power spinning.

114
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,960
Mr. Yu, if I had the budget,

115
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,520
why would I buy

116
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,920
non-natural fabric?

117
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,640
Ms Ding.

118
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,520
Feel the texture of this material first.

119
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,920
Our material

120
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,520
is

121
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,520
the 23mm silk.

122
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,480
can be

123
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,600
more than 95%.

124
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,160
But the price is only half of it.

125
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,960
I think this cost-effective ratio...

126
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,200
I'll be blunt, Ms Ding.

127
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,120
You can't find

128
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,320
in Asia.

129
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,320
This is indeed a good thing.

130
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,560
But the price

131
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,480
at most,

132
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,080
at most.

133
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,200
23?

134
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,360
I'm afraid

135
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,080
this price.

136
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,120
Mr. Yu, as you know,

137
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,760
we are very strict

138
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,880
the purchase rights.

139
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,160
If the price doesn't work,

140
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,160
Unfortunately,

141
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,280
we can only work together next time.

142
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,560
Sorry.

143
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,800
Waiter, the bill please.

144
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,560
Ms Ding.

145
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,280
Wait.

146
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,280
I'll buy it.

147
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,760
Ms Ding, here's the thing.

148
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,520
We

149
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,120
know very well

150
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,360
in the industry.

151
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
I

152
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,240
sincerely hope

153
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,840
cooperate with May.

154
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,960
As for the price,

155
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,880
about the price.

156
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
Let me tell you the truth.

157
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,880
25.

158
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,440
25. It can't be lower.

159
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,000
Please have a seat.

160
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,360
But the price of 25

161
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,400
can't be exported from us.

162
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,360
We have a Hong Kong Brothers Company.

163
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,880
If they offer it,

164
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,960
the agent price will be higher

165
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,800
than ours.

166
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,680
But can the official smuggling work?

167
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,840
No problem. There's a refund.

168
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,200
The price there is cheaper than here.

169
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,840
It's normal.

170
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,440
As long as you agree,

171
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,320
I'll deal with my boss.

172
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,600
Okay.

173
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,920
As long as the price is good, the goods are the same.

174
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,960
we don't care which supplier.

175
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,280
I should hire someone

176
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,200
in May.

177
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,960
Ms Ding,

178
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,480
I guess you need

179
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,160
you need some typed rice samples.

180
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,520
I'll ask our Hong Kong Brothers Company

181
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,640
to send you some.

182
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,560
Are you sure? After that,

183
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,560
I'll ask my superior for a price.

184
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,680
Okay.

185
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,800
I want rice, silver gray, three meters each.

186
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,240
How long will it take?

187
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,400
Soonfeng mail,

188
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,200
Maybe the day after tomorrow.

189
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,120
I'll send it to your company's address.

190
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:30,840
What do you think?

191
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,480
Sure.

192
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,360
Happy cooperation, Ms Ding.

193
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,120
Happy cooperation.

194
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,760
Happy cooperation.

195
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,720
Happy cooperation.

196
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,440
Is this okay?

197
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,960
Remove the flowers and catch the wood.

198
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,400
Don't worry.

199
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,680
Have you forgotten what I used to do?

200
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,280
The company, position, and name are the same.

201
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,560
It was just a year ago.

202
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,680
Is it handsome?

203
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,760
I found a fabric dealer.

204
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,240
I think it can solve this problem.

205
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,040
What I just sent you is A4.

206
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,160
Tina, can you do it?

207
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,960
Hello, who is it?

208
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,720
Hello, it's me.

209
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,360
Oh.

210
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,000
What is it?

211
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,640
Seeing the dress you designed,

212
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,360
I like it.

213
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,560
Really? Thank you.

214
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,360
But we think

215
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,480
the cost of silk fabric you use is too high.

216
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,800
It may not be suitable for making clothes.

217
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,440
I've talked to Leo about that.

218
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,200
Eric is looking for

219
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,000
to replace the fabric.

220
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,280
Here's the thing.

221
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,920
I found a bronze droplets.

222
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
It's highly authentic and the price is good.

223
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,080
You can see

224
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,280
as a replacement.

225
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,360
Sure.

226
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,120
Where are you? I'll go find you now.

227
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,760
No need.

228
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,720
Tell me where you are.

229
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,040
I'll just give it to you.

230
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,240
You don't want to see me that much?

231
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,320
We'll still be friends.

232
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,880
That's what you said that day.

233
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,680
Don't get me wrong.

234
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,160
I've been tired lately.

235
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,520
I finally got some rest.

236
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,080
You don't have to come here.

237
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,880
I just left the studio.

238
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,520
It's on the motorcycle. It's not troublesome at all.

239
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,680
Forget it.

240
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,960
I don't know when

241
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
when I can go back.

242
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,400
I'll contact you later.

243
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,200
Ding Yike.

244
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,280
Why are you always so awkward?

245
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,000
Is it fun?

246
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,240
What's wrong with meeting?

247
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,600
I'm going to eat you.

248
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,280
Who's uncomfortable? Don't button your hat.

249
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,320
I'm at the Fabrics Library.

250
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,160
It'll take more than an hour.

251
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,960
I'll give you two choices.

252
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,560
You either stay where you are

253
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,360
Wait for me to pick you up.

254
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,120
or I'll wait for you at a distance.

255
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,120
Zhao Moyuan.

256
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,360
Can you stop being so bossy?

257
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,560
You're the bossy one.

258
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,200
When we were together,

259
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,400
together.

260
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,160
When we broke up,

261
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,440
you said it alone?

262
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,120
You pretended to be rational.

263
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,160
You're the one who broke up.

264
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,120
Do you have evidence?

265
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,720
I sent that message.

266
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,080
But I sent it by mistake.

267
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,880
I sent it and withdrew it.

268
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,680
Zhao Moyuan, you are a rascal.

269
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,520
You're the rogue.

270
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,880
Hello?

271
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,640
Zhao Moyuan.

272
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,920
Who else?

273
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,160
Calm down.

274
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,160
Hello, Qian. Where are you?

275
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,240
Moyuan, Moyuan may have had a car accident.

276
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,640
I don't know.

277
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,720
He said

278
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,400
It's near the studio.

279
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,480
Okay.

280
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,280
Excuse me.

281
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,040
Excuse me.

282
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,280
Excuse me.

283
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,080
there is a patient called Zhao Moyuan today.

284
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,680
Which room is he in?

285
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,640
Let me check.

286
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,240
Please hurry.

287
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,960
732.

288
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,480
732. Okay.

289
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,560
You're here.

290
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,760
How did it go?

291
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,840
It flew a dozen meters away. What do you think?

292
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,080
I hope it's nothing serious now.

293
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,400
We don't know when he'll wake up.

294
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,000
When he wakes up,

295
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,000
ask him and the doctor yourself.

296
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,120
By the way, I'm going to pay the bill.

297
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
Watch out for me.

298
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,840
Okay, go ahead.

299
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,320
Zhao Moyuan.

300
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,760
Get up!

301
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
Aren't you that great?

302
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,400
Aren't you so overbearing?

303
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,640
Get up and fight with me.

304
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,040
We haven't finished talking.

305
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,480
Why are you lying down like this?

306
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,920
What about your Partric series?

307
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,600
What about Leo?

308
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,240
What should I do?

309
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,440
Zhao Moyuan.

310
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,600
Mo Yuan.

311
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,520
Zhao Moyuan!

312
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,880
Wake up!

313
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,360
Wake up, Zhao Moyuan.

314
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,480
You have to wake up.

315
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,200
I'll promise you anything, okay?

316
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,800
You said that.

317
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,440
You're so pretty.

318
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,520
No.

319
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,560
You're awake.

320
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,680
I'm awake.

321
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:34,360
Of course I am.

322
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,600
You're crying and making a scene.

323
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,400
rubbing and rubbing. How can I not wake up?

324
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,520
You can move.

325
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,920
Of course I can.

326
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,360
What? You want me to stay still?

327
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,440
Do you think I'm disabled

328
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,480
or a vegetative?

329
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,520
I told you to watch less dramas.

330
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,560
Come on, help me.

331
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,640
Well,

332
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,840
Didn't Qian say you don't know

333
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,360
when will you wake up?

334
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,720
Yes, I flew over ten meters away.

335
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,680
Where did you get hurt?

336
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,320
I'm seriously injured.

337
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,560
Look.

338
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,920
My left leg is fractured.

339
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,040
Isn't it amazing?

340
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,160
It hurts when you put the clapper on.

341
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,600
I asked

342
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,920
a nurse

343
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:22,800
that painkiller.

344
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,880
Then I fell asleep.

345
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,360
Qian definitely didn't know

346
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,640
when I woke up, right?

347
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,800
I'm thirsty now. I want some water.

348
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,600
I'm not going.

349
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,200
I want water.

350
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,520
You colluded with Qian to lie to me. I'm seriously injured.

351
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,920
You want me to get you some water? Can you pour me a glass?

352
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,120
I'm not going.

353
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,560
Then go.

354
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,360
I don't need you anymore.

355
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,200
Fine.

356
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,360
Don't you dare say that again.

357
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,560
The door is still open. Be careful.

358
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,600
Well...

359
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,640
He's fine.

360
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,640
I'm leaving.

361
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,040
You...

362
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,000
Keep your promise.

363
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,240
Can you still write?

364
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,560
No. What?

365
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,960
Okay.

366
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,840
Hey.

367
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,120
What now?

368
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,640
You...you...

369
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,080
Didn't you say

370
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,160
you wanted to show me some fabric?

371
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:24,840
Where is it?

372
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:36,560
Fee.

373
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,360
What are you doing here?

374
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,320
You're so dead.

375
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,080
Can you come in later?

376
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:45,320
Do you want to explode you right here?

377
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:01,720
Hey.

378
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
Hello, aunt.

379
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,360
Excuse me.

380
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,360
have you seen

381
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,560
such a big cow paper?

382
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,800
I didn't see it.

383
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,080
Hello, nurse.

384
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,200
Have you seen

385
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,160
such a big cow paper?

386
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,960
No.

387
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,720
Please think again.

388
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,880
I just arrived here.

389
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,600
I didn't see it.

390
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,800
Yes, a black car.

391
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,720
The last number is 0806.

392
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,400
According to his accent,

393
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,040
He doesn't look like a local.

394
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,640
We can only try our best to find him.

395
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,040
We're expecting to inform you

396
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,520
in 48 hours.

397
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,920
It takes 48 hours.

398
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,040
That long?

399
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,440
I have no choice.

400
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,600
Can you hurry up?

401
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,520
We'll do it as soon as possible, okay?

402
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,080
Okay.

403
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,520
Let me know if you have any news.

404
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Thank you.

405
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,280
Ding Yike.

406
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,360
Why did you come down?

407
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:43,840
Go upstairs.

408
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,600
How can I ignore you?

409
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,680
What if it gets serious?

410
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,880
Why don't we sit down and talk?

411
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,040
No need.

412
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,800
There are no demos in the fabric library.

413
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,760
Fabrics send me rice samples.

414
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,720
I think they will arrive next Monday.

415
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,320
It's okay. We can make it next Monday.

416
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,440
Please send her home.

417
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,320
Okay?

418
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,040
And tell Xu Fei

419
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,000
I'm fine. Don't worry.

420
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,480
Don't bother Qian.

421
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,120
I can go back myself.

422
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,240
Just listen to me.

423
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,000
Losing bags and fabrics.

424
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,160
When did you lose yourself?

425
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,760
Didn't you say

426
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,400
if you don't want to pour me water here,

427
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
then leave here.

428
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,320
Don't get in my way.

429
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,840
Excuse me.

430
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,320
Let me help you.

431
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,560
No, I can go back myself.

432
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,680
Send it back right away. Thank you.

433
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,520
Let's go.

434
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,080
Boss, calm down.

435
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,080
He

436
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,720
just broke his toe.

437
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,520
Yes.

438
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,320
He has found someone for the sample.

439
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,440
Yes. Fortunately, the samples are ready.

440
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,800
It should be fine.

441
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,760
Okay.

442
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,600
Okay, no problem.

443
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,480
Okay.

444
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,800
Bye.

445
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,840
What happened?

446
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,000
Nothing.

447
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,640
He can still be alive.

448
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,120
and yell at me.

449
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,240
That's great.

450
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,640
Don't blame me for lying to you.

451
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,960
It’s Moyuan’s idea.

452
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,320
I know. He's a bad guy.

453
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,960
Yes, he's a bad guy.

454
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,920
Anyway,

455
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,600
if he didn't really like you,

456
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,440
why did he do that?

457
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,320
Normally,

458
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,480
it's not up to me

459
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,480
to persuade

460
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,120
to persuade me.

461
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:55,920
However,

462
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,400
I've seen you two

463
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,720
walking all the way.

464
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,200
So,

465
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,200
I'm just trying to look old and nag.

466
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,120
When these two

467
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,280
When they're angry,

468
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,680
you can say 10,000 times you break up.

469
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,080
When you calm down,

470
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,640
I can really leave and leave.

471
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,920
That's the end.

472
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Otherwise, just recognize one word.

473
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,280
Coward.

474
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,360
Listen to your heart.

475
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,520
Follow your heart.

476
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,720
and walk around.

477
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,040
After all,

478
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
no one is perfect.

479
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,040
As long as they are safe,

480
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,960
what are they doing?

481
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,840
Am I right?

482
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,880
Coco.

483
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,880
What happened to my prince charming?

484
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,280
Qian left before he finished.

485
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,640
You didn't answer my call.

486
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,320
I dare not leave the shop and go to the hospital.

487
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,560
What do you want?

488
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,360
My phone is dead.

489
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,720
Don't worry.

490
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,480
He's fine.

491
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,360
He just broke his toe.

492
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,080
He'll be discharged in two or three days.

493
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,960
Are you lying to me?

494
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,960
Why would I lie to you?

495
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,120
Where are you going?

496
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,600
I'm going to buy some trotters for him.

497
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,720
Chicken feet.

498
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,360
It's good for your health.

499
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,400
You two made up?

500
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,000
Kids, mind your own business.

501
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,200
Let's go.

502
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,680
Why are you making a fuss?

503
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,120
I'm still a patient. Don't scare me.

504
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,200
How did you get in?

505
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,760
The spare key you left with me.

506
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,280
But you can't

507
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,120
come to my house without permission.

508
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,520
Come on.

509
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,960
Xu Fei said

510
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,080
you went to buy groceries for me.

511
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,000
I have to hurry back.

512
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
I have to eat.

513
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,520
You don't welcome me, do you?

514
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,280
Fine.

515
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,720
I'll leave if you don't welcome me.

516
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,840
Let's go.

517
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,200
What's wrong?

518
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,400
What are you doing?

519
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,960
Let's stop it.

520
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:30,440
Let's make up.

521
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:46,960
Okay.

522
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,000
Go cook.

523
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
Zhao Moyuan.

524
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,600
I haven't eaten anything

525
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,480
I haven't eaten anything.

526
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,720
I'm so hungry.

527
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,040
I have snacks here. I'll get some for you.

528
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,440
I don't want sweet food.

529
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,720
I don't want sweet food.

530
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,600
I'll make noodles for you.

531
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,600
Soon.

532
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,400
The pain reliever is over. It hurts.

533
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,960
Does it still hurt?

534
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,440
Let me get you some medicine.

535
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,760
I think I have painkillers.

536
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,520
If it hurts so much,

537
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,840
Why are you discharged so early?

538
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,680
Because of you.

539
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,280
Because I want to see you all the time.

540
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,480
You're amazing.

541
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,560
We break up every time we fight.

542
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,160
I have to get discharged.

543
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,480
I'm telling you this.

544
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,320
You like

545
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,880
a boyfriend like me.

546
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,760
How can you fall in love with someone else?

547
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,880
Right?

548
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,600
If I hadn't apologized to you in advance,

549
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,680
and give in.

550
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,040
If you really break up with me,

551
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,360
you might not be able to find your boyfriend.

552
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,600
What's wrong?

553
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,600
Are you unhappy again?

554
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,640
I'd rather never get married

555
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,840
than let you scare me again.

556
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,040
I just broke my toes.

557
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,720
I can walk.

558
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,200
I'm sorry.

559
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,920
It's my fault.

560
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
I won't scare you anymore.

561
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,680
I made you worry.

562
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,840
I'm the one who should apologize.

563
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,200
Let me say it again.

564
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,920
Leo is important to me,

565
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,360
but she's just my senior.

566
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,000
You are my girlfriend.

567
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,800
I don't love you

568
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,840
I don't love you enough.

569
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,480
I just didn't realize

570
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,160
you have taken over my life.

571
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,880
everywhere.

572
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,720
So you can't leave me.

573
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,240
You can't leave me.

574
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,240
You have to be responsible for me.

575
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,000
Okay?

576
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,520
Leo's old name was Lam.

577
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,560
Olin.

578
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,640
When she took her master's degree in literature,

579
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,760
I didn't go to school.

580
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,840
But at that time,

581
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,960
I already knew

582
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,640
she was a rising star.

583
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,320
When everyone is by her side,

584
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,720
will become a supporting role.

585
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,120
She's very good at

586
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,280
and cutting.

587
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,600
It's only been four years in London,

588
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,920
in London for four years.

589
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,800
of the United Fashion Designer Association.

590
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,360
At that time, no one suspected

591
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,320
she would be the next.

592
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,560
Alexander McKun.

593
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:01,920
or Kawakubo Reinence.

594
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,320
But at her most glorious moment,

595
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,760
her boyfriend

596
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,400
jumped out and said she imitated herself.

597
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,960
Many people are jealous of her.

598
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,880
took the chance to kick her when she was down.

599
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,120
So in an instant,

600
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,440
all praise became doubts.

601
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,679
Even the school

602
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,719
her annual design suspected of plagiarism

603
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,480
to drop out of school.

604
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
I don't believe

605
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,920
she would imitate others.

606
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,600
Because I've seen her

607
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,920
from freshman to senior year.

608
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,880
Her design concept

609
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,800
matured little by little.

610
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,239
Later I found out

611
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:39,480
It turns out

612
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,840
he wanted to make Leo's design

613
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,719
as his own.

614
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,400
Leo firmly disagreed.

615
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,760
He even wanted to break up.

616
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,800
So he got angry.

617
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:48,280
The villain complained first.

618
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,480
A few years later,

619
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,199
I got

620
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,600
the American Fashion Designer Association.

621
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,120
Since then,

622
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,639
I've been looking for Leo.

623
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,240
I wanted to help her clear her name.

624
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,040
I want her to stand on the TV again.

625
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,680
But she disappeared completely.

626
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,400
She disappeared in the design industry.

627
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,600
I don't want to give up.

628
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,120
This kind of search becomes obsession.

629
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,120
It even affected my emotional choice.

630
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,680
For a long time,

631
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,960
I liked the girls

632
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,600
Leo's personality.

633
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,080
But don't worry.

634
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,760
They were the ones who pursued me.

635
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,040
A proud man like me

636
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,720
never pursued anyone.

637
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,760
It's you.

638
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,080
Let me ask you.

639
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,160
Before me,

640
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,280
how many ex-girlfriends do you have?

641
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,160
Enough, stop ordering.

642
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,560
I'm asking for trouble.

643
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,400
Mr. Patrick Cho.

644
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,840
He's famous at a young age and he's a shooter.

645
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,720
There's no one around him without a girlfriend.

646
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,840
Even the president's daughter

647
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,760
fell under your jeans.

648
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,240
Don't be jealous of me.

649
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,320
I've received

650
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,560
the punishment of God.

651
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,320
I wanted to avenge Leo.

652
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,480
And then?

653
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,320
my ex-girlfriend

654
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,040
was stolen by my ex-girlfriend.

655
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,080
And she published my work

656
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,240
to publish my work.

657
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,800
That’s not enough?

658
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,160
She joined hands with Shen Jin

659
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,080
and kicked me out of the shop.

660
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,120
What is this?

661
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,920
Shen Jin has no conscience

662
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,240
He may have some conscience

663
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,360
but he has no taste.

664
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,000
He really believes that I want to steal it.

665
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,800
He won't believe me no matter how I explain it.

666
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,920
But I can understand that

667
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,280
he had a crush on my ex-girlfriend.

668
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,560
What does Leo mean to me?

669
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,720
In his heart,

670
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,600
in his heart.

671
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,880
Alright.

672
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,640
I already told you

673
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,320
I told you everything.

674
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,120
Now I know.

675
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,000
why I didn't tell you

676
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,320
about Leo?

677
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,560
First, it involves my privacy.

678
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,080
Second,

679
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,200
My ex-girlfriend cheated on me.

680
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,360
It's really embarrassing.

681
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,240
Thank you for your trust.

682
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,400
I'll keep it a secret for you.

683
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,480
So you still care about

684
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,600
between me and Leo?

685
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,040
No.

686
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,120
Being jealous of his idol with a stupid fan

687
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,720
to be jealous of his idol.

688
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:44,080
What do you mean?

689
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,480
What?

690
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,680
Am I wrong?

691
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,640
What you did to Leo

692
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,080
are different from

693
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,600
from those fanatic fans?

694
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,360
Dumb fan. Dumb fan.

695
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:56,880
This...

696
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,760
A crazy fan.

697
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,800
All right.

698
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,720
I'll understand and support you.

699
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,720
I'll make your collaboration a success.

700
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,920
Because I like Leo too.

701
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,840
I want to see her too.

702
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,160
shining brightly.

703
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,520
Hello?

704
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,560
I have another request.

705
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,720
Can you stop

706
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,760
come here again?

707
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,040
We...

708
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,840
I just want you and me.

709
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,840
If he comes again,

710
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,000
I'll be very sad.

711
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,440
Do you know

712
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,280
Last time at the door,

713
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,480
I saw you hugging him from behind.

714
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,320
My heart was about to stop beating.

715
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,240
Okay.

716
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,000
I told him not to come last time.

717
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,440
He and I...

718
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,160
between me and him.

719
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,520
And that day,

720
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,360
I was really giving him an emergency.

721
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,360
Emergency.

722
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:54,920
You can do it.

723
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,280
I told you to hold him from behind.

724
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,440
If you need an emergency,

725
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,400
I want to go in shock right now.

726
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,240
Since last time...

727
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,240
my heart still hurts.

728
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,160
I also need

729
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,200
artificial respiration.

730
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,160
Morning.

731
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,600
Morning.

732
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,160
Have you eaten?

733
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:26,840
Yes.

734
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:28,960
Morning.

735
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:29,920
Morning.

736
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,720
Good morning.

737
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,520
You're wearing peach blossoms.

738
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,840
Looks like you've turned calamities into blessings.

739
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,960
I'm in a good mood.

740
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,040
You should treat us to dinner.

741
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,320
Internet celebrity bread or milk tea

742
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,840
Both are good.

743
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,960
So this afternoon,

744
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,680
can you

745
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,320
with me again?

746
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,160
No.

747
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,800
We've discussed with the boss.

748
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,320
I'll do my best to

749
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,640
to receive Linda.

750
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,640
When she approves the budget,

751
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,480
after she approves the budget.

752
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,000
We...

753
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,080
How is your husband now?

754
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,200
Linda will come tomorrow.

755
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,040
Can he sit in a wheelchair?

756
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,440
Don't curse him.

757
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,680
He's recovering well.

758
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,640
He just walks slowly. He doesn't need a wheelchair.

759
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,600
By the way,

760
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,760
keep an eye on

761
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,600
from Hong Kong these days.

762
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,400
It's the rice sam from the fabric dealer.

763
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,840
Now you know how to order people.

764
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,880
If the replacement fabric is approved,

765
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,320
the cost will be saved.

766
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:29,600
You'll get a bonus.

767
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,160
We're at the studio. Don't worry.

768
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,880
I found the latest new series manuscript.

769
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,640
Look who he looks like.

770
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,800
Leo inspired me before.

771
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,280
And now my muse

772
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,840
has changed to a fat girl with short hair.

773
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,520
That's all.

774
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,480
There's no Fei Fei at all.

775
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,840
Go back. Don't be tired.

776
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,680
I'll take care of the rest.

777
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,760
I'm not tired.

778
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,040
I'll help you finish this.

779
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,880
Didn't you say

780
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,760
you must give a satisfactory design

781
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,960
a satisfactory design?

782
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,720
Seeing you two working so hard,

783
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,960
I feel a little uneasy.

784
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,960
I think after this job,

785
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,520
if I don't send you

786
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,440
to Dubai for half a month,

787
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,000
Do I feel guilty?

788
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,240
I think Partrick's foot is broken,

789
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,960
but he's in a good mood.

790
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,760
Didn't you see

791
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,720
who sent him this morning.

792
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,520
Who?

793
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,320
It's okay. It's okay if you miss it today.

794
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,240
When you reach May tomorrow,

795
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:56,960
you'll see it.

796
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,560
Look at you. I feel embarrassed.

797
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,360
Look at this.

798
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,680
Where should I change it?

799
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,040
A little bit here.

800
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,200
How is it?

801
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
Pretty enough. Be confident.

802
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,160
He's just the vice president of a group.

803
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,440
He's not the president of any country.

804
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,400
Dating the first family.

805
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,520
Of course I don't have a famous designer.

806
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,880
as a famous designer.

807
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,080
What a nice day today.

808
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,920
Actually, I'm worried about you.

809
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,080
I heard Linda is quite picky.

810
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,520
Their lord

811
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,800
is the one

812
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,880
in the same group.

813
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,200
They told me last night

814
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,880
because their lights

815
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,040
the color temperature was wrong,

816
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,400
Linda criticized them.

817
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,800
Half an hour.

818
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,400
What are you afraid of?

819
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,200
As long as she's not blind,

820
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,360
she will be conquered by my design.

821
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,960
Arrogant.

822
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:26,640
Okay, I'll pick her up at the hotel.

823
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,160
See you in the office.

824
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,480
Watch your feet when you walk.

825
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,400
Slow down.

826
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:32,640
Bye.

827
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,360
Okay, bye.

828
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:04,920
This is it, right?

829
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,600
Yes.

830
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,520
Let's wait here.

831
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,120
Okay.

832
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,320
I heard she has a bad temper.

833
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,280
She's just strict.
