1
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,080
[The number you have dialled is not available.]

2
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,680
[Please try again later.]

3
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,320
Are you out of your mind?

4
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,800
You're the crazy one.

5
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,600
And you can't control

6
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,440
what I want to do.

7
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,520
Why not?

8
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,600
I'm your sister-in-law.

9
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,240
Are you here to see your relatives?

10
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:02,080
No, I live here.

11
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,400
Don't you live in Hongyue?

12
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,399
I never said that.

13
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,720
I just said my house is next to Diamond Tae.

14
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,880
That's what you think.

15
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,880
You got caught bragging.

16
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
You know what?

17
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,120
My sister-in-law pretended to be a fool.

18
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,159
She's a princess,

19
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
but she pretended to be rich and pretty.

20
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,600
Shameless.

21
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,280
Go.

22
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,960
I'll call you next time.

23
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:16,720
Bye.

24
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,400
Thank you.

25
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,000
Bye.

26
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,680
Bye.

27
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,680
The skirt can be shorter.

28
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,240
Try it.

29
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,720
Okay.

30
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,400
It's normal that

31
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
to not cooperate with you.

32
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,720
Why?

33
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,280
Luna, explain it to her.

34
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,680
It’s because of the shop.

35
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,080
Normally, they can only afford

36
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,960
But they can only afford

37
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
300,000 goods.

38
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,000
So,

39
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,720
the sales can only reach

40
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,000
as expected.

41
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,120
So after several times,

42
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,720
they won't cooperate.

43
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,720
Understand?

44
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,600
No wonder you said it was too easy for me.

45
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,080
It's so troublesome.

46
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
I'm disappointed.

47
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,240
How is that possible?

48
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,840
The Ding Yike you know

49
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,320
give up so easily?

50
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,560
I came to you

51
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,400
to ask you to analyze it for me.

52
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,880
Now I know the reason.

53
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,680
I can finally shoot.

54
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,520
There are several brands.

55
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
I don't believe I can't handle them all.

56
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,400
Pay all the money.

57
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,840
Only in this way

58
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,240
the designers will be tempted.

59
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,280
As for the money,

60
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,080
you can use it. Don't worry.

61
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,560
You trust me so much.

62
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,840
Don't doubt the military.

63
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:01,880
Take a look.

64
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,600
What do you think of the skirt now?

65
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
Perfect.

66
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,600
Come on.

67
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,840
So professional.

68
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,120
We had a show before

69
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,400
It's no match for this.

70
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
Boss and Patrick.

71
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,560
are all professionals.

72
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,600
Mr. Qin, I'm very sincere.

73
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,440
Not only am I willing to provide 70% of the goods

74
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,280
when we get the goods,

75
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,080
will also promote you

76
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,560
as a distant designer.

77
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,560
for you.

78
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,080
Of course.

79
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,960
It's not an ordinary shop.

80
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,840
Not only to buy your goods,

81
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,840
but also help you expand the market.

82
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,840
Ms Ding,

83
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,720
You're really good at making illusions.

84
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,280
Thank you.

85
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,840
From marketing strategy to promotion cooperation,

86
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,280
from promotion strategy to promotion.

87
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:36,480
But if you want to use 700,000,

88
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,960
with 700,000 yuan

89
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,520
the whole autumn and winter series.

90
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,840
I can't promise you that.

91
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,760
To be honest,

92
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,840
Look at my scale.

93
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,040
1.5 million a year.

94
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,760
Even my rent

95
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,200
artificial, water and electricity

96
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,400
are not enough.

97
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,960
I may not be able to earn back the cost of fabric.

98
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,600
I'm not that kind of person

99
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,960
who runs a studio

100
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,840
and have fun.

101
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,480
I have to be responsible for my brand survival.

102
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,080
I understand.

103
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,720
The problem for independent designers

104
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,400
is that the order is small.

105
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,840
Not only the fabric, the base, the purchase is expensive,

106
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,960
and a big clothing factory

107
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,280
wouldn't accept orders.

108
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,200
But now in May and Yuan are working together.

109
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,080
As long as you agree to pay,

110
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
I promise

111
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,160
you can share

112
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,760
in May.

113
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,400
It's not that I don't trust you, Ms Ding.

114
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,080
After all, you two

115
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,720
for only this season.

116
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,760
Who knows what will happen

117
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,720
in the future?

118
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,640
I'm sorry, Ms Ding.

119
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,640
A customer is here.

120
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,600
I have to entertain them.

121
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,480
What if I only want you

122
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,720
a month's supply?

123
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,400
I won't give you the whole autumn and winter.

124
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
Just one month.

125
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,520
Also,

126
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,720
pay 70% of the goods in advance.

127
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,400
No return, no exchange.

128
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,200
The promotion and promotion are the same.

129
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,160
The condition is

130
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,720
I'll only accept your price.

131
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,080
3.50% off.

132
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,360
And in this month,

133
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,360
your autumn and winter style

134
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,720
Whether I chose it

135
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,040
or not,

136
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,960
or not.

137
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,280
Of course, one month later,

138
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:23,840
if you're willing

139
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,520
cooperate with Yuan,

140
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,160
we can accept a 50% discount.

141
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,400
But you have to promise

142
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,520
you can't provide the goods to the television.

143
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,080
What do you think?

144
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,280
No more buyers

145
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,200
can provide you

146
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,080
such crazy and rich conditions.

147
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,520
Of course, I'm not crazy.

148
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,920
I have great confidence

149
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,480
in your design and my taste.

150
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,520
I'm willing to bet.

151
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,960
Then do you dare to bet?

152
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,840
You only have one chance.

153
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,720
You have to meet a client later.

154
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,600
I don't want to waste your time.

155
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,760
How about this?

156
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,360
I'll give you one minute to think about it.

157
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,600
30 seconds left.

158
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,600
I bet.

159
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,520
Okay.

160
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,600
As long as the cooperation is modified,

161
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,840
we can sell big goods.

162
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,280
How about our cooperation?

163
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,520
Don't worry. We'll make the version next week.

164
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
Before August 1,

165
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,040
before August 1st.

166
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,840
Mr. Zhao also gave me

167
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,080
a lot of good suggestions.

168
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,960
Last time when I had a meeting with Linda,

169
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,280
I thought he was not easy to work with.

170
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,640
I didn't expect him to...

171
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,520
Did he tell you

172
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,960
to introduce you to a super model?

173
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,480
Mr. Du.

174
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,200
Enough, stop praising outsiders.

175
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,960
Tell me if we can help

176
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,720
to buy hands?

177
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,520
Of course.

178
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,600
I understand now.

179
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,080
The company wants to change the design guide

180
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,840
into market guide and customer needs.

181
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,080
Now we have sales support.

182
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,760
and located the creative direction.

183
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,080
My men said

184
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,480
the work in this season is much better.

185
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,920
Anyway, the company's goods are selling well.

186
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,600
our design department will be proud.

187
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,960
Even if we don't sell well now,

188
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,360
some buyers will take the blame for us.

189
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,200
Isn't that a good thing?

190
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,720
What are you talking about?

191
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,280
I have to go.

192
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,080
What's up?

193
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,400
Coming.

194
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
Do you remember?

195
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,960
Where did you find it?

196
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,600
In Peter’s box.

197
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,840
He said

198
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,760
you were doing

199
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,920
for you.

200
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,600
to design this dress.

201
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,720
But it was half designed.

202
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,160
that man framed you for plagiarism.

203
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,400
You never came back

204
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,400
You never came back to the studio.

205
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,480
But Peter kept it.

206
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,520
He said you were an excellent student.

207
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,520
hoping one day

208
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,960
I can see its finished product

209
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,720
on the bridge.

210
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,600
Although it looks

211
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,160
very ordinary now,

212
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,200
It's just a layer of white rust cloth.

213
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,920
But people with eyes

214
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,280
can see

215
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,520
through its cutting.

216
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,080
if it's completed.

217
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,160
Can you continue to finish it?

218
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,840
I hope it can appear

219
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,400
in this show

220
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,840
and complete its mission.

221
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,720
No.

222
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,840
Can you give up your childish thoughts?

223
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,720
I won't give up.

224
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,400
To let others know your talent

225
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,160
is what I've always wanted.

226
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,160
It's been ten years.

227
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,280
Could it be that Leo chose to hide now?

228
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,280
the dirty water he splashed on Olin ten years ago

229
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,720
will be gone forever?

230
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,960
Senior, strength is the only way

231
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,160
the only way.

232
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,920
I have the ability to protect you.

233
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,360
I won't let you

234
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,520
hurt you again.

235
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,720
Ten years ago,

236
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,760
I was framed by my fiance

237
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,760
and ruined my reputation.

238
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,200
After that, I changed my name and started over.

239
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,160
It took me ten years

240
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,160
to reach the middle level of Lingyun.

241
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,720
After that,

242
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,400
I met another man.

243
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,600
He's handsome, gentle and talented.

244
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,160
I worked together with him

245
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,400
to save the brand

246
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,840
a brand that is going to die.

247
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,960
Everything looks so tacit.

248
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,920
Thankfully, I thought I found

249
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,520
a long-awaited soulmate.

250
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,520
But who would have thought

251
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
that day,

252
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,080
in front of

253
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,720
slapped me

254
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,200
in front of all directors of Lingyun,

255
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,360
I realized

256
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,040
he was not

257
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,360
like he said.

258
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,360
What's more ridiculous is

259
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,040
in order to prove himself,

260
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,520
he declared to the public that

261
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,400
I seduced him

262
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,040
I seduced and threatened him.

263
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,400
Luckily,

264
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,160
I have something on Lingyun.

265
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,400
Otherwise, I would have been kicked out.

266
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,520
I wouldn't have the chance to come to May

267
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,280
to stand in front of you.

268
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,520
Patrick.

269
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,720
I'm not as strong as you think.

270
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,280
I managed to get this far

271
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,720
because of the resentment and resentment.

272
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,160
I want to create

273
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,280
with my own strength.

274
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,640
This might be my last struggle.

275
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,960
So I don't have more energy

276
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,520
to touch

277
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,600
and my favorite design.

278
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,360
Senior.

279
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,840
I owe you a thank you.

280
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,200
Without you,

281
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,280
Zhao Moyuan and May wouldn’t have been realized.

282
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,840
You've done a lot for me.

283
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,520
But I still want to tell you

284
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
I'm not the one you should protect.

285
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,400
but Ding Yike.

286
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,840
I'll finish

287
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,400
the rest of the battle by myself.

288
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,080
Trust me.

289
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,960
I will stick to it till the end.

290
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,120
This dress is really beautiful.

291
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,400
Mr. Du.

292
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,520
I saw it outside just now.

293
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,880
I heard it too.

294
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,080
You're right.

295
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,000
This dress

296
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,880
is really suitable for the final show.

297
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,720
Mr. Zhao,

298
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,880
I have a favor to ask you.

299
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Please...

300
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,080
help Leo complete the design of this dress.

301
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,840
She and you are in this dress.

302
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,960
are the real Zhao Moyuan and May.

303
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,760
Please.

304
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Did you really promise him?

305
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,080
Of course. What else?

306
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,240
He suddenly bowed.

307
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,880
It makes me embarrassed.

308
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,360
I wonder

309
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,760
and Leo.

310
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,640
Are you guessing

311
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,280
when he said this to you,

312
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,840
as a boyfriend

313
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,600
or as the president of May?

314
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,360
Yes.

315
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,480
According to Tina,

316
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,640
she hasn't become a regular employee yet.

317
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,520
Really?

318
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,000
I didn't expect

319
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,640
my senior would like him.

320
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,240
So,

321
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,080
he's the last one who takes advantage of me?

322
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,880
Yo Yo Yo

323
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,880
Listen to him.

324
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,000
A 100% boyfriend fan.

325
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,960
What? You want to protect your goddess?

326
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,760
Are you jealous?

327
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,360
No.

328
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,640
You're jealous.

329
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,240
No.

330
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,760
I can see that you're jealous.

331
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,240
I understand how you feel.

332
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,880
I used to be like this to Lim Sixian.

333
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,520
So I understand.

334
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,160
Didn't we agree not to mention Lin Sixian?

335
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,880
Why mention him again?

336
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,760
Don't mention it. What are you doing?

337
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,080
Male chauvinist.

338
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,080
I don't mind

339
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,480
I have no objections.

340
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,240
I'm sorry.

341
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,000
Isn't that work?

342
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,880
Well, it's a suit. It's a style.

343
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,200
Why do you care about that?

344
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,720
I'm sorry.

345
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,040
I won't do it again.

346
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,520
I won't.

347
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,840
Don't mention him again, okay?

348
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,480
All right.

349
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,360
But I didn't know

350
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,480
a big show is so complicated.

351
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,520
Except clothes, models,

352
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,840
there are also venues, styles, lights,

353
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,400
Music, fragrance.

354
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,080
Nothing is simple.

355
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,480
Of course.

356
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,640
You should know

357
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,480
in New York,

358
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,080
a show

359
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,280
about 300,000 US dollars.

360
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:15,000
The average

361
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,280
15 minutes,

362
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,240
it means

363
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,760
it costs about

364
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,000
2,000 RMB.

365
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,080
So much money.

366
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,280
What if we don't pay attention?

367
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,240
Right?

368
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,240
Besides,

369
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,520
you don’t care.

370
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,760
Just because of Du Xiuqi’s aesthetics,

371
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,720
I guess

372
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,400
he will make this show

373
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,480
into the opening ceremony

374
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,960
in the countryside.

375
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,400
Right? Let's go.

376
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,840
I saw Victoria for an hour.

377
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,360
No.

378
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,880
I know.

379
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,840
You mean singing and dancing?

380
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
Victoria belongs to the TV show

381
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,120
All fashion shows

382
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,520
in all fashion shows.

383
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,080
Do you understand, amateur?

384
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,960
Understand?

385
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,760
Yes.

386
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,200
What are you doing? We'll go back if you understand.

387
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,640
How is it, Feifei?

388
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,720
I'll be right there.

389
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,120
Let me finish this.

390
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,760
Lucy, let's go.

391
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,720
Let's do the upstairs first.

392
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Take your time.

393
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,600
Okay.

394
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,600
What do you think?

395
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
The cooperation with Kevin Ro

396
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,640
will begin tomorrow.

397
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,080
How confident are you?

398
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,960
80%.

399
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,000
So tall. Amazing.

400
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,240
Actually, I don't have 20 percent.

401
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,960
Moyuan.

402
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,480
I'm really afraid of losing this bet.

403
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,520
Not only did I waste your money,

404
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,480
but also smashed a long brand.

405
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,600
Although I was right before,

406
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,760
but

407
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,840
I've never done this before.

408
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,760
I...

409
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,280
I called you out for a walk

410
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,960
because you were nervous.

411
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,600
But you're still nervous.

412
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,880
Let me tell you.

413
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,480
My legs are weak at the last minute. It's too late.

414
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,720
I won't comfort you.

415
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,080
I've been nervous

416
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,240
I can understand

417
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,160
I can understand that feeling.

418
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,240
For example,

419
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,760
when I received St. Martin

420
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,080
to accept my letter,

421
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,120
before I start my first show.

422
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,000
Of course.

423
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,840
I get nervous before every show.

424
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,120
Sometimes I'm so nervous

425
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,120
I wanted to drink

426
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,240
I had to drink a whole bottle of whiskey

427
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,360
to fall asleep.

428
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,640
It's normal.

429
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,280
I only need to ask you three questions.

430
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,600
Please answer me seriously.

431
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,160
Okay?

432
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,760
First,

433
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,360
all the clothes here

434
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,280
are all

435
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,760
carefully selected?

436
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,000
Second,

437
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,360
I did a lot of analysis.

438
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,000
I want to ask you if all marketing methods

439
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,840
are the best?

440
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,360
Yes.

441
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,000
Third,

442
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,360
Did we

443
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,240
together?

444
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,640
It's true, but...

445
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,360
I love you.

446
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,280
No matter how hard and how bad the result is,

447
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,200
I'm right here.

448
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,240
by your side.

449
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,360
Okay?

450
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,640
Come in come in

451
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,120
Why don't you come in for a photo

452
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,880
Why don't you come in?

453
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,640
Look at this shop.

454
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,880
This is nice.

455
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,240
She just went.

456
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,480
Miaomiao?

457
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,480
What if we meet her? Let's go now.

458
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,520
It's not far from here. Let's go.

459
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,400
Let's go and have a look.

460
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,640
This is the restaurant, right?

461
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,760
Yes, this one.

462
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,160
This way

463
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,640
Welcome.

464
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,160
I bought

465
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,360
bought it here?

466
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,760
Yes we bought it here

467
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,640
This one is great

468
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,120
I want to buy it.

469
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,720
Get me a medium size.

470
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,280
You have good taste.

471
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,640
This is our limited edition.

472
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,280
Xiaomei, hurry up.

473
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,360
Let me take you to the second floor.

474
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,400
Let's go and have a look.

475
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,880
Great. It's beautiful.

476
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,480
What do you think?

477
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,520
The designer's clothes

478
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,480
are different.

479
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,640
It's pretty.

480
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,120
This dress

481
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,080
You have to try it on to know the effect.

482
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,840
We have an advantage

483
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,120
each piece of clothes

484
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,280
has its own code.

485
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,760
When you input the code,

486
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,240
you can see the effect of trying them on.

487
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,160
Yeah look

488
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,720
This is amazing.

489
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,160
I like this

490
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,480
This one looks nice

491
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:05,880
Yes.

492
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,160
This looks nice.

493
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,120
Here it is

494
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,080
This is it.

495
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,080
I'm sorry.

496
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,640
I'm sorry.

497
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,480
Here

498
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,000
There are so many guests today

499
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,720
To give you a better

500
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,520
shopping experience,

501
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,240
We only serve ten guests at the same time.

502
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,880
So please line up.

503
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,400
Thank you

504
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,480
You came all the way here.

505
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,160
Thank you. Thank you for queuing up.

506
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,600
I'm sorry.

507
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,000
The curve of her hair

508
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:28,880
more.

509
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,000
Here. From her ear to here.

510
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,040
Let's see if we should roll more.

511
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,480
Yes.

512
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,760
And this too.

513
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,880
Just like her. OK.

514
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,080
I'll let it roll a little more.

515
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,760
Prince charming.

516
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,480
Look

517
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,000
Have you ever seen

518
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,880
Have you seen it before?

519
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,280
Boss, they're here.

520
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,240
Hello, Director Lei.

521
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,120
Hello.

522
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,360
This is the director of our Design Department.

523
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,840
Hello.

524
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,160
Let's sit down.

525
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:01,640
Okay.

526
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,240
Why didn't we

527
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,840
such a marketing method before?

528
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
Mr Shen.

529
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,760
Let's not talk about the future.

530
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,480
about Zhao Moyuan?

531
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,880
Personal grudge.

532
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,360
Is it the same

533
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,520
is the same?

534
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,640
I checked.

535
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,600
Their designer is Xu Fei.

536
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,480
Their clerk.

537
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,760
What they did

538
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,640
are just people who don't understand.

539
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,360
Are you sure?

540
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,360
Yes.

541
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,120
Zhao Moyuan’s girlfriend’s idea

542
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,000
is a little bit of gimmick.

543
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,080
As you know,

544
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,880
what’s Kevin La’s price?

545
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,480
60% of the cost price.

546
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,480
If she delivers food less than 1,000 yuan,

547
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,760
the more we sell it, the more we lose.

548
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,120
It's just the way of a rabbit tail.

549
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,760
It won't grow.

550
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,160
And it's not included

551
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,760
for the promotion on Weibo.

552
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,000
and the software.

553
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,000
This is also a big expense.

554
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,080
A woman who was fired by May

555
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,480
who was fired in May.

556
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,880
You can't say that.

557
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,760
Find out

558
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:09,880
of your previous investigation.

559
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,240
After all, Yuan is his work.

560
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,240
Why did he leave

561
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,240
to a newcomer?

562
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,160
Does love lower your IQ?

563
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,360
Besides, her way of doing it

564
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,640
doesn't seem completely unreasonable.

565
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,840
Leaders.

566
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,640
Actually, it's not difficult

567
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,840
is not difficult to make a designer.

568
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,000
including our store.

569
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,480
many shops are doing it.

570
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,600
But

571
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,120
The point is

572
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,000
[she avoids]

573
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,520
the street shooting mode of a celebrity.

574
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,000
The third person of the passerby

575
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,280
the third passerby called her perspective to attract attention.

576
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,760
Then she used the selfie landmark as a gimmick

577
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,640
to achieve customers’ distribution.

578
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,080
Actually, the designer's costumes can't be sold.

579
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,640
Most of the reason is

580
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,760
the price is too high.

581
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,080
So this time,

582
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,480
lower the price to three digits.

583
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,080
Then she opened an online store.

584
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,480
online and offline.

585
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
Then,

586
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,240
she also learned from

587
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,960
from a big brand.

588
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,280
Make a line.

589
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,000
When the hot topic of the first week fades,

590
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
she created

591
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,760
next week's marketing hot topic.

592
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,600
I underestimated you.

593
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,760
If there are so many people in line,

594
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,360
how much Kevin Luo has prepared for her?

595
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,480
Qin, it's me.

596
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,720
The autumn and winter in this season is very effective.

597
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,160
I want to replenish the goods.

598
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
Like this.

599
00:28:59,240 --> 00:28:59,760
Okay.

600
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,840
Let's talk again when you land.

601
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,240
Okay.

602
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,280
He said he was on the plane

603
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,520
on the plane.

604
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,160
He would have said

605
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,000
keep in touch with me on WeChat.

606
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,520
This is not normal.

607
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,840
Looks like I have to go and find out the truth myself.

608
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,840
You... I've never lied to you.

609
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,400
You think

610
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,080
I'm just rich and pretty.

611
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,240
But actually,

612
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,520
I'm just a princess

613
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,000
a princess.

614
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,880
The highest-end

615
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,720
in Shanghai.

616
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,480
But at night,

617
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,520
I could only go back

618
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,640
and my parents.

619
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,160
My half-brother.

620
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,120
My brother

621
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,480
and sister-in-law from another city.

622
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,840
The six of us

623
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,360
in a

624
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,000
over 30 square meters.

625
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,000
When I was ten,

626
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,640
since I was ten.

627
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,120
But they were waiting for demolition.

628
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,520
Later,

629
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,240
I got a scholarship and went abroad.

630
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,640
I thought when I came back,

631
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,080
I could get rid of

632
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,240
a bad life.

633
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,480
But

634
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
Later I realized

635
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,240
even if I could afford Chanel,

636
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,880
and a sports car,

637
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,160
But I can never afford it.

638
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,760
the down payment of a house.

639
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,360
I know you are indecisive.

640
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,760
and disliked the old.

641
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,400
But I chose you.

642
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,600
Do you know why?

643
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,280
Because the introduced said

644
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,240
you have a house.

645
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,280
over 100 square meters, a three-bedroom.

646
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,600
Okay, that's all.

647
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,960
What else do you want to know?

648
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,240
What about your uncle?

649
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,640
He's so capable.

650
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,880
He should be able to help you.

651
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,000
He's not my real uncle.

652
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,120
He's just...

653
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,000
a neighbor

654
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,160
a neighbor.

655
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,880
My mother's last name.

656
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,240
That's all.

657
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,600
Actually, I...

658
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,760
Wenwen.

659
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,880
I don't care about that.

660
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,640
If you don't mind,

661
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,000
I can pretend

662
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
nothing happened.

663
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,160
But your mom cares.

664
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,640
She called me yesterday.

665
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
You are really

666
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,480
who tells your mom everything.

667
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,400
My mom went to see you.

668
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,960
Wenwen, I told her.

669
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,720
I told her about this.

670
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,360
What's the point

671
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,520
to say this now?

672
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,120
Let's part happily.

673
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,280
Waiter, pay the bill.

674
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,480
Wenwen.

675
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,240
No need.

676
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,840
I have money for coffee.

677
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,480
Do you know why

678
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
his persuasion?

679
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,160
Because I don't need his charity.

680
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,960
I don't want to live

681
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,000
as a forgiven person for the rest of my life.

682
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,600
I've never lied to him.

683
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,080
And I've been helping him.

684
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,360
In this relationship,

685
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,000
I have a clear conscience.

686
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,600
Where are you going tomorrow?

687
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
Tomorrow.

688
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,239
The model for the interview tomorrow.

689
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:37,520
Do you want to come with me?

690
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,520
No.

691
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,480
I don't want to see

692
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,520
the central air conditioner.

693
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:44,080
to a bunch of pretty girls.

694
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,880
Here's the sample for May.

695
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,440
Boss asked me to go back.

696
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,120
Who is it? You're still busy?

697
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,600
You always call me a crazy fan.

698
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,840
What about you, summon?

699
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,000
Your family business

700
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,200
is so busy.

701
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,640
You even volunteered for them.

702
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,360
I'm just suspended for a while.

703
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,720
I'm still an employee in May.

704
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,280
Besides,

705
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,920
the restaurant opens at 10:30 a.m.

706
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,480
I'll go to the office at nine. It won't be delayed.

707
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,200
Look at your tone.

708
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,520
You made money

709
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,200
You're so stubborn.

710
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,080
Stop teasing me.

711
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,120
I still have a long way to go.

712
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,840
But according to the current trend,

713
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,720
we can make a small profit this month.

714
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,440
But your choice ability

715
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,680
is much better.

716
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,760
Of course, boss said

717
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,680
I'm talented in this.

718
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,680
Of course.

719
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,120
It's only below the medium price.

720
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,920
After all, I'm not from your circle.

721
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,440
I'm the only one

722
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,000
to get on the horse.

723
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:44,960
to compete with

724
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,200
high-price art like you.

725
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,200
You know Tian Ji’s horse racing?

726
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,160
Do you think Du Xiuqi can persuade her

727
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,840
to make this dress the finale on the show?

728
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,440
Love is magical.

729
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,720
Trust the power of love.

730
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,200
No no it's not spicy dance

731
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,480
It's love. Love is magical.

732
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,400
You have to put your tongue on it longer.

733
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,680
Love.

734
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,400
Love is magical

735
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,480
Love

736
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,200
Spicy.

737
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,000
Where is the tongue?

738
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,640
Love.

739
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,160
Love.

740
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,200
Look carefully.

741
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,160
Got it?

742
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,240
Got it.

743
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,160
This is the company's new exhibition hall.

744
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,720
The vendors in May

745
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,000
will come here to pick out the design.

746
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,920
In this season,

747
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,240
15 joint designs.

748
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,480
100 follow-up designs.

749
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,240
and 200 original designs.

750
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,360
But according to the rules,

751
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,720
it can't be more than 40 on the show.

752
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,680
So now,

753
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,720
I hope you can

754
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,640
pick them out for me.

755
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,200
25 other brands.

756
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
The fashion design.

757
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,440
By the way,

758
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,440
for the first time in May.

759
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,400
and software.

760
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,440
Let's start.

761
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,400
Okay, no problem.

762
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,400
What?

763
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,600
It's moisturizing.

764
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,760
Being jealous of single is scary.

765
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,160
Why didn’t you keep one more for me?

766
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,600
Kevin La's popular dress.

767
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,440
Fine, I'll keep it for you, okay?

768
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,680
It's a deal.

769
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,880
Leave what?

770
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:05,680
Look.

771
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,520
What?

772
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,960
Come on, everyone.

773
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,160
Mr. Du, come here.

774
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,600
Hello, Mr. Du. Hello, Mr. Du.

775
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,760
The president wants to visit

776
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,280
the new exhibition hall

777
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,120
and the new design of this season.

778
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,720
Hurry up.

779
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,000
Mr. Du, please.

780
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,840
Mr. Du, take a look.

781
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,640
These are the latest products

782
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,600
of our season.

783
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:39,960
Did you miss me?

784
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,840
I don't want to.

785
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,680
It's all about white.

786
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,280
And then?

787
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,600
This side mainly

788
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,720
the outline.

789
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,480
Mr. Du, this way.

790
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,160
Please come again.

791
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:54,960
Bye.

792
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,680
You, one, two, three, four.

793
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,960
Please follow me inside.

794
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,200
Please wait for a while.

795
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,080
Thank you.

796
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:01,600
Okay.

797
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,000
How much did you buy?

798
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,680
Look at this.

799
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,720
Are you crazy?

800
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,720
Isn't it pretty?

801
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,960
It's not easy to come out.

802
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,480
You must buy it.

803
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,000
Where are we going later?

804
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,600
Boss.

805
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,520
Is it time?

806
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:31,960
Just now.

807
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,880
This is the total data

808
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,640
for an hour.

809
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,360
How's Kevin Ro doing?

810
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,840
Boss.

811
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,360
I called Kevin La

812
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,480
in several companies.

813
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,840
They said they won’t supply for now.

814
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,480
That's the payment.

815
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,440
Increase sales and lower cost.

816
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,000
No wonder she sold it at such a low price.

817
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
Boss, come on!

818
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,640
I'm so tired.

819
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:13,080
Thank you, Mr. image designer.

820
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,640
It's okay.

821
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,760
The studio

822
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,720
in the studio.

823
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,400
Even if Prince Charming doesn't say it,

824
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:17,920
I don't want to

825
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,680
to make you tired.

826
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,200
Look at this.

827
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,000
This design is not bad.

828
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,160
The color is too light.

829
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:26,760
Let's see.

830
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,680
It's a bit thorough.

831
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:32,760
Look at this.

832
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,880
This looks good.

833
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,920
This is not bad.

834
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,200
This color is pretty too.

835
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,200
This is our main design this year.

836
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,000
It sells very well.

837
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,240
Shall I show it to you?

838
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,080
What is he doing here?

839
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,440
To spy on the enemy.

840
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,520
Whatever. This is Moyuan’s place.

841
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,640
Who asked him to come?

842
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:53,960
No, no, no.

843
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:54,840
No.

844
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,680
What if he says he's a customer?

845
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,280
You can't drive him away.

846
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,680
People are watching.

847
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,360
The mountain people have their own plan.

848
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,480
Mr Shen.

849
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,280
Long time no see.

850
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,640
You've taken good care of Yuan.

851
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,120
Thank you.

852
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,240
You're not welcome here.

853
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,200
Can I ask why?

854
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,400
Don't play dumb, okay?

855
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,600
Sir, please leave.

856
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,240
You're not welcome here.

857
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,600
who spits gum everywhere.

858
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,840
I saw it. You vomited it.

859
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,000
Coco, did I ask you

860
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,200
Don't talk to customers like that.

861
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,600
Even if the customer spits out this gum,

862
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:08,680
it's not a problem.

863
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,920
Can you be gentle and tell him

864
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,120
Do you want to learn from me?

865
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:11,920
Sir.

866
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,080
Please leave.

867
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,240
Please leave.

868
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,920
I let you go.

869
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,400
but you've gotten worse.

870
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,200
Okay.

871
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,200
Very good.

872
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,840
Boss, how is it inside?

873
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:50,920
Do you want some?

874
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:57,760
I want to know

875
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,240
what agreement they signed.

876
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,440
But...

877
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,680
I have to know

878
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,880
I must know, okay?

879
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:06,960
Okay.
