1
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,000
Is it time to celebrate?

2
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,520
Have you prepared

3
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,720
Are you ready?

4
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,520
Can you guarantee

5
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,840
Are you sure?

6
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,080
Director Lei, the show is just over.

7
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,560
Make them happy.

8
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,479
Director Luo.

9
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,280
The show is over.

10
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,639
is over.

11
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,120
The job of buying hands

12
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,280
is far more than that.

13
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,360
From now on,

14
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,840
buying hands and this show

15
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,880
with this show.

16
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,079
Keep working.

17
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,280
Okay.

18
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:22,920
Yes.

19
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,920
Let's go.

20
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,240
Hey, don't go.

21
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,600
Don't go.

22
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,680
Don't go.

23
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,360
Let's go.

24
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,320
They all left.

25
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,200
Did they really say that?

26
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,160
Yes.

27
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,520
Then they

28
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,800
went back to the company.

29
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,440
Call, call.

30
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,640
patrol the shops.

31
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,920
Fortunately, I don't have enough goods.

32
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,680
Plus, you have a great reputation.

33
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,000
Otherwise,

34
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,600
I have to be with them.

35
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,640
I told you

36
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,640
I told you not to carry things.

37
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,320
Your skirt must be dirty.

38
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,520
Thank you.

39
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,160
Since young,

40
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,840
I've only seen two shows.

41
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,800
You showed me both.

42
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,400
But last time,

43
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,040
I could only wear

44
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,440
from the foreign trade store.

45
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,280
and the photographer.

46
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,760
And this time,

47
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,360
I can sit in the audience's seat

48
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,840
sitting in the audience

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,240
in the audience.

50
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,360
I'm happy for you.

51
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,480
What's the next step?

52
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,720
Is the next step

53
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,200
stand

54
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,920
the best fashion week in the world.

55
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,760
sitting in the first row

56
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,640
drinking champagne

57
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,880
and then

58
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,960
the life and death

59
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,440
its life and death, right?

60
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,480
Of course.

61
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
This is the reason

62
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,200
why I became a buyer.

63
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,440
So

64
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,240
you won't go back to the restaurant, right?

65
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,440
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,120
No need to say sorry.

67
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,240
You've helped me a lot.

68
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,839
Of course I know.

69
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,920
How could I let you stand

70
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,240
How could I let you

71
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,520
in the middle of the world top show?

72
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,000
Besides, you have filled up

73
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,880
all my obsession.

74
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,360
Of course I should repay you.

75
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,760
Have you filled it up?

76
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,080
Of course.

77
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,520
When I

78
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,159
the last nail bead,

79
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,040
I've let go of all my obsession.

80
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,440
Including Rin from ten years ago.

81
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,320
and the current Leo.

82
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,640
and the current Rao.

83
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,320
So I won't

84
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,560
to make her return to the design industry.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,720
I'm only worried about one thing.

86
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,159
whether I can

87
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,120
the long-distance store

88
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,680
for me.

89
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,840
I'll come back to help you.

90
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,080
Really?

91
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,960
Of course.

92
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,120
Then I have to

93
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,640
fawn on you.

94
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:05,520
right?

95
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,440
Thank you.

96
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:08,960
Okay.

97
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,120
Thank you.

98
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,840
Wait for me.

99
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,120
I watched the live show.

100
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,320
It was a great show.

101
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,800
Congratulations.

102
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,040
Thank you.

103
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,960
I found Linlin.

104
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,680
It's because of the finale dress.

105
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,000
and what you said back then.

106
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,400
So I came to check.

107
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:56,800
Okay.

108
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,240
That's good.

109
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,880
When you were at school,

110
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,640
when you were at school.

111
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,640
Time flies.

112
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,280
Mo Yuan.

113
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,240
I'll ask you one last time.

114
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,720
Did you steal her?

115
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,080
I'll answer you one last time.

116
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,120
Do you remember why

117
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,320
why you left St. Martin?

118
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,320
I'll tell you again.

119
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,880
I, Zhao Moyuan, used to be...

120
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,800
I hate the pirated version.

121
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:33,960
Okay.

122
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,880
Good.

123
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,920
Last week before she went to Hong Kong,

124
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,560
I asked her the same question.

125
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,880
She swore to me

126
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,159
to me

127
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,680
that the printing flowers were original.

128
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,520
Since you insist,

129
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,560
I can only start over.

130
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,600
But remember,

131
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,960
Those who keep lying to me

132
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,000
never end well.

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,040
Go ahead.

134
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,360
Let's calculate

135
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,200
the old scores, okay?

136
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,360
How are you going to settle this?

137
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,080
That Nikolas

138
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,280
is going back to France.

139
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,040
Why didn't you tell me?

140
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,240
Your girlfriend set me up.

141
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,120
I lost so much money.

142
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,800
How do you calculate this?

143
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,480
There's always a cause, you know?

144
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,200
You lied

145
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,840
you lied to her with a mask.

146
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,760
Let me tell you.

147
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,000
that mask has nothing to do with me.

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:21,600
I can also swear

149
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,840
as a designer.

150
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,440
Okay.

151
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,560
When this happened,

152
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,640
I knew nothing.

153
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,560
It's all Kong's fault.

154
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,080
We've known each other for so many years.

155
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,640
Don't you know me?

156
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,680
Do you think I'd do something like this?

157
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,159
I don't know you.

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,280
I don't know you.

159
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,240
I don't know you at all.

160
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Who are you?

161
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,400
One is hanging out with my girlfriend.

162
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,159
took my girlfriend away

163
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,840
and kicked me out of the company

164
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,840
and started a company.

165
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,440
Do you deserve to be my buddy?

166
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,600
Do you deserve it?

167
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,640
I've told you many times.

168
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,640
I was just comforting her.

169
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,480
Okay?

170
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,080
Before you break up,

171
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,600
I...

172
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,360
Forget it.

173
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,280
You don't trust me anyway.

174
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,200
Zhao Moyuan.

175
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,600
Can we

176
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,400
be friends again?

177
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,800
Don't worry.

178
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,320
You are our super VIP.

179
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,840
I'll keep it until noon.

180
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,760
Okay, bye.

181
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,160
Hello.

182
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,040
Miss Wang.

183
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,800
Don't worry.

184
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,680
Okay.

185
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,160
Up to 10 p.m. tonight.

186
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,400
Zhao Moyuan and May

187
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,280
The search volume has increased.

188
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,160
352 percent.

189
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,000
of May.

190
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,040
Hot search list.

191
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,760
The fourth place.

192
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,920
The total sales volume is over 40,000.

193
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,840
What's the ratio

194
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,080
of our own products?

195
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,480
2.5 to 1.

196
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,800
Not enough.

197
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,200
Start Plan B at 12:00.

198
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,840
with 2,000 minus 299

199
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,800
of 2,000 minus 299.

200
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,680
Okay.

201
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,600
Please guide the customers

202
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,560
to buy more joint products.

203
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,240
Okay.

204
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,600
Boss, the second store in Tientsin called and said

205
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,320
some yellow cows

206
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,520
want to buy limited edition

207
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,320
with the one-year coupon they sent last year.

208
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,640
But their manager disagreed.

209
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,680
so they got into a fight.

210
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,520
Let them buy it.

211
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,840
It's good to have a yellow cow as a publicity.

212
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,680
Okay.

213
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,480
Ask the PR department to prepare

214
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,320
for PR.

215
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,080
You go.

216
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,840
Got it.

217
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,480
Director Lei,

218
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,880
A few friends from the textile department

219
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,400
want to be the agent of Malaysia.

220
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,360
Do you have any documents?

221
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,760
Yes, I'll send it to you in ten minutes.

222
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,280
Watch the CCTV.

223
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,680
The coat line from the south store.

224
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,440
It's hot this year.

225
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,360
If it doesn't sell well,

226
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,640
transfer the goods to the north immediately.

227
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,280
Okay.

228
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,800
Hello, everyone. Listen to me.

229
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,960
Up to 10:11 this morning,

230
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,360
we have completed

231
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,120
two weeks earlier.

232
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,320
Wow.

233
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,640
We'd like to thank

234
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,720
Director Luo, Director Lei,

235
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,040
and Mr. Zhao Moyuan who hasn't arrived.

236
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
I announce

237
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,160
everyone's bonus

238
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,480
20%.

239
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,480
Wow.

240
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,480
I have one more sentence.

241
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,560
If you can't

242
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,840
next month,

243
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,240
Everyone's bonus

244
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,680
20%.

245
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,920
All right.

246
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,000
Let's move the bricks.

247
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,800
Director Lei.

248
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,280
Why didn't you smile just now?

249
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,080
Are you proud of your poor grades?

250
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,240
You're the best business director

251
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,960
in May.

252
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,440
one of them.

253
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,400
Where are you going?

254
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,080
Work hard.

255
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,280
After work,

256
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,800
I'll take you on a vacation, okay?

257
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,960
I'll definitely design

258
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,320
a perfect trip.

259
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,520
You're the boss

260
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,320
in the future.

261
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,040
You have the final say at home.

262
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,040
Who is the boss?

263
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,040
Dad.

264
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,840
Chairman.

265
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,320
What brings you here?

266
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,760
I just checked the finance department's data.

267
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,360
Although so far,

268
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,200
has been sold hundreds of thousands,

269
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,480
But it brought

270
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,360
to the company.

271
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,280
Director Lei,

272
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,160
How did you calculate the cost?

273
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,480
Is this your sales performance?

274
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,200
Dad.

275
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,800
Didn't I tell you before?

276
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,600
the joint design cost is high.

277
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,840
We'll definitely lose money.

278
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,840
You told me

279
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,120
as the advertising fee.

280
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,720
Didn't you support us?

281
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,640
When did I say that?

282
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,160
Did I say that?

283
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,520
Do you have meetings?

284
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,080
Do you have the company documents?

285
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,360
Why are you all standing here?

286
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,560
Get out.

287
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,040
Let's go.

288
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,240
Son, don't do this.

289
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,960
I've taken care of everything else.

290
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,880
From now on,

291
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,320
you don't have to

292
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,280
in front of this woman anymore.

293
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,280
Dad. Dad.

294
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,520
No.

295
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,520
What's wrong with you today?

296
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,760
Leo did his best for the company.

297
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,800
to the company.

298
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,320
You should know it well.

299
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,560
I know two things better.

300
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,080
First,

301
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,840
May is the world

302
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,760
by your mother and me.

303
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,120
I can't just watch

304
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,880
other women control it.

305
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,040
Second,

306
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,000
You are my son.

307
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,240
My only son.

308
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,400
He's very handsome.

309
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,640
We can't let a woman

310
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,200
because of a woman with broken shoes.

311
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,360
Director Lei,

312
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,600
Do you have anything else to say?

313
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,400
I think you misunderstood.

314
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,400
Our joint payment

315
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,760
may have some losses,

316
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,960
but according to its own style,

317
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,880
the margin rate is still

318
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,440
more than 20 percent.

319
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,400
You can take a look.

320
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,760
The self-owned design and sales

321
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,280
by our company.

322
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,400
Why should we

323
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,960
with the joint design?

324
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,720
Director Lei,

325
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,000
The project

326
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,960
the project of Zhao Moyuan and May.

327
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,120
is a

328
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,560
a complete failure.

329
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,720
It seems that

330
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,280
for a long time.

331
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
Chairman.

332
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,360
It's been a long time

333
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,400
for a long time.

334
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,920
After we sell

335
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,280
sell well,

336
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,920
you'll tear down the bridge.

337
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,240
You're so patient.

338
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,680
I sent a call yesterday.

339
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,840
At 1:30 p.m.,

340
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,320
the temporary board meeting will be held.

341
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,320
Director Lei can explain it

342
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,920
at the meeting.

343
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,680
the huge loss.

344
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,920
And

345
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,040
before the company's most important fashion show,

346
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,200
Why did you

347
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,600
for six days?

348
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,800
Please explain.

349
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,560
I want to see how many directors

350
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,720
will be on your side.

351
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,360
Dad, she's not absent for no reason.

352
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:03,720
She was...

353
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,480
Shut up.

354
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,280
Why are you so sure?

355
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,839
Looks like you've already

356
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,119
the board of directors.

357
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,400
You haven't given up

358
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,560
drive me away.

359
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:15,599
But don't forget.

360
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,359
my mission is arranged by the headquarters.

361
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,480
I've talked

362
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,440
with Linda SWangson.

363
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,680
As long as the board of May reached an agreement,

364
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,280
she's willing to change your appointment

365
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
and let you be in charge of

366
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,240
our expansion business in South America.

367
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,480
Dad, you can't do that.

368
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,360
Go back to your office.

369
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,600
May.

370
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,360
It's time for it to be named Du again.

371
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,040
Miss Lei, I advise you

372
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,000
If you're interested,

373
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,240
you'd better resign

374
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,920
before the board meeting.

375
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,000
Otherwise,

376
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,000
two sexual deals

377
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,960
to seduce the higher-ups.

378
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,920
If word gets out,

379
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,360
I can guarantee that

380
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,440
no company in fashion

381
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,640
dares to hire you again.

382
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,320
Du Xiuqi.

383
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,480
Explain it to me.

384
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,600
Okay.

385
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,320
Okay.

386
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,280
Chairman, what meeting do you want? Suit yourself.

387
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,840
You can announce whatever you want.

388
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,600
I won't resign.

389
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm not worried about my future either.

390
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,120
I've been too tired lately.

391
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,240
I need some rest.

392
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,160
Oh, right.

393
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,040
I forgot to tell you.

394
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,960
Your son is very considerate.

395
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,360
If I knew he was such a good actor,

396
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,400
I would have given him some tips.

397
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,240
You...

398
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,520
You...

399
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,440
Leo! Leo!

400
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,280
Stop right there!

401
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,200
If you want to find her,

402
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,560
don't call me your dad.

403
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,560
Dad.

404
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,000
I didn't expect the company I love so much

405
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
its manager

406
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,960
would treat

407
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,160
a diligent employee

408
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,400
to say this.

409
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,640
I'm disappointed in you.

410
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,560
Who is this?

411
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,240
This...

412
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,440
Dad, what's wrong?

413
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,240
Are you an idiot?

414
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,520
In that situation,

415
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,920
you're just a small soldier.

416
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,800
Will it work?

417
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,600
I don't care.

418
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,400
If the company

419
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,440
are like Mr. Du

420
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,680
like Mr. Du.

421
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,720
I'd rather go with you.

422
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,160
You're too young.

423
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,160
It's normal for a company

424
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,640
is just common.

425
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,960
If you have to be treated fairly every time,

426
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,200
you'll die miserably.

427
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,640
Better than Miya-to, right?

428
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,080
Mi Nam Jidu has used it.

429
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,520
Actually, I think

430
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,320
Mr. Du is not the kind of person

431
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:30,760
Alright.

432
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,560
I'm used to it. It's not the first time.

433
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,160
Don't get involved in the future.

434
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,840
I know how to solve it.

435
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,360
What should we do this afternoon?

436
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,120
Those directors

437
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,480
will listen to Mr. Du.

438
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,120
Do you think

439
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,320
for so long,

440
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,600
the Du family still has nothing on them.

441
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,680
in my hands?

442
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,520
The sky hasn't collapsed yet. Don't worry.

443
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,360
Go back to work.

444
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,160
Let's go.

445
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,240
Coco.

446
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,760
Is Boss okay?

447
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,560
What does Mr. Du want?

448
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,440
Is he going to tear down the bridge?

449
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,160
That's too much.

450
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,840
Capitalists are cunning.

451
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,880
Coco.

452
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,240
I think you should contact him right away.

453
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:25,880
Patrick.

454
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,160
See if there is any way

455
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,640
to suppress Mr. Du.

456
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,400
Right.

457
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,720
Okay.

458
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,520
What?

459
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,160
This isn't right.

460
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,280
This is too calm.

461
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,320
I forgot to tell you something.

462
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,280
I heard

463
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,960
After Vincent's incident,

464
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,200
Leo has a clear depression tendency.

465
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,880
She even went to see a psychiatrist.

466
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,480
The psychiatrist asked her to take medicine.

467
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,840
She was afraid of dependence, so...

468
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,800
she hates it.

469
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,640
Okay, I got it.

470
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,160
What's wrong?

471
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,280
What's going on?

472
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,760
I'll go find her.

473
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,280
Have you seen Director Lei?

474
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,000
I'm also looking for her.

475
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,240
Do you know

476
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,600
means to her?

477
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,280
It means

478
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,120
she was betrayed

479
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,360
who claimed to love her.

480
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,320
Moyuan just told me

481
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,120
she's been taking antidepressants lately.

482
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,600
Do you know that?

483
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,720
Wait.

484
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,680
Why didn’t Zhao Moyuan tell us earlier?

485
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,960
Get everyone

486
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,800
to find her.

487
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,160
She can't be alone right now.

488
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,040
Please.

489
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,040
And...

490
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,400
I'm not saying I love her.

491
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,680
I just love her.

492
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,840
Hello

493
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,920
Have you seen Director Lei?

494
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,600
I saw her go out just now.

495
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,720
Hello, Coco.

496
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,920
The receptionist said she saw the boss.

497
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,120
She just left the company.

498
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,360
Try this.

499
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,000
Here.

500
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,280
Has Director Lei been here?

501
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
No.

502
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,240
I told myself

503
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,240
if this battle

504
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,840
defeat Zhou Bai’an,

505
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,200
I’ll jump off the rooftop of May.

506
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,840
Hello, Mr. Du.

507
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,240
Leo.

508
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,360
I finally found you.

509
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,200
What are you doing here?

510
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,560
Are you afraid I'll jump?

511
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,840
The fence is so high.

512
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,840
It's not elegant to flip over.

513
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,040
Don't worry.

514
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,720
I'm here to apologize to you.

515
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,520
For what?

516
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:27,960
I shouldn't have

517
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
our promise.

518
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,840
I'll take a photo for you.

519
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,680
I really don't know

520
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,400
how my father got that photo.

521
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,720
He must have stolen my account.

522
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,800
But I swear to you,

523
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,840
my feelings for you are real.

524
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,640
I've never acted in front of you.

525
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,440
Also,

526
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,680
I shouldn't have threatened me

527
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,040
threatening me

528
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,200
I didn't take your side in time.

529
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,400
But he is my father.

530
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,800
Please understand.

531
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,200
If you're done, let's go.

532
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,920
Don't disturb my mood to enjoy the scenery.

533
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,200
I know.

534
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,840
No matter what I say now,

535
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,640
I can't make up for my hurt to you.

536
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:16,400
But I still have to

537
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,960
apologize to you

538
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,880
for my father and myself.

539
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,880
I'm a jerk.

540
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,360
I let you down.

541
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,880
I'm sorry.

542
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,960
You're welcome, Mr. Du.

543
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,360
There's no relationship between us.

544
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,080
We just met

545
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,560
when we were bored.

546
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,880
If you really feel sorry,

547
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,960
you can persuade your father.

548
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,680
to give up persuading or exile me.

549
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,400
But I have

550
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,560
my own way.

551
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,880
I can announce to the media

552
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,920
that you

553
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,120
to sexually harass me.

554
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,480
When the scandal comes out,

555
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,000
the sales will decrease in May.

556
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,120
It's not worth it.

557
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,480
I tried to persuade him,

558
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,560
But he didn't listen.

559
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,400
then both sides will suffer.

560
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,680
Okay.

561
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
If you want to do this,

562
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,160
I will tell the media

563
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,560
to the media.

564
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,920
I can't change what has happened.

565
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,760
But I can

566
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,000
bear it with you.

567
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,800
Don't come over.

568
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,760
Even if I jump today,

569
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,840
it should be me.

570
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,880
I promised you

571
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,880
I will never let you go down.

572
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,280
I let you down.

573
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,320
When you needed me the most,

574
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,560
when you needed me the most.

575
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,520
Come down. Aren't you afraid of heights?

576
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,200
I'll catch you

577
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,640
I'll catch you.

578
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,960
I won't let you fall again.

579
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,680
I'll be your last line of defense.

580
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,240
It's okay.

581
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,200
You scared me.

582
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,840
Everyone.

583
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,520
We are all the people our boss brought out.

584
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,400
If Mr. Du

585
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,720
to exile Director Lei,

586
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,240
The story of the cold teeth.

587
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,560
You all understand, right?

588
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,120
So,

589
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,040
you want to start from the board meeting in the afternoon?

590
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,600
Yes.

591
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,080
Considering Leo's negligence,

592
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,280
as Chairman of May,

593
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,160
as Chairman of May.

594
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,440
From today onwards,

595
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,960
the business director, Leo,

596
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,880
will not be involved in any related

597
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,960
Sales and purchase

598
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,280
and marketing management.

599
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,240
management,

600
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,480
to the company.

601
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,280
in South America.

602
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,960
Of course, if you think South America is too far away,

603
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,280
you can choose to resign.

604
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,240
Now, please vote

605
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,280
to the president.

606
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,280
Wait.

607
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,000
I'm the general manager of the company.

608
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,480
You can't vote without me.

609
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,040
Everyone.

610
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,280
We all know

611
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,520
what happened in the past week.

612
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,520
I hope

613
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,880
can make an objective judgment

614
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,280
of Director Lei's efforts.

615
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,360
I hope

616
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,760
can vote

617
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,680
fair and square.

618
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,520
I hope you can oppose

619
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,920
what the chairman just proposed.

620
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,680
Please.

621
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,520
Du Xiuqi.

622
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,960
If the meeting is approved,

623
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,000
I'll resign right away.

624
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,760
Are you crazy?

625
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,480
Are you really going to

626
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,640
with this woman?

627
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,600
That's right.

628
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,440
I will sell

629
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,360
in May.

630
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,520
Because I don't believe

631
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,960
a company under my father's leadership

632
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,000
under my father's leadership.

633
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,320
Okay.

634
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,960
Okay.

635
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,120
The voting starts now.

636
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,720
I want to see

637
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,800
if you are a man of your word.

638
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,760
Raise your hand if you agree with the president.

639
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,160
Dear directors,

640
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,720
Before you vote,

641
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,160
I have an announcement to make.

642
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,520
If Director Lei

643
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,320
was cleared

644
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,480
in May.

645
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
All the buyers

646
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,240
will be with her.

647
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,080
What are you doing?

648
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,840
This is the board of directors.

649
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,920
Get out!

650
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,000
According to the company's rules,

651
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,200
I’m the general manager.

652
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,680
I have the right to let the staff

653
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,360
to attend the board meeting.

654
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,360
As the main executive department

655
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,040
of this project,

656
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,200
We don't know why the president

657
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,360
deny the result of this project.

658
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,040
I’m worried

659
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,400
the directors would be misled.

660
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,800
So we made this form.

661
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,080
The first half of the blue part

662
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,120
is the sales and profits

663
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,960
all sales and profits

664
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,000
has a detailed project and a total and statistics.

665
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,560
And the second half of the red part

666
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,000
is Director Lei and all our buyers.

667
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,920
resigned,

668
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,040
the project will be terminated.

669
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,920
it will bring great losses to the company.

670
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,120
If you think it's too complicated,

671
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,240
we can report it directly.

672
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,480
The final number.

673
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,400
In the next two months,

674
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,600
in two months.

675
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,720
Half a year, 7.6.4 billion.

676
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,440
These are the money

677
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,400
in your stocks.

678
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,400
So we beg all directors

679
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,680
to consider it carefully.

680
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,240
They said what I wanted to say.

681
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,560
Everyone.

682
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,680
I can guarantee that after I leave,

683
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:34,920
no professional manager

684
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,560
any professional manager

685
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,480
to take over

686
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,280
the project that suddenly died.

687
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,280
I wonder

688
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,720
hope to see May

689
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,400
to buy handmade in May

690
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,720
and continue to be proud?

691
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,560
or

692
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,120
go back to the old path.

693
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,120
Okay.

694
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,520
Let's vote.

695
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,160
Those who oppose

696
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,600
please raise your hand.

697
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,400
What are you doing?

698
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,800
Do you really believe it?

699
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,440
I'm sorry, Chairman.

700
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,960
I really appreciate Director Lei's creativity.

701
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,840
I think so too.

702
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,440
Director Lei can

703
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,880
in this position.

704
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,320
For the sake of the company.

705
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,240
If the sales and profit are good,

706
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,960
the shareholders will give us an explanation.

707
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,720
Yes.

708
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,520
If it were someone else,

709
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,920
he wouldn’t be able to take over the business.

710
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,080
Mr. Du, you are not feeling well.

711
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,520
Why don’t you go back and rest more?

712
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,080
It's normal for young people to fall in love.

713
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,160
Why are you making a fuss?

714
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,160
It's okay.

715
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,680
He pretended.

716
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,320
And then?

717
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,360
Did Mr. Du cry

718
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,840
and live alone

719
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,880
in the conference room.

720
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,360
What are you talking about, you jinx?

721
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,239
He’s Mr. Du’s father.

722
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,679
Anyway, Mr. Du

723
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,480
walked into the elevator.

724
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,600
Mr. Du wanted to see him off, but he didn't.

725
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,320
Will Mr. Du and Leo

726
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:32,440
are in a romantic relationship now?

727
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,520
Then they are there.

728
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,960
Yes.

729
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,800
But I

730
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,280
spend time in the office.

731
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,760
Sales are like champagne.

732
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,480
and take the profit rate as a rose.

733
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,840
Discussing marketing plans is flirting.

734
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,280
It's like

735
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,080
a movie.

736
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,360
This is the lifestyle of the executive.

737
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,040
Come on.

738
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,400
We low management don't understand.

739
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,800
Sorry, everyone.

740
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,920
I'm late.

741
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,239
I heard everything from her today.

742
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:57,840
You won a big victory at the meeting today.

743
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,440
Right?

744
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,760
Awesome.

745
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,480
Prince Charming, your garment-making series

746
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,440
is so popular.

747
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,080
Let me tell you.

748
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,840
reporters are outside now.

749
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,080
Keep a low profile.

750
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,440
What's so great about that?

751
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,080
Don't all the clothes I make cost money?

752
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,880
Okay.

753
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,080
Today is a good day.

754
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,160
For the sake of Patrick Cho,

755
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,840
For Oh-wol.

756
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,720
Cheers, okay?

757
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,520
Cheers. Cheers.

758
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,680
This is nice.

759
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,280
What do you mean?

760
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,240
It's nice.

761
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,400
It's like a drama.

762
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,040
Everyone has a good ending.

763
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,080
Right?

764
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:14,720
Then

765
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,680
make us more beautiful.

766
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,600
OK?

767
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Next time.

768
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,000
I won't let you off next time.

769
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,520
Morning, boss.

770
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,920
What’s up?

771
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,680
I discussed with Mr. Du yesterday

772
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,640
to expand my current shopping skills.

773
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,920
So we need to promote two assistant managers.

774
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,360
I have two candidates now.

775
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,400
Tina, and you.

776
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,840
Thank you for helping Zhao Yuan

777
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,720
for your contribution

778
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,840
for Zhao Yuyuan and May.

779
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,520
Congratulations on your promotion.

780
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,480
Why? You don't want to?

781
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,120
Of course I do.

782
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,360
Please come over here.

783
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,000
We just entered this.

784
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,880
You can take a look.

785
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,640
Okay, thank you.

786
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,200
Ask me if you have any questions.

787
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,280
Okay, thank you.

788
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,720
Dad, what brings you here?

789
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,280
The factory had a power outage today.

790
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,320
I came out to see you.

791
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,440
I saw the news.

792
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,720
that your business is good.

793
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,680
This shop seems to have changed

794
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,480
There are so many customers

795
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,680
I'm not used to it.

796
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,440
You just work hard.

797
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,080
Ding is more practical than you.

798
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,880
Come on.

799
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,400
Let me show you downstairs.

800
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,360
Sit.

801
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,120
What's wrong?

802
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,040
Sure.

803
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,000
I'm a little scared.

804
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,760
Scared of what?

805
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:44,800
Hug me.

806
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,120
Stay by my side.

807
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,360
I'll always be by your side.

808
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,120
How about

809
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,800
I tell you a good news?

810
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,600
I have bad news for you.

811
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,280
What's wrong? Did something happen?

812
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,880
I came today

813
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,080
to tell you something.

814
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,040
I felt uncomfortable last week.

815
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,320
I went for a check-up.

816
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:27,360
The results just came out.

817
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,800
It's confirmed.

818
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,080
What's wrong with him?

819
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,640
lymphache.

820
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,640
I know.

821
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,240
You always look down on us.

822
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,680
Electronic electronic organs.

823
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,920
But in this situation,

824
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,000
home and company

825
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,040
I can only leave them to you.

826
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,280
As for Yuan, I think

827
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,600
Ding manages it well.

828
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:10,840
With her,

829
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,120
Don't worry.

830
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:17,120
Me too.

831
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,280
I know

832
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,240
you had a good time in May.

833
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,440
But during this special time,

834
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,240
can I

835
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,640
ask you for another favor?

836
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,360
Go ahead.

837
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,200
Can you

838
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,480
for a while?

839
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,360
Thank you for

840
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:47,240
for your contribution

841
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,320
for Zhao Yuyuan and May.

842
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,840
Congratulations on your promotion.

843
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,520
Can I?
