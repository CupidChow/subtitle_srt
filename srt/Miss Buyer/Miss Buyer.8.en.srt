1
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,400
I saw

2
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,840
I saw it.

3
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,280
That video.

4
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,360
You might not believe it.

5
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,360
I recorded that video while playing games.

6
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,560
My best friend edited it.

7
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,480
and sent it to you secretly.

8
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,480
Delete it.

9
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
Just pretend you didn't see it.

10
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,640
Don't be so nice to me.

11
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,400
That man is right.

12
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,360
I'm a scumbag.

13
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,680
I can dump you

14
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,120
I can dump you and fall in love with someone else.

15
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,400
To get into a better company,

16
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,760
I searched everywhere to get a job.

17
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,120
I'm not good enough for you.

18
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,480
Just let me go

19
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,400
and yourself.

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,400
I want to give up too.

21
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,560
But what can I do?

22
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,200
to meet you like this?

23
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,840
It must be fate.

24
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,680
I won't give up.

25
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,920
Sure.

26
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,920
I beg you.

27
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
Can you stop being silly?

28
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,480
I said

29
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,280
this is my own business.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,840
Even if I'm stupid,

31
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,200
I hope foolish people are lucky.

32
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,040
Anyway, I'll let you go today.

33
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,840
If I meet

34
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,920
another chance like this,

35
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,120
I will definitely...

36
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,200
You know.

37
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,400
Go to sleep. I'm leaving.

38
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,480
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,200
Sa Hyun. Sa Hyun.

40
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
I'm sorry.

41
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,280
I'm not going back.

42
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,040
I must find a way

43
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,840
to stay in Shanghai.

44
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,840
I must live a decent life

45
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,760
and make Lin Sixian regret.

46
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,760
That's fine. Don't be silly again.

47
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,079
No matter how good you become,

48
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,399
I won't be with you.

49
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,920
I have changed my mind.

50
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,079
The only person I love is Jiang Wenwen.

51
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,079
Did you hear that?

52
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,480
You're a good girl.

53
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,680
But marriage and dating are different.

54
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,960
I'm a scumbag who's disloyal.

55
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
Don't waste your time on me.

56
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,200
Can I have a drink?

57
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,520
My wine is strong.

58
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,360
The stronger, the better.

59
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,480
Look at you.

60
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,360
you don't look like you can drink.

61
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,520
That's enough.

62
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,960
Don't waste my good wine.

63
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,680
What? You went to a bar at night

64
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,080
and met an old lover.

65
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,840
and got the room card.

66
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,560
When we get to the room,

67
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,800
it doesn't feel like a home run.

68
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,080
How do you know?

69
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,680
When I was a party maniac,

70
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,520
you probably didn't graduate from middle school.

71
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,640
Do you think

72
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,800
Am I not attractive?

73
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,800
I sent her home.

74
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,080
Nothing happened.

75
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,480
You're a girl.

76
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,080
you should behave yourself sometimes.

77
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,800
I suggest you not to go to the bar in the future.

78
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,960
Don't say anything

79
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,120
in the middle of the night.

80
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,080
may lead to misunderstandings.

81
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,760
Do you understand?

82
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,560
You're right.

83
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,240
I...

84
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,360
I'm fine. I'm just a little depressed.

85
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,520
When you drink some wine for the first time,

86
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,200
you'll think it's choking.

87
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,200
But when you drink the second cup,

88
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,120
It's smooth. Try it.

89
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,080
No.

90
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,480
I'll make it dirty.

91
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,080
It's already dirty.

92
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Use it.

93
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,440
Steven Niji's...

94
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,000
You bastard!

95
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,159
You use such a good handkerchief.

96
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,560
Now you still have time to think about this.

97
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,800
It means you're still alive.

98
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,240
You're not too sad.

99
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,000
Zhao Moyuan.

100
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,040
Let me ask you.

101
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,560
Tell me.

102
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,440
should I let go?

103
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,040
If you want me to answer you,

104
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll let you go.

105
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,560
Of course, I have to ask you.

106
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,040
Do you think

107
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,040
if you let it go?

108
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,120
No.

109
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,160
That's it.

110
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,560
Let it solve it.

111
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,160
How is it?

112
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,240
Does it taste better now?

113
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,120
Besides data analysis,

114
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,040
and the changes of the company's inventory.

115
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,040
The buyer has another important duty.

116
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,920
Choose.

117
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,480
According to the information of the fashion week

118
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,360
of the two seasons.

119
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,560
The future trend

120
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,880
Change it into reality.

121
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,480
This is our basic work.

122
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,680
What is the business concept

123
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,040
in May these years?

124
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:22,920
Tina.

125
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,880
It's fast fashion.

126
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,360
Before May, hundreds of designers

127
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,480
are in charge of searching possible elements

128
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,000
from various fashion press conference.

129
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:31,920
After

130
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,440
after changing the style,

131
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,320
and send the goods

132
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,720
at the fastest speed.

133
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,680
The whole process takes three weeks at the earliest.

134
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,160
That's right.

135
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,680
A top fashion brand.

136
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,600
It takes four months

137
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,800
it takes four months.

138
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,240
And fast fashion brands

139
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,680
in less than a month.

140
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,440
This is their way of winning.

141
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,120
But in the past few years in May,

142
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,720
in May these years?

143
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,480
Coco.

144
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,040
because the whole clothing market in China

145
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
is not good enough.

146
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,600
Wrong.

147
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,360
It's because we just

148
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,880
just a simple imitation.

149
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,800
We didn't catch the fast-fashioned soul.

150
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,440
Without many competitors,

151
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,240
we can still live well

152
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,040
with some connections.

153
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
But now it's faster than May.

154
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,560
There are hundreds of brands

155
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,560
are more than hundreds.

156
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,600
Learn from me.

157
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,440
Learn from me.

158
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,680
This is

159
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,680
from Milan Fashion Week half a month ago.

160
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,680
There are some well-informed manufacturers

161
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,480
have made their

162
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,560
according to them.

163
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,560
So this assessment

164
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,360
for you.

165
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,920
The rules are simple.

166
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,040
Each person has half a month.

167
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,120
200,000 budget

168
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,120
will be put into the store

169
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,120
according to your purchase.

170
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,800
Everything goes according to the data.

171
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,920
The two with the worst grades will be eliminated.

172
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,040
It's time to test your taste

173
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,120
and ability.

174
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
Come on, guys.

175
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,880
How is it?

176
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,160
I have no idea.

177
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,800
What are these designers

178
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,240
these designers are doing?

179
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,040
I don't understand.

180
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,440
Look at this dress.

181
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,440
It looks like a cloth bag.

182
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,160
Who can wear it?

183
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,360
How can I

184
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,600
summarize the elements and choose the style?

185
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,880
It's normal that

186
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,120
It's normal that there are differences.

187
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,560
You were an amateur.

188
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,680
No wonder you don't know this.

189
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,920
Tina, can't you talk properly?

190
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,040
Don't get me wrong. I mean no harm.

191
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,680
I'm just stating the facts.

192
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,360
Coco, you're already very talented.

193
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,120
But you haven't received

194
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,240
system fashion education.

195
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,000
So the feeling

196
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,360
in this aspect.

197
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,480
I personally suggest

198
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,560
you can talk to your colleagues

199
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,360
in the Design Department.

200
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,680
and have a look.

201
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,040
like modern art.

202
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,720
It's not hard to feel it.

203
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,120
I'll go get the parcel.

204
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,240
Take your time.

205
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,000
Thank you.

206
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,560
You're welcome.

207
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,120
The team is not disbanded yet.

208
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,240
We are still a team.

209
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,680
We should help each other.

210
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,480
It's beneficial, isn't it?

211
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,880
Tell me, what do you like about me this time?

212
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,320
Rainbow shop.

213
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
I want to put the small quantity there for a trial sale.

214
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,920
This promotion

215
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,440
is the most effective.

216
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,440
I have confidence in my design.

217
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,040
But if you want to sell well,

218
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,560
we have to rely on sales.

219
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,240
Coco.

220
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,600
You seem to know the manager there.

221
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,240
Okay, I'll talk to Seo-jin for you.

222
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,600
So straightforward.

223
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,920
As a return of friendship,

224
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,320
I have a secret for you.

225
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,160
Do you want to hear it?

226
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,920
The whole company is saying that

227
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,920
you have a special relationship with the boss.

228
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,800
What do you mean?

229
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,120
Are they crazy?

230
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,800
I'm totally fine.

231
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,160
Pure.

232
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,040
During the last celebration party,

233
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,600
Boss saw your foundation

234
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,360
in front of the whole company.

235
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,480
What is this?

236
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,480
We often get close to each other.

237
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,040
Why didn't they pass it?

238
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,000
What do we have?

239
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,360
Calm down.

240
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,880
You want to make a clean choice?

241
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,040
Let me give you an idea.

242
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,600
Go ahead.

243
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,120
Didn't Mr. Du discuss something with you

244
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,440
in the dressing room yesterday?

245
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,720
Tell him.

246
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,120
that no one

247
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,480
to say you and Boss.

248
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,040
Zhou Tianna.

249
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,720
Stop!

250
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,920
Stop!

251
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,680
Zhou Tianna, stop!

252
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,720
I'm sorry.

253
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,680
Stop! Stop!

254
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,720
Stop! Stop!

255
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,160
Stop. Stop.

256
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,680
I'm sorry, okay?

257
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,480
I'm sorry. No.

258
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,600
If you keep talking nonsense,

259
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,360
I'll kill you.

260
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,000
What are you doing?

261
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,600
Annoying.

262
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,720
If I didn't want to owe you,

263
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,920
about Guo Youming,

264
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,120
I don't want to talk too much.

265
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,680
You

266
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,680
don't do things

267
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,120
in the company.

268
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,720
There are many people in this company.

269
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,800
One word and one word,

270
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,120
You might become

271
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,720
a monster

272
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,880
in the company.

273
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,040
Thank you.

274
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,720
If you don't spread rumors about the sample room,

275
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,920
who would know?

276
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,240
Jiang Jie knew it.

277
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,320
She won't gossip like you.

278
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,240
Do you still believe

279
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,680
she's your good friend?

280
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,800
Do you know

281
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,920
who leaked the information

282
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,560
Who leaked it to Boss?

283
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,680
She

284
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,160
She's been trying to please the boss.

285
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,360
Unfortunately,

286
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,920
Boss doesn’t like her.

287
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,000
She gave me a set of Shishengtang a few days ago.

288
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,680
She asked me to

289
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,120
in front of the boss.

290
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,880
You have to stay no matter what.

291
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,560
Now that it's done,

292
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,800
you start yelling at me.

293
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,440
What's with the long face?

294
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,040
What era is it now?

295
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,440
Do you still believe in plastic sisterhood?

296
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,120
In my opinion,

297
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,680
our friendship

298
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,480
based on interests.

299
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,440
is more practical.

300
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:22,920
What do you think?

301
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,240
Thank you.

302
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,839
How was your conversation?

303
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,119
Not bad.

304
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,079
Anyway, you can only believe

305
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,720
what she said.

306
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,319
She must think

307
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,599
Director Lei is always on your side.

308
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,440
so he wants to sell well and borrow some light.

309
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,840
Xiaojie

310
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,960
I want to ask you something.

311
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,840
Did you ask someone else

312
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,200
Aside from asking me, did you ask someone else?

313
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,840
No.

314
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Other than you,

315
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,840
in front of Leo.

316
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,360
Besides Mr. Du,

317
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,040
and your department.

318
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,840
I also asked someone to send something.

319
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,040
Don't you think there are too many people to say nice things?

320
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:18,960
Right?

321
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,320
By the way, about Guo Youming,

322
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,080
how did the boss find out?

323
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,240
Is it really wiretapping?

324
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,960
We're in the same department.

325
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,680
There are no walls that are not breathable.

326
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,080
I think the one who told the boss

327
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,200
must be among those who stay.

328
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,720
Do you think

329
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,840
of honesty and honesty

330
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,600
How much is the difference?

331
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,200
The friendship between classmates

332
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,560
which is more real

333
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,960
Which one is more real?

334
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,600
Or you shouldn't believe it?

335
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,440
the unfinished provocation?

336
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,200
Because no matter how sincere the emotion is,

337
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,600
in front of the questionable magnifier,

338
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,200
the dust and cracks will be found.

339
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,720
I suddenly feel so tired.

340
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,440
Why can't this world

341
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,040
be simpler?

342
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,360
But Tina is right about one thing.

343
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,720
You should talk to the designers

344
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,600
with the designers.

345
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,720
How about we go to

346
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,600
go to the Chao Store on Changle Road tomorrow?

347
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,600
Call Yangyang from the Design Department.

348
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,840
No need.

349
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,720
It’s a weekend. You should spend more time with Tang Li.

350
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,840
I know a designer too.

351
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,320
Really?

352
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,200
You even read

353
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,320
into Ella.

354
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,200
I don't know any designer.

355
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,440
The designer I know

356
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,600
is really awesome.

357
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
and very handsome.

358
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,600
He can also

359
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,040
some equipment and art.

360
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,680
I was thinking about going to his exhibition.

361
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,480
By the way,

362
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,200
I need to call him back.

363
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,960
Hello, guru.

364
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:52,800
Well,

365
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,440
I want to go to your exhibition this weekend.

366
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,080
You're going to my exhibition?

367
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,240
My exhibition ends

368
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,920
ends at 6:30 tonight.

369
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,040
Are you kidding me?

370
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,440
I have no money and no color.

371
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,680
Why would I lie to you?

372
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,840
You still have three hours.

373
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
Are you going?

374
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,440
Can we buy tickets at the scene?

375
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,480
Any discount?

376
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,120
When you go to the scene,

377
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,800
ask the staff to tell Xu Fei’s name.

378
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,720
He will definitely let you in.

379
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,720
That's it. I have something to do.

380
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,080
I have to go, Xu Fei.

381
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,320
Hello? Hello?

382
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,720
Amanda.

383
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,840
What do you think of Chinese culture?

384
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,640
Amanda, wait. You like it?

385
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,840
Wait.

386
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,120
Sorry.

387
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,440
How long are you staying?

388
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,320
Armanda.

389
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Partrick.

390
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,440
Are you going to give me a surprise?

391
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,360
Yes. Surprise.

392
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,440
You look good.

393
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,120
I know you're here.

394
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,600
I saw the news that

395
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,840
about your father visiting China.

396
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,200
Right?

397
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,080
Yes.

398
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,600
So this is your shop?

399
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,320
Yes.

400
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,080
This place looks nice.

401
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,240
Thank you.

402
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:58,840
Let's go inside.

403
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,440
Take a walk.

404
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,080
Of course.

405
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,360
Boss.

406
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,720
I want to take a leave this afternoon

407
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,800
to meet a designer, okay?

408
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,920
Okay, go ahead.

409
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,240
I'm free this Friday afternoon anyway.

410
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
Thank you, boss.

411
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,440
Wait.

412
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,920
Go ahead.

413
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,480
Director Lei.

414
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,680
Although men's clothes only occupy the company,

415
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,240
of the company,

416
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,200
But if you give it to a rookie like Ding Yike,

417
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,440
Who will take responsibility if something happens?

418
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,200
I'll take care of my people.

419
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,920
Don't worry.

420
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,080
Your people.

421
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,560
How dare you!

422
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,320
How dare you let her out

423
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,360
at work.

424
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,080
Why do I feel

425
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,080
she's afraid of you?

426
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,120
Love

427
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,960
about love.

428
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,600
Director Lei,

429
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,480
Although love

430
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,680
in the company's rules and regulations,

431
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,840
in the company's rules.

432
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,720
But if you don't want to do it,

433
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,320
What about you?

434
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,360
This is a big problem.

435
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,560
But if

436
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,440
he doesn't like you at all,

437
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,120
It will cause trouble.

438
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,800
What are you doing?

439
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,080
Tell me if you're jealous.

440
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,600
Hello.

441
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,240
This place needs tickets to get in.

442
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,560
Well,

443
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,440
a staff named Xu Fei

444
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,720
He said he was waiting for me inside.

445
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,720
Come in.

446
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,240
Look.

447
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,840
It's suppressing

448
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,080
in depression.

449
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,120
It shows a will

450
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,120
and perseverance.

451
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,360
It reminds me of

452
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,960
the one in Bukjae.

453
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,960
In the surfing in Kanagawa

454
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,720
Is this art?

455
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,360
It's a new work.

456
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,040
Color cutting.

457
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,360
Why is it so popular?

458
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,360
Do you like it?

459
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,560
Are you talking to me?

460
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,960
Of course.

461
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,320
Yes.

462
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,960
Where exactly do you like it?

463
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,320
There are many colors.

464
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,800
This style is also special.

465
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,320
I think

466
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,840
these bold colors

467
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,360
are very decorated.

468
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,960
It reminds me of Pop art.

469
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,680
The soul of the fabric lies in its muscle.

470
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,120
What do you think?

471
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,440
I think...

472
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,200
Next time,

473
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,120
when you want to watch the art exhibition,

474
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:04,920
when others ask you

475
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,080
and you don't know how to answer,

476
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,840
you can ask back and remember three key points.

477
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,200
Soul connection.

478
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,320
Add a particularly profound

479
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,480
artistic name.

480
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,840
That way, your squeeze will explode.

481
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,440
Hello, miss.

482
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,040
I am Xu Fei.

483
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,680
My idol's assistant and running errands.

484
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,320
Miss.

485
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,320
I should have known

486
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,680
than in the photo,

487
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,720
I should have run to you

488
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,920
to see you.

489
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,200
The sooner I see you,

490
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,200
the more wonderful life is.

491
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,240
The prince charming you mentioned

492
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,720
Zhao Moyuan?

493
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,440
Yes.

494
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,960
He said I'm a bumpkin.

495
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,680
No, no, no.

496
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,040
Now is Beijing time.

497
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,840
4:38 minutes and 03 seconds.

498
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,480
In the future,

499
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,320
82 minutes and 57 seconds,

500
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,800
in your eyes and heart

501
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,440
in your eyes.

502
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,440
No other men.

503
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,200
Let's go.

504
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,120
Nice to meet you.

505
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,040
Likewise.

506
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,440
How about this?

507
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,120
remember to send me an email tomorrow.

508
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,320
Let's make an appointment next week

509
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,800
to talk about

510
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,720
private equity investment.

511
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,840
Sure.

512
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,440
I have something to do. I'll go back first.

513
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,960
Take care.

514
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,840
Bye.

515
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,480
Thank you for bringing me here.

516
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,440
Even the vice president of our company

517
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,720
the vice president of our company.

518
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,320
The annual party sponsored by our company

519
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,960
We don't let outsiders take advantage of us.

520
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,840
But...

521
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,120
Are you just thanking me?

522
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,480
I want to kiss you, but...

523
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:09,960
There are too many people here.

524
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,440
Gosh.

525
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,040
Hello, Director?

526
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:18,440
I...

527
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,080
Use mine.

528
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,960
Sir.

529
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:38,320
I've hit the South Wall, Wenwen.

530
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,960
It hurts so much that I can't stop crying.

531
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,080
Don't get me wrong.

532
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,840
I can explain this.

533
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,440
She sent this.

534
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,960
I didn't reply at all.

535
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,320
But you didn't delete it.

536
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,320
I know.

537
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,320
Everyone has their past.

538
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,800
I can pretend to be deaf

539
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
in this period of time.

540
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,560
but it doesn't mean I don't care at all.

541
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,840
Ms Ding can't let you go.

542
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:09,840
That's her problem.

543
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,320
But if you let her be like this,

544
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,960
it will become our problem.

545
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,240
Wenwen, actually I...

546
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,480
Don't worry.

547
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,200
I'm not very angry yet.

548
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,200
Sa Hyun.

549
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,120
I'm trying my best to run our future.

550
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,600
If you want to continue,

551
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,720
get rid of your relationship as soon as possible.

552
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,360
Okay?

553
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,120
Okay.

554
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,600
As you can see,

555
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,200
Director Jiang must be busy looking for me.

556
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,440
I'm leaving.

557
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,720
Wenwen.

558
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:56,640
You...

559
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:57,800
You...

560
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,960
You drank just now.

561
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,360
I can't drive by myself.

562
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,680
Sa Hyun.

563
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,600
Except you,

564
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,680
I can take a taxi.

565
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,040
subway.

566
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,200
I have many choices.

567
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,080
This part

568
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,840
should be Zhao Moyuan.

569
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,440
the Space theme

570
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,040
in 2016.

571
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,440
It's mainly about

572
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,320
comparison between wire and yarn

573
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,960
to show the sense of suspense, right?

574
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,240
Correct.

575
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,720
It's really different

576
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,240
The effect is really different.

577
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,600
But

578
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,320
I still have a question.

579
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,960
He used to have various colors.

580
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,600
Why are there only black and white

581
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,960
in the past few years?

582
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,560
Let me tell you a secret.

583
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,040
Do you know why

584
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,440
black is his favorite?

585
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,080
Because black is gentle and arrogant.

586
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,840
It's casual and mysterious.

587
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,440
The simpler it is,

588
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,320
the more challenging it is.

589
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
Okay, it was a public version.

590
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,720
Do you want to hear a private version?

591
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,360
Private version

592
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,560
actually choose black fabric.

593
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,920
to save a lot of money.

594
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,600
As long as you get the order,

595
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,200
you can use it again if you can't finish it this time.

596
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,600
I see.

597
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,800
Miss.

598
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,600
This is a secret.

599
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,600
If you can't protect it,

600
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,320
Even if you're so beautiful,

601
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,840
I will still...

602
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,080
Do you always

603
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,600
always talk like this?

604
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,200
Of course not.

605
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,840
I'm doing this

606
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:19,840
in front of you

607
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,720
in front of you?

608
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,960
I must work hard.

609
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,680
Do you see

610
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,440
my hot heart?

611
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,040
Next time,

612
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,680
before you say that again,

613
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,800
Can we do a high-level warning in front?

614
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,720
It seems that you know some jokes.

615
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,920
We're friends.

616
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,800
No wonder I cried

617
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,360
when I ate your fried rice yesterday.

618
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,360
It turns out that it's been 500 years.

619
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,480
Fried rice with egg.

620
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,720
is the fried rice

621
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,960
you made for my idol.

622
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,040
You must want to know

623
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,840
why I'm in the distance, right?

624
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,680
Do you think

625
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,800
my prince charming

626
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,080
and busy.

627
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,800
who is addicted to creation every day.

628
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,600
every day.

629
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,320
Will he collect money and look after the store?

630
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,440
His glorious life

631
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,040
needs to be with these great artists.

632
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,560
the presidential daughter and cousin

633
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,320
Brother Ah Tang and the others came to spend their time together.

634
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,159
As for other trivial matters,

635
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,600
just leave it to me

636
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,719
to deal with it.

637
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
You're exaggerating.

638
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,360
The daughter of the president?

639
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,880
You've read too many online novels.

640
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,560
You don't believe me.

641
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,199
Did you see that?

642
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,679
The picture wall of the first daughter.

643
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,400
It's hard to

644
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,560
in the same bed with me.

645
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,800
with me in the same bed.

646
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,320
together?

647
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,320
Wait.

648
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,040
One bed.

649
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,840
Don't think about it. It's a hospital bed.

650
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,160
If he's sick, I'll bring him food.

651
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,240
There are no other chairs.

652
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,360
That's all.

653
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,120
Visiting and sending food.

654
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,880
Let me tell you.

655
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,680
Actually, I

656
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,800
for three years.

657
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,160
He never told me

658
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,400
let go of work

659
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,600
to take people to the exhibition first.

660
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,440
You're the first one.

661
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,680
Tell me.

662
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
Do you have

663
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,160
between you two?

664
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,560
I guess you're not very imaginative.

665
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:35,880
Let me show you.

666
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,240
Just now,

667
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,080
Someone said

668
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,360
our relationship.

669
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,160
Oh my god.

670
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,680
Miss, you can't leave me.

671
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,080
I love you.

672
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,160
Look.

673
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,240
His work

674
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,200
is mainly about muscle.

675
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,400
Look at the interaction

676
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,400
between them.

677
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,160
Miss.

678
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,920
I'm trying my best to say this.

679
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,960
Can you stop being so cold?

680
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
Am I cold?

681
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,880
I suddenly wonder

682
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
how you know

683
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,440
your prince charming?

684
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,360
It's all fate.

685
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,160
By the way,

686
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,840
I was just a servant.

687
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,320
I met a double pain

688
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,240
in New York.

689
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,960
I had to sell myself in Fashion Week.

690
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,400
and witnessed how successful

691
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,600
how successful I was.

692
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:33,880
Hey.

693
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,880
What are you doing?

694
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,720
I heard your brother

695
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,680
praised your great achievements.

696
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,400
What do you mean?

697
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,880
The daughter of the president.

698
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,480
International celebrities.

699
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,360
Anyway, all kinds of serial novels

700
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,960
can't come up with.

701
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,400
Did he say

702
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,720
that within a week after my first show,

703
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,880
all the money

704
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,320
will be taken away.

705
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,120
No way.

706
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,840
Then how do you think

707
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,800
I can afford

708
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,480
in Shanghai.

709
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,720
Nonsense.

710
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,160
I've been watching it all afternoon.

711
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,240
Do you understand?

712
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,120
With this Master Feifei's guidance,

713
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,200
I understand a lot.

714
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,160
Thank you, Guru Zhao.

715
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,320
This exhibition

716
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,240
will end in five minutes.

717
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,680
That means there's a lot I don't understand.

718
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,120
It's six o'clock.

719
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,920
Come back with Xu Fei.

720
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,160
I'll treat you to steak.

721
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,160
You don't have to accompany your Princess Amanda.

722
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,040
She left early.

723
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,880
He wants steak.

724
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,040
It's been days.

725
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,360
You just happened to

726
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,400
so I invited you.

727
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,920
Forget it. Let's go.

728
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,040
I have a business trip this weekend.

729
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,840
So I'll give you extra lessons

730
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,320
when we eat.

731
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,720
In case you

732
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,640
your new fashion knowledge

733
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,440
are crooked again.

734
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,960
Don't you need to accompany your Princess Armanda?

735
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,640
Are you really not jealous?

736
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,160
It seems that someone hasn't given up

737
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,880
about your ex.

738
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,400
You're lying to me, who's young and innocent.

739
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,440
What are you talking about?

740
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,560
I'm sorry.

741
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,400
I'm going to the bathroom. I'll be right back.

742
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,880
My stomach hurts.

743
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,160
What a coincidence.

744
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,200
We meet again.

745
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,320
Didn't you say

746
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,360
come back for dinner with Wenwen today?

747
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,240
I wanted to ask the parents on both sides

748
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,880
when can we meet

749
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,840
Mom.

750
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,640
I told you you don't have to come here all the time.

751
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,880
and you don't have to cook all the time.

752
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,840
I've been working for so many years.

753
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,400
Cut it out.

754
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,160
You're 30.

755
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,560
You know how to be independent?

756
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,960
When I was three,

757
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,400
when I was three?

758
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,640
No, I'll call Wenwen.

759
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,800
It's the weekend. Why are you working overtime?

760
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,680
Mom, mom.

761
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,560
Wenwen has something urgent to do today.

762
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,640
Don't bother her, okay?

763
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,960
You only care about your girlfriend.

764
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,080
Okay, she's not coming.

765
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,040
Let's eat together.

766
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,080
Let's eat.

767
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,160
I want soup

768
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,480
Go to the kitchen and get me a bowl of soup

769
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,720
Mom why is it pork liver soup again

770
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,160
How many times have I told you?

771
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,320
I don't like this.

772
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,400
Pig liver protects eyes. What's wrong?

773
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,160
The doctor said I can't eat oil.

774
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,880
Get rid of the oil on it.

775
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,960
Add some pepper.

776
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,360
Eat more

777
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,400
Long time no see.

778
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,560
It's not a long time.

779
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,920
I saw your video

780
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,160
from Si Hyun.

781
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,360
It's pretty.

782
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,120
I saw Youlian.

783
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,840
Really?

784
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,680
The light is not good.

785
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,680
I'll be more stable next time.

786
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,160
Sure.

787
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,120
Sa Hyun was drunk that day.

788
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,160
I took him home.

789
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,280
Really?

790
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,000
Thank you.

791
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,320
Miss Jiang, you should know

792
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,640
I'm going to take Sixian back.

793
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,880
No, I shouldn't say that.

794
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,600
Since we're not married,

795
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,400
then everyone

796
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,200
a fair competition.

797
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,840
You also

798
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,240
take him away from me.

799
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,400
First of all,

800
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,200
I'm not like someone

801
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,720
who doesn't steal other's boyfriend.

802
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,920
I agreed to his pursuit

803
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,200
I agreed to his pursuit.

804
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,600
Secondly,

805
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,040
if you want to compete,

806
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,880
I don't mind at all.

807
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,600
But...

808
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,200
if you really

809
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,560
so confident,

810
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,920
why don't you be fair and square?

811
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,880
Last time at the hospital,

812
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,040
you held another man's hand

813
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:38,840
with another man's hand.

814
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,640
Whether you take him home

815
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,080
or take him away,

816
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,200
I don't mind.

817
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,880
No.

818
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,120
Of course not.

819
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,160
That means I have good taste.

820
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,320
Sa Hyun is so popular.

821
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,640
It means he's very charming.

822
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:02,400
And I admire you.

823
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,440
Only women who are confident

824
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,200
can do whatever she wants.

825
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,920
I'll be right there.

826
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,840
Sorry.

827
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,960
I have to go.

828
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:27,920
By the way,

829
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,560
I'm a confident woman too.

830
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:32,440
So I believe

831
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,880
Sa Hyun will stick to his decision.

832
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,280
and choose me.

833
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,400
I give up on you.

834
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,440
Come on!

835
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,240
Sorry, you're dead.

836
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,600
Game over.
