1
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,680
Sunday.

2
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,480
Wait.

3
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:21,800
Old Di,

4
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,600
Do we still have this month's newspapers?

5
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,730
We've kept them all.

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,460
Silently goes to get them.

7
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,920
I see.

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,660
This poem indeed has meaning.

9
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
I understand now.

10
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,000
Why the tailor wanted to kill Zhou Xiaokang at ten o'clock.

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,680
Why?

12
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,090
The thief was the guardian.

13
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,160
All one hundred small yellow croakers have been recovered.

14
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,759
This is...

15
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,800
You're looking at the time above.

16
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,760
The gold robber, Zhao, resisted stubbornly.

17
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,160
With the cooperation of police and civilians, he was shot dead at ten o'clock on Pingkang Street.

18
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,360
At first, we all thought this 'ten'

19
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,290
referred to the time of the murder.

20
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,360
But the tailor repeatedly mentioned it.

21
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,420
I feel this matter isn't that simple.

22
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,960
Since he told us through the newspaper,

23
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,680
let's start our investigation from the newspaper.

24
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,760
This newspaper is dated the 10th.

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,360
But the incident happened on the 9th.

26
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,400
Which means for this Zhao,

27
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,760
the 10th is a day that will never come.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,200
So there is no 'ten.'

29
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,280
I think

30
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:49,200
wanting to kill Zhou Xiaokang at ten o'clock

31
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,560
must have some connection with this Zhao.

32
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,480
Old Di,

33
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,440
do you know about Zhao's situation?

34
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,480
Where does he live?

35
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,010
I know about this incident,

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,920
but I really don't know where he lives.

37
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,240
This incident happened in Yun City,

38
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,400
not in our De City.

39
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,560
I suspect he's now

40
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,170
probably near Zhao's home.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,760
Quickly call the police station in Yun City.

42
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,960
We'll go find him now.

43
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,000
Alright.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,660
I'll contact them right away.

45
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,410
Gong Sunhe, go prepare the car.

46
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,160
Everyone,

47
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,660
gather at the entrance, ready to depart.

48
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,300
We're here.

49
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,970
It's this house, right?

50
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,560
Who is it at this late hour?

51
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
We're the police.

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,440
Are you here for Xu Huizhen?

53
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,079
Yes.

54
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,000
We're here to verify some information with her.

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,960
Oh, please stop coming to verify the situation.

56
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,400
Ever since her husband got into trouble,

57
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,840
the police have been coming to see them every day.

58
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,680
It's pitiful, they're left as just a widow and orphan now.

59
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,720
They couldn't take it anymore,

60
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,880
so she took the child and went back to her parents' home.

61
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,079
What should we do? No one's here.

62
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,200
We're running out of time.

63
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,200
Let's go in first.

64
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,620
Let's go take a look first.

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,460
Why is there nothing here?

66
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,640
Quiet.

67
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,360
Time.

68
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,480
Why?

69
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,480
why?

70
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,300
We were still one step too late in the end.

71
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,480
Old Wang,

72
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,160
thank you so much.

73
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,880
When this case is over,

74
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,680
you must come to Decheng.

75
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,200
I'll treat you to drinks.

76
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,240
That's very kind of you.

77
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,120
We're working together on this case,

78
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,840
but we need to solve it quickly.

79
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,440
Alright.

80
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,240
If you need anything,

81
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,050
we'll fully cooperate with your investigation.

82
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,480
That's great.

83
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,210
I'll have someone send over the case files later.

84
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,480
If there's nothing else you need,

85
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,520
I'll take my leave.

86
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,650
Alright, take care.

87
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,440
Okay,

88
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,880
everyone cheer up.

89
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,450
The killer hasn't been caught yet.

90
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,640
Why are you all looking so dejected?

91
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:50,880
Song Si,

92
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,820
come with me to the morgue.

93
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,040
Don't feel guilty anymore.

94
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,480
Although you couldn't save him,

95
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,160
you did your best, didn't you?

96
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,180
If only I had been earlier,

97
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,600
just a bit earlier...

98
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,720
During this investigation,

99
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,530
did you slack off even a little?

100
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:37,880
No,

101
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,320
I worked very hard.

102
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,560
Then that's fine.

103
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,080
It's not your fault that you couldn't save him.

104
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,520
The murderer is to blame,

105
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,250
or even the victim himself.

106
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,240
To be honest,

107
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,960
if he hadn't done so many bad things himself,

108
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,220
the Tailor wouldn't have come after him.

109
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,680
But...

110
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,200
But the law is an inviolable red line, right?

111
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,010
That's correct.

112
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,740
But you know, sometimes the law is a red line,

113
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,130
but not the upper limit.

114
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,960
Alright.

115
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,120
Stop feeling guilty.

116
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,180
Gong Sun He,

117
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,800
come down quickly and take a look.

118
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,960
I found something strange

119
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,360
in Zhou Xiaokang's body.

120
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,560
Let's go.

121
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,960
This bottle was found in the victim's stomach.

122
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,760
The killer must have made the victim swallow it before death.

123
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,330
There's also this note inside.

124
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,080
What is this?

125
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,159
A jar of oil, a basket of beans,

126
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,720
The bean basket in the oil jar.

127
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,400
A little mouse smells the scent,

128
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,280
Peeks out from behind the wall.

129
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,280
This is a nursery rhyme.

130
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,480
It's about a little mouse stealing beans and oil,

131
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,480
and finally falling into the oil jar.

132
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,520
Another riddle.

133
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,480
This Tailor really likes to pose puzzles.

134
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,040
I think

135
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,770
this must be related to Lin Li and Zhao Ping'an's gold robbery case.

136
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,860
Why don't we start investigating from here?

137
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,360
Okay.

138
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,300
Let's go to her office to review the case.

139
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,210
Let's go.

140
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,240
Zhao Ping'an, male, 38 years old, from Yun City.

141
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,200
He was a gold bar escort for Shengfeng Money House before his death.

142
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,960
He robbed the gold bars he was escorting on the evening of September 9th.

143
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,640
He was shot dead on the street at 10 p.m. that night.

144
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,880
According to the records,

145
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,640
Zhao Ping'an was involved in

146
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,440
the development and construction of Xinxin Department Store as a contractor two years ago.

147
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,880
However, due to a large amount of upfront loans,

148
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,520
he ended up heavily in debt.

149
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,640
Xinxin Department Store was completed and put into use a year ago.

150
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,080
Originally, if Zhao Ping'an had received the contractor's payment,

151
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,720
he would have been able to clear his debts.

152
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,640
However, the developer refused to pay, citing a lack of funds.

153
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,080
This led to Zhao Ping'an being violently debt-collected.

154
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,520
The debt collector was none other than

155
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,520
the deceased, Zhou Xiaokang.

156
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,760
The case is not over yet.

157
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,640
This

158
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,050
was found in the victim's stomach.

159
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,300
Other than that, we know nothing.

160
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,200
Behind this,

161
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,720
there's also a nursery rhyme called 'The Mouse Fell into the Oil Tank.'

162
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,050
I think this must be a clue from the Tailor.

163
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,700
This Lin Li should be related to Zhao Ping'an's developer.

164
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,320
It's clear that

165
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,780
the Tailor wants us to investigate the Zhao Ping'an incident.

166
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,040
So, what drove Zhao Ping'an to extremes

167
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,920
was mainly the developer's refusal to pay.

168
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,120
Song Si,

169
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,880
you go with Fu Mosi to investigate Xinxin Department Store.

170
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,140
I'll go to the Clock Tower with Qing Tian.

171
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,000
Everyone, stick to your tasks.

172
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,200
We must make sure to

173
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,520
rescue the victim before the Tailor makes a move.

174
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,000
Let's go.
