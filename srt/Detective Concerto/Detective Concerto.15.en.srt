1
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,400
First,

2
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,680
let's start with Uncle Lu Tianci's

3
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,440
attack case.

4
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:27,920
This incident

5
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,720
wasn't done by the man wearing sunglasses, was it?

6
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,400
Of course not.

7
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,280
He wouldn't have had enough time

8
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,810
to set up traps in this room.

9
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,160
That's true.

10
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,740
Anyone entering the conference room would have to pass through the hall,

11
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,560
and we've had people coming and going these past few days.

12
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,420
If someone had entered the villa,

13
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,039
we would have noticed.

14
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,680
There's always something fishy going on.

15
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,810
What if that person took advantage while we were asleep?

16
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,680
If I hadn't heard that sentence,

17
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,840
I might have thought the same.

18
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,200
But what the killer said at that time

19
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,610
made me immediately zero in on him.

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,400
Gong Sun He,

21
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,760
stop keeping us in suspense.

22
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,620
Tell us who the killer is quickly.

23
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,560
Qing Tian.

24
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,120
What?

25
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,840
Are you suspecting me?

26
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,840
No,

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,200
I want to ask you,

28
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,600
how did you know it was an arrow that was shot?

29
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,210
Because I saw the crossbow.

30
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,380
It could only be shot from a crossbow.

31
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,140
Do you understand now?

32
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,640
Because at that time,

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,280
you saw the crossbow,

34
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,100
that's how you knew an arrow was shot from it.

35
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,160
But we were at the scene at that time.

36
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,130
However, someone, without seeing anything,

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,360
blurted out

38
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,540
where the arrow was shot from.

39
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,960
Who is this person?

40
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,320
It's okay if you don't remember clearly,

41
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,560
but I remember it very clearly.

42
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,400
Where was the arrow shot from?

43
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,480
Ms. Tian Shan, may I ask,

44
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,840
in such a short time,

45
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,120
how did you clearly see

46
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,320
that what flew across the entire room

47
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,040
and landed behind uncle was an arrow?

48
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,680
What?

49
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,600
Are you suggesting that my wife is...

50
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,280
That's right.

51
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,940
The person who set up this trap

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,920
is you,

53
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,280
Ms. Tian Shan.

54
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,140
That's why you could blurt out

55
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,940
where the arrow was shot from.

56
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,040
But even so,

57
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,900
it doesn't prove that my wife is the killer, does it?

58
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,200
Atai,

59
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,840
think carefully.

60
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,920
Has your wife recently told you

61
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,280
that she wanted to clean the conference room or something similar,

62
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,480
and then stayed here for a long time?

63
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,480
Shanshan.

64
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,170
What are you doing in the conference room?

65
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,040
Isn't father's will going to be read in a few days?

66
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,380
I came to clean up a bit.

67
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,220
So it looks more presentable when everyone comes in a few days.

68
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,680
That's fine.

69
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,640
Then we'll do it in the conference room,

70
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,700
when it's time to read father's will.

71
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,400
Tian Shan, why are you doing this?

72
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,680
Jing Tai.

73
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,600
Jing Tai, I was wrong.

74
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,120
I was out of my mind.

75
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,459
I owe a lot of money to the gambling house.

76
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,120
I have a huge gambling debt.

77
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,840
They said if I can't pay it back this month,

78
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,000
they'll cut off both my hands.

79
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,010
Why didn't you tell me about this earlier?

80
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,159
Why didn't you say something sooner?

81
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,290
I wanted to tell you, but I didn't dare.

82
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,560
I thought

83
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,240
if things went smoothly with the inheritance,

84
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,240
I could pay off the gambling debt without having to tell you.

85
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,800
But

86
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,000
but when I heard

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,520
that uncle was coming back from abroad

88
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
to claim a share of the inheritance,

89
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,880
I got scared.

90
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,440
I was afraid that with one more person getting a share,

91
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,440
the money I'd get wouldn't be enough to pay off my debt.

92
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,000
So I just

93
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,120
Just for this?

94
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,460
You committed murder?

95
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,200
And you killed my own uncle?

96
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,880
No, I never intended to kill anyone.

97
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,280
Believe me, I just wanted to scare him.

98
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,280
To frighten him,

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,600
so that he might give up the inheritance

100
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,360
and return abroad to save his life.

101
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,600
The reason I experimented with so many angles

102
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,200
was to avoid hurting uncle.

103
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,720
I really never thought about killing anyone.

104
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,180
Stop making excuses to me.

105
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,760
You sent me that threatening letter too, didn't you?

106
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,320
Yes, I did it.

107
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,120
Uncle,

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,800
I really didn't want to kill you.

109
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,000
I really didn't.

110
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,600
I don't dare to kill anyone.

111
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,400
Forget it.

112
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,159
What do you mean you don't dare to kill?

113
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:38,600
Didn't you kill your stepmother too?

114
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,280
I didn't kill my stepmother.

115
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,720
Who would believe what you say?

116
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,240
A Tai.

117
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,100
You believe me, right?

118
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,320
I didn't kill anyone.

119
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:53,880
Tian Shan.

120
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
I never thought

121
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,880
you were such a ruthless woman.

122
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,120
A Tai,

123
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,880
calm down.

124
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,880
Sister-in-law is right.

125
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,050
The person who killed Second Mom is someone else.

126
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,000
If the killer isn't Tian Shan,

127
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,890
it must be that person in black.

128
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
That's right.

129
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,000
That man is likely our uncle.

130
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,480
It's because of our mother's death years ago,

131
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,340
he's been harboring resentment.

132
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,360
He couldn't bear

133
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,320
that our stepmother

134
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,600
took his sister's place in this family.

135
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,280
So

136
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,240
that's why he killed her.

137
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
No, that's not it.

138
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,220
That person is not your uncle.

139
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,930
If my deduction is correct,

140
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,680
it should be one of you

141
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,880
who sent a private detective to investigate your uncle's true identity.

142
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,560
If this person isn't our uncle,

143
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,880
then who could it be?

144
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,720
So you're saying

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,280
that the person who killed Ms. Xu Yazhi

146
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,600
is in this room?

147
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,130
That's correct.

148
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,920
The real killer

149
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,760
is among us.

150
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,200
But at nine o'clock,

151
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,240
didn't Tian Shan receive a call from our stepmother?

152
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,280
Could it be

153
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,280
that this call was fake?

154
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,560
No.

155
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,440
At nine o'clock,

156
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,020
your stepmother did indeed make a call here.

157
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,240
However,

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,120
Ms. Tian Shan,

159
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,880
can you really be certain

160
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,300
that this call was from your stepmother?

161
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,320
Well,

162
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,880
I'm not sure about that.

163
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,450
Didn't I mention before

164
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,920
that there was a lot of background noise on the call?

165
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,520
The voice was intermittent,

166
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,890
she said a lot at the beginning,

167
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,160
but I couldn't make out what she was saying at all.

168
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,160
The only thing I could hear clearly was one sentence.

169
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,400
She said she wouldn't be back until after eleven.

170
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,440
The voice I heard should be Second Mom's.

171
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,080
If

172
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,540
we're certain that Second Mom made the call,

173
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,560
even if she left immediately after hanging up,

174
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,250
she wouldn't arrive until around ten.

175
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,210
And at that time,

176
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,600
almost all of us were in the living room.

177
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,720
Is it possible

178
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,440
that she arrived

179
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,159
after eight o'clock?

180
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,799
Wait a minute.

181
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,960
even so,

182
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,250
how do you explain that phone call?

183
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,780
Suppose Xu Yazhi has an assistant

184
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,840
whose voice is extremely similar to hers,

185
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,240
who made the call for her.

186
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,400
Then

187
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,500
she could drive over here.

188
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,960
But the person who died is our stepmother.

189
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,040
This is just...

190
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,600
This is just like...

191
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,360
It's just like creating an alibi.

192
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,280
Because what she wanted was precisely an alibi.

193
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,090
Unfortunately, things didn't go as she had planned.

194
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,840
otherwise,

195
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,520
she would be sitting here

196
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:22,180
sharing her alibi for yesterday with everyone.

197
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,080
Unexpected to her?

198
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,480
What do you mean?

199
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,180
Don't you understand yet?

200
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,960
Ms. Xu Yazhi used this method to create an alibi

201
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,760
in order to kill someone with her own hands.

202
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,960
But she never expected

203
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,540
that in the end, she would be killed by that person instead.

204
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,440
What?

205
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,920
How could this happen?

206
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,120
How is that not possible?

207
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,840
Didn't she marry into our family just for the money?

208
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,160
However, ironically,

209
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,960
this method of Xu Yazhi's

210
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,240
actually proved that the person who was originally meant to be killed

211
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,480
but ended up becoming the killer

212
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,260
was not even in this room at the time of the crime.

213
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Song Si,

214
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,040
the raincoat found in the well

215
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,720
must have been purchased by Xu Yazhi

216
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,240
to prevent blood from splashing on herself.

217
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,240
The tear in the raincoat proves

218
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,450
that she was wearing it when she committed the crime.

219
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,840
Where's the crime scene?

220
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,080
There's no blood in the room either.

221
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,640
Of course, it's in the bathroom.

222
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,840
Only there

223
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,160
could the blood be quickly cleaned up.

224
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,600
Then who was it?

225
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,800
Who killed the second mother in the bathroom?
