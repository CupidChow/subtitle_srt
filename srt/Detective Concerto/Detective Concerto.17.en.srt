1
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,410
Quick, something's happened!

2
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,520
What's wrong?

3
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,520
Tailor.

4
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,520
Two shoulders can't bear the weight, crushing all in the world.

5
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,840
Suddenly, the first yang line appears.

6
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,960
Nine times nine is eighty-two.

7
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,760
What does this mean?

8
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,520
Gong Sun He, you don't know either?

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,640
Aren't you supposed to be all-knowing?

10
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,480
I do indeed know astronomy above and geography below.

11
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,040
but this belongs to the realm of literature.

12
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,760
So I don't see what's so strange about not knowing it.

13
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,040
This isn't one poem.

14
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,120
The first two lines are in five-character form.

15
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,560
The last two lines are in seven-character regulated verse.

16
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,360
This should be pieced together from two different poems.

17
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,040
Qing Tian.

18
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,360
You even know this?

19
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,560
This is common knowledge.

20
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,400
Moreover,

21
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,880
I don't know the source of this poem either.

22
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,329
It's very likely written by the person who sent the card.

23
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,640
It must mean something, right?

24
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,200
This death notice plus a poem.

25
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,660
It's performance art!

26
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,480
If I'm not mistaken,

27
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,650
this Zhou Xiaokang has probably been kidnapped.

28
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,280
This is a death notice.

29
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,920
and the poem

30
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,280
is the clue.

31
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,920
What kind of organization is this Tailor anyway?

32
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,040
They're challenging our police station!

33
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,840
It's just

34
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,200
a group that thinks it can replace the law

35
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,260
and execute justice through murder.

36
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
I will definitely

37
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,640
bring them to justice.

38
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,640
Zhou Xiaokang, male, 28 years old.

39
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,000
Lives in Wanyan Alley at the end of West Street.

40
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,040
Helps his brother with work, keeps an eye on their business.

41
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,280
Last night, he went to Fengluan Tower for drinks and entertainment.

42
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,400
He drank until 1 AM,

43
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,680
then went home.

44
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,240
After that, he disappeared without a trace.

45
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,400
Two o'clock.

46
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,840
Initial assessment suggests

47
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,640
he was likely kidnapped at home.

48
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,900
It seems he's the one mentioned in the death notice.

49
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,640
He's just a scumbag.

50
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,480
The Tailor caught him,

51
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,000
it's like carrying out heaven's justice, isn't it?

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,640
What?

53
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,920
Do you know him?

54
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,100
No, I don't.

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,360
How would I know someone like that?

56
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,200
Then how do you know he's a scumbag?

57
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,560
And even if he is a scumbag,

58
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,400
the law will naturally punish him.

59
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,460
It's not up to some so-called Tailor.

60
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,720
I was just saying.

61
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,770
Look how serious you're being.

62
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,720
I'm sorry, I got too excited.

63
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
But this person is indeed a scumbag.

64
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,010
He bullies men and women alike.

65
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,040
But that's exactly why it's difficult for us to investigate.

66
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,279
Because there are too many people who hate him.

67
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,640
If we start from interpersonal relationships,

68
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,100
it will be very difficult.

69
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,920
Why do we have to start from interpersonal relationships?

70
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,240
Don't we have the notice

71
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,080
and the poem?

72
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,520
I think these are clues left by the Tailor.

73
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,760
If we can figure out what this poem means,

74
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,020
we can find the answer.

75
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,640
I think this

76
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,140
should be the time and place of death.

77
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,080
Suddenly seeing the first yang line appear.

78
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,800
Isn't this referring to something from the I Ching?

79
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,330
The first yang line appears

80
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,960
refers to the first line in the Jie hexagram.

81
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,840
The line statement is 'Initial six, no blame.'

82
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,800
The yin line in the lowest position

83
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,480
is gentle, not easily discovered, and therefore safe.

84
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,680
What do you mean?

85
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,640
I didn't understand a word of that.

86
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,400
That's because your IQ is low.

87
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,900
You're the one lowering our team's IQ, okay?

88
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,520
Alright,

89
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,640
stop arguing.

90
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,680
Song Si,

91
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,780
what does this actually mean?

92
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,200
If we apply it to the current situation,

93
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,280
I guess it means

94
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,640
Zhou Xiaokang is currently in a safe and hidden location.

95
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,080
However,

96
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,130
once discovered, it will become very dangerous.

97
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,880
Hidden and safe, but dangerous if exposed.

98
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,760
If that's the case,

99
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,960
let's think about it.

100
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,280
What kind of place fits this description?

101
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,240
If that line refers to the location,

102
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,400
Then I think the next line

103
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,530
might be referring to the time, right?

104
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,800
As for the time,

105
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,040
nine times nine is eighty-one.

106
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,760
Eighty-one can be seen as eight plus one,

107
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,820
which is also nine.

108
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,480
Three nines make twenty-seven,

109
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,480
so that's the 27th,

110
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,340
which is today.

111
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,800
Then eighty-two would be eight plus two, 10 PM.

112
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,960
It's 2:30 now.

113
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,280
We still have seven and a half hours left.

114
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,340
Alright, alright.

115
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,520
It's a waste of time to analyze this poem here.

116
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,840
He He, Qing Tian,

117
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,160
go check out Fengluan Tower.

118
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,080
see if you can find any clues.

119
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,360
Mo Mo, Si Si,

120
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,080
go to Zhou Xiaokang's house.

121
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,680
check if there are any clues there.

122
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,010
Split up and get to work.

123
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,240
What are you doing here?

124
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,680
Weren't you supposed to go to Fengluan Tower?

125
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,080
We heard that Zhou Xiaokang returned at 2 AM,

126
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,960
so we came here.

127
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,360
You're just in time.

128
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,420
Take a look at this.

129
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,040
Look at this blood stain.

130
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,240
Zhou Xiaokang's wound must be serious.

131
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,080
I thought so at first, too.

132
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,659
But this isn't real blood.

133
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,680
It's artificial blood from a blood pack.

134
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,480
I think

135
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,840
it was deliberately left by the person who kidnapped Zhou Xiaokang.

136
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,800
That's right.

137
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,200
The perpetrator is leaving us clues.

138
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,400
They're worried we won't be able to identify Zhou Xiaokang.

139
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,860
That's quite thoughtful.

140
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,850
There's something even more thoughtful.

141
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,080
How is it?

142
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,600
Have you found anything?

143
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,400
Xiao Mo,

144
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,410
give me a pen.

145
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,960
This newspaper,

146
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,960
why is it so disorganized?

147
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,970
And these dates,

148
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,380
there's no pattern to them at all.

149
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,690
Look carefully.

150
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,320
First, look at the dates inside.

151
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,520
Gong Sunhe, hurry up and tell us.

152
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,220
The newspapers inside...

153
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,159
among the numbers from one to ten...

154
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,480
only ten is missing.

155
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,920
No ten?

156
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,890
What's going on?

157
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,290
First, I need to tell you...

158
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,960
the newspapers here...

159
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,080
were deliberately placed by someone.

160
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,010
To give us a hint.

161
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,520
Why do you say that?

162
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,730
It's obviously just casually placed after reading.

163
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,960
Do you understand now?

164
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,440
These newspapers...

165
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,160
are from as early as January.

166
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,920
But if they were from that time...

167
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,400
they should have turned yellow by now.

168
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,130
Moreover...

169
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,360
the dates on them are all visible.

170
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,640
It would be too strange if someone didn't do this intentionally.

171
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,480
I see.

172
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,520
Indeed, this week's newspapers...

173
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,850
all lack the number ten.

174
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,799
There are papers from January to September here...

175
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,200
but none from this month.

176
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,480
Look at these dates.

177
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,240
There's the 8th, 9th, 11th, 12th, but no 10th.

178
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,039
That's right.

179
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,240
But there's no 10th...

180
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,720
what does that mean?

181
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,160
I don't know.

182
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,320
It's getting late, almost six o'clock.

183
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,040
We still need to start with the poem.

184
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,560
Let's go back and deal with it.

185
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,090
Let's go.

186
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,880
What on earth does this mean?

187
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,360
I've already tried countless solutions,

188
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,480
but still can't solve it.

189
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,680
What's going on here?

190
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,320
It's already seven o'clock.

191
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,980
We only have three hours left.

192
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,000
What does this really mean?

193
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,090
Could it be some kind of ritual?

194
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,160
Similar to certain religious organizations,

195
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,560
they become very devout at specific times.

196
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,800
For example, God creating humans in seven days.

197
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,920
God created humans on the sixth day and rested on the seventh.

198
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,560
That's why Christians go to church on Sundays.

199
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,040
This is also why Sunday is called Sunday.

200
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,480
Sunday.

201
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,560
Sunday.

202
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,440
Wait a minute.
