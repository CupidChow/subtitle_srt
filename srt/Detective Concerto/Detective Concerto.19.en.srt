1
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,280
What?

2
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,130
You're saying our Lao Lin has been kidnapped?

3
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,600
This...

4
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,520
How is that possible?

5
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,600
We received a death notice.

6
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,920
The person to be punished on it is Lin Li.

7
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,440
But there are so many people in Yuncheng called Lin Li.

8
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,560
How can you be sure it's our Lao Lin?

9
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,039
Do you know Zhao Ping'an?

10
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,400
Since you know him,

11
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,960
I assume you're also aware of

12
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,759
the relationship between Zhao Ping'an and Lin Li.

13
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,440
I can tell you clearly

14
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,640
that your husband's kidnapping

15
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,080
has a great deal to do

16
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,660
with Zhao Ping'an's case.

17
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,039
No, but...

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,200
Isn't Zhao Ping'an already dead?

19
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,960
And it was he himself who

20
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,080
broke the law by stealing gold bars.

21
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,600
What does this have to do with our Lao Lin?

22
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,920
If Lin Li had fulfilled

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,880
his payment obligations according to the contract,

24
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,760
Zhao Ping'an wouldn't have died.

25
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,280
To build that Xinxin Department Store,

26
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,200
Zhao Ping'an went into debt for over 60,000.

27
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,040
His whole family was pressured by thugs every day to repay the money.

28
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,100
But what about you?

29
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,120
For over a year, you haven't given them a single penny.

30
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,780
How can you say this has nothing to do with Lin Li?

31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,400
Well...

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,920
What does this have to do with us?

33
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,120
If you don't have money, you shouldn't do business, right?

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,200
Why did he take out a loan to do it then?

35
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,120
Besides,

36
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,040
our Lao Lin's company

37
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,560
had a break in its cash flow,

38
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,280
which led to not having money to pay him.

39
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,120
Otherwise, if we had money, how could we not pay?

40
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,770
May I ask, is there really no money?

41
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,280
When we came in, we saw a car in the yard.

42
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,640
And it's new.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,200
Cars aren't cheap these days, are they?

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,480
I don't know about that.

45
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,640
That's just what our Lao Lin told me.

46
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,280
Let's not talk about this now.

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,480
You're the police.

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,480
Since you know our Lao Lin has been kidnapped,

49
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,200
shouldn't you hurry up and rescue him?

50
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
Why are you coming here in the middle of the night?

51
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,840
We can't find where Lin Li is right now.

52
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:22,120
And they're not asking for ransom.

53
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,060
They want to avenge Zhao Ping'an.

54
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,680
We need to understand more information

55
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,079
so I can figure out where Lin Li actually is.

56
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,480
Information?

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,200
What information?

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,200
I've told you

59
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,400
everything you asked me to say.

60
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,060
What else do you want me to say?

61
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,400
When Lin Li was in contact with Zhao Ping'an,

62
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,480
were you present?

63
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,480
Can you give us any clues?

64
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,560
I really don't know about this.

65
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,400
I only heard Lin Li say

66
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,040
that Zhao Ping'an was like a stubborn sticker,

67
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,480
impossible to shake off no matter what.

68
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,480
Ms. Su,

69
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,920
let me give you a piece of advice.

70
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,370
Your husband is in great danger right now.

71
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,200
The kidnappers could kill him at any time.

72
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,480
The last person who was kidnapped is already dead.

73
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,280
Dead?

74
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,580
So you need to think carefully

75
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,860
about whether you want to cooperate with us.

76
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,360
This is where he usually works from home.

77
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,600
Look around everywhere.

78
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,560
See if you can find what you need.

79
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,730
As for the company matters,

80
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,360
I often don't know anything about them either.

81
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,520
so,

82
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,080
when you ask me, I don't know what to say.

83
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,560
Alright.

84
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,960
In that case, Ms. Su,

85
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,760
could you think about it again?

86
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,760
Has Lin Li ever mentioned anything to you?

87
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,820
Or has he been acting strange lately?

88
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,370
If you remember anything, please let us know.

89
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,080
Okay.

90
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,680
I'll go get you some water.

91
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,240
Take your time looking around.

92
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,770
Thank you for your trouble.

93
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,640
She's really something.

94
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,240
Her husband has been kidnapped.

95
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,500
Look at how calm she is.

96
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,960
What good would panicking do?

97
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,820
crying and screaming won't help.

98
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,480
You said she claims to know nothing about the company's affairs.

99
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,400
Is that true?

100
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,640
I don't think she has any reason to lie to me.

101
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,240
After all, her husband's life is in danger now.

102
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,800
You never know.

103
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,970
It might be exactly what she wants.

104
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,400
Even a screenwriter wouldn't dare to think like that.

105
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,920
Let's hurry up and search.

106
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,760
It's getting late now.

107
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,540
We're running out of time.

108
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,820
Take a look at this.

109
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:52,880
What?

110
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,080
Land Development Contract.

111
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,020
Check the investment method.

112
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,570
Shengfeng Money House.

113
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,280
Isn't this the money house that was robbed by Zhao Ping'an?

114
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,080
That's right.

115
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,090
It's also the money house where Zhao Ping'an worked.

116
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,640
Could it be...

117
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,400
This matter is also related to this money house?

118
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,980
Although this seems a bit too coincidental,

119
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,640
Gongsun He once said,

120
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,580
Many coincidences are deliberately arranged.

121
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,240
I think I'll go ask Su Mingfang.

122
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,520
Maybe she knows something.

123
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,080
Mm-hmm.

124
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,760
Go ahead.

125
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,400
Okay.

126
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,420
How's it going?

127
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,680
Any progress?

128
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,080
We didn't find anything at the clock tower.

129
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,560
I can't get the story of the mouse stealing oil out of my head.

130
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,320
You don't think...

131
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,240
they really stuffed him into an oil drum, do you?

132
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,720
We can't rule out that possibility.

133
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,250
Why don't we check the nearby oil refineries?

134
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,400
No way.

135
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,960
After all, it was a clue from the tailor.

136
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,370
It can't be that simple.

137
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,760
I think so too.

138
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,800
You know, with all the oil refineries in Yun City,

139
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,840
there must be at least a hundred of them.

140
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,770
There should be a more direct clue.

141
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,920
What about the time?

142
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,200
Have you figured out the time of the murder?

143
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,760
This nursery rhyme has four ones and one ten.

144
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,770
I think there are quite a few possible combinations.

145
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,400
No.

146
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,080
I don't think the execution time has anything to do with the numbers.

147
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,010
What do you mean?

148
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,640
Because this nursery rhyme is about a mouse

149
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,240
falling into an oil drum while trying to steal oil.

150
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,120
The ending is obvious.

151
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,120
But it also reminds me of another

152
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,640
story about a mouse stealing oil.

153
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,480
A mouse crawled into a bottle to steal oil,

154
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,800
but in the end, because of its greed,

155
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,240
it ate too much and its belly grew too big.

156
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,970
In the end, it couldn't get out.

157
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,200
Doesn't this story also lack an ending?

158
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,240
Of course it has one.

159
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,840
There's only one ending for the mouse.

160
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,960
It's discovered and then killed.

161
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
What do you think?

162
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,640
Daybreak.

163
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,970
The final deadline is at daybreak.

164
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,040
How's it going?

165
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,170
Did you find what you were looking for?

166
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,120
Do you know about Lin Li's cooperation

167
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,720
with Shengfeng Money House?

168
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,130
I don't know about that.

169
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,800
But Lin Li and the owner of Shengfeng Money House,

170
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,400
Sixth Master, are quite close.

171
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,460
Sixth Master came to our house for dinner a few days ago.

172
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,840
Sixth Master?

173
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,520
What's his real name?

174
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,680
I think it's Zheng Sheng.

175
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,360
I remember when he came to our house for dinner,

176
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,559
he joked and said,

177
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,120
he was in his prime.

178
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,000
He also said if this deal goes through,

179
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,799
there'll be plenty of benefits.

180
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,780
The benefits will go to Lin Li, right?

181
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,160
When did he say this?

182
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,120
A long time ago, a very long time ago.

183
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,320
You just said Sixth Master came to your house for dinner a few days ago.

184
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,000
How has it suddenly become 'a long time ago'?

185
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,360
Do you know that deliberately concealing case information leading to death

186
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,800
can land you in prison?

187
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,240
What?

188
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,960
No, no, no. What does this have to do with me?

189
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,680
How is it not related to you?

190
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,880
If Mr. Lin dies,

191
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,560
and you deliberately conceal information about the case,

192
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,600
you'll go to jail.

193
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Oh, right.

194
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,680
You won't get any of Mr. Lin's inheritance either.

195
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,560
If there are children, it goes to them. If not, it goes to the parents.

196
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,040
I assume Mrs. Su and Mr. Lin

197
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,840
don't have children yet, right?

198
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,000
That's correct.

199
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,320
What about the company Lin Li opened?

200
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,440
Zheng Sheng is the beneficiary.

201
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Although Lin Li is the legal representative,

202
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,240
the real owner behind the company is Zheng Sheng.

203
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,920
So when they talked about the deal going through,

204
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,520
what were they referring to?

205
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,560
It seems

206
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
it seems they said that

207
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,480
after Zhao Ping'an died,

208
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,650
they don't need to pay the project funds anymore.

209
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
What?

210
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,880
What do you mean they don't need to pay?

211
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:06,000
It's because you delayed paying the project funds

212
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,530
that Zhao Ping'an was driven to break the law.

213
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,800
You're practically murderers.

214
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,440
This has nothing to do with us.

215
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,680
Delaying project payments happens all the time.

216
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,320
Who told Zhao Ping'an to commit crimes?

217
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,160
Hey, Fu Mosi,

218
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,280
do you have any leads on your end?

219
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,730
Lin Li and Shengfeng Money House have a partnership.

220
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,480
What?

221
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,400
Lin Li is connected to Shengfeng Money House.
