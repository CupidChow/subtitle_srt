1
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,600
Dad.

2
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,479
My will

3
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,680
has been given to Lawyer Lin.

4
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,039
Your uncle

5
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,160
Dad.

6
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,479
Dad.

7
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
Come back.

8
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,320
Dad.

9
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:04,880
Master.

10
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,560
Dad.

11
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,120
Dad.

12
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,280
Dad.

13
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,000
Dad.

14
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,440
Dad.

15
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,000
Dad.

16
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,320
Dad.

17
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,820
Miss Qingtian,

18
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,240
the police station is closed tomorrow.

19
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:32,970
Are you free?

20
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,640
What is it?

21
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,280
Are you treating me to a meal?

22
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,520
I have a friend who owns a villa in Lianxin District.

23
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,560
He's invited me over tomorrow. How about it?

24
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,820
There might be a feast.

25
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,440
Do you want to go?

26
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,500
Lianxin District?

27
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,440
That's the famous wealthy area in Decheng.

28
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,120
Yes, it is.

29
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,680
He's my elementary school classmate.

30
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,640
But his father,

31
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,100
you should know him. His name is Lu Tianyang.

32
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,000
The chairman of Hongchang Chamber of Commerce?

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,560
Not bad, Gong Sunhe.

34
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,240
I didn't expect you to have a friend from such a wealthy family.

35
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,640
What are you talking about?

36
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,760
Don't we have someone from a wealthy family right here with us?

37
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,400
Who is it?

38
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,800
It's Fu Mosi.

39
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,640
Look,

40
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,760
every time she goes out,

41
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,000
she's surrounded by a group of followers.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,730
It's so cool.

43
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,880
There's nothing we can do about it.

44
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,680
She inherited Zhentong Trading Company, after all.

45
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,640
How many eyes are watching her now?

46
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,200
Alright, that's not important anymore.

47
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,760
Will you come with me tomorrow?

48
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,520
Please?

49
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,880
Okay, okay, I'll go with you.

50
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,000
But consider this as repaying your favor.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,530
Alright.

52
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,900
See you tomorrow then.

53
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,500
Compared to Xiao Fu's estate,

54
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:37,880
it's smaller.

55
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,680
This is Lianxin District,

56
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,560
where every inch of land is worth its weight in gold.

57
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,000
How can it be compared to a suburban estate?

58
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,000
Ah He,

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:47,680
A Tai.

60
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,650
Long time no see.

61
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,800
It's been so long.

62
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,560
Indeed.

63
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,800
Oh my!

64
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,640
You...

65
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,360
you...

66
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,520
You've changed a lot.

67
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,320
Have I?

68
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,800
It seems we haven't seen each other for only three or four years.

69
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,440
How much could I have changed?

70
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,240
Not at all. I remember you used to be quite skinny.

71
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,460
Like a bamboo pole.

72
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,440
You're not wrong about that.

73
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,320
But you've lost quite a bit of weight yourself.

74
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,380
Your round belly from before is gone.

75
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,720
You used to be quite chubby, huh?

76
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,000
He was short and fat in middle school.

77
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,800
He had a nickname, 'Globe.'

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,160
now you can imagine what he looked like back then.

79
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,440
Globe?

80
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,240
Oh, right. This is...

81
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,440
Ah He.

82
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,570
Are you married?

83
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
I wish I was.

84
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,640
No, no. I'm his colleague.

85
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,159
The police station happens to be closed today.

86
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,520
so I thought I'd come along with him for a visit.

87
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,920
I'm sorry for intruding.

88
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,440
I see.

89
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,330
However, we might need to trouble you a bit today.

90
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,080
Trouble?

91
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,780
Let's talk inside.

92
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,440
Atai.

93
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,360
Uncle.

94
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,440
We have a guest at home.

95
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,720
Uncle, do you remember him?

96
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,240
the one who used to

97
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,360
visit our home often when you were in elementary school, Gong Sun He.

98
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,840
Uncle, long time no see.

99
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,080
Gong Sun He.

100
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,520
I'm sorry,

101
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,820
I've been abroad for years and rarely come back.

102
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,980
I don't remember anymore.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,080
Since he's a childhood playmate,

104
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,600
please entertain him well.

105
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,040
You two chat, I'll take a walk in the garden.

106
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,240
Anderson.

107
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,360
Let's go.

108
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Anderson.

109
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,720
He's my uncle's bodyguard.

110
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,500
By the way, Ahe,

111
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,520
what do you think of my uncle?

112
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,240
What do you mean?

113
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,900
I mean his appearance,

114
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,480
his voice, things like that.

115
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,740
Does he seem familiar?

116
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,360
Well,

117
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,250
it's been so many years, how could I remember?

118
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:49,920
What's wrong?

119
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,920
Don't you recognize your own uncle?

120
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,760
When I was in elementary school,

121
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,159
he moved abroad.

122
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,460
He only came back three years ago.

123
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,720
But I always feel

124
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,300
there's something different about him.

125
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,360
Are you suspecting he's not your uncle?

126
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,880
But isn't your father at home?

127
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,940
Surely he wouldn't

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,240
fail to recognize his own brother, right?

129
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,900
My father passed away last month due to illness.

130
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,240
I'm sorry.

131
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,960
Please accept my condolences.

132
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,160
I was mentally prepared for this.

133
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,000
My mother passed away more than ten years ago.

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,930
The relatives who have met my uncle

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,440
have either passed away or moved far away.

136
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,840
Now, among those who have met my uncle before,

137
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,300
besides my brother and me,

138
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
I'm afraid you're the only one left.

139
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,880
So you suspect someone is impersonating your uncle?

140
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,400
But who would do such a thing?

141
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,360
If it's for inheriting the estate,

142
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,840
someone would definitely do it.

143
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,680
This is my wife, Tian Shan.

144
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,280
To be honest, we all suspect this uncle.

145
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,000
We think this uncle

146
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
might be here to claim a share of my father-in-law's inheritance.

147
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,450
That's why he came here.

148
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,280
I don't need to introduce who my father-in-law is, right?

149
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,280
A month ago,

150
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,120
on his deathbed, he said he left a will.

151
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,440
But we have to wait for a month

152
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,560
until the uncle returns for the lawyer to disclose it.

153
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,960
He also said that anyone not present when the will is read

154
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
won't get a penny.

155
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,640
If that's the case,

156
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,880
today is the day the will is to be read?

157
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,960
That's right.

158
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,280
The lawyer won't arrive until tomorrow evening.

159
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,140
In other words,

160
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,120
if we can't expose the old man's disguise when the lawyer reads the will tomorrow,

161
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,400
our share

162
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,200
will be significantly reduced.

163
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,600
will be significantly reduced.

164
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,800
I think

165
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,680
not only will our inheritance shares be reduced,

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,280
some of us might not get anything at all.

167
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,960
Who are these people anyway?

168
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,520
That's my younger brother, Jing Jiang,

169
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,120
and next to him is my stepmother.

170
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,840
She's the second wife my father married after my mother died,

171
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,880
her name is Xu Yazhi.

172
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,640
I see.

173
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,120
In any case, before tomorrow,

174
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,740
we must prove that this uncle is an impostor.

175
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,420
What's going on, brother?

176
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,520
I remember when uncle left home,

177
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,120
he did leave some photos, didn't he?

178
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,920
We might have lost many of them when we moved later.

179
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,120
Hey, look, here's a photo album.

180
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,160
Look at this,

181
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
isn't this uncle?

182
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,080
I'm there next to him too.

183
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,240
That's right,

184
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,900
the one in the middle is uncle.

185
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,680
But he's wearing a hat,

186
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,500
we can't see his face clearly.

187
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
Seriously,

188
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,010
even if we found a photo,

189
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,560
we still can't confirm if that old man

190
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,840
is really our uncle or not.

191
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,000
However, this photo looks

192
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,840
quite nostalgic indeed.

193
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,960
I remember

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,400
this photo should have been taken after uncle and father finished playing soccer

195
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,120
after uncle and father finished playing soccer.

196
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,360
Ah, I remember now.

197
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,500
Wasn't it that time when uncle

198
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,450
stepped on a nail

199
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,040
and had to leave the game?

200
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,040
If that's the case, the real uncle

201
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,720
should have a scar on his foot.

202
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,920
If we can confirm this,

203
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,580
we'll know if it's really him.

204
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,320
That's right,

205
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,920
we just need to check if he has a scar on his foot.

206
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,040
Jingtai.

207
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,640
Make sure you see it clearly.

208
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,680
I understand.

209
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,240
Uncle,

210
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,960
you've been abroad for so many years.

211
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,440
you're probably not used to drinking tea.

212
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,170
I've poured you a cup of coffee.

213
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,650
Thank you. Just put it here.

214
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,800
Oh, Uncle, quickly take off your shoes and socks,

215
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,500
otherwise you'll get burned.

216
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,880
It's fine, it's fine.

217
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,280
It's okay, it's nothing.

218
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,640
What?

219
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
Indeed, there isn't any.

220
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,280
Let's go.

221
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,240
let's go take a look.

222
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,970
As expected, there's nothing.

223
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,980
You're referring to the scar on my left foot, right?

224
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,960
It's here.

225
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,540
This happened over twenty years ago.

226
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,960
I was playing football with your father.

227
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,280
I accidentally stepped on a nail.

228
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,680
at that time,

229
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,840
I lost a lot of blood.

230
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,400
It later got infected.

231
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,720
I almost lost this foot.

232
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,200
So this uncle is the real deal.

233
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,520
Really.

234
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:04,280
So you've been suspecting me all along.

235
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,280
You never believed me.

236
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,200
I knew each of you had ulterior motives.

237
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,760
That's why

238
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,640
I hired Anderson in advance.

239
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,280
to come here with me.

240
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,720
Uncle,

241
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,640
We just wanted to confirm

242
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,840
your identity, that's all.

243
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,280
After all, we haven't seen you for so many years.

244
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,010
And you even hired a bodyguard,

245
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,140
as if we were going to harm you.

246
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,970
Is there really no one who wants to harm me?

247
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,720
Take a look at this.

248
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,660
A threatening letter.

249
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,280
I received this threatening letter before I left the country.

250
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,400
now you know

251
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,400
why I asked Anderson to come.

252
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,160
after so many years abroad,

253
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,200
I have my own savings.

254
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:18,080
I'm not interested in my brother's inheritance.

255
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,760
But when I saw this threatening letter,

256
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,200
I had to come here to see

257
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,960
which ungrateful child

258
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,080
sent a threatening letter to me, their uncle.

259
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,520
You ungrateful children!

260
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,720
Get out.

261
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,040
All of you, get out!
