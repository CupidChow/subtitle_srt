1
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:19,120
You ungrateful children!

2
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,960
Get out!

3
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:20,840
Oh, Uncle,

4
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,280
please don't get upset.

5
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,200
It's all because we younger ones haven't done well.

6
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,930
Please be more understanding.

7
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,690
You're Gong Sun He, aren't you?

8
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,480
I remember now.

9
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,400
When you were little,

10
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:35,740
you used to come here to play all the time.

11
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,640
Uncle, you finally remember!

12
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,880
Oh, right,

13
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,320
I

14
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,180
just saw this photo in the warehouse.

15
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:46,920
Look,

16
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,360
there's A Tai and A Tai's father too.

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,580
This is a very precious photo.

18
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,800
So I was wondering

19
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,280
if you could write a message on the back for me.

20
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,160
In the future,

21
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,690
when I miss you, I can take it out and look at it.

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,039
This is indeed an old photo from over twenty years ago.

23
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,039
Seeing it here

24
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,320
is a kind of fate.

25
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,040
Well then, I wish you

26
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,680
good fortune and health. There you go.

27
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,240
Thank you, Uncle.

28
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,320
Anderson,

29
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,800
let's go.

30
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,329
Brother, you saw everything just now, right?

31
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,800
I remember when Uncle used to write,

32
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,650
he wasn't left-handed.

33
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,400
A He, do you remember?

34
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,960
It's been so long,

35
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,640
I've long forgotten.

36
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,600
But you just

37
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,240
saw the scar on your uncle's foot, didn't you?

38
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,320
Is there a possibility

39
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,100
that this old man had heard about the scar before

40
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,640
and then had someone make an identical one?

41
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,720
Could it be that

42
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
this old man is indeed an impostor?

43
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,640
No, that's not right.

44
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,740
This uncle should be the real one.

45
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:25,880
Look at this.

46
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,880
I just found this in the warehouse.

47
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,079
It's a postcard Uncle sent three years ago.

48
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:30,680
See,

49
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,820
the handwriting is identical to what he just wrote.

50
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,720
So that's why you asked that old man to write a message for you.

51
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,960
I see now.

52
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,520
Not bad!

53
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,320
As expected of De City's top detective.

54
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,780
You're really something.

55
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,579
It's so nostalgic.

56
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,600
Indeed.

57
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,440
Many years have passed in the blink of an eye.

58
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,700
Back then, we used to play in this garden,

59
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,240
carefree and without a worry in the world.

60
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,440
This well is still here.

61
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,519
After that accident happened back then,

62
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,279
I thought you would have filled it in.

63
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,120
Accident?

64
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,400
It was fifteen years ago.

65
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,280
My mother accidentally slipped

66
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,410
and fell into the well, where she died.

67
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,720
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

68
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,600
Don't worry about it.

69
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,240
It's been many years now.

70
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,200
After that incident,

71
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,540
we originally wanted to fill in the well,

72
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,960
but my father firmly disagreed.

73
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,400
Against everyone's advice, he kept the old well,

74
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,330
though it's been abandoned since.

75
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,400
No wonder I was thinking,

76
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,120
why is this well still fenced off?

77
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,440
That was added later,

78
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,960
to prevent anyone else from accidentally falling in.

79
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,380
That uncle of yours back then,

80
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,880
did he ever come to cause trouble for your family again?

81
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,680
Uncle?

82
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,160
Why would he cause trouble for you?

83
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,840
That man was just crazy.

84
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,120
He kept causing a scene at mother's funeral,

85
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,160
even claiming that someone in our family

86
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,960
had pushed mother into the well.

87
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,690
Did you conduct an investigation at the time?

88
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,440
Of course we did. The investigation concluded that

89
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,280
mother wanted to draw water from the well by herself

90
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,740
to chill some watermelon.

91
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,580
But during the process of drawing water,

92
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,210
her back gave out, causing her to lose balance

93
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,720
and fall into the well.

94
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,340
No one wanted something like this to happen.

95
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,280
It was all

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,720
just a terrible accident.

97
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
After that,

98
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,159
did you explain the situation to your uncle?

99
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,820
After all, you're all family.

100
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,240
We all explained it to him.

101
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,159
The police also told him the results.

102
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,960
But he still couldn't accept it.

103
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,440
Since then,

104
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,140
he hasn't appeared again,

105
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,840
as if he disappeared.

106
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,560
Do you think

107
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,480
if he knows about tomorrow's inheritance distribution,

108
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,640
he might show up?

109
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,970
What could he do even if he came?

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,240
Even if he did come,

111
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,120
legally, he can't inherit father's estate.

112
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,240
What if your father

113
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,000
specifically left him a share in the will?

114
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,120
After all, he's his late wife's brother.

115
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,280
He might have felt guilty towards him.

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,440
Wouldn't that mean one more person to share our inheritance?

117
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,720
He can forget about it.

118
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,520
As long as that person is still alive,

119
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,090
we can't rule out the possibility.

120
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,120
He might even be on his way here now.

121
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,980
If that's really the case,

122
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,400
you all

123
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,320
need to be careful.

124
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,980
That person has hated this family for over a decade.

125
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,320
But it has nothing to do with me anymore.

126
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,280
After all, when the previous wife died,

127
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,080
I didn't even know any of you.

128
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,810
Stepmother,

129
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,140
did you come here just to say this?

130
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,880
Of course not.

131
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,720
I'm going to attend a party soon.

132
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,380
I'll be taking the family car.

133
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,560
I'll leave the house to you all.

134
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,440
Who is it?

135
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,000
Strange.

136
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,320
I clearly saw someone over here.

137
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,060
Could you have been mistaken?

138
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,080
It couldn't be that uncle we were just talking about, could it?

139
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,140
How could it be? Don't talk nonsense.

140
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,080
Hello, who's this?

141
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,840
It's Tian Shan.

142
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,400
Oh, Second Aunt. What's the matter?

143
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,680
Has the bathroom run out of firewood?

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,600
So it might be inconvenient to take a bath today.

145
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,120
Let's have a drink, beautiful lady.

146
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,210
What's wrong, Second Aunt?

147
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,160
Stop it, I'm on the phone.

148
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, right.

149
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,520
I bought the firewood this morning.

150
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,800
It's in the warehouse.

151
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,960
Okay, I got it.

152
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,840
It seems

153
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,000
our dear Second Aunt

154
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,850
has already found a new man.

155
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,560
This woman,

156
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,340
father has only been gone for a month.

157
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Tonight's dinner is Chinese food.

158
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,280
That puts my mind at ease.

159
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,039
Don't worry.

160
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,919
Chinese food,

161
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,620
after all, we'll all be eating together.

162
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,320
No need for separate dishes.

163
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,480
This way, we can avoid anyone poisoning the food.

164
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,640
Uncle,

165
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,340
don't take it to heart.

166
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,080
That threatening letter might just be a prank.

167
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,840
If that's the case, then it's all good.

168
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,360
Come on,

169
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,840
Anderson.

170
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,160
I'll leave this to you.

171
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,960
Are you saying Anderson is going to

172
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,440
watch all of us while Uncle is taking a bath?

173
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,940
It looks like that's the case.

174
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,080
Fire...

175
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,720
Later...

176
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,410
Is that Second Aunt?

177
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,720
I can't hear you clearly.

178
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,120
After eleven o'clock...

179
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,560
Go back...

180
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,600
A hot bath is still very comfortable.

181
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,640
The water is already heated.

182
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,570
See which one of you wants to go.

183
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,360
I'm tired.

184
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,480
I'll go take a bath first.
