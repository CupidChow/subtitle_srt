1
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,640
Who was it then?

2
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,450
Who killed the second mother in the bathroom?

3
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,160
Actually,

4
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,260
if we think from Xu Yazhi's perspective,

5
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,700
we can find the answer.

6
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,360
First,

7
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,000
the strong Lu Jingtai and Lu Jingjiang

8
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,020
were definitely not her targets.

9
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,320
And although Tian Shan, also being a woman,

10
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,880
was a good target,

11
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,640
she couldn't determine which order Tian Shan would go to the bathroom.

12
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,960
If someone else entered the bathroom before her,

13
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,360
it would be troublesome.

14
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,880
Her real target

15
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,840
could only be the first person to enter the bathroom.

16
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,240
That would be you, Uncle.

17
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,880
Mr. Lu Tianci,

18
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,560
that's quite a good deduction.

19
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,640
But I have to ask you,

20
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,560
why would the first person to enter the bathroom

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,800
be me?

22
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,539
Because you're the elder, of course.

23
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,520
In the Lu family's customs,

24
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,740
elders always have priority.

25
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,640
Xu Yazhi observed over the past few days

26
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:19,040
and knew that when you were bathing,

27
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,680
you would definitely leave bodyguard Anderson

28
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,340
in the room to watch everyone.

29
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,440
So,

30
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,600
she wouldn't worry about being discovered when she went out.

31
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,640
I think Ms. Xu Yazhi must have believed

32
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,280
that Mr. Lu Tianci was old

33
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,880
and not very mobile, making him an easy target.

34
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,880
But what she didn't expect was

35
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,960
that Mr. Lu Tianci was actually a martial arts expert.

36
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,400
When Xu Yazhi raised the knife to attack Uncle,

37
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,240
she was caught by Uncle in the moment of attack,

38
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,480
and then he swiftly stabbed the knife into Xu Yazhi's chest.

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,680
That's right, Uncle.

40
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,130
Qingtian and I are both trained fighters.

41
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,120
You shouldn't have acted in front of us.

42
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,440
I think Xu Yazhi's real purpose

43
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,720
was also to fight over the distribution of the inheritance.

44
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,160
Well, if everything is as you say,

45
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,860
then Uncle's actions should be considered self-defense.

46
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,680
But why didn't he say so?

47
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
I think Uncle

48
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,520
couldn't be absolutely certain

49
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,850
that the owner of this letter was Xu Yazhi.

50
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,720
That's why he placed the body

51
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,020
in a place where it could be easily found,

52
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,410
as a warning to others not to act against him carelessly.

53
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,960
Uncle,

54
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,320
can you now tell us everything?

55
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:29,640
You're too naive, Gong Sun He.

56
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,680
Who are you?

57
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,600
You can call me by my codename, Tailor.

58
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,800
You appear so openly,

59
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,520
aren't you afraid we'll arrest you?

60
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,520
On what grounds would you arrest me?

61
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,280
I haven't done anything.

62
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,940
I was invited here by Mr. Lu Tianyang.

63
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,480
Now, as long as the lawyer

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,560
reads out the will,

65
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,720
the truth will come to light.

66
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,060
Then, Lawyer Lin, please read the will quickly.

67
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,120
Alright.

68
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,140
Then I will officially read the will.

69
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,920
Last Will and Testament.

70
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,960
I, Lu Tianyang, hereby decide

71
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,240
to distribute my estate among the following five individuals:

72
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,800
namely, my wife,

73
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,200
Xu Yazhi,

74
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,960
my eldest son Lu Jingtai,

75
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,529
my eldest daughter-in-law Tian Shan,

76
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,279
my younger son Lu Jingjiang, and Anderson.

77
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,250
These five individuals shall equally divide all assets under my name.

78
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,080
October 25th, 1945.

79
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,320
Testator:

80
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,240
Lu Tianyang

81
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,560
Anderson?

82
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,440
Lawyer,

83
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,320
are you sure you read that correctly?

84
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,120
That's correct.

85
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,280
The last name is indeed Anderson.

86
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,560
Moreover, Mr. Lu even wrote

87
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,060
Anderson's date of birth after his name.

88
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,680
This is so strange.

89
00:04:50,159 --> 00:04:52,920
Why isn't Uncle's name

90
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,920
Lu Tianci on the will?

91
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,000
It's normal that his name isn't there.

92
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,040
Because the old man in front of you

93
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,960
is not your uncle.

94
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,570
He's actually a bodyguard who came

95
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,280
all the way from abroad

96
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,920
to protect Anderson.

97
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,560
Then who is Anderson?

98
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,120
He is the real Lu Tianci's

99
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,440
child born to a woman abroad,

100
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,450
which means he's Lu Tianyang's nephew

101
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,080
and your cousin.

102
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,640
Why did you come here?

103
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,100
What's your real purpose?

104
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,170
Mr. Lu Tianyang was worried

105
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,840
that someone among you might harm family members

106
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,080
in order to fight for the inheritance.

107
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,000
So he asked me to secretly keep an eye on you all.

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,860
If anyone tried to harm Anderson,

109
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,840
I would intervene to stop them.

110
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
If that's the case,

111
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,300
you were present when Xu Yazhi made her move?

112
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,560
That's correct.

113
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,080
Then why didn't you stop her?

114
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,120
If you had stopped her, she wouldn't have died.

115
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,280
Why should I have stopped her?

116
00:05:59,280 --> 00:05:59,800
You...

117
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,880
She was trying to kill this old man,

118
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,880
not Anderson.

119
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,840
Wait.

120
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,460
You say this uncle in front of us is not my real uncle,

121
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,280
but why does he have an injury on his foot?

122
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,880
Moreover,

123
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,840
his handwriting

124
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,400
matches the handwriting on the postcards we received.

125
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,930
The handwriting is the same

126
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,880
because this old man wrote those postcards.

127
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,600
Why is that?

128
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Ten years ago,

129
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,760
your uncle was outdoors

130
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,320
when a tornado

131
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,320
caused him to lose his right arm.

132
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,040
Since then,

133
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,760
all letters and postcards have been written by his good friend,

134
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,159
who is this old man in front of you.

135
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,720
These are the letters

136
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,580
Lu Tianci sent to his brother over the years,

137
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,330
which provide a complete account of this matter.

138
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,659
Six months ago,

139
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,600
Lu Tianci passed away abroad due to illness.

140
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,640
Your father also fell gravely ill.

141
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,680
To ensure his nephew could also have a good life,

142
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,840
he allocated a portion of the inheritance to Anderson.

143
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,600
Then why did this old man impersonate our uncle?

144
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,280
Could it be

145
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,050
he wanted to claim this part of the inheritance for himself?

146
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,800
If he really wanted to claim the inheritance for himself,

147
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,460
he wouldn't have become the target of an attack.

148
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,400
If someone knew

149
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,800
Anderson is Lu Tianci's son.

150
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,880
Then the person who sent the threatening letter

151
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,120
will definitely target Anderson.

152
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,120
That's why he impersonated Lu Tianci,

153
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,380
to make the intimidator direct their attacks towards him.

154
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,360
The best proof is

155
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,120
that every time he takes a shower,

156
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,640
he makes sure Anderson is with all of you.

157
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,960
is the safest.

158
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,720
The original intention was to catch the intimidator.

159
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,000
But he ended up accidentally killing him.

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,400
Based on the circumstances at the time,

161
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,000
it was indeed self-defense.

162
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,600
However, once he reveals this situation,

163
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,680
he will definitely have to go to the police station for questioning.

164
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,000
That's why he placed the body in the most easily discoverable location.

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,800
I see.

166
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,560
So that's how it is.

167
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,080
Am I correct?

168
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,880
Mr. Qin Dongli,

169
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,000
you are absolutely correct.

170
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,120
That's exactly how it is.

171
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,240
However, there's one thing I didn't know.

172
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,720
I didn't know that Mr. Lu Tianyang

173
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,960
had someone secretly protecting Anderson.

174
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,240
If I had known,

175
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,280
I wouldn't have been so nervous

176
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,880
and killed in self-defense.

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,320
Xu Yazhi.

178
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,640
Mr. Tailor,

179
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,360
since your task is already completed,

180
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,760
please come with me to the police station for investigation.

181
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,570
I have no interest in going to the police station.

182
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,100
The reason I accepted the invitation

183
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,240
was to repay Mr. Lu Tianyang's kindness.

184
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,800
If you don't want to perish together with me,

185
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,080
you're welcome to arrest me.

186
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,890
Should we still pursue?

187
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,280
Let it go. It's too dangerous.

188
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,160
Mr. Qin,

189
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,240
please come back to the police station with us.

190
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,400
Don't worry.

191
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,700
Gong Sunhe is an excellent detective under my command.

192
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,680
With him protecting Anderson's safety,

193
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,340
you can be completely at ease.

194
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,200
If that's the case,

195
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,840
then I'll leave it to you.

196
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,280
I just found out.

197
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,100
This Anderson doesn't speak Chinese at all.

198
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,760
He doesn't even know that he's been here

199
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,400
waiting to inherit these past few days.

200
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
What should we do?

201
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,980
Should we take him to the police station too?

202
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,660
I'll go talk to him.

203
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,400
Don't worry.

204
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,960
Mr. Qin will be back soon.

205
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,620
Let's wait for him here, okay?

206
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,400
Where is uncle going?

207
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,560
Will he be alright?

208
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,880
He's going to the police station to assist with the investigation. He'll be fine.

209
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,080
I promise you.

210
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,520
Good child,

211
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
this detective will protect you.

212
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,600
I'll be back soon,

213
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,960
okay?

214
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,000
Okay.

215
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,200
Anderson,

216
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,320
your father is my uncle.

217
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,280
We are cousins.

218
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,400
We're family.

219
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,040
Don't worry, cousin.

220
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,640
I'll keep you safe.
