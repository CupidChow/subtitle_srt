1
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,360
No way.

2
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,480
We only have five minutes left.

3
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
I can't disarm it.

4
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:20,960
Inspector,

5
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,180
You killed her.

6
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,220
You killed her.

7
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,160
Kill her.

8
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,340
Then I can live.

9
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,920
I'll give you money.

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,960
One million isn't enough.

11
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,690
Two million.

12
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,880
All my businesses,

13
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,600
including my family fortune, I'll give you everything.

14
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,440
I beg you.

15
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,660
Please save me.

16
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,620
I don't want to die yet.

17
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,620
Inspector,

18
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:45,560
Inspector,

19
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,560
what are you doing?

20
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,960
Didn't you say you couldn't disarm it?

21
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,039
Even if I can't disarm it, I have to try.

22
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,570
If you want to live, shut up.

23
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:03,600
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,760
I really can't disarm it.

25
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,760
Kill her.

26
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,419
Kill her to save me.

27
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,680
Please,

28
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,400
kill her to save me.

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,120
No, don't kill me.

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,880
Don't kill me.

31
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,960
I haven't committed any crime.

32
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,200
I'm innocent.

33
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,680
Don't kill me.

34
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,320
Qingtian.

35
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,120
You.

36
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,660
You're one of the Tailors.

37
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,040
That's right.

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,180
You approached me from the beginning

39
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,320
with a purpose.

40
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,600
Our boss greatly admires your talent.

41
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,960
Gong Sunhe, join our Tailor organization.

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Only by joining us

43
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,040
can you realize the justice in your heart.

44
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,120
The justice in my heart

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,850
doesn't need you to realize it.

46
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,280
Bao Qingtian.

47
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,160
I trusted you so much,

48
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
liked you so much.

49
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,370
So you've been deceiving me all along.

50
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,760
You haven't told me your name yet.

51
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,320
Gong Sun He.

52
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,040
We'll meet again soon.

53
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,320
You

54
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,400
Can you be with me?

55
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,760
Qing Tian

56
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,370
You haven't answered my question yet.

57
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,170
Bao Qing Tian

58
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,840
You are suspected of joining a terrorist organization.

59
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,400
Infiltrating the police department,

60
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,120
providing top-secret information to the organization.

61
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,880
I now

62
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,360
formally arrest you as a detective inspector.

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,880
Gong Sun He.

64
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,160
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,240
Lao Luo adopted me when I was little.

66
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,320
he treated me like his own daughter.

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,800
if I can only choose one,

68
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,880
I can only choose him.

69
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,159
Hurry, hurry!

70
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,520
Oh my! Quick, save them!

71
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,180
Gong Sun He!

72
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,920
Gong Sun He!

73
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,720
I'll do it.

74
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,740
He's awake.

75
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,560
He's fine now.

76
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,520
Go check on him.

77
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,400
What happened?

78
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,360
Where's Qingtian?

79
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,320
Where is Qingtian?

80
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,000
You don't need to say anything.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,960
I already know.

82
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,920
Qingtian is a member of the Tailor organization.

83
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,680
Zheng Sheng.

84
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,520
She's the one who killed him, isn't she?

85
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,450
How did you know?

86
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,410
When the team gathered,

87
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,480
she snuck away.

88
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,080
I knew then.

89
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,360
But don't worry,

90
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,770
I've already sent people to track her.

91
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,760
We'll definitely catch

92
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,020
the Tailor's old lair.

93
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,040
Get up now.

94
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,050
What's going on?

95
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,960
Chief Xiao has sent us news.

96
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,600
The tailor's hiding place has been confirmed.

97
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,260
It's in Xiangjiang District.

98
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:51,920
Let's go.

99
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,200
Qing Tian,

100
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,320
I raised you for over a decade.

101
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,240
Is this how you repay me?

102
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,080
I'm sorry, foster father.

103
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,240
I'm willing to take full responsibility for this incident.

104
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,480
This carefully planned event of mine

105
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,880
as long as Gong Sun He fires a shot,

106
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,920
it will shake him psychologically.

107
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,200
Then,

108
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,360
I can break him down step by step

109
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,960
and bring him over to our side.

110
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,360
What I never expected was

111
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,920
you ruined my first step of the plan.

112
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,200
I'm sorry.

113
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,360
You haven't really fallen in love with that guy, have you?

114
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,159
Bao Qingtian,

115
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,810
if you don't have feelings for Gong Sun He,

116
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,920
then why did you kill Zheng Sheng?

117
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,340
Why did you expose your identity?

118
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,100
Foster father,

119
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,880
Gong Sun He is very intelligent and upholds justice.

120
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,680
I believe that with a detective like him in De City,

121
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,640
there's no need for us tailors at all.

122
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,360
As long as we're willing to hand over these criminal files,

123
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:49,880
Shut up!

124
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,040
Bao Qingtian!

125
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,020
Have you forgotten how your own family died?

126
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,320
If the law was effective,

127
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,530
how would they have ended up like this?

128
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,680
Qing Tian,

129
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,720
you brought the police here.

130
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,400
I didn't, Father, I didn't.

131
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,920
It wasn't me, Father.

132
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,880
We'll split up.

133
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,610
You come with me.

134
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,200
So it's you.

135
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,130
Put the gun down,

136
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,400
or I'll shoot her dead.

137
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
You can't escape.

138
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,770
Did I say I was trying to escape?

139
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,680
Who are you really?

140
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
Twenty years ago,

141
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,020
your father died because of a bombing incident.

142
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,200
How do you know that?

143
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,080
I also know that your father not only didn't receive any reward,

144
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,320
but was also held responsible for the damages caused by the explosion.

145
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,040
This is the justice you uphold,

146
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,300
and all it brought him.

147
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
As far as I know,

148
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,360
that person wasn't even the bomber.

149
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,800
He was just an ordinary civilian with a bomb strapped to him.

150
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,080
And my father died trying to save him.

151
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,920
So what?

152
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,920
In the end, there wasn't even a complete body left.

153
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,560
My father sacrificed himself to save others.

154
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,240
And you?

155
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,490
You're just satisfying your own twisted desire to kill.

156
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,320
Back during the Rakshasa Bride case,

157
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,980
you could have saved Liu Geng,

158
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,880
but you let Zhou Yansheng kill him instead.

159
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,520
Didn't Liu Geng deserve to die?

160
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,850
If your so-called justice was effective,

161
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,680
how would he have died by my hand?

162
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,480
I'm carrying out heaven's will.

163
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,800
I don't care how you try to glorify yourself.

164
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,920
You're just a bloodstained murderer yourself.

165
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,880
blood.

166
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,040
Are your hands clean?

167
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,480
The justice you uphold

168
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,360
is just the interests of certain people.

169
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,920
You're merely killing tools for those in power.

170
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,320
Let me tell you the truth,

171
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,080
in that explosion case years ago,

172
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,320
I was among those your father saved.

173
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Was justice fair to your father?

174
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,360
I don't care what you say,

175
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,080
I'm going to arrest you today.

176
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,760
Fine.

177
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,840
Go to hell!

178
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,120
Qing Tian.

179
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,520
Qing Tian.

180
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Gong Sun He.

181
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
I'm sorry.

182
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,320
Qing Tian.

183
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:04,880
Qing Tian.

184
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,960
Qing Tian.

185
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,520
Qing Tian.

186
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,760
Bao Qing Tian.

187
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,560
I will always be by your side.

188
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,400
Gong Sun He.

189
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,400
We're setting off.
