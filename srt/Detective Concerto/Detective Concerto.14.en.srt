1
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,130
Master, Master!

2
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,600
Wake up, get up!

3
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,800
What's the fuss so early in the morning?

4
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,560
We found the murder weapon while dredging the dry well.

5
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,120
Look.

6
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:30,240
Let me see.

7
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,080
It's an ordinary watermelon knife.

8
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,800
but it's worth noting that

9
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,330
when we found it, it was wrapped in a raincoat.

10
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,680
Raincoat?

11
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,340
Gong Sun He, what do you think?

12
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,400
I'll go and do a wound comparison first.

13
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,800
Chief,

14
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,160
there's a man outside trying to force his way in.

15
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,120
Who's so bold?

16
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,289
Let's go take a look.

17
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:24,240
Sir,

18
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,240
this is a crime scene, you can't go in.

19
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,520
I've said this several times already.

20
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,360
I'm a lawyer.

21
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,320
A lawyer?

22
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,160
A lawyer, huh?

23
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,620
Even lawyers can't barge into a crime scene.

24
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,240
You're the lawyer in charge of the will

25
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,320
for the owner of this house, Mr. Lu Tianyang, right?

26
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,650
Yes, my name is Lin Tian.

27
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,360
I'm here to work today.

28
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,180
I'm here to announce Mr. Lu Tianyang's will.

29
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,480
Alright then, let him in.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,160
What do you mean the will's publication needs to be postponed?

31
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,760
Because the killer hasn't been caught yet.

32
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,960
Our investigation here isn't over either.

33
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,400
Ah.

34
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,080
What right do you have to interfere in our family affairs?

35
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,800
Right?

36
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,560
By virtue of my position as the police chief.

37
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,020
Is that enough authority?

38
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,440
You greedy descendants.

39
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,160
arguing about the inheritance again.

40
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,240
What are you saying here, you old geezer?

41
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,300
Our family matters

42
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,600
are none of your business.

43
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,530
I'm warning you.

44
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,720
I don't care if you're a real uncle or a fake one,

45
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,720
don't meddle in our family affairs.

46
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,600
Young man,

47
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,800
you're asking for trouble.

48
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,600
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

49
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,570
Alright, let's do this.

50
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,160
There's no need for you to argue over something like this.

51
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,079
When the will is announced later,

52
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,560
I'll watch from the side.

53
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,620
Why didn't you say so earlier?

54
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,160
This uncle's skills

55
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,840
are impressive.

56
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,360
His skills

57
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,180
are indeed those of an expert.

58
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,960
If that's the case,

59
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,090
uncle's bodyguard,

60
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,820
Anderson's skills must be even better than his.

61
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,040
I'd really like to test them out.

62
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,960
Qingtian,

63
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,040
I didn't know you had this hobby.

64
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,400
Martial artists always want to test themselves against stronger opponents.

65
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,200
they always want to give it a try.

66
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,850
Alright.

67
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,040
But I'm still wondering,

68
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,200
if this uncle's skills are so good,

69
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,780
is it necessary for him

70
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,760
to hire bodyguards to protect himself?

71
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,960
Maybe he feels safer with an extra person for protection.

72
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,240
Hmm.

73
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,800
Let's go inside.

74
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,200
Okay.

75
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,159
Now then,

76
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
I will announce Mr. Lu Tianyang's

77
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,320
last will and testament.

78
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,520
Please listen carefully.

79
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
Where's the will?

80
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,770
I remember putting it in my bag.

81
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,610
Where did that arrow come from?

82
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,180
It's a delayed device.

83
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,040
Once the time is up and the alarm goes off,

84
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:31,440
it will automatically break out and shoot the hidden weapon.

85
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,520
Who set this up?

86
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,320
Who on earth

87
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,780
would set up something like this?

88
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,060
This is attempted murder!

89
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,600
Who on earth

90
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,200
set up this trap?

91
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,640
I think

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,320
it must be that uncle you mentioned yesterday.

93
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,240
It has to be him.

94
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,600
He's also the one who was peeping at the back door yesterday.

95
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,600
He must have sneaked into our house.

96
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,600
He's planning to kill one of us

97
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,440
to show up here and inherit the estate.

98
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,640
Damn, just for a larger share of the inheritance,

99
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,320
is it necessary to do such a thing?

100
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:03,800
No.

101
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,340
He didn't do it.

102
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,040
How do you know it wasn't him?

103
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,360
Follow me inside and take a look.

104
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,560
This should be the killer.

105
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,960
Repeated experiments to determine the direction of attack.

106
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,320
The purpose was to shoot and kill

107
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,450
the person who would always sit there.

108
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,720
If I'm not mistaken,

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,720
the matter of reading the will

110
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,800
must have been decided to be in the conference room long ago, right?

111
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,480
Then,

112
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,040
how did the killer know who would sit where?

113
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,200
Of course he knew.

114
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,820
The Lu family is a big clan.

115
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,409
Big families always like to follow the rules.

116
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,120
As the current head of the Lu family, Lu Jingtai

117
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,280
would certainly sit at the head of the table.

118
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,800
And the seat to the left of the head

119
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,000
is reserved for the person

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,120
with the highest seniority in the family after the head.

121
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,450
So the person the killer wanted to kill was

122
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,520
your uncle,

123
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,000
Mr. Lu Tianci.

124
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,040
I knew it.

125
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,770
Those black-hearted people want my old life.

126
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,360
Saying the threatening letter was a prank.

127
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,320
I think

128
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,760
it must be that man who was peeping at the back door yesterday.

129
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,920
It seems your uncle really hates our family to death.

130
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
It's very possible.

131
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,640
Maybe the killer is sitting in some corner right now,

132
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,300
watching us with a cold sneer.

133
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,200
We found

134
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,360
an unfinished cigarette in the backyard warehouse.

135
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,880
May I ask if anyone here smokes?

136
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,480
No,

137
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,220
no one in the family smokes except my father.

138
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,560
That's strange then.

139
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,760
Because that cigarette was still warm.

140
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,200
Song Si, take me to see it.

141
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,640
The man with sunglasses must still be nearby.

142
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,700
Go search quickly.

143
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,800
Not only that,

144
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,240
when I examined the murder weapon,

145
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,160
I only found the victim Xu Yazhi's blood and fingerprints.

146
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,320
Moreover, from the fingerprint marks,

147
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,800
it appears the victim held the knife handle in a natural grip.

148
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,760
Natural grip?

149
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,610
That's impossible.

150
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,520
If she was being stabbed,

151
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,360
she would instinctively grab the knife,

152
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,520
but it should be a reverse grip,

153
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,200
not a forward grip.

154
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:35,120
Could the killer be trying to make it look like suicide?

155
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,760
I don't think that's possible.

156
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,760
The killer couldn't be that stupid.

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,960
I'm back.

158
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,929
How did it go?

159
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,760
I went to the Pingkang Hotel.

160
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,440
According to the hotel manager and Xu Yazhi's friend,

161
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,960
Xu Yazhi did go to the hotel last night.

162
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,520
But they don't know when she left.

163
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,760
I also checked the call records at the switchboard.

164
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,080
Indeed, at 9 o'clock at the hotel,

165
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,680
there was a call made from the Pingkang Hotel

166
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,440
to the Lu family mansion.

167
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,040
Tian Shan,

168
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,320
you said yesterday that your second aunt called at 9 p.m.

169
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,880
and said she wouldn't be home until after 11, right?

170
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,680
That's right.

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,640
At first, I couldn't hear clearly what she was saying.

172
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
The last sentence was the clearest.

173
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,120
But why did she come back around 10 o'clock

174
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,060
when she clearly said she'd be back after 11:30?

175
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,640
You all come back first.

176
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,840
The lawyer has found the will.

177
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,300
It will be announced soon.

178
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,530
Let's go.

179
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,010
Let's go.

180
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,660
Xiao Fu,

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,800
show me their statements again.

182
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,060
Here you go.

183
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,320
Who is this Gu Wanting?

184
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,280
She said she seemed to have seen

185
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,660
Xu Yazhi making a phone call at 9 o'clock.

186
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,840
She's a waitress at the Pingkang Hotel.

187
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,840
But she said she couldn't really remember.

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,330
She's not sure if anyone made a phone call.

189
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
That's not right.

190
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,600
If she can't remember

191
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,800
whether a call was made or not, that's possible.

192
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,930
But not remembering who made the call,

193
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,410
that's a bit stupid.

194
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,520
You think

195
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,540
this waitress is suspicious?

196
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,080
That's right.

197
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,200
Okay, I'll go investigate.

198
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:31,800
Mm-hmm.

199
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,640
Wait a moment.

200
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,500
What's wrong, A He?

201
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,000
I already know.

202
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,050
who the culprit behind these two cases really is.

203
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,880
Who is it?
