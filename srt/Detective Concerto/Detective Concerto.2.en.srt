1
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,400
I donated ten thousand silver dollars.

2
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,440
Ten thousand silver dollars!

3
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,720
They gave us time off to come out and have fun,

4
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,380
and they put us up in this dump?

5
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,960
Oh, never mind.

6
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,210
Maybe it's surprisingly nice inside.

7
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,440
Just look at the exterior.

8
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,570
How good could the inside possibly be?

9
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,240
Dear guest,

10
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,560
please don't say that.

11
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,840
Our inn

12
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,840
has been in business for many years.

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,600
It's fully equipped inside,

14
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,920
and the rooms even have hot water supply.

15
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,120
Who are you?

16
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,479
I am the owner of this inn.

17
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,920
You must be

18
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,320
the four gentlemen from the Decheng Police Station, right?

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,250
Please, come in.

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,920
How did you know

21
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,640
I'm from the Decheng Police Station?

22
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,360
There are only two groups of guests.

23
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,000
One group checked in yesterday,

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,130
and the other is you.

25
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,370
Please, come in.

26
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,680
Do you prefer the shakehand grip or the penhold grip?

27
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,480
I prefer using the penhold grip.

28
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,420
then I start with a topspin serve,

29
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,820
followed by a powerful smash,

30
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,240
and then I loop, loop the ball.

31
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,840
Yes.

32
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,680
I particularly enjoy the thrill of looping.

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,360
I think it's great.

34
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,040
There's a table tennis room here.

35
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,040
Luckily, I brought my paddle and some ping pong balls.

36
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,760
Bao Qingtian.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,260
This time, I'll show you what I'm made of.

38
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,450
The owner says the rooms are ready.

39
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,560
But there are only two rooms.

40
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,720
And we need to share, two people per room.

41
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,050
Because the entire inn only has six rooms.

42
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,280
So I guess that means we'll be sharing a room, right?

43
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,540
Dream on. You'll be sharing with Song Si.

44
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,040
Alright then.

45
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,340
Check-in is done. Let's go upstairs.

46
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,120
Hey.

47
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,120
Hello.

48
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,320
Excuse me,

49
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,800
are you the four detectives from Decheng?

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,120
I didn't expect to meet detectives here.

51
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,920
It's an honor.

52
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,040
I'm a student from Zhongshan Academy of Fine Arts.

53
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,100
My name is Liu Geng.

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,160
Hello there.

55
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,800
I'm Lv Wenshou.

56
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,060
I'm Zhou Yansheng.

57
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,400
My name is Huang Tian.

58
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,640
We're all students from Zhongshan Academy of Fine Arts.

59
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,200
We came here to have some fun during the holiday.

60
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,440
Otherwise, once we graduate,

61
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,360
we'll all go our separate ways.

62
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,800
So you're all students from Zhongshan Academy of Fine Arts.

63
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,860
then in the future,

64
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,410
you'll all be big shots.

65
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,440
Not really.

66
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,820
If you have some free time,

67
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,720
you could paint a picture for us.

68
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,800
When you become famous in the future,

69
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,160
we'll be rich.

70
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,200
Detective Gong Sun,

71
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,060
could you be a little more modest?

72
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,600
The detective is really too humorous.

73
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,320
Oh, right.

74
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,160
We're planning to play ping pong later.

75
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,720
Would you like to join us?

76
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,440
Sure.

77
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Let us go put our things away first.

78
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,560
Okay.

79
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,700
See you in a bit.

80
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,320
We'll wait for you. See you soon.

81
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:03,850
Bye-bye.

82
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,240
Gong Sun He.

83
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,810
Are you alright?

84
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,320
We need to go downstairs now.

85
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,250
Wait a moment. I'll be right there.

86
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,200
Let's go.

87
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
It's really fine.

88
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,480
it's really okay.

89
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,760
No, no.

90
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,400
I've left the medicine and hot water on the table.

91
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Make sure to take it before you come down.

92
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,800
That's what you get for eating so much junk.

93
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,120
Song Si.

94
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,730
How's Gong Sun He doing?

95
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,520
He's taken his medicine.

96
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,480
it should take effect in an hour.

97
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,760
He should be resting now.

98
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,240
Come on.

99
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:51,960
Ah.

100
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,800
Kids.

101
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,400
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

102
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,200
Now, let me show you something.

103
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,000
The prowess of Decheng's top player.

104
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,280
Dinner is ready.

105
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,100
Finally, it's time to eat.

106
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,490
Let's go eat.

107
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,280
Come on, let's go.

108
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,720
No.

109
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,490
Give it to me.

110
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,160
What are we having today?

111
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,760
Officers,

112
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,409
do you have time now?

113
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,080
It's okay.

114
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,810
We don't have much to do either.

115
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,040
So, do you want to play together?

116
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,800
every summer,

117
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,800
we often play a game.

118
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,480
This isn't your first time here, is it?

119
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,800
It's our first time here,

120
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,680
but this game

121
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,360
is our traditional game.

122
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,720
Traditional game?

123
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,280
Sounds interesting.

124
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,620
What kind of game is it?

125
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,840
Of course, it's

126
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,810
a courage test game.

127
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,280
It can scare you so much

128
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,820
that your legs go weak.

129
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,960
A courage test game?

130
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,680
Do we play it in this hotel?

131
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,410
Of course not in this hotel.

132
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,400
It seems you don't know

133
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,160
why this hotel is so cheap.

134
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,880
Come on, I'll show you.

135
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,120
Let's go.

136
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,400
let's go.

137
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,240
Next,

138
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,540
don't be frightened by what you're about to see.

139
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,680
Everyone can see the hospital across from the cemetery, right?

140
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,810
There's a legend about that hospital.

141
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,409
A pregnant woman named Liu Hui'er, wearing a wedding dress,

142
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,280
hanged herself in the hospital bathroom.

143
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,680
But during the process of hanging herself,

144
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
she unexpectedly gave birth to her child.

145
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,640
As a result,

146
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,200
as soon as the baby was born,

147
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,460
it fell into the sewer.

148
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,080
Later, that pregnant woman

149
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,740
turned into a terrifying Rakshasa ghost bride.

150
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,520
She has been wandering in every corner of the hospital.

151
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,240
That Rakshasa bride has killed many people.

152
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,770
Look at this graveyard,

153
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,960
more than half

154
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,080
of the dead are people from that hospital.

155
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,160
Rakshasa ghost bride...

156
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,240
But in fact,

157
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,360
it's just some scary ghost stories spread through hearsay.

158
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,080
This is the hospital that was abandoned ten years ago.

159
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,800
How about it?

160
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,730
Scary, isn't it?

161
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,460
The place you mentioned for the courage test

162
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,840
couldn't be

163
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,240
Yes, it's right here.

164
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,360
Do you know

165
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,640
where the Rakshasa Ghost Bride might appear?

166
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,600
Perhaps

167
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,200
she's

168
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
right beside you.

169
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
Those are just legends.

170
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,880
I'm not scared at all.

171
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,080
You say you're not scared,

172
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,080
but look how much your legs are shaking.
