1
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,620
We found Zheng Sheng's death notice.

2
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,880
This tailor is really thorough in his actions.

3
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,960
It seems he's planning to kill everyone responsible for Zhao Ping'an's death.

4
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,960
Go investigate Zheng Sheng's house immediately.

5
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,920
Alright, alright.

6
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,180
we'll go investigate Zheng Sheng's situation right away.

7
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,039
Okay.

8
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,090
I'll call you when we have results.

9
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,650
Let's go.

10
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,360
It's confirmed that Zheng Sheng has also been kidnapped.

11
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,520
Let's go to Zheng Sheng's house to gather more information.

12
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,479
Let's go.

13
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,000
Zheng Sheng hasn't been found yet.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,520
Why are we going back to De City?

15
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,580
Because Zheng Sheng is very likely in De City right now.

16
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,810
You've figured out the meaning of that sentence?

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,640
Although there's only one possibility,

18
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,900
it can only be this way.

19
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,240
It ends at the beginning.

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,880
If it's the tailor,

21
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,120
this sentence must have some cause and effect relationship.

22
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
As for the ending,

23
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,050
it should refer to when Zhao Ping'an was officially killed.

24
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,080
The beginning should be when Zheng Sheng decided to develop the land

25
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,680
and build Xinxin Department Store.

26
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,740
If that's the case,

27
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,880
Zheng Sheng is very likely

28
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,760
somewhere in Xinxin Department Store.

29
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,840
And the time of death

30
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,480
should be the same as Zhao Ping'an's death time,

31
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,360
which is 10 PM.

32
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,520
10 PM?

33
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,800
This tailor seems to have quite a sense of ceremony in his actions.

34
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,440
Alright then.

35
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
I'll go make arrangements.

36
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,840
Let's depart right away.

37
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,410
Let's go.

38
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,240
What should we do now?

39
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,520
We've searched everywhere in Zheng Sheng's house and Shengfeng Money House.

40
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,520
We didn't find anything valuable.

41
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,440
Oh, right.

42
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,610
Why are we coming to Xinxin Department Store?

43
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,410
Are you going shopping?

44
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,680
Xinxin Department Store is the initial connection point

45
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
between Zheng Sheng and Zhao Ping'an.

46
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,360
It's also the beginning of Zhao Ping'an's tragic life.

47
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,760
Perhaps we can find some unexpected gains.

48
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
That makes sense.

49
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,080
Let's go in and take a look.

50
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,610
Let's go.

51
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,600
Hey.

52
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,020
What are you two sneaking around for?

53
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,400
Who are you calling sneaky?

54
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,240
Oh.

55
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,700
So it's the two bosses.

56
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,860
I apologize for not recognizing you.

57
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,160
May I ask what brings you here?

58
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,520
Where's your manager?

59
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,520
We need to see him.

60
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,530
The manager?

61
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,800
Just turn this corner.

62
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,240
Do you need me to accompany you?

63
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,800
No need, we can go by ourselves.

64
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,730
Alright, got it.

65
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,760
Don't come any closer.

66
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,220
You must be Song Si, right?

67
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
How do you know?

68
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,370
Of course I know.

69
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,800
Although you're not as clever as Gong Sun He,

70
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,880
I know that

71
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,500
your forensic skills are excellent.

72
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,980
Are you interested

73
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,400
in joining us?

74
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,050
You want me, a forensic expert,

75
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,680
to join your criminal gang?

76
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,080
You must be dreaming.

77
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,680
Let me ask you,

78
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,200
aren't Zheng Sheng and Lin Li

79
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,200
breaking the law by conspiring to harm Zhao Ping'an?

80
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,960
Zhou Xiaokang's violent debt collection from Zhao Ping'an,

81
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,440
making him and his family live in fear every day,

82
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,960
isn't that a crime?

83
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,440
When the victims really need you,

84
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,720
where are you?

85
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,920
Zhao Ping'an didn't report it to the police. If he had,

86
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,120
Even if he had reported it,

87
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,250
the matter would have been dismissed.

88
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,360
Because Zhao Ping'an

89
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,760
is just a nobody.

90
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,050
Your police station wouldn't risk offending

91
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,340
a business tycoon like Zheng Sheng for a nobody.

92
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,280
You really underestimate our police station.

93
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,280
We don't fear the rich and powerful.

94
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,520
If you're just talking about yourself, I believe you.

95
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,650
But your police station...

96
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,640
Alright,

97
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,180
I won't waste any more words with you.

98
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,090
If you want to save them,

99
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,320
it's impossible.

100
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,220
They have bombs strapped to them.

101
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,240
If you don't want me to blow up the entire mall,

102
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,240
I suggest you evacuate everyone immediately.

103
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:35,720
Also,

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,680
give Gong Sun He a message.

105
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,560
Tell him to come up alone.

106
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,440
I'll be waiting for him here.

107
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,600
Let's go.

108
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,680
Get out of here quickly.

109
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,140
There's danger upstairs.

110
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
Everyone, leave this place.

111
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,640
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

112
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,840
You've finally arrived.

113
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,760
Zheng Sheng is upstairs, and there's a bomb up there too.

114
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,800
Quickly arrange for people to evacuate the crowd.

115
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,200
Alright.

116
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,080
Evacuate the crowd immediately.

117
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,200
Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry!

118
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,520
What's the situation here?

119
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,450
A man and a woman.

120
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,600
The man is definitely Zheng Sheng.

121
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,160
We don't know the situation with the woman.

122
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,440
And there are kidnappers too.

123
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,080
What?

124
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,880
The Tailor is here too?

125
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,560
Yes.

126
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,410
What exactly does he want to do?

127
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,300
We were held at gunpoint as soon as we went in.

128
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,000
And the two hostages both have bombs strapped to them.

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,280
The kidnapper specifically asked to see you.

130
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,340
It looks like he wants to recruit you.

131
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,520
This madman.

132
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,380
Then I'll go up and take a look.

133
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:36,680
Hey.

134
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,240
He said...

135
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,330
Only Gong Sun He can go up alone.

136
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,490
if they find anyone else upstairs,

137
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,760
he'll detonate the bombs immediately.

138
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,409
Don't worry.

139
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
They're after me.

140
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,060
I'll definitely bring them back.

141
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,560
You must be careful.

142
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,840
Gong Sun He,

143
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,490
come back safely, okay?

144
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,040
Inspector.

145
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,760
Please save me.

146
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,440
Shut up.

147
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,770
I'll blow your head off if you speak again.

148
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,760
Tailor.

149
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,280
You again.

150
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,440
What exactly do you want?

151
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,080
I need you

152
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,720
to make a choice.

153
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,240
I'm the one you're looking for.

154
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,200
Let them go.

155
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,640
Impossible.

156
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,620
The man is Zheng Sheng.

157
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,920
The woman is his wife.

158
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,000
They're strapped with a special bomb I made.

159
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,280
If one of them dies,

160
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,740
the bomb will be deactivated.

161
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,200
If they're both alive after ten minutes,

162
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,500
the bomb will explode.

163
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,600
If you cut the wrong wire, the bomb will also explode.

164
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,800
If you were to choose,

165
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,880
which one would you let live?

166
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,370
What do you mean?

167
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,440
It's simple.

168
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,200
You just need to kill one of them,

169
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,210
and the other will be saved.

170
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,520
Now,

171
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,160
the choice is yours.

172
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,380
Let's see what you'll do next.

173
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,840
Until we meet again.

174
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,080
Oh, right.

175
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,770
I forgot to tell you.

176
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,480
If I die,

177
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,160
my partners will detonate the other bombs.

178
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,120
When that happens, the death toll

179
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,050
won't be limited to just those two.

180
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,280
Why haven't they shown up yet?

181
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,240
Th-th-this...

182
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,280
What's going on here?

183
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,920
We can't just sit here waiting.

184
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,960
The tailor has finally shown up.

185
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,040
If we don't catch him this time,

186
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,970
we might never get another chance.

187
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,160
Hey, you guys go block the back door.

188
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,720
Zheng Sheng, you won't die a good death!

189
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,680
You've done bad things and now you're dragging me into it.

190
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,360
Inspector, I can't die.

191
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,160
I have children to take care of.

192
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,730
You can go ahead and die.

193
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,200
I'll raise the children.

194
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,970
Inspector Gong Sun,

195
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,570
you know who I am, don't you?

196
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,840
I'm the owner of Shengfeng Money House.

197
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,520
I'm rich.

198
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,400
I have lots and lots of money.

199
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,520
if you can save me,

200
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,980
I can give you 100,000.

201
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,080
No, no, no. I'll give you a million silver dollars.

202
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,840
Shut up.

203
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,720
You even killed your wife just to save your own skin.

204
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,360
Can you even be considered human?

205
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,480
You're right. He's not human.

206
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,800
Zheng Sheng, this is your retribution.

207
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,400
Detective, Detective, save me!

208
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,240
I can't.

209
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,920
Only five minutes left.

210
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,920
I can't disarm it.
