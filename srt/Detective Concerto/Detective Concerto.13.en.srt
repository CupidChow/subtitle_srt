1
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,520
How is it?

2
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,039
Feels pretty good, right?

3
00:01:22,039 --> 00:01:22,800
Indeed.

4
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,650
I'm even thinking about getting a bathtub like this for my home.

5
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,440
I'm going to take a bath then.

6
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,400
Who's there?

7
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,160
A Tai.

8
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,200
What's wrong?

9
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,400
You weren't mistaken earlier.

10
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,930
I also saw someone just now.

11
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,720
A person wearing sunglasses and covering their face.

12
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,920
standing at the door, looking this way.

13
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
This bucket.

14
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,440
Why is it up there?

15
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,759
Something must be tied to the rope and dropped into the well.

16
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,160
Only then will it rise up.

17
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:10,720
Quick!

18
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,770
Let's pull it up.

19
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,130
Second Aunt.

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,010
How could it be Second Aunt?

21
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,560
This ancient well has already been fenced off.

22
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,890
It's impossible to accidentally fall in.

23
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Could it be that...

24
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,360
she jumped in herself?

25
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,440
That's not it.

26
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,540
There's a stab wound on her chest.

27
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,280
I think the real cause of her death

28
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
is the stab wound.

29
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,640
Stab wound?

30
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,040
It couldn't be one of us, could it?

31
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,120
How is that possible?

32
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,650
Brother,

33
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,890
what are you saying?

34
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,920
If I remember correctly,

35
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,840
at 9 o'clock last night,

36
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,079
your Second Aunt was supposed to call, right?

37
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,880
That's right.

38
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,200
It should have been from the Pingkang Hotel.

39
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,760
I went to take a shower around 10 o'clock.

40
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,400
Did anyone leave during this time?

41
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,200
No,

42
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,640
no one left.

43
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,480
We were all drinking tea and chatting.

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,280
Pingkang Hotel?

45
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,360
Is that the hotel we passed on the way?

46
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,840
That's right.

47
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,560
If that's the case,

48
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,170
then except for you,

49
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,840
none of us are suspects.

50
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,200
Because coming from there,

51
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,640
even by car, it would take at least an hour.

52
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,200
Are you suspecting me now?

53
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,280
How could that be possible?

54
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,560
We're meeting Miss Qingtian for the first time.

55
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,960
How could we suspect you?

56
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,640
Exactly.

57
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,960
Besides, I invited you here.

58
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,520
Your arrival was random.

59
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,820
It couldn't be you.

60
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,770
Then who on earth is the killer?

61
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,200
Do you even need to ask?

62
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,120
Brother, didn't you just see?

63
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,400
The masked man.

64
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,720
Could it be...

65
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,760
Uncle?

66
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,040
Gong Sunhe.

67
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,610
Why are we getting the case from Yuncheng?

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,130
Because I trust you.

69
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,600
if we leave it to them,

70
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,770
I won't feel at ease.

71
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,320
Is the deceased your mother, Ms. Xu Yazhi?

72
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,200
Yes.

73
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,520
Chief,

74
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,960
the victim died from a wound to the chest,

75
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
resulting in death from blood loss.

76
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,080
Did you discover the body around 10 PM?

77
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,360
Yes.

78
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,520
Master,

79
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,520
we've searched the surrounding area

80
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,580
but haven't found the murder weapon.

81
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,240
That's strange.

82
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,920
Where could the weapon be?

83
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,040
Regardless of where the weapon is,

84
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,440
according to Gong Sunhe,

85
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,520
the killer

86
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,760
must be among you.

87
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,880
Wait a minute.

88
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,840
Before dinner,

89
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,960
Second Mother went to Pingkang Restaurant for dinner.

90
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,640
And at 9 o'clock,

91
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,520
she called home.

92
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,140
My wife answered the call.

93
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,040
If

94
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,280
she drove back after the call,

95
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,440
she couldn't have arrived before 10 PM.

96
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:18,840
Moreover,

97
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
before 10 PM,

98
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,080
we were all together.

99
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,960
It's impossible for any of us to have committed the murder.

100
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,120
Around 10 PM, I was the only one who went to take a shower alone.

101
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,640
But you should remember clearly,

102
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,280
today was the first time I met Ms. Xu Yazhi.

103
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,680
Is that so?

104
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,850
What do you mean?

105
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,450
A-Tai and I are childhood friends.

106
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,680
As for Miss Qingtian,

107
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,520
it's the first time I've brought her here.

108
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,280
She has no connection to this family at all.

109
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,680
I was just asking casually.

110
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,840
Why are you so nervous?

111
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:47,520
Fu Mosi,

112
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,840
expand the search area.

113
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,640
Keep looking.

114
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,490
Yes, Master.

115
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,210
Oh, right, sister-in-law,

116
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,040
are you sure that the phone call at 9 o'clock

117
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,570
was from Aunt Xu?

118
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,360
It should be.

119
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,640
There was a lot of background noise on the call.

120
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,480
At first, I couldn't hear clearly what she was saying.

121
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,120
Later, she said she'd be back after 11 PM.

122
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,200
Then she hung up.

123
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,540
Before we discovered Second Mother's body,

124
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,810
I saw a tall man wearing glasses

125
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,400
covering his face at the back door,

126
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,760
peeking at us through the crack.

127
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:27,520
I think

128
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,240
he must be the killer.

129
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,360
What?

130
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,520
A man was spying on you?

131
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,640
That's right.

132
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,560
And this person is likely

133
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,200
our deceased mother's brother,

134
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,520
which means he's our uncle.

135
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,180
Years ago, our mother slipped

136
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,040
and fell into this well, drowning.

137
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,770
Our uncle has always suspected

138
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,200
that one of us killed our mother.

139
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
That's not right.

140
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,520
Ms. Xu Yazhi once said

141
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,840
that your mother had passed away

142
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,080
before Second Mother came to this family.

143
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,080
He doesn't have a motive to kill her.

144
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,360
I don't know about that.

145
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,960
I suggest

146
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,620
we start by investigating the car the deceased drove back.

147
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,580
There might be some clues.

148
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:06,930
Okay.

149
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,680
Where is that car?

150
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,280
What?

151
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,400
Isn't the car in the front yard?

152
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,130
No, it's not.

153
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,170
I didn't see the car when I arrived.

154
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,140
The car is indeed not here.

155
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,720
It's really strange.

156
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,480
Usually when we drive the car back,

157
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,740
we always park it here.

158
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,400
Then how did Second Mom get back if the car isn't here?

159
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,659
Could someone have given her a ride back?

160
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,690
Master, Master,

161
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,680
there's a major discovery.

162
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,610
What discovery?

163
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,520
Just now, the police were searching in the small woods

164
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,960
and found a car.

165
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,610
Song Si is also at the scene.

166
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,280
The car...

167
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,640
It couldn't be...

168
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,640
Hey, don't, don't, don't!

169
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,040
Don't touch it, don't touch it!

170
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,760
just look.

171
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,840
No mistake, it's our family car.

172
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,520
But Second Mom, why is the car parked here?

173
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,960
Could it be that the killer wanted to drive away?

174
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,280
But worried the car was too conspicuous and abandoned it here?

175
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,520
It's also possible that your Second Mom drove the car here,

176
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,360
and then the car suddenly broke down.

177
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,080
After being discovered by the killer, she was murdered,

178
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,280
and thrown into the old well over there.

179
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:38,720
Strange.

180
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,799
The inside of the car looks fine.

181
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,000
There are no signs of a struggle inside the car,

182
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,530
and no blood stains either.

183
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,480
Which means,

184
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,880
this car is not the primary crime scene.

185
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,320
Wait.

186
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,440
Because the killer hasn't been caught yet.

187
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,240
The mysterious person hasn't been caught either.

188
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,040
For everyone's safety,

189
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,050
no one is allowed to leave tonight.

190
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,160
So we'll all sleep here in the living room.

191
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:13,690
Let's go.

192
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,680
Seriously.

193
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,240
Why do I have to sleep

194
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,920
with the police and bodyguards?

195
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,480
Alright.

196
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,040
After all, it's the second wife who died.

197
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,440
Just bear with it for now.

198
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,720
Gong Sun He,

199
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,960
do you have any suspects in mind?

200
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,680
The mysterious man wearing sunglasses

201
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,880
goes without saying.

202
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,940
There's also the car abandoned in the woods.

203
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,740
But what I find most suspicious is

204
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,160
why the body was tied with a rope and thrown into the dry well.

205
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,040
It's almost as if they wanted us to find the body quickly.

206
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,360
There are quite a few suspicious points now.

207
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,240
There's a high possibility that the killer is the mysterious man.

208
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,160
But maybe...

209
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,210
Wasn't the warehouse door closed, if I remember correctly?

210
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,680
Let's go check it out.

211
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,920
There's nothing here.

212
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,540
I might have remembered it wrong.

213
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,780
Shall we go?

214
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,040
Let's go.
