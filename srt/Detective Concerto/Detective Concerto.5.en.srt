1
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,160
Wait.

2
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,560
What is this?

3
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,530
It looks like it was just drawn.

4
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,080
Plaster.

5
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,770
Detective Gong Sun,

6
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,120
there's a phone call for you at the front desk.

7
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,720
Alright, I'll go right away.

8
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,600
Hello?

9
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,880
Oh, Song Si.

10
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,440
Do you have the autopsy report results?

11
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,800
The deceased died instantly due to a potent poison.

12
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,039
On the tip of his right finger,

13
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,680
we found marks similar to needle pricks.

14
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,400
The poison likely entered the body through the fingertip.

15
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,480
Because it was such a potent poison,

16
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,000
after death,

17
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,690
the victim wouldn't have even struggled.

18
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,280
What about the fingerprints?

19
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,160
Were you able to identify any?

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,360
There are traces from many people on it.

21
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,570
Do you need me to give you all the names?

22
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,680
Tell me about it.

23
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,780
Liu Geng yesterday...

24
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,680
It seems he went out for a while during the drawing.

25
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,840
What did he go out to do?

26
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,040
I remember...

27
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,079
he went to get candles.

28
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,440
Have you all finished drawing?

29
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,840
I'm not the last one, am I?

30
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,090
Yes, it's your turn. Hurry up and draw.

31
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,520
I can't believe I'm the eighth one.

32
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,800
the last one.

33
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,840
I understand now.

34
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,940
I understand everything now.

35
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,680
Why did you bring us to this place?

36
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
You suspect us of being the killers?

37
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,640
But we have alibis.

38
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,680
We don't want to go in anymore.

39
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,480
Let's go back.

40
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,520
I don't want to go in again either.

41
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
Let's go, come on.

42
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,640
Wait, all of you.

43
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,840
Each of you is now a suspect.

44
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,140
Until your suspicion is cleared,

45
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,280
no one can leave.

46
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,200
You are all suspects now.

47
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,170
If you try to leave by force,

48
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,720
the police have the right to arrest you.

49
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,680
Geez.

50
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,960
Why hasn't Gong Sun He come out yet?

51
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,810
Let's wait a bit longer.

52
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,370
I'm sorry to have kept you all waiting.

53
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,839
We can go now.

54
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,019
Where are we going?

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,400
Of course, we're going to

56
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,240
the Rakshasa Bride's compartment.

57
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,000
Why?

58
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm not going.

59
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,760
Don't you want to know

60
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,240
how Liu Geng really died?

61
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,260
And who the real killer is?

62
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,520
Who is it really?

63
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,820
You know who the killer is?

64
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,440
Are you saying that

65
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,320
the killer is among us?

66
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,240
You'll find out when we get there.

67
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,770
Let's go.

68
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,400
You're saying...

69
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,760
You know who the killer is?

70
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,600
Could it be...

71
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,400
The killer is among us?

72
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,000
Before that,

73
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,200
I need to confess two things I've been hiding from you.

74
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,160
Two things you've been hiding?

75
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,160
First,

76
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,200
Fu Mosi didn't actually attend the courage test yesterday.

77
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,520
she only pretended to come.

78
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,640
Oh, Gong Sun He,

79
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,960
you promised to keep it a secret for me.

80
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,890
I have no choice.

81
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,200
This matter is important.

82
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,080
I must tell.

83
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,640
What?

84
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,400
I'm really sorry.

85
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
This doesn't make sense.

86
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,400
Yesterday, you brought back the ping pong ball,

87
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,930
which proves you were here.

88
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,960
Well...

89
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,490
Because I gave it to her.

90
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,000
This is my special ball.

91
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,490
I'm a ping pong enthusiast.

92
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,320
So my balls and rackets

93
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,760
are all custom-made.

94
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,520
Then there's the second thing

95
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,560
that only I know.

96
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,440
That is, after me,

97
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,159
all the ping pong balls here

98
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,480
are my special balls.

99
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,040
I remember the ping pong balls were all taken from the hotel's court, weren't they?

100
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,760
Because at that time,

101
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,680
I accidentally knocked over the ping pong ball container here.

102
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,520
Then,

103
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,840
everything inside spilled into the toilet.

104
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,080
So I replaced all the balls with my own.

105
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,960
All of them?

106
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,120
But yesterday when I opened the door of the compartment,

107
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,240
the balls in the container were still intact.

108
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,880
Those were of course my special balls.

109
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,640
How could I possibly fish out the ones from the toilet

110
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,770
and put them back in?

111
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,040
However,

112
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,360
my ping pong balls are all custom-made.

113
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,640
Look,

114
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,850
isn't there a special symbol here?

115
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,160
It's true.

116
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,320
So small,

117
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,280
if you don't look carefully, you might think it's just dust.

118
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,400
But after that,

119
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,360
something very incredible happened.

120
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,640
That is, Liu Geng, the last one to come here,

121
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,970
the ping pong ball on him

122
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,850
wasn't my special ball.

123
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,920
According to Song Si's fingerprint comparison,

124
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,600
that ball

125
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,640
was covered with everyone's fingerprints.

126
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,400
Even

127
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,120
Miss Mo Si's fingerprints, who didn't attend, were on it.

128
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,600
This, this...

129
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,480
What does this mean?

130
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,160
I don't understand.

131
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,280
In other words,

132
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,000
the ping pong ball found on him

133
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,320
was planted by the killer

134
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,440
to confuse everyone's perception.

135
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,560
I see.

136
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,400
No wonder this morning at the police station,

137
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,260
you remained silent when you saw the ping pong ball.

138
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,040
Then I think the ping pong ball on Liu Geng

139
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,600
must be one that was used

140
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,320
in our hotel.

141
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,360
That's right.

142
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
If even Miss Fu Mo Si used it,

143
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,120
it could only have been at that time.

144
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,560
If that's the case, then we can know

145
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,560
the killer is among us.

146
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,570
This can't be possible.

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,120
The killer is one of us?

148
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,080
One of us

149
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,000
killed Liu Geng.

150
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,440
Who the hell is that guy?

151
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,560
It's the ping pong ball from the deceased Liu Geng.

152
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,200
It told me who the murderer really is.

153
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,880
Because my fingerprints are also on that ball.

154
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,240
But even if your fingerprints are on it,

155
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,900
what's so strange about that?

156
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,360
Don't forget,

157
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,440
back then, all of us were in the hotel

158
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,840
playing ping pong.

159
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,080
Only Gong Sun He wasn't with us

160
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,840
because he had diarrhea.

161
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,620
Gentlemen, thank you for your patience.

162
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,640
Now,

163
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,720
let me show you

164
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,440
the skills of the best player in Decheng.

165
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,280
Therefore,

166
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,640
the person who put the ping pong ball back in its place

167
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,080
is the murderer.

168
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,440
The one who set up the hospital death mystery

169
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,320
and pushed all the blame onto the Rakshasa Bride

170
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,440
is you,

171
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,640
Zhou Yansheng.

172
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,120
Me?
