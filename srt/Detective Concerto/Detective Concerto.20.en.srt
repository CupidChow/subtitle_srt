1
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,480
How's it going?

2
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,680
Do you have any leads?

3
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,360
The real boss behind Lin Li's company

4
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,440
is Zheng Sheng, the owner of Shengfeng Money House.

5
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,920
Shengfeng Money House?

6
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,520
Well,

7
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,080
why does that sound so familiar?

8
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,920
Because Zhao Ping'an robbed the gold bars from Shengfeng Money House.

9
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,720
Wait a minute.

10
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,160
I'm having trouble processing this.

11
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:38,080
The boss behind Lin Li

12
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,280
is the owner of Shengfeng Money House,

13
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,800
and this Shengfeng Money House

14
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,479
hired Zhao Ping'an to transport their gold?

15
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,360
That's right.

16
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,880
That's the relationship between them.

17
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,280
Old Di, what do you think?

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,960
It sounds like a trap to me.

19
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,640
I think so too.

20
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,479
This is indeed a trap,

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,130
a trap set for Zhao Ping'an.

22
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,080
But why?

23
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,640
Could it be that

24
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,800
this Zheng Sheng and Zhao Ping'an

25
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,080
have some kind of grudge?

26
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,860
That's still unknown.

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,600
Let's have Fu Mosi's team investigate further.

28
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,440
They already have some leads on their end.

29
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,370
It's just that we don't have any clues on our side yet.

30
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,970
I do have an idea though.

31
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,800
I want to go check out the oil field.

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,329
What made you think of that?

33
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,680
I feel like I was overthinking it before.

34
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,079
Now that I know about their relationship,

35
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,880
I think Lin Li is like that rat,

36
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,610
suffering the consequences of his own greed.

37
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,680
How about I wake up Old Wang

38
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,880
and we go check out the nearby refinery?

39
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,410
Alright.

40
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
I'll go right now.

41
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,800
Oh, this Lin Li.

42
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,170
he once contracted a refinery before.

43
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,800
And the person in charge there was Zheng Sheng.

44
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,080
Wait.

45
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,040
Refinery?

46
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,080
Do you remember

47
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,320
the content on Lin Li's death notice?

48
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,080
I do.

49
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,780
It was a nursery rhyme.

50
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,880
It was about a mouse that ate too much

51
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,080
and accidentally fell into an oil tank.

52
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,320
Do you think it's possible

53
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,520
that Lin Li was at this refinery?

54
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,680
Yes, it's very possible.

55
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,010
Quick, call Gong Sun He.

56
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,600
Alright, I understand.

57
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,060
We'll go there right away.

58
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,380
Let's split up.

59
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,040
Ms. Su,

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,960
we need to take these items back with us.

61
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,040
After the case is closed,

62
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,970
we'll notify you to retrieve them.

63
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,400
Officer,

64
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,840
when will our Lao Lin be able to come back?

65
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,840
We don't know that either.

66
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,440
Our colleagues are actively working on the rescue.

67
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,480
So you mean...

68
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,480
have you found our Lao Lin?

69
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,440
Do you know where he is?

70
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,520
Based on the clues from the notification

71
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,400
and a construction contract we found,

72
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,160
Lin Li should be held in an oil refinery.

73
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,560
However, we don't know if he's been found yet.

74
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,020
We'll notify you immediately if we find him.

75
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,520
What?

76
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,120
Kidnapped to an oil refinery?

77
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,960
It's karma!

78
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,560
It really is karma!

79
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,000
Karma!

80
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,280
What do you mean?

81
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,520
The owner of that oil refinery

82
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,720
had already

83
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,320
self-immolated many years ago.

84
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,760
Alright, we understand the situation.

85
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,960
We'll be leaving now.

86
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,840
Report: Not found.

87
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,280
Report: Nothing here.

88
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,820
Report: Nothing here either.

89
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,580
It's not that big here. How can it not be here?

90
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,880
Could I have been mistaken?

91
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,560
Lin Li.

92
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,890
He's not here at all.

93
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
That's impossible.

94
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,840
That nursery rhyme was referring to the oil refinery.

95
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,100
It shouldn't be wrong.

96
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,120
It's almost six o'clock. It's getting light soon.

97
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,980
Sunrise is around seven o'clock.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,659
We still have an hour. Why don't we keep looking?

99
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,120
Then search thoroughly.

100
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,650
Try to search every corner.

101
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,610
Let's go too.

102
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,440
Nothing to report.

103
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,500
nothing to report,

104
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,560
nothing to report.

105
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,120
It seems we're really going in the wrong direction.

106
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,440
We've searched everywhere, front and back, left and right.

107
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,120
Still, we haven't found Lin Li.

108
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,080
This refinery...

109
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,320
doesn't seem to have any hidden mechanisms or secret doors.

110
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,360
Lin Li is a grown man.

111
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,840
If he were here, we couldn't possibly miss him.

112
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,720
Are there any other refineries nearby?

113
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,720
There's another one to the north, but it's quite far.

114
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,120
About a 40-minute drive.

115
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,800
He should be here.

116
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,340
But we've turned this place upside down.

117
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,120
We haven't found him anywhere.

118
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,000
Could it be...

119
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,420
that we really guessed wrong?

120
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,650
That's impossible.

121
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,120
This tailor always acts with cause and effect in mind.

122
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,080
This is the first refinery they built.

123
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,400
Lin Li must be here.

124
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,980
He must be here.

125
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,540
But where exactly?

126
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,040
Where could he be?

127
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,320
We've searched everywhere here.

128
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,880
We've already searched within a two-kilometer radius.

129
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,740
still nothing.

130
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,980
Should we go look somewhere else?

131
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,720
Let's go.

132
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,720
Have you searched that room upstairs?

133
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
I think so.

134
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,080
But it's just an attic.

135
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,540
nothing special about it.

136
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,400
Gongsun He.

137
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,280
Gongsun He.

138
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,060
What have you discovered?

139
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,280
Rats usually move around at night.

140
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,530
As soon as it's dawn,

141
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,760
they hide in their dark nests.

142
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,280
Chief.

143
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,340
We've found Lin Li.

144
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,410
He's right here.

145
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,380
Be careful.

146
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,080
This is Lin Li.

147
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:20,640
That's right.

148
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,480
This time we finally managed to

149
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,600
save the person before the Tailor could kill them.

150
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,400
I think

151
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,000
the Tailor's game of punishing evil

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,800
should come to an end now, right?

153
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,090
I don't think so.

154
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,130
Based on their modus operandi,

155
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,400
Zheng Sheng is likely still in their hands.

156
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,160
Zheng Sheng.

157
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,180
Lin Li, I'm from the Decheng Police Station.

158
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,370
You're safe now.

159
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,780
Did you see the person who kidnapped you?

160
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,200
Come on, tell us, who was it?

161
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,920
Did you encounter the person who kidnapped you?

162
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,160
who was it?

163
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

164
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,860
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

165
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,400
I was wrong, I'm a beast.

166
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,040
I'm a beast.

167
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,160
Please, please spare me.

168
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,280
Where is Zheng Sheng?

169
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,160
Quickly, where is Zheng Sheng?

170
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,040
Zheng Sheng.

171
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,450
Zheng Sheng.

172
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
What's going on?

173
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,080
Death notice.
