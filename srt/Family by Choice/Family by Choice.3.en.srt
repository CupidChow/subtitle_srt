00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,450
Just a tiny bit.

182
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,500
Be more careful.

183
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:37,580
So, Sanha doesn't know you got a love letter?

184
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,620
I didn't show it to him.

185
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,870
It's obvious he's going to nag about it.

186
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:47,270
But my daughter, Sanha isn't exactly wrong if you think about it.

187
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:51,950
I'm not exactly impressed that there's one person behind you, either.

188
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,130
- There are two people.
- You said one of them is an athlete.

189
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,090
You said I'm a good daughter as long as I don't drink, smoke, or gamble.

190
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:04,900
Well, yes. That's true, but...

191
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:09,610
Dad, don't you think I reached a level of mastery in doing the dishes?

192
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,150
Once I graduate, should I do the dishes at your store?

193
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,760
Huh? Why? You're not going to college?

194
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,610
What use is college with my grades?

195
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:19,340
I'm not interested in learning anything, either.

196
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,290
What do you think? My help will make things easier for you, too.

197
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,150
You said you mastered washing dishes.

198
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,700
It's no fun if you keep doing something you've mastered.

199
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,670
You just don't know it yet,

200
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:41,480
but there are tons of things that are more fun than washing dishes.

201
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,300
What good is fun if I'm not good at it?

202
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,070
Don't you remember? I cooked chicken soup in the summer,

203
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,460
but Kim Sanha didn't eat it, saying it might give him a stomachache

204
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,740
and Kang Haejun said it tasted funny.

205
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:57,550
Is it so hard to eat something your younger sister made and act like it was delicious?

206
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,720
But there are many other fun things, too.

207
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,700
Not gambling, drinking, or smoking is...

208
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,040
How should I put this? A form of passive filial piety.

209
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,850
A form of passive filial piety.

210
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:10,000
But finding something you love to do and enjoying life

211
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,830
is active filial piety.

212
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,620
Really? Enjoying my life is fulfilling filial piety?

213
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,330
Of course! And being healthy. That's the best.

214
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,260
Then, why did you give them gorosoe* and not me?
(Mineral water good for health)

215
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,570
I only had this much. Only two bottles.

216
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,480
They're in 12th grade.

217
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,820
I didn't drink any.

218
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,660
And I didn't give Ahjussi. He has no idea.

219
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,790
- Really?
- Of course!

220
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,370
Is Sanha studying at home?

221
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,240
He said not to disturb him because he's watching a lecture.

222
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,540
Then, ask Haejun what he wants for dinner.

223
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,070
I'll go home and make dinner after I sterilize these dishcloths.

224
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,870
I'm the one who did the dishes.

225
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,010
Why are you making what Kang Haejun wants for dinner?

226
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,710
Three fried eggs... Special.

227
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,270
He'll probably say he wants crab soybean paste stew.

228
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,450
Is he still at practice?

229
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,500
I'm...

230
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,200
your father.

231
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,010
I'm your dad!

232
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,830
If only she had told me she was carrying you,

233
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,870
you and I wouldn't have been separated.

234
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:48,460
Nor would we have had to reunite after 19 years!

235
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,670
[You have a new message]

236
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,730
[Global Biz Partner, CEO Yang Donggoo]

237
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,420
[Mr. Yoon's Kalguksu]

238
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,650
Done with practice?

239
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,220
Why aren't you going home?

240
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,640
No reason.

241
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,460
It's okay. You'll dirty your hands.

242
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,350
What?

243
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,930
- Actually, today-
- Aigoo! So particular.

244
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:34,550
What use will he be if you raise him without even letting him touch the garbage?

245
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:36,370
I'll be right out after hanging the dishcloths.

246
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,770
Okay.

247
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,690
Now that I look at you, you resemble him.

248
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,620
How could that be when we're not blood-related?

249
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,530
Even married couples start resembling each other after living together for a long time.

250
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,770
You and Mr. Yoon lived together for ten years now.

251
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,170
Aigoo, now that it ended up like this,

252
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:14,110
I wonder if I made too much of a fuss, telling him to send you back.

253
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:20,750
Good for you for at least realizing that now.

254
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,480
Look at you talk!

255
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,280
You just need to say "all right" when an adult says something!

256
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,430
All right!

257
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,220
- I said, all right!
- Madam!

258
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:35,650
It doesn't hurt at all.

259
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,130
You're going to trip!

260
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,410
Slow down!

261
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,380
Anyway, what about today?

262
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:54,740
- What?
- You were about to say something earlier.

263
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,630
Did something happen?

264
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:01,430
Juwon said you didn't even answer her when she asked you what you wanted for dinner.

265
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,390
Just that today's practice was a bit rough.

266
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,670
All right. How anticlimactic.

267
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,290
I forgot the fried eggs.

268
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,360
- Three for me!
- How could I forget?

269
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,180
- Be quiet.
- I didn't say anything.

270
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,560
- You spoke with your eyes.
- What did I say?

271
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,130
"You have the gall to ask for three eggs with those grades?"

272
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,680
You can read minds now?

273
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,540
Nothing new.

274
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:39,700
She can just do better on her next exam after eating three eggs.

275
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,690
Why aren't you saying anything?

276
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,670
- What?
- An opportunity presented itself.

277
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:50,330
Aren't you just itching?

278
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,830
My grades aren't anything to brag about, either.

279
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,410
That's true.

280
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,410
Spill it.

281
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,540
What?

282
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,040
Spill what?

283
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,870
I don't know.

284
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:37,010
How would I know unless you tell me?

285
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:47,150
Things will escalate if I call Juwon.

286
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,800
Didn't he pass away?

287
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,830
Mom never said that.

288
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,570
It was just...

289
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,950
How should I put this?

290
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,950
He was happy to see me, his son.

291
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,730
And I think I was a bit glad, too.

292
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,440
But if I'm too glad,

293
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,440
I'd feel kind of bad for Dad.

294
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,750
I've been calling him "Dad" for so many years.

295
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:29,120
To tell him, "I actually had a real dad" at this point...

296
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,680
Would you be able to do that?

297
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,120
One thing gives me peace of mind, though.

298
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,550
You know how Mom cut off contact with me not long after I came here?

299
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,690
I didn't let it show,

300
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,960
but I thought hard about what I did so wrong for her to

301
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,750
abandon me like that.

302
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:04,840
Mom! Mom!

303
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,050
- Mom!
- Gosh.

304
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:10,290
But he said he never knew I was even born.

305
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:13,370
At least he didn't abandon me out of hate.

306
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,200
That's a bit...

307
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,740
reassuring..

308
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,850
or comforting, I guess.

309
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,280
That's true.

310
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,940
Wait, no! I-I wasn't talking about you!

311
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,770
I wasn't implying your mom left you because she hated you.

312
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,750
Stop overreacting.

313
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,730
You're making it seem true.

314
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,540
I really didn't mean it like that.

315
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,680
Are you sure he's your real dad?

316
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,310
Didn't he ask for a DNA test or something?

317
00:22:54,310 --> 00:22:56,480
Come on. What good is that?

318
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,500
I resemble him so much that you'd go, "Whoa, that's Haejun's dad,"

319
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,260
if you saw him.

320
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,970
Our monolids are the same.

321
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:06,680
- Monolids?
- Yeah.

322
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:10,660
He said monolids with large eyes

323
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:13,690
are the Namwon Yang family's signature.

324
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:14,940
I never knew that.

325
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,400
How could you be so certain with just monolids?

326
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,300
Hey, I'm certain!

327
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,680
Why would he lie about that?

328
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,820
Did he look healthy?

329
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:30,180
Healthy?

330
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:35,750
Maybe he might need suitable organs...

331
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,600
Are you crazy?

332
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,690
What did your aunt say?

333
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,280
As if I had the time to tell her.

334
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,220
Aunt doesn't know anything, anyway.

335
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,120
You sure she didn't hear a single thing?

336
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,930
From her sister?

337
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:58,080
Why are you so suspicious about everything?

338
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,390
Let's go inside.

339
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,740
He's over 180 cm tall.

340
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,660
So what, unless he plays basketball?

341
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,920
He's a Math Olympiad alum.

342
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,980
No way. We're way too different.

343
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,810
Him! Doesn't he come by our class often these days?

344
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:39,090
He's going out with Jaein.

345
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,410
I didn't see you there. Sorry.

346
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,640
You always drink strawberry milk.

347
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,950
How did he know I only...

348
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,660
drink strawberry milk?

349
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,650
What class is he in?

350
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,220
Class 4.

351
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,750
Should I ask him?

352
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,000
Can you do it?

353
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,310
Why not?

354
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:03,020
Gosh, strawberry milk is always sold out.

355
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,650

He's usually not this messy.

537
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:49,610
He's neat in his own way.

538
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,880
He probably left in a hurry.

539
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,250
It's probably not a big deal, right?

540
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,340
Big deal? About what?

541
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:01,680
[Heaven Hotel]

542
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,620
Whoa...

543
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,490
Don't places like this cost several hundred won a night?

544
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:10,640
Is this the right place?

545
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,970
It is.

546
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:14,470
He told me to meet him at the Heaven Hotel lounge.

547
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,770
Don't let this intimidate you.

548
00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:24,870
If you're going to take a swing at him, I'll cover you.

549
00:39:24,870 --> 00:39:26,770
What are you saying?

550
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,190
I'm going to ask him nicely.

551
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,420
Is it my organs?

552
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:42,620
What? What about your organs?

553
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,400
Geez, I'm healthy!

554
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,310
I take herbal tonics all four seasons

555
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,480
and don't even touch processed foods.

556
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,860
You don't believe me? Do I have to show you my medical records?

557
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,970
The doctor said my physical age is in the thirties.

558
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:02,070
That's not an easy feat, even if you're rich.

559
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,750
Then, why did you come looking for me?

560
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,690
Obviously, because you're my son.

561
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,640
You're my blood.

562
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,670
But you disregarded me 19 years ago.

563
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,710
I heard you cut Mom off when she was due to give birth.

564
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,530
Says who?

565
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:32,850
Seohyeon's not the type to say that kind of thing.

566
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,610
- Aunt.
- Aunt-

567
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:39,310
Oh, her? Geez...

568
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:41,810
Is that why you brought your friend along to argue?

569
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,600
To fight two against one?

570
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,790
You've grown up more petty than I thought.

571
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,600
I think it's more petty for an adult to call minors petty for "fighting two against one."

572
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,880
If it's not for organs, then fine.

573
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,930
Please don't contact me again.

574
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,470
You already cut off our ties back then.

575
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,730
I came here to tell you that.

576
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,680
Wait! As you can clearly see...

577
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,290
Sit down.

578
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,150
Well,

579
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,910
I have some money and property.

580
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,800
I have everything.

581
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,520
But I don't have a child.

582
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,660
So?

583
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,340
So?

584
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,740
Oh, so...

585
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,620
My wife's family is... How should I say this?

586
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,390
They want your money?

587
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:44,440
They used to only joke about it before.

588
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,050
But nowadays, they're more blatant about it.

589
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:51,860
They're dividing my property amongst themselves.

590
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,280
Isn't that ridiculous? Huh?

591
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:58,200
Coveting my assets while I'm still alive just because I don't have an heir?

592
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,520
If you're looking for an heir,

593
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:03,300
there's a better method called adoption.

594
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,300
This isn't a bad deal for you, either.

595
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,370
You can do anything you want if you come with me to America.

596
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:13,210
- America?
- Yes, America!

597
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:15,730
You know, don't you? America is known for basketball.

598
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,700
NBA! Michael Jordan!

599
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:23,040
What are you saying?

600
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,410
Basketball is fun in Korea, too.

601
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:30,220
What?

602
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,920
Are we beggars?

603
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,250
Hey.

604
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,510
That...

605
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,430
Damn it! Seriously!

606
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:56,240
Stop that. Sand is flying everywhere.

607
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,670
He's the worst!

608
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,540
He's worse than I expected!

609
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:01,710
I'd rather he asked for my organs!

610
00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:03,510
- You'd give them to him?
- Why would I?

611
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,030
They're my precious organs!

612
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,820
Seriously!

613
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,560
How long will you keep this up? People are staring.

614
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:16,750
Let's say your mom had her reasons.

615
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,680
Why did your aunt stay quiet and create this situation?

616
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,990
Aunt probably kept quiet for my sake.

617
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:27,770
There are things better left unknown in this world.

618
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:31,090
You should know about it since it concerns you.

619
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,800
Anyway, she had good intentions-

620
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:37,890
How can you be so sure good intentions would lead to a good result?

621
00:43:37,890 --> 00:43:42,640
Your aunt believed you wouldn't be able to handle the truth.

622
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,650
You're not entirely wrong.

623
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,520
Don't tell Dad and Juwon about this.

624
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,660
How much of it?

625
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,780
The fact that your birth dad appeared or that he's rich?

626
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,150
Everything.

627
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:00,400
Why should we?

628
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,910
They don't have to know.

629
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:04,140
Didn't you hear a thing I said?

630
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,950
- Okay?
- I don't know.

631
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,950
Don't tell them.

632
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,650
Okay? Okay?

633
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,490
Don't tell them!

634
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:14,630
- Thanks for the food.
- Sure! Thank you. Take care!

635
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,780
Kalguksu.

636
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,760
Is that what you're here for?

637
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,810
Oh, yes. Come in!

638
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,870
Have I met you before?

639
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,290
Oh, I haven't, right?

640
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:10,850
I thought you were staring at me because we're acquainted.

641
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:13,610
We're more than just acquaintances.

642
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:20,900
Since you raised my son for ten years.

643
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,920
Son?

644
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,240
I'm...

645
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:31,580
Haejun's dad.

646
00:45:44,430 --> 00:45:46,770
Oh, hold on.

647
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,060
I prepared a lot more than expected.

648
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,340
Whose expectations do you mean?

649
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,770
Gosh.

650
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:26,310
This is something I'll never be able to comprehend.

651
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,210
Raising someone else's kid.

652
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:31,950
That's not as easy as you'd think...

653
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,570
Right?

654
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,430
I never thought of him as someone else's child.

655
00:46:41,530 --> 00:46:45,140
I prepared exactly double the amount my attorney came up with.

656
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:47,730
I was going to convince him by talking to him,

657
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:51,200
but I can't get through to the kid.

658
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,580
He's making me go this far. Honestly.

659
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,730
You met Haejun?

660
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:00,680
Yes, I did.

661
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,460
He'll be a legal adult next year,

662
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:05,940
so I thought it would be quicker to talk to him directly.

663
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,690
I want to leave the country by the end of this year at the latest.

664
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:11,920
But I need to change his last name and make him a passport.

665
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,560
These things take several months.

666
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,350
Wait a minute.

667
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:20,280
We just met.

668
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,950
What's this about leaving the country and changing his name?

669
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:25,650
He's using his mom's surname right now.

670
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,670
He should use his dad's surname now that we've met.

671
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:31,530
And his passport should show my surname,

672
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:34,710
so we can get an immigration visa together, right?

673
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:36,770
Immigration...

674
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:38,560
Immigration?

675
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,470
You're planning to emigrate together with Haejun?

676
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:46,540
Yes.

677
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,090
What did Haejun say?

678
00:47:49,090 --> 00:47:52,120
A minor's affairs are the guardian's responsibility.

679
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:57,300
Even so, he's in 12th grade, which is an important period.

680
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,410
He has his own opinion. You can't just suddenly-

681
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:01,410
Geez.

682
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:04,190
I said I put more than enough in there for you.

683
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:07,340
You're quite greedy.

684
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:12,630
All right, fine. I'll consider adding a bit more compensation.

685
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:15,450
What do you mean by compensation?

686
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:19,650
W-Wait, that's not what I meant.

687
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:25,290
Yes.

688
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:32,410
A minor's affairs are the guardian's responsibility.

689
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,270
I'm his guardian right now.

690
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:51,150
So this is how you're going to be?

691
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:53,670
Yes, well, for now.

692
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:57,160
Seriously! Are you kidding me?

693
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:05,330
Isn't it preparation hours right now?

694
00:49:05,330 --> 00:49:08,540
I'm in the middle of a conversation with a customer right now.

695
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,110
Come back in a bit.

696
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,100
I'm sorry, Dal.

697
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,920
Hello.

698
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:17,110
Let's go.

699
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:18,500
Okay.

700
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,310
Wasn't the atmosphere weird?

701
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:31,760
Yeah. You've never seen that ahjussi before?

702
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,240
Yeah.

703
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:38,430
Oppa!

704
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:40,660
Hey.

705
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,940
Dal, you're visiting, huh?

706
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,930
Hello.

707
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:49,230
You two should stop by the store.

708
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:52,220
- Why?
- There's a strange ahjussi there.

709
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,400
- You should stop by.
- Who?

710
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,210
I said I don't know. But...

711
00:49:57,210 --> 00:50:00,050
Anyway, the atmosphere was weird.

712
00:50:00,050 --> 00:50:01,780
I'm tired.

713
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,060
Me, too.

714
00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:11,060
Your birth father you didn't even know existed just showed up.

715
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,700
Oh, monolids!

716
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:17,240
He has monolids but with large eyes!

717
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:22,790
You kind of resemble him.

718
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,330
Shit!

719
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:29,830
Seriously!

720
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,640
What is it? What about monolids?

721
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:39,570
Dad!

722
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:50,920
Hey.

723
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:58,640
He left.

724
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,020
Just now.

725
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,290
Hey. Did Dal leave?

726
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:35,390
You want some ice cream?

727
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:37,960
I bought the one you like.

728
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:48,560
I heard you met him.

729
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:57,450
Why didn't you tell me?

730
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:02,520
I'm not scolding you.

731
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,590
If you had told me, I would've had time to...

732
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,580
Never mind.

733
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:14,250
I'm not blaming you, nor is it your fault.

734
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:19,350
Your dad...

735
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:23,620
I mean, not me.

736
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,680
Your real, biological dad...

737
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:37,290
Your biological dad...

738
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:41,750
wants to take you with him.

739
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:46,910
And?

740
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:53,290
You're his biological son, so of course, he'd want to take you.

741
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:56,570
It's not like I don't understand him.

742
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:01,710
And he's your biological dad, so you must also...

743
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:05,250
If you want to go with him...

744
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,810
And if you're asking for my opinion...

745
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:30,160
I wish you wouldn't go with him.

746
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:38,830
You're still...

747
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:43,660
You're still in high school.

748
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:48,390
At least until you graduate high school,

749
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:55,130
I could cook for you and...

750
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:01,360
iron your school uniform and...

751
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:08,540
Never mind. You can do what you want,

752
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,460
but I...

753
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:20,120
I just want to do those things a little longer.

754
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,080
I didn't tell you.

755
00:54:33,890 --> 00:54:36,970
I-I didn't tell you...

756
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:40,320
because I thought you'd tell me to go.

757
00:54:44,290 --> 00:54:49,990
You were planning to keep me...

758
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:52,660
only until my mom returned.

759
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:59,090
But now that my biological dad...

760
00:54:59,090 --> 00:55:01,510
appeared instead of Mom,

761
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:06,560
I thought you'd tell me to go.

762
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:16,170
I was afraid.

763
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,960
I was afraid.

764
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:29,290
N-No...

765
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,280
It's not like that, Haejun.

766
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:39,650
Don't go...

767
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:46,240
I'm sorry.

768
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,600
[Mr. Yoon's Kalguksu]
It's okay.

769
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:02,520
[Mr. Yoon's Kalguksu]

770
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,120
His biological dad?

771
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,670
Yeah.

772
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,660
Whoa! So he had a dad!

773
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:13,000
Good for him.

774
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,930
Is that good?

775
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:17,080
Even if that ahjussi takes Haejun with him?

776
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,340
He's going to take him?

777
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,510
Isn't that obvious?

778
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:24,250
- I guess so.
- Are you okay with that?

779
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:27,510
- If he goes?
- He won't go anyway. Right?

780
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:30,780
He might go since it's his biological dad.

781
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,970
What about our dad? What's our dad going to do?

782
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:37,340
Even now, he's always worried Haejun might skip a meal.

783
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:39,800
How could he leave our dad?

784
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,450
We can tell him to see his biological dad occasionally.

785
00:56:44,450 --> 00:56:46,560
Just like his aunt.

786
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,440
So he can't leave?

787
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,320
He can't.

788
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,280
Never?

789
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,950
Never.

790
00:57:11,210 --> 00:57:13,420
Why are you crying?

791
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,750
Stay away! Stay away!

792
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:44,460
Damn it.

793
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,450
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

794
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:51,860
Why would you leave that there?

795
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:57,390
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,340
Mom! When are we going to see Oppa?

798
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:02,610
Soon!

799
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:05,300
- Let's play a bit!
- Hey, careful. You'll fall.

800
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,420
Wait for Mommy!

801
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:24,990
What will you do now?

802
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:31,730
If he insists on taking him, I'll hire an attorney if I have to.

803
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:36,540
Fortunately, the store is under my name.

805
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:56,780
Kang Haejun, who's always looking for his dad and crab soybean paste stew.

806
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:00,310
To Haejun, his dad is the best chef.

807
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:04,620
19-year-old Kang Haejun bursts into tears as he considers the possibility

808
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:08,350
of losing such a good chef.

809
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:10,740
That's enough.

810
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,170
19-year-old Haejun...

811
00:59:12,170 --> 00:59:13,910
That's enough.

812

He said he's sorry.

813
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:19,280
I'm upset that I went around cluelessly looking for Kang Haejun.

814
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,960
Why were you looking for me?

815
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:25,010
I know, huh? Why was I looking for you?

816
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:29,110
It was definitely something

817
00:59:29,110 --> 00:59:33,610
more important than this situation.

That's what I'm saying. We should've told Juwon from the start.

Sharp for no good reason.
