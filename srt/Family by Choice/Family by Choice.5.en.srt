7
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:47,000
Hi, Juwon.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,150
It was suddenly spring in my heart.

9
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,750
I've decided to deliver my feelings to you through this letter.

10
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,420
With fond feelings, 'X.'

11
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:56,050
He wrote, 'X.' Is he in our grade?

12
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,660
- Did something good happen?
- Actually...

13
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,400
I have something to brag about. Yoon Juwon. You see that, right?

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,690
I'm going to start dating now, too.

15
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,460
He's the class president, he's intelligent,

16
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,180
and I heard he's even handsome and tall!

17
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,870
My mom said a person's family environment is really important.

18
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,330
But all that sounds like a stereotype when it comes to you.

19
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,150
It's not that we don't have a good family environment.

20
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,810
Each of us is special.

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,380
Is it true? Is he really your dad?

22
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,500
The birth father he never knew existed?

23
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,200
Didn't he pass away? Are you sure he's your real dad?

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,970
You can do anything you want if you come with me to America.

25
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,360
Please don't contact me again.

26
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,430
I'm Haejun's dad.

27
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,500
I prepared exactly double the amount my attorney came up with.

28
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,840
Dad!

29
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,810
Your biological dad...

30
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,230
wants to take you with him.

31
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,030
I wish you wouldn't go with him.

32
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,670
I didn't tell you...

33
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:01,570
I-I didn't tell you...

34
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,950
because I thought you'd tell me to go.

35
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,350
I was afraid.

36
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:09,870
You must be surprised that I showed up out of the blue.

37
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,060
Why did you suddenly appear after ten years?

38
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,940
To forgive you.

39
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,710
- Forgive me for what?
- You and Sojeong...

40
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,650
It was just the two of you.

41
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,110
What did Ahjumma say?

42
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,310
I told him I wanted to see him from now on.

43
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,560
If I take Sanha with me to Seoul, I can get him admissions consultations-

44
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,460
How can you say that after abandoning him like that?

45
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:32,950
Can't you just leave Sanha alone?

46
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:34,650
Oppa!

47
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,640
She resembles her, right?

48
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,040
So?

49
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,180
I just want to live with you.

50
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,120
Why don't you ask for my opinion even once?

51
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,910
Please leave.

52
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,410
And don't come back, if possible.

53
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,220
Pardon...

54
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,150
Shouldn't you ask Oppa if he wants to go to Seoul?

55
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,330
Why?

56
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,360
Oppa might not want to go.

57
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,930
I don't think so.

58
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,980
Mom said he'll go.

59
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,810
Sure.

60
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,770
What is it?

61
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:36,770
He must be stressed enough with the CSAT* exam around the corner.
(College Scholastic Ability Test.)

62
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,830
Maybe there was no need to talk about the past.

63
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,640
I'm his mom.

64
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,340
I worry about him more than anyone.

65
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,550
Oh, yes. Of course you are.

66
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,480
Then...

67
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:54,270
why not talk about his younger sister after he's done with the CSAT?

68
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,880
Or you could bring it up after he enters college next year-

69
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,040
He ended up that way because you're too soft on him!

70
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,210
- Sorry?
- He used to be such an obedient child.

71
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:06,720
I was wondering how he became so impudent!

72
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:14,600
Well, you suddenly showed up acting friendly after ten years of no contact.

73
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:20,680
He never said a thing about wanting to go to Seoul.

74
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,540
Did you think he'd gladly go to Seoul with you so abruptly?

75
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,000
If you had first asked him if he wanted to go,

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,210
he wouldn't have spoken so harshly.

77
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,910
- Look here!
- Here.

78
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,140
You hit him here first.

79
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:38,490
Then, you ask why he put up his guard.

80
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:41,130
That's what I'm saying.

81
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,470
Why do you flip out on me when there are other kids with their moms?

82
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,410
In other people's eyes,

83
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,070
you and I are just kids abandoned by their moms!

84
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,390
How many times do you need me to say it?

85
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,510
Should I repeat myself?

86
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,330
You and I are just-

87
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,380
Why are you acting like kids?

88
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,450
He is a kid asking for his mom.

89
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,990
- Kang Haejun!
- Don't hit my oppa!

90
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:30,730
Don't hit him!

91
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,510
What are you guys doing?

92
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,280

95
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,980
The two of them fought.

96
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,770
And Mr. Yoon?

97
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:29,670
After the two of them fought,

98
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:33,770
Ahjumma said a word about his parenting style.

99
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,920
I told her not to come back.

100
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,250
Why do you keep whispering?

101
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,880
Do you want some gim*?
(Roasted laver)

102
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,290
What terrible table manners!

103
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,920
Thank you for the food.

104
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,130
Thank you for the food.

105
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,040
Did you have to yell while they were eating?

106
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,440
They should hear it from family. Act like that outside

107
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,700
and people will say it's because they grew up without a mom.

108
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,840
Well, do they act like that outside?

109
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,280
Becoming an adult is all about holding back.

110
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,790
- Where's the gim?
- No gim since the kids left.

111
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,420
What am I? Chopped liver?

112
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,140
Gim is gold these days.

113
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,780
It's been like this for a week.

114
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,860
I haven't had a comfortable meal in one week!

115
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,770
Just give them some time.

116
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:13,800
Reconciliation takes time.

117
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,950
I'll be stressed to death before that.

118
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,690
You know what happened yesterday?

119
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,600
Ahjussi gave me money for fried chicken.

120
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,530
Fried or sweet and spicy?

121
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,730
Sweet and spicy.

122
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,330
Okay, I'm going to ask Kim Sanha, too.

123
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,140
Fried or sweet and spicy chicken?

124
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,490
- What?
- Fried or sweet and spicy?

125
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,650
- Fried.
- Not sweet and spicy?

126
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:45,560
Why? Does Kang Haejun want sweet and spicy?

127
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,390
Fried.

128
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,710
Hold on! I'll ask him one more time.

129
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:54,630
Fried?

130
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,800
Sweet.

131
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,290
And spicy.

132
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,870
Fried.

133
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,360
Then, how about half and half?

134
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,970
Sweet and spicy.

135
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,270
Fried.

136
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,830
[Sweet and spicy]

137
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,950
Is half and half out of the question?

138
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,800
[Fried]

139
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:20,080
Sweet and spicy.

140
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,980
Fried.

141
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,210
Forget it. Forget it.

142
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,610
Forget about it!

143
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:41,420
But I'll somehow make them reconcile before Kang Haejun's birthday.

144
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,750
Why? Is his birthday special?

145
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,670
Imagine they argue over his birthday dinner.

146
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:48,670
It's awkward enough with Aunt there.

147
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,660
Aunt? What aunt?

148
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,830
Haejun's aunt. She visits on Kang Haejun's birthdays.

149
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,580
I thought he had lost contact with his mom-

150
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,190
- He stays in touch with his aunt. She lives nearby, too.
- Really?

151
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:04,440
It's good to know he has an aunt.

152
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,830
Right? It's reassuring.

153
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,220
What?

154
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,790
I heard you have a cold, so I got some medicine from the nurse's office.

155
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,380
Thanks.

156
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,280
Are you free this weekend?

157
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,210
Are you asking her on a date?

158
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,100
I didn't say anything! You're the one who let it slip.

159
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,730
I kept my promise, so give me a chance to redeem myself.

160
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,600
I know how great your family environment is now.

161
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,060
Really?

162
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,720
So, where are we going?

163
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,670
Look at this.

164
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,330
There's a new bike rail at this park.

Yeah.

171
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,020
[Just us friends! One lap and friendship will blossom!]
So, this is true!

172
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,350
Hey, where are you going?

173
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,140

I can't help it, then.

182
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,640
I'll just go with Kim Sanha.

183
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,100
I can't help it, then.

184
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,660
I'll have to go with Kang Haejun.

185
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,300
Anyway, they hate being left out.

186
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,610
But will riding that make them reconcile?

187
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,860
It says it right here.

188
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,880
"Just us friends! One lap and friendship will blossom!"

189
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Doing things together naturally brings forth friendship.

190
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,350
It's very logical.

191
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,770
It's that simple?

192
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,390
How's Sunday at 2:00 p.m.?

193
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,480
- Me, too?
- Yeah.

194
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,100
The bike is a four-seater.

195
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,770
Why? Are you busy?

196
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,500
N-No, I'm not!

197
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,330
What should I wear?

198
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:32,060
I can just ride the bus.

199
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,900
You said the weekend lecture lasts all day.

200
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,750
You should save your energy.

201
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,510
Should I pick you up at night?

202
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,940
Sure.

203
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,860
Why is there so much traffic?

204
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,840
We're here.

205
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,700
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

206
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,770
- Bye now.
- Okay, have a good day!

207
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,620
[SkyBike to the ends of the earth!]

208
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,160
- So hot!
- So handsome!

209
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,600
How are we supposed to heal with this crowd?

210
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,550
That's odd. I heard it was slow because it just opened.

211
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,080
Hey. You're here.

212
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,540
Hey, why is it so packed?

213
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,470
If your brothers are here, this is a hot place.

214
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:31,880
How did they know my brothers would come?

215
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,560
You said you'd come with them.

216
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,120
I did?

217
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,200
I'm asking them to join!

218
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,310
They're here! They're here! Come this way!

219
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,700
[Big news! Sanha and Haejun will be at SkyBike!]

220
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,710
Hey! Haejun is going to ride the SkyBike!

221
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,060
[Me, too!]
[What time are they going?]

222
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,560
[Give me the address.]
[I want to sit in the back of their bikes.]

223
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,930
[If they're going, of course, I'm going!]

224
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,190
I think that's why he came, too.

225
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,600
- We'll get going.
- Sorry. Passing through.

226
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,950
Sorry, please let me pass.

227
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,230
This was my idea.

228
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,810
I would've been fine if you said they'd be joining.

229
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,630
Who are you calling "hyungnim"?

230
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:16,100
Didn't I tell you not to talk to Juwon anymore?

231
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,230
It's okay because I was remorseful.

232
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,120
Next person!

233
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,020
- Come with me.
- As if!

234
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,640
Dal will be here soon.

235
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:34,330
She better be here soon.

236
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,600
Next person, please.

237
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,900
We should just pair up.

238
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,230
Sure, we have no choice.

239
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,070
Let's just ride three of us.

240
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:52,290
That sounds like a better idea.

241
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,220
Let's go! Let's go.

242
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,850
No, no!

243
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,620
What?

244
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,650
- I'm going to ride this one!
- No!

245
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,200
There are people waiting.

246
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,010
- What?
- Here.

247
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,410
Go ahead.

248
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,960
Seriously!

249
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,810
Ride the one behind us.

250
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,460
I can't hear anything,

251
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,880
so you can talk all you want, okay?

252
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,260
Don't worry about driving!

253

Okay, then! Just keep talking!

258

She must be tired.

259
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,970
I guess so. She's really going at it.

260
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,660
Geez, I said we should play pool. Why come to the park?

261
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,380
- Seriously.
- All the girls from our school are here today.

262

- Is that right?
- I'm looking at the bigger-

263
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,730
- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

264
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:50,150
Who knows? We might meet the one here.

265
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:52,540
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

266
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,650
Look at this.

Nature is so magnificent.

People would think you're on top of the Jirisan Cheonwangbong Peak.

269
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,900
- Sorry.
- For what?

270
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,940
I'm sorry for hitting you.

271
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,410
Only for hitting me?

272
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,160
What about before that?

273
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,750

00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,530
Of course, you don't know.

You're the one who started it!

277
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,960
You hit me with your words first!

278
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,260
You started it.

279
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,170
No. No, I didn't!

280
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,470
If you don't know why you're apologizing,

281
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:34,080
just don't apologize.

282
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,060
Hey, just hit me.

00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,620

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,250
- Apologize?
- Let go!

289
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,710
I said, let go!

00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:55,860
- Let go!
- Hey!

291
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:58,420

Hey, just don't. Don't make up!

One of us should wait for her.

Is she a kid?

317
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,500
She needs us to accompany her in broad daylight?

318
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:24,960
You should go get her if you're so worried.

- Where are they?
- Over there!

324

- Why are you coming?
- Juwon.

Yes.

Is something off?

00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,370
Shouldn't we at least get them a used car when they go to college next year?

364
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:28,110
A car, my foot.

365
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:31,830
Maintenance and insurance cost an arm and a leg.

366

They'll probably both go to Myungju University.

Buying beer...

370
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,710
once a week seems too often.

Sorry.

What should we do?

378
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:31,540
Should we just let it slide?

379

Gosh, but that seems too unfair.

- A moment?
- Oh, yes.

Punishment?

00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:39,400
That's a bit too much...

- Don't you agree?
- I get it.

And to think about it, we're not that beaten up.

405
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,100
- You got hit the most.
- Are you okay?

406
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,180
- You should change the tissue.
- No, I'm fine.

407

- Your nose looks bent.
- He just grazed me. I'm fine.

But Ahjussi, as the victims stated,

409
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:11,670
there was plenty of room for misunderstanding.

538
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,900
Dating as a student?

539
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,560
Dating is for college.

540
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,700
Gosh, what the heck?

541
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,270
[♥Huiju sunbae?]
[Kang Haejun x Dal]

542
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,080
Should we check out over there?

543
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:40,720
What about there?

544
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,640
Didn't Kang Haejun say he needs something?

545
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,380
Sneakers? What do you think?

546
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,040
Sneakers?

547
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,500
This one! It's the last one.

548
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,230
- Which one?
- This one.

549
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,060
What do you think?

550
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,400
Take it off.

551
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,850
Just keep going this way.

552
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:05,380
I want it.

553
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,980
A confirmed kill?

554
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,970
Just get it off your chest.

555
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:16,530
"I like you."

556
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,800
Is that so hard to do?

557
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,390
She can't say it because she likes him.

558
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:24,530
And it might ruin their current relationship.

559
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,660
Dal's so kind and smart, though.

560
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:29,290
Huiju's smart, too.

561
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,330
Don't do it.

562
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,060
Don't do it.

563
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,220
This one.

564
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,750
This one?

565
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,790
Let's get this.

566
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,450
Do you have this in 275 mm?

567
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,620
One moment, please.

568
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,520
Kang Haejun wears 270 mm.

569
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:02,770
He grew. He has trouble putting on his current pair.

570
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:04,530
As expected.

571
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,320
"One lap that brings your love to fruition."

572
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,410
Do you have this in 240 mm?

573
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:15,850
That one's 240 mm.

574
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,520
Try it on.

575
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,830
It's not my birthday, though.

576
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,900
I know. Just try it on.

577
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,310
I'll buy you...

578
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,700
prettier ones later.

579
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,850
The price doesn't look right.

580
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:59,310
I gave you an employee discount.

581
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,800
Why?

582
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,730
Because you're such a cute couple.

583
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,640
- We're not a-
- Thank you.

584
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,850
Be quiet. She's giving us a discount.

585
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:15,600
Hope you enjoy them.

586
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,420
Thank you.

587
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,300
Sohui wants to go see Oppa.

588
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,530
Not today.

589
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:28,850
Why?

590
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,760
Sohui misses Oppa!

591
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,730
I know we can go right now!

592
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:35,080
We can go after we eat!

593
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,760
I don't want to see Oppa.

594
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,010
Sohui wants to see him.

595
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,270
Bathroom?

596
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,300
I need to use it, so be nice and keep eating.

597
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:56,560
- Okay?
- Okay.

598
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,630
Huh? Oppa!

599
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,180
You'll be late for the academy, right? I guess we can't eat.

600
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,270
We can eat quickly. Hamburger?

601
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,110
A large set!

602
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:21,150
Oppa!

603
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,530
Oppa!

604
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,610
Oppa! Oppa!

605
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,670
Sohui, are you okay?

606
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,470
Can you stand up?

607
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:43,740
Where does it hurt?

608
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,760
Here? Does it hurt here?

609
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,310
It's the only place that hurts?

610
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:54,150
If it only hurts here, it'll get better in no time.

611
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,710
Really?

612
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,030
Jeong Sohui!

613
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,160
Sohui!

614
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,190
I told you to stay seated and eat, didn't I?

615
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,360
I saw Oppa and...

616
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,340
I said I didn't want to see Oppa.

617
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,510
Come here.

618
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,350
Look at this. You got hurt!

619
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,200
This happens whenever you're involved.

620
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,250
Sohui, weren't you a good girl?

621
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,670
Why do accidents happen whenever your oppa is involved?

622
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,100
That's not true.

623
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,930
Only good things happen when Kim Sanha is involved.

624
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:52,560
My dad won fourth place lottery recently when he rarely wins fifth place.

625
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,950
My dad's store has more customers because it's the valedictorian's family.

626
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:56,670
You didn't know, right?

627
00:38:58,030 --> 00:39:00,590
No one in our apartment building ever got in a car accident.

628
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:03,210
Even the jopop* tree in the courtyard looked dead
(Sounds like an insult in Korean)

629
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,950
but is in full bloom.

630
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:08,340
Everyone was saying, "What in the world!"

631
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,750
Let's go.

632
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,340
Let's listen to that before we go.

633
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,580
That's not true.

634
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,020
Only good things happen when Kim Sanha is involved.

635
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,980
Hey! There's nothing wrong with my oppa!

636
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,490
You're the one with a problem!

637
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,120
If you get hungry, knock on our door.

638
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,650
Children shouldn't be hungry. Okay?

639
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,440
[Mr. Yoon's Kalguksu]
Oppa!

640
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,780
Are you okay?

641
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:20,950
Did I go too far with jopop?

642
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:24,200
- What?
- I mean, she's still an elder.

643
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,050
I went too far with jopop, right?

644
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:31,010
Why?

645
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,940
I was wondering if you still have a fever.

646
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,450
Fever?

647
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,040
I got better ages ago.

648
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,140
You're fine.

649
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:21,740
[Mr. Yoon's Kalguksu]
[We're closed today because it's my son's birthday.]

650
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:44,150
- Hey, Juwon. Set the plates in advance.
- Okay.

651
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,010
- Where's your aunt?
- She's almost here.

652
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,510
All right.

653
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,300
Cook the rest of the jeon*.
(Korean pancake)

654
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,210
Where are you going?

655
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,480
I'll go bring Kim Sanha.

656
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:03,730
Sanha!

657
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,950
You don't know how to knock?

658
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:12,300
The sound of the front door opening is the knock.

659
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,890
Get out. I need to get changed.

660
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,660
Get changed.

661
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:18,340
- Get out.
- What-

662
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,640
Get out, I said!

663
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:20,970
You're being so petty!

664
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:23,500
- Just get out!
- I never knocked, to begin with-

665
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,740
You should lock your door before changing from now on, too!

666
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,360
For what?

667
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,930
I mean, if Kang Haejun or I open the door by mistake-

668
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:40,090
Forget it.

669
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,990
- Where's Dad?
- Went to buy a cake.

670
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,480
Again.

671
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,510
Again, with that expression.

672
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,670
I mean...

673
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:53,700
Auntie is a good person.

674
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,990
I know.

675
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,960
Kang Haejun breaks down when Auntie is here.

676
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,220
He forces laughs and starts getting loud.

677
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,970
Don't show it.

678
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:10,440
- If you want to say something to Auntie?
- Yes.

679
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:14,080
- But you're not sure if you should say it or not.
- Yes.

680
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,290
Then, don't say anything.

681
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,340
Let's go.

682
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:28,740
I'm always trying my best.

683
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,540
Smile.

684
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,220
Auntie!

685
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,170
Have you been well?

686
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:41,190
You're here? Welcome.

687
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,460
Should I help you out?

688
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:43,980
No, we're all done.

689
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:47,700
Aigoo, it must've been a long trip. Go sit and relax.

690
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,580
- Come here.
- Yes.

691
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,790
You're here?

692
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:59,640
Yes.

693
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:04,340
Have you been well, Juwon?

694
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:06,030
Yes!

695
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:08,170
It's next month, right?

696
00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:09,800
Yes.

697
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,910
Hey, clean up the clothes in your room.

698
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:13,770
Oh, that's right!

699
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,040
What about your biological dad?

700
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,190
He hasn't contacted you yet?

701
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,550
I think he went to Seoul.

702
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:05,570
Is that so? I guess it must be so.

703
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:07,120
Why?

704
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,470
I gave it some thought and...

705
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:14,960
I wonder if it'd be better for you to go with your biological dad.

706
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,190
Gosh, Auntie!

707
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:17,570
Am I wrong here?

708
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:20,350
We already owe this family for the past ten years now.

709
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,980
A person should know better.

710
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:26,910
I behave well.

711
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:28,440
Behave well, my foot!

712
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,970
Just look at what happened earlier.

713
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:33,090
You can clean up Juwon's room for her and

714
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:38,750
you should help out if you see Sanha setting the table.

715
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:41,500
We need to pay for your college next year, too.

716
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,800
And it's not like it costs a penny or two.

717
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,090
I'll be mindful from now on.

718
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:51,210
I'm doing whatever I can, but this happens sometimes.

719
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,200
Don't worry about it!

720
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:58,050
Don't worry about me.

721
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:02,330
What are you doing there?

722
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,910
You came.

723
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:09,240
- Give it to me.
- Oh, here.

724
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:12,280
It's fresh cream.

725
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:17,280
Hello.

726
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,970
- It's fresh cream.
- What kind of cake is it?

727
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:21,050
It's fresh cream.

728
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,330
You can't open it yet.

729
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:24,530
It's got so many fruits.

730
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:27,020
Calm down now.

731
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,540
- We'll do it.
- Why?

732
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:31,640
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

733
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,640
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

734
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,010
♫ Happy birthday, Dear Kang Haejun ♫

735
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:42,120
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

736

Make a wish.

737
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,100
- Here!
- Whoa, what's this?

738
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,660
This is from Kim Sanha and me.

739
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:02,340
Basketball shoes?

740
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:05,870
Hurry up and eat before the short ribs get cold.

741
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:07,370
Yes.

742
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,330
Thank you for the food.

743
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:11,550
They say people run away when you gift shoes.

744
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,930
Will you be okay?

745
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:15,540
How dare he run away?

746
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:20,140
Once Haejun goes to college, he'll have to give back to Juwon's dad.

747
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:22,460
- Right?
- Yes.

748
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,290
To be honest,

749
00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:32,330
the first time you took him under,

750
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:35,760
I thought you'd send him back soon after.

751
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,040
Back then, I was thankful if you could take him

752
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:44,420
even for a moment because I was busy with my life.

753
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:46,620
You even had a child of your own.

754
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:50,340
But you still came forward to take in a stranger's child.

755
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:53,880
I thought you were so innocent.

756
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:59,290
You say such silly things.

757
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:03,320
Not at all. I'm really thankful to you.

758
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:07,200
Haejun received everything in this house,

759
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,550
which my sister and I couldn't provide.

760
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:13,220
So, Haejun will be good to you.

761
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:18,370
He's the type to give back tenfold once he grows up.

762
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:22,680
Be good to me for what?

763
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,100
There's no need.

764
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:28,310
What parent tells his child to pay back for raising him?

765
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,680
Are the short ribs not good?

766
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:46,030
- They're delicious.
- Oh, yes.

767
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,600
Man, that's refreshing!

768
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,870
- Delicious, right?
- Yeah.

769
00:48:55,870 --> 00:48:57,890
Eat up.

770
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:12,000
Should I call you a cab?

771
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,550
No need. I can just grab one by the main street.

772
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,630
I should've brought him...

773
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:23,340
when he was much younger.

774
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:36,620
If so, he wouldn't have known I brought him from elsewhere to raise him.

775
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:40,450
Had I done so...

776
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:46,160
he didn't have to hear that he needed to be good to me.

777
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,990
What's your problem?

778
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,730
H-Hey, take your father to his room.

779
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:56,130
Yes.

780
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,740
No, I'm fine.

781
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:01,460
Let's go inside, Ahjussi.

782
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:12,710
Why can't you understand where I'm coming from when you have your own child?

783
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:19,940
Feeding, clothing, and providing for them.

784
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:24,520
They're all my joys, not theirs.

785
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,430
I'm doing them for my own good, so why...

786
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:32,960
Why does Haejun need to walk on eggshells?

787
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,680
I wasn't saying he needed to walk on eggshells.

788
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,970
It's because I'm so thankful.

789
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:39,800
Thankful...

790
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:46,310
I can't even spit on the streets because of the kids.

791
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:50,470
God forbid if something were to happen to the kids in the future,

792
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:54,470
I'm afraid I might regret even those little things.

793
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:00,910
Thanks to the kids, I'm living my life properly.

794
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:03,340
So, I should be thanking them!

795
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:06,670
What did the kids do so wrong?

796
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:10,280
One gets shoved around by his mom,

797
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,540
and the other gets shoved around by his aunt.

798
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,560
Haejun, that kid?

799
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:20,880
He does his darndest to help me with whatever I'm doing.

800
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,700
He does all he has to do, including basketball, cleaning, and laundry.

801
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,500
He's such a nice kid!

802
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,960
W-What on earth did he do so wrong that

803
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:34,710
he has to be good to me?

804
00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:37,040
Be good...

805
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,150
J-Just how much more does he have to do?

806
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:46,390
T-That's not what I meant-

807
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,890
He knows.

808
00:51:49,710 --> 00:51:52,290
He knows that's not what you meant.

809
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:55,330
He's just drunk, you know.

810
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:56,750
You understand, right?

811
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,810
I'm sorry.

812
00:51:58,810 --> 00:52:01,110
I'm so sorry.

813
00:52:25,450 --> 00:52:27,680
Aigoo, seriously.

814
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,630
He went all out today.

815
00:52:35,630 --> 00:52:39,350
What a memorable birthday today will be.

816
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:44,480
- His socks.
- Yes.

This is a clean one.

818
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,600
- I'm a fool, aren't I?
- Not at all.

Just leave it.

820
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:07,890
I'll clean up with Haejun once he comes out.

I can just clean up quickly.

You and Haejun aren't the same.

Even if you ate and grew up together,

824

your dad pays for everything.

825
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,600
I'll clean up before leaving. Go up and get some rest.
