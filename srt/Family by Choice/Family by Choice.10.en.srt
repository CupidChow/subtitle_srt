Thanks a lot!

183
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:48,300
They say every family has a troublemaker.

184
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,190
You have one, too.

185
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:52,590
Gosh, why do you keep saying that?

186
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:56,280
It's great that both boys came down together.

187
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:59,920
Did Sanha really become a doctor at Myungju University Hospital?

188
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,710
Yes, he did.

189
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,900
Will Sanha treat us well if we go to him, too?

190
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,480
Yes, he'll do the best he can.

191
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,490
Aigoo, that's why they say you've got to have a doctor in your family!

192
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,430
But why are you eating noodles?

193
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:18,190
I'm sure you'd be full even if you don't eat.

194
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,740
What do you mean?

195
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,840
One's a doctor and

196
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,280
the other's unemployed.

197
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,880
So, one looks bright while the other looks dull.

198
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,450
Does Haejun speak some English?

199
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:34,100
Gosh, I'm sure he does.

200
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,870
He spent years in the U.S.

201
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:41,800
I guess he can't.

202
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,310
I'm thankful he came back in one piece, all healthy.

203
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,300
Gosh, Mr. Yoon's right about that.

204

- Health comes first.
- Yes.

205
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,230
If being healthy is a young man's most proud achievement, he's got a problem.

206
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,890
There's no problem.

207

209
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:10,760
It's not too far from here, so there are lots of her regulars in our hospital.

210
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,460
The reunions happen every other day.

211
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:16,590
Haedong High's graduates are quite active, as you know.

212
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,230
So, she's been doing well.

213
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,630
Of course, she's doing great!

214
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,140
The teachers were worried about what Juwon would do after graduating.

215
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,650
She's the only one who's really successful.

216
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,830
Daldal is famous on SNS.

217
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:33,150
I barely got my mother's birthday cake because I placed the order weeks ago.

218

Really?

219
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,610
A person really needs to excel at one thing, whatever it may be.

220
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,250
Juwon is probably the only one who's called "Boss" out of all the Haedong High graduates.

221
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:46,020
How about a boyfriend?

222
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,630
Does she have one or something?

223
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:50,610
- I was actually going to tell you-
Hey, Huiju!

224
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,220
Did you show Professor Kim the CT scan you took this morning?

225
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,300
- I-I was going to show him right now!
- Wait.

Hyungnim, let's talk again later.

228

Mr. Yoon, I'm going to go get some air.

229
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,560
Yes, thanks for your work.

Aigoo, why do I crave sweets?

231

Madam is only worried about Haejun, you know.

232
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,980
It's understandable.

233
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,450
I'm worried about him, too.

234
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:33,040
Is he interested in getting a steady job?

235
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,420
Mr. Yoon, why don't you move out to the city?

236
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,750
And get some more tables.

237
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,810
Aigoo, I can hardly manage this by myself.

238
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:46,130
That's why you need to do it with Haejun.

239
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,040
You're right.

240
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,330
Haejun won't have to suffer elsewhere trying to learn a trade.

241
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,970
And Mr. Yoon will be at ease if Haejun is by his side.

242
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,990
Money from selling this store won't be nearly enough.

252
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,520
No, my dad will be running it.

You don't want that, either, do you?

359
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,850
Anyhow, stop contacting Oppa.

360
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,030
Come home early.

361
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,880
Wow, my daughter's birthday will be a noisy one this year, right?

362
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,750
Who said you can?

363
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:52,740
[2 years ago]
We spent it quietly all this time. Why does it have to be noisy?

364
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,960
I'll give him a call.

365
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,430
N-No.

366
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,420
Hey, we didn't even sing.

367
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,200
No need to sing. I'm not a kid.

368
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,090
Dad, let's not buy a cake for my birthday.

369
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:16,470
I eat it every day.

370
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:19,830
I don't want to eat the cake I made on my birthday, too.

371
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:25,570
Instead, I'll bake the most delicious cakes for your birthdays. All right?

372
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,590
Okay!

373
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,830
Sure!

374
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,440
Cheers!

375
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,600
Wow, what is this?

376
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,590
Is it broiled chicken?

377
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,310
The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

378
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,020
She said she wasn't coming.

379
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:14,480
Don't wait and just dig in. It's getting cold.

380
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,820
The store must be busy.

381
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:18,030
I'll try her one more time.

382
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,100
I'm here. Why do you keep calling me?

383
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,980
The birthday girl doesn't even have rice.

384
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,480
I came to eat miyeokguk.

385
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,340
I haven't served it yet in case it gets cold. Wait.

386
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,540
Let's dig in.

387
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,250
Dig in!

388
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,340
Thank you for the food.

389
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:43,520
- All right! One, two, three!
♫ - Happy birthday- ♫

390
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:47,820
I'm not a kid. Skip the song.

391
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,120
I've become another year older.

392
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,050
I'll ask each of you a question as the birthday girl.

393
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,660
Was it five years ago?

394
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,510
I called you, but the number no longer existed.

395
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,070
That's when you quit basketball, right?

396
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,230
Huh?

397
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:09,320
- Me?
- Did anyone else here play basketball?

398
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,190
Quitting basketball is one thing.

399
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,880
Why did you go off the grid?

400
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,510
Did you know Dad put aside his pride

401
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:19,310
and called that ahjussi thinking something might've happened to you?

402
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,620
Why are you bringing that up all of a sudden?

403
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:27,560
Did you know that ahjussi told Dad to mind his business since you already cut ties?

404
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,590
And Dad was just happy that you were okay.

405
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,680
Do you know how upset Ahjussi and I were?

406
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,940
I had no idea.

407
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,010
How could you not? Are you stupid?

408
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,200
What would we think when we couldn't reach you?

409
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,020
Juwon, why do you keep talking about the past?

410
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,520
Why can't I? I thought we were family.

411
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,660
You wanted me to blow out the candles on my birthday.

412
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,520
And I can't even ask these things?

413
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,980
He's here in the end.

414
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,730
All that matters is that he's here and healthy.

415
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:57,330
Haejun...

416
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:00,320
hurt his leg.

417
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,880
He should've known when to stop, but he pushed himself too hard.

418
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,670
Hey!

419
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:13,340
He called me from America.

420
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,960
He asked if he could walk again.

421
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,950
If what the American doctors said was true.

422
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,040
Have you lost it?

423
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,620
Where is it?

424
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,480
Which leg?

425
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,450
It's okay. I'm fine now.

426
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,310
It's just the scar that's left.

427
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:57,570
It doesn't hurt at all.

428
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,420
I'm fine!

429
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,810
Okay.

430
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,150
As long as it doesn't hurt.

431
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,010
You guys must be thirsty.

432
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,300
Milk... The milk...

433
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,110
The milk...

434
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,800
What's with the dramatics in front of the kids?

435
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,420
It's my fault.

436
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,580
I shouldn't have told him to go to America.

437
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,230
I told you not to say that!

438
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,360
I can't even talk?

439
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,960
Why don't you tell Haejun that?

440
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,010
Lower your voice.

441
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,810
Stop shaking your hands.

442
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,720
Hand it over! I'll do it.

443
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,140
It's fine!

444
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,920
Go sit down.

445
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,040
Once I calm down-

446
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,070
What's the use in calming down now? You made it too obvious.

447
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:20,270
Get away from me!

448
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,060
See?

449
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,320
The kids all left because of us.

450
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,590
Why did you cry in front of the kids?

451
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,160
They left because they wanted to.

452
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,350
And I didn't cry in front of them. I came into the kitchen.

453
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,150
You should've gone to your room!

454
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:42,670
Going into my room is weirder!

455
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:48,280
It's fine. They'll forget about it before lunchtime

456
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,490
and debate what to eat for lunch.

457
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,330
I just can't play basketball.

458
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:19,120
Otherwise, I'm fine. See?

459
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:24,990
I can still beat you in a 100-meter race.

460
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:26,460
I can beat that guy, too.

461
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,460
You're not that fine.

462
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,550
If you overdo it, your ankle will give out under your weight

463
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,010
and your knee will hurt, too.

464
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,280
That's what he's saying.

465
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,300
Who are you to say otherwise when I'm feeling fine!

466
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,060
Why are you listening to him when I'm telling you I'm fine?

467
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,870
Well, he's the one with a license.

468
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:47,080
Why believe a liar who didn't even tell us he got injured?

469
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:50,720
I used to tell you, didn't I?

470
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,860
We must tell each other everything.

471
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:55,260
We must live like that.

472
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,040
That held quite a deep meaning for me.

473
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:04,960
You didn't even keep your promise that you'll return after graduating college.

474
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:09,230
But you didn't even tell me why you didn't come.

475
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,200
I'm innocent!

476
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,690
He's the one who kept quiet about his injury.

477
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,690
If that's the case, I'm at a disadvantage!

478
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,900
I couldn't come from America, but he was only in Seoul!

479
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,420
We can't be the same!

480
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,250
That's why it's over.

481
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,060
That's why we can't return to old times.

482
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,690
I'm sorry I came later than I had promised.

483
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,500
I don't need to hear you're sorry.

484
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,030
Why couldn't you come?

485
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:01,740
No. You can't go!

486
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,680
What about Sohui if you're gone?

487
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,440
What about me?

488
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,330
I was busy.

489
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,020
Is that so?

490
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,310
I tried to come back multiple times-

491
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:27,970
Forget it. I'm not asking you to tell me everything after all this time.

492
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:31,190
What's the use?

493
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,690
Back then,

494
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,800
you knew even if I didn't say anything.

495
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,770
That's because...

496
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:41,950
we always ate together back then.

497
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,000
That's not the case anymore.

498
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,560
I'm sorry.

499
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,290
Okay.

500
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,580
Are you ending late today, too?

501
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,160
Past your store hours?

502
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,640
No, I'm going to close at 7:00 p.m. and drink beer with Dal.

503
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,270
Should I come by in the evening?

504
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,590
Up to you.

505
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,540
I'll come by 7:00 p.m.

506
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,800
Welcome!

507
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,130
We're open!

508
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,140
Can I take your order?

509
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,100
Three strawberry lattes and...

510
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,820
- a croissant, too.
- One croissant?

511
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,530
One croissant.

512
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,640
Did it hurt a lot?

513
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,880
I said it doesn't hurt!

514
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,340
Look.

515
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,770
It's totally fine.

516
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:11,160
At the time of the injury,

517
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,790
did it hurt a lot?

518
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:20,880
You were new to that family, too.

519
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,600
They probably couldn't tend to you.

520
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,780
You should've come back immediately.

521
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,180
I told you...

522
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,100
that there's no need to try too hard.

523
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,590
I told you to come back once you think

524
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,950
you've done enough.

525
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:56,700
I didn't try that hard.

526
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,730
I just did as much as I wanted to.

527
00:36:59,730 --> 00:37:03,130
But I somehow ended up falling by mistake.

528
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:08,670
I was just having fun seeing my ball make the hoop more times.

529
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,730
I...

530
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:19,100
just did that much.

531
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:25,440
It wasn't because I forced myself.

532
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,680
Really.

533
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,180
All right.

534
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,000
You've been through a lot.

535
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,400
You did great.

536
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,590
My son has grown so much.

537
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,700
I prescribed an anti-inflammatory medicine.

538
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,720
Please request a cast so they don't strain their ligament.

539
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,450
Yes, please take good care of it.

540
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,480
Isn't today your day off?

541
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,260
Yes. Something came up, so Dr. Lee asked me to cover.

542
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,150
I heard there are no outpatients today.

543
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:53,420
Yes. Professor Kim also has a seminar offsite.

544
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,900
Gosh, it's so quiet.

545
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,060
I hope every day is like today.

546
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,610
Hey!

547
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,200
Spit, spit! I take that back! Spit!

548
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,490
If we get too many emergency calls, it's on you.

549
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:12,100
[Daldal]

550
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,920
- Juwon!
- You made it.

551
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,490
Tada!

552
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,290
I told you to buy beer!

553
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,860
We should try something new for your birthday!

554
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,340
Let me take that.

555
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,540
Sanha isn't here yet?

556
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,840
Yeah.

557
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,380
Haejun's not coming, either?

558
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,390
I told him to come if he had time.

559
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,480
Of course, he's got time.

560
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,400
I guess Kang Haejun's not here yet.

561
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,450
Juwon! Park Dal, I'm here.

562
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:05,150
Hello.

563
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,690
Hello.

564
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:08,450
It's our first time seeing you after our wedding.

565
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,580
What brings you here all of a sudden?

566
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,820
I heard Haejun is coming here today.

567
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,970
We were going to meet tomorrow, but I just came.

568
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:16,910
I was in a rush, so I couldn't even buy anything for your birthday.

569
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:18,240
Beer is perfect.

570
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,500
Please, sit.

571
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:23,540
Wow...

572
00:40:27,530 --> 00:40:30,110
Pardon me!

573
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,940
There are more people than I expected.

574
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,370
Long time no see.

575
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,660
Hi.

576
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,760
Where do I sit?

577
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,790
Unni, you're here because of Juwon's birthday, too?

578
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,340
Birthday?

579
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,990
Oh, it's your birthday? Congrats.

580
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:59,720
So, Haejun's not here yet?

581
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,530
When's he coming?

582
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:04,960
[Kang Haejun]

583
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,330
The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

584
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,020
Is there a gathering?

585
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,800
Why are there so many people?

586
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,700
And why are you here?

587
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:24,460
I always remember your birthday.

588
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,830
Take this.

589
00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:33,000
- Thanks.
- Whoa.

590
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,130
Oh, right. Hyungnim got an emergency call.

591
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:40,760
It'll probably be three or four hours before he can come.

592
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,840
Hello?

593
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,200
I'll head over right now.

594
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:10,760
The kids probably got Juwon's birthday covered, right?

595
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,770
Should I call them?

596
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:16,210
What if you disturb them? Don't.

597
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:20,320
Let me take another look.

598
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,610
At what?

599
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:27,450
Geez, this guy...

600
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:35,080
Do you get something by just looking at it?

601
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:37,100
Rice cakes?

602
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,660
Money comes out!

603
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,220
Let me see. Let me see.

604
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:53,150
We saved so much!

605
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:56,250
What did I say? Everything has a use!

606
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:59,590
Wow! What can we do for them with this?

607
00:42:59,590 --> 00:43:01,690
What should we do?

608
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,440
[Messy]

609
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:14,190
We have to take care of the starving one, so the rest of them can rest assured.

610
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:17,680
Listen to you. How can we take care of only one when we both saved this money?

611
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,230
Sanha's fine.

612
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,900
He has a job and a car.

613
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,950
He takes care of himself.

614
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:24,810
Buying himself something is different

615
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,940
from receiving something from his parents.

616
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,200
And money's not the issue. It's disheartening.

617
00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:35,590
Whatever you want.

618
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:40,750
Anyway, it was worth holding back on drinking beer all this time.

619
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,670
No, we still drank quite a lot.

620
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,360
Another round!

621
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,800
When's Haejun coming?

622
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:08,350
He said he was coming, so he'll come.

623
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:21,940
You!

624
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,490
Dude.

625
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:27,050
What are you doing here?

626
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,870
You're busy,

627
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,980
so I should come to meet you. What else can I do?

628
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:34,000
- Have you been well?
- Of course.

629
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,180
I'm sorry I couldn't make the wedding.

630
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,700
It's already been years.

631
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,780
D-Don't you see me?

632
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,770
I'm here, too.

633
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:44,880
Do Huiju?

634
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,960
Why are you here?

635
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:49,400
Haedong is a smaller place than you think.

636
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,800
Sit here.

637
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:52,960
Sure.

638
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,990
You!

639
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,520
I don't have fond memories of you.

640
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,660
It's all in the past.

641
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,210
Please sit here.

642
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:03,690
- Should I?
- Yes.

643
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,360
I'm late because I bought these.

644
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,340
It cost more than 150,000 won to buy a designer.

645
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:16,010
I told you to keep it less than 100,000-

646
00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:17,520
This is your gift.

647
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:20,510
I bought it with my own money.

648
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,910
This is expensive!

649
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:24,980
You wear 240, right?

650
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,320
You should've bought your own clothes with that money.

651
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,730
Why did you buy mine?

652
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:31,250
It's a gift. Just take it.

653
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,810
Is there anything else to eat?

654
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:37,150
Why are you looking for food here?

655
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:39,830
I'll see if there's anything else.

656
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,240
Sit down. I'll do it.

657
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,710
Well, it's been a while. Let's have a drink.

658
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,690
Hey, you're leaving tomorrow. Will you be okay?

659
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,480
I'll be fine!

660
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,830
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

661
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:10,030
Are you okay?

662
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,000
One shot! Okay!

663
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,320
I told them I was busy since it was your birthday.

664
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,830
I'm sorry.

665
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,810
Go sit with them.

666
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:29,690
I'll bring this out.

667
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:32,800
I'm fine.

668
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,250
I'm fine, too!

669
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,490
Please move.

670
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:42,390
It's a simple fracture, so it should heal relatively quickly.

671
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:44,330
- I see.
- Please come this way, ma'am.

672
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:45,720
Yes.

673
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:58,460
We finished the beer.

674
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,530
I'll go buy some.

675
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,740
Let's not do this here and go someplace else.

676
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,880
This is an operating store.

677
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:11,780
There's a craft beer place nearby. Want to go there?

678
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:14,250
Sure! Let's go! Get up!

679
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:17,190
Yeah? You want to go?

680
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:18,480
Let's go. Get up.

681
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,070
Get up! Get up!

682
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:23,640
Let's go.

683
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,830
- Let's go!
- Get up!

684
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:29,160
- When's Kim Sanha coming?
- He'll get here eventually.

685
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,630
- Bye! Bye.
- You don't know that.

686
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:35,030
We don't know if it'll take him eight hours or ten hours.

687
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:36,670
Really?

688
00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:39,670
Isn't it tiring to work long hours in the emergency room?

689
00:47:39,670 --> 00:47:41,390
Of course, it is.

690
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:45,120
He's probably very tired since he was on call yesterday, too.

691
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,980
Let's go to round two!

692
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,000
You're probably tired, so you don't have to come.

693
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,080
They all went home.

694
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,620
[Yoon Juwon]

695
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,400
What's this?

696
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:42,390
Whoa, they're earrings.

697
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:49,580
Happy birthday.

698
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,280
Who's it from?

699
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,080
Kim Sanha.

700
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:57,870
Couldn't he have written more?

701
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:06,290
He has a good eye.

702
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:07,470
So pretty.

703
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:09,500
- Is it all right?
- Yeah.

704
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,370
You should wear this to dinner tonight.

705
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,340
So pretty!

706
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,800
Thanks.

707
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:38,130
Sorry I couldn't go yesterday.

708
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,080
Do you...

709
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:54,400
[Do you want to grab dinner tonight?]

710
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,570
Try not to shake the box because of the cream.

711
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:58,680
Okay.

712
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:01,190
- I hope they like the cake.
- Thank you. It's so pretty.

713
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:03,770
- Thank you. Take care!
- Thank you.

714
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,880
Do you want to grab dinner tonight?

715
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:12,780
Welcome!

716
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:16,160
Next time. I have plans tonight.

717
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:22,270
Hyungnim, you slept here last night?

718
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:23,440
Yeah.

719
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,660
I heard you went to Juwon's store yesterday, too.

720
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:28,650
Yes.

721
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:33,120
Juwon was worried you'd be really tired.

722
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,000
Lucky you.

723
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:39,650
I thought I had a chance.

724
00:51:39,650 --> 00:51:42,060
What time do you think you'll be done?

725
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:45,500
- Should I pick you up?
- Hyungnim.

726
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,200
- What?
- Can you support me so I can end up with Juwon?

727
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,930
I'll be really good to you!

728
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:56,360
Says the guy who disappeared after getting an emergency call.

729
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,320
That hyung isn't right for her.

730
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,740
He only has his looks. I'm the more charming one!

731
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:07,090
That hyung?

732
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:10,140
He's in my class. A dermatology intern.

733
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:13,460
I couldn't stand the sight of him all excited to have dinner with Juwon tonight.

734
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,260
No, I think I'll be late tonight.

735
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:35,810
He's been walking around with Juwon's coffee every morning for the past few months.

736
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:37,740
I had a bad feeling.

737
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:40,040
He must've finally asked her out.

738
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:43,250
Oh, I see.

739
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:47,530
So, Juwon accepted him?

740
00:52:49,110 --> 00:52:52,850
She's been rejecting him all this time, but I wonder what caught her interest.

741
00:52:57,580 --> 00:53:01,460
Hyungnim, please believe in Lee Junho.

742
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:07,280
Drink up.

743
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:17,150
[Park Min Hyeong: I'll go to the bakery at 7:00 p.m.]

744
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,830
Look at me.

745
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,900
What's the same?

746
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,660
My hairstyle is different for starters.

747
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:51,360
I'm not the Park Dal from the past.

748
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:55,190
Guys ask me for my number on the streets of Seoul!

749
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,870
Is that right?

750
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:59,610
I didn't know. I had no idea.

751
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:01,220
Now you know, right?

752
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,910
Definitely.

753
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:08,110
Then, as a token of apology, buy me hangover soup.

754
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:12,550
Feel-Better Hangover Soup at 12 p.m.

755
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,670
Let's go inside.

756
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:28,850
This place is a gem!

757
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,440
Do you come here often?

758
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:33,560
From time to time.

759
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:44,880
I didn't make any mistakes last night, did I?

760
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,460
No way. Not at all.

761
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:50,280
Right?

762
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,600
Of course.

763
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,010
What's wrong with getting hit on in Seoul?

764
00:54:54,010 --> 00:54:56,540
Telling the truth isn't a mistake.

765
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:13,720
She said she'd never date bakery customers.

766
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,240
Hello, Doctor.

767
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:21,890
Thinking back, the guy she had a thing with last time also came to buy her cake.

768
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:28,470
Next time. I have plans tonight.

[Kim Sanha]

770
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,970
Apply a dressing right now to the baby with the lacerated arm.

771
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:56,370
The patient with a comminuted fracture needs his stitches removed.

772
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:58,610
Educate him while applying his dressing before he goes to rehabilitation.

773
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:00,790
The open fracture T.A. patient that came in this morning
(T.A. - Traffic accident)

774
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,460
got a sonogram done because she had trouble breathing.
(T.A. - Traffic accident)

775
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,840
But her symptoms worsened, so I called in C.S. Repeat what I said.
(C.S. - Cardiovascular surgery)

776
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:09,610
Arm-baby, dressing, right now. Comminuted fracture, stitches.

777
