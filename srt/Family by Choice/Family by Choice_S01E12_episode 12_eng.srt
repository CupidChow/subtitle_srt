00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,010
   

3
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,050
   

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,700

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,080
♫  I want to get closer to you  ♫

9
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:04,780
♫  Even though I'm right next to you  ♫

10
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,400
♫  It’s like you’re on the other side of the earth  ♫

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,090
Even after this,

12
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:15,710
we can't become anything else?

13
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,450
We can't.

14
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,600
What about Dad?

15
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,380
What about Ahjusshi?

16
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,610
What would we tell Kang Hae Joon?

17
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,600
Is that a problem?

18
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,290
It is.

19
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:42,120
So your feelings are no longer the problem?

20
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:51,760
♫  My one promise for the rest of my life  ♫

21
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,790
Then, it's fine.

22
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,720
I'll take care of it.

23
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,700
Twelve...

24
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,350
Thirteen.

25
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,470
   

26
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,140
Why are you walking around in the rain?

27
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,030
Are you still a teenager?

28
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,940
So what?

29
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,190
Wait, why is your face red?

30
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,020
Do you have something to say?

31
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:53,570
No, maybe later.

32
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,200
Go to sleep.

33
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,620
Am I a child? Do you think I'll sleep so early?

34
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,400
Geez...

35
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,670
How many did I do?

36
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:08,150
Geez, that punk.

37
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,070
One.

38
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,870
Is she still washing up?

39
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,090
   

40
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,080
   

41
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,510
   

42
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,370
   

43
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,160
 You know it's Mom's birthday tomorrow, right? 

44
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:24,080
 I'll have Mom's favorite cheesecake delivered home tomorrow. 

45
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,260
 You, too, Oppa. 

46
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,670
 Okay. 

47
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,720
 Goodnight. 

48
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,790
   

49
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:55,030
   

50
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,370
 I'll be there in five minutes. 

51
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,000
Right now?

52
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,990
♫  I keep rattling  ♫

53
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,880
- Thank you for the cake. 
 - Enjoy!

54
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,610
♫  I'm lost on every step  ♫

55
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:37,230
♫  I guess I'm locked away inside you  ♫

56
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:40,220
♫  I need an explanation  ♫

57
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,760
♫  My day is spent immersed in a dream  ♫

58
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,590
You're here.

59
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,180
♫  I have a lot to say  ♫

60
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,510
Thank you for the food.

61
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:58,160
♫  but I'm lost for words  ♫

62
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,110
Just eat how you always did.

63
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,340
I like it when you eat heartily.

64
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:09,360
♫  Why am I like this?  ♫

65
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:16,060
♫  Why am I always so excited like it's the first time?  ♫

66
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,500
Are you crazy?

67
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,510
What if someone sees us?

68
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,110
Who would see us? There's no one here.

69
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,470
♫  Again, I circle around you like I'm praying  ♫

70
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,950
What? Trouble swallowing? Do you want some water?

71
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,500
Hyungnim.

72
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,590
What?

73
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,460
You said you'd grab an early lunch, and you were here?

74
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,300
I would've joined you if I had known.

75
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,270
Is that it? I thought–

76
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,900
So, is she Dr. Kim's girlfriend? Are you all acquainted?

77
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,270
What girlfriend?

78
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:07,250
She's not his girlfriend.

79
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,330
- She's not? 
 - They're family.

80
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,800
Family.

81
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,600
Where's Hae Joon? I came because I heard he was here.

82
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,430
Kang Hae Joon always comes and goes.

83
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,050
He won't answer my calls either.

84
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,400
Is he avoiding me?

85
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,930
I don't think so.

86
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:26,760
They don't give me family vibes.

87
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,210
Really? What vibes do we give off?

88
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,330
- At least, flirtation? 
 - Order!

89
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,790
You should make an order.

90
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,890
Everyone's getting coffee, right?

91
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:41,340
Three iced Americanos. Extra shot for me.

92
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,610
Three iced Americanos and an extra shot for one.

93
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,160
- Do you need help? 
 - That's odd.

94
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,050
I'm usually sharp with these things.

95
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,670
Hey, that's enough.

96
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,600
They're siblings. Just siblings.

97
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,020
They've been affectionate since high school.

98
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,830
I guess strangers can tell at a glance.

99
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,400
Be quiet.

100
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,150
What if others find out before Dad, Ahjusshi and Kang Hae Joon do?

101
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,250
That can never happen, okay?

102
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,620
I know. Don't worry.

103
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,730
 We can't stay long! Make it to-go! 

104
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,960
A-All right!

105
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:28,260
Don't you dare make it obvious out there.

106
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:37,480
Gosh, that hits the spot.

107
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,090
Tell Kang Hae Joon to answer my calls when you see him.

108
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:42,580
Of course! Of course.

109
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,660
Hyungnim, aren't you leaving?

110
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,570
I saw your car outside. Give us a ride.

111
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,910
- I'll stay a little longer. 
 - Right?

112
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:54,720
You want to stay longer for no reason, right?

113
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,270
Hey, just get going.

114
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,200
- Come again. 
 - I'll be right there.

115
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,690
Fine. I'm going, I'll go.

116
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,520
 What's the matter? 

117
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,690
What do you mean?

118
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:22,830
What's with your expression since yesterday?

119
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,320
What's wrong with my expression?

120
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,070
You said you were just picking up a prescription at the hospital yesterday,

121
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,030
but your expression has been sour since then.

122
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,740
Is it a serious illness?

123
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,210
It's not like that.

124
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,150
Then what is it?

125
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,580
I ran into Hae Joon's mom.

126
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,410
And here I thought...

127
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,190
What?

128
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,050
Well...

129
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:08,540
I ran into her by chance.

130
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,680
 You killed... 

131
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,450
 What do you mean? 

132
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,180
 It's all in the past. 

133
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,600
 I don't want to talk about it ever again. 

134
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,640
 All right. Forget about me, 

135
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,900
 but Hae Joon should know. 

136
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,000
 He waited all this time. He waited endlessly without any idea. 

137
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,840
 Seo Hyeon, why don't you– 

138
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,850
 No. 

139
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,360
 I won't contact Hae Joon. 

140
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,000
 If you tell Hae Joon you saw me today, 

141
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,840
 I'll shut down my store in Busan and will never show up again. 

142
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,680
 So, 

143
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,860
 please just let me... 

144
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:07,050
 see his face from afar every once in a while. 

145
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,200
 I beg you. 

146
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,610
S-She killed...

147
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,880
If it's involuntary manslaughter,

148
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,450
it must have been either self-defense or a justifiable reason.

149
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:35,220
So what did you say?

150
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,930
Did you agree?

151
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,780
Not to tell Hae Joon?

152
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,370
She said she'd leave if I told him.

153
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,340
Then Hae Joon would also lose his chance to see his mom.

154
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,020
Even so!

155
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:50,280
She should tell him the reason for cutting ties so he can come to terms with it.

156
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,150
Consider how she must feel to say she doesn't want to see her child.

157
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:54,980
Who's worried about whom?

158
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,470
I've thought it out.

159
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,500
I'm going to Busan tomorrow to ask her to reconsider.

160
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,990
"Busan"? She's in Busan right now?

161
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:07,020
She settled there last year and runs a hair salon.

162
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,180
Busan's so close by.

163
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,420
- If she wanted to meet... 
 - If she wanted to meet, it wouldn't take long.

164
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:22,570
Don't worry. I'll do whatever it takes to reunite them this time.

165
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,000
What if Hae Joon doesn't want to?

166
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,500
Why wouldn't he?

167
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,690
I'm not saying he wouldn't,

168
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:35,250
but he couldn't come to us right away when he arrived in Haedong.

169
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:40,190
How worried must he feel about meeting his mom after 20 years?

170
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,540
I think we ought to open a store for him or find him a job.

171
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,400
You're right.

172
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,020
He only played basketball all his life, but now he has injured his leg.

173
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,670
What should we have him do?

174
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:10,360
Oh, yes. I find it overwhelming

175
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,880
when the woman is too pretty.

176
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:24,650
I'm also not overwhelmed at all right now. It's nice.

177
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:33,850
How much do you make from running a lawyer's office around here?

178
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:36,590
- Pardon? 
 - I mean,

179
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:39,440
this isn't just a casual blind date.

180
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,630
We must be transparent.

181
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,100
- Would you like a copy of my income tax? 
 - That would be nice!

182
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,590
Honey, are you on a blind date right now?

183
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:26,400
- He called her "Honey." 
 - She betrayed him and went on a blind date.

184
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,090
- Why would she leave someone like him? 
 - Honey.

185
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:32,330
Do you want to see me lose it?

186
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,630
Well...

187
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:43,940
Hey, Attorney Park. Do you know this guy?

188
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,110
Am I just a guy you know?

189
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,480
He's not just a guy I know.

190
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,690
He's the person I like.

191
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,130
He's the person she likes.

192
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,790
Lucky her.

193
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,450
What kind of situation is this?

194
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,640
What a joke. Wow.

195
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:27,700
It'll be hard for you to go on another blind date in the future.

196
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,460
My acting was pretty good, but yours was off the charts, too!

197
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:41,400
I really thought you were confessing your feelings to me.

198
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,540
I wasn't. I really wasn't.

199
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,530
Sir.

200
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,650
Mr. Yang.

201
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:51,350
- Sir. 
- What are you doing here?

202
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,870
Oh, I was on my way to see a property

203
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:57,520
when I saw you standing here.

204
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,320
The property you saw last time was sold this morning.

205
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,080
Man, already?

206
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:08,800
Aigoo, I told you the good ones sell within hours.

207
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,960
It's really rare to find a building like this for 800 million won ($570,000).

208
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,490
"800 million won"?

209
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,190
I'll reach out to you again.

210
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,230
Yes, take care.

211
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,970
800 million won?

212
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,670
Why?

213
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,750
Do you think it's a bad idea, too?

214
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:40,140
No, I'd love to receive a building, of course.

215
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,130
Right? You'd love to, right?

216
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:47,010
But Kim San Ha keeps telling me to ask Dad first.

217
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,880
Then it wouldn't be a surprise.

218
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:54,620
Sunbae, do you like apples?

219
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,010
I do.

220
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:01,070
After winning cases, my clients sometimes bring me apples.

221
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,290
But I like strawberries.

222
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,540
It's ultimately up to the giver,

223
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,340
but wouldn't it be better to ask the person for whom the gift is intended?

224
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,470
All right.

225
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:25,380
Wow, you really know how to tailor your explanation.

226
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,060
Attorneys really are different.

227
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:31,620
I should talk to Dad while I'm at it.

228
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,400
Let's eat...

229
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,620
I should've just stayed quiet.

230
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,380
Hey, Park Dal!

231
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,100
I'm in your debt!

232
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,510
I'll buy you a meal next time!

233
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,580
Okay!

234
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,570
Madam.

235
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:59,770
Do you know the current market price for commercial properties downtown?

236
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:04,310
Yes, Jin Ju's daughter-in-law works in real estate downtown.

237
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,770
I occasionally visit to eat rice cakes.

238
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:13,770
How much would a store of this size cost?

239
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:16,450
Why? Do you want to move stores?

240
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,600
No, not me. For Hae Joon.

241
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,140
Good thinking.

242
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,870
What good can come from leaving him idle?

243
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,300
But even if it's a small property,

244
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,120
with the deposit and key money, even with a loan,

245
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,300
it'll cost at least 100 million won.

246
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,120
- "100 million"? 
 - Yes.

247
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,620
Okay, please give me her contact number for now.

248
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:45,920
Madam!

249
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,830
Are you going home?

250
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,230
Who is this?

251
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,130
You look so handsome!

252
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,040
You should dress like this all the time.

253
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,770
Gosh, I can't every day. Too many women will bother me.

254
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,540
Why don't you talk after you find one?

255
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,900
You should be good to Mr. Yoon.

256
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,390
Pardon?

257
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:11,960
All right!

258
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,060
 Dad! 

259
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,700
Yes, I'll reach out to you again.

260
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,860
Yes, thank you.

261
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,170
Hey, you're here.

262
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,660
Wow, why does my son look so radiant today?

263
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:31,290
Did you have a job interview?

264
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,410
Nothing like that.

265
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,320
I came to eat.

266
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,430
You did? Good, let's go. I'll whip something up.

267
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:46,300
There's more. Slow down.

268
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,330
Why'd you decide to live away from home?

269
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,790
You could eat home-cooked meals every day.

270
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,010
That's actually the reason why I came.

271
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:14,900
I was originally planning to move in after securing a property.

272
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,660
"Property"?

273
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,360
"This is yours, Dad!"

274
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,790
I was going to surprise you,

275
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,860
but everyone keeps telling me to ask you first.

276
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,890
What are you talking about?

277
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,080
What is this...

278
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,210
800 million?

279
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,360
- Is this real? 
 - Yes.

280
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,900
Is this your birth father's money?

281
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,570
Gosh, no way!

282
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,670
Where did you get this much money, then?

283
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,510
I washed dishes and served tables.

284
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:11,260
Dishes and serving? What do you mean?

285
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,760
It's what I did at the store back then.

286
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,600
I got a lot of tips for my skillful hands.

287
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,440
I caught a customer's eye and did some modeling, too.

288
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,450
The investments I made before serving in the military also did well.

289
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,170
I worked really hard to pay you back...

290
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,830
I worked...

291
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,180
hard.

292
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:47,170
Did someone tell you to pay me back?

293
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:52,020
Did I send you to America to do those things?

294
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,540
What did I tell you before you left?

295
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:59,360
I told you to come back after you'd had your fun.

296
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,270
Dishes and serving? How do you have skillful hands?

297
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:05,680
Did I ever tell you to do those things at the store?

298
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,560
No, that's not what I meant.

299
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,840
Still, you raised me for ten years–

300
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,770
What parent doesn't? It comes naturally!

301
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:17,280
We raise you to eat well, sleep well, and live a joyful life.

302
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,160
Did I raise you to give me money?

303
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,730
Did I raise you to pay me back?

304
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,520
No.

305
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,810
- Take it back. 
 - Dad...

306
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,230
You...

307
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:38,870
Is it because I'm not your real father?

308
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,630
Is that why you keep insisting on paying me back?

309
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,280
It's not.

310
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,360
It's not like that. I don't ever think that way, Dad!

311
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,000
Leave.

312
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,020
Dad.

313
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,730
Leave!

314
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,520
   

315
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:12,010
 Will you be home this weekend? 

316
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,470
 I have something to tell you. 

317
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:19,340
 What is it? 

318
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,570
 I'll tell you in person. 

319
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,250
I'm fine.

320
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:32,460
I'm fine.

321
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,080
Hyungnim, do you have a fever?

322
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,720
"A fever"?

323
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,610
I don't. I'm fine.

324
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:43,730
I think you have a cold.

325
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,920
Thanks.

326
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,710
You need to rehydrate after crying.

327
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:29,350
I'm sorry. I spoke out carelessly.

328
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,880
It's not your fault.

329
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,360
He's this angry right now.

330
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,740
If I told him after signing the contract,

331
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:49,350
he might've said he'd never see me again.

332
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:54,930
No way. He's just saying that.

333
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,270
In my opinion,

334
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,620
I think he's heartbroken, not angry.

335
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,930
He didn't want you to suffer,

336
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:14,940
but you did suffer, which breaks his heart.

337
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,520
Isn't that proof that you're so loved?

338
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,620
I'm aware, too.

339
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,530
I'm the problem.

340
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,750
In the end, I'm not his biological son.

341
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,330
So it feels like I have to do something more,

342
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:43,560
like I need to pay him back.

343
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,920
I keep thinking that way.

344
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,900
Since you're aware, can't you just tell him you're sorry?

345
00:26:57,870 --> 00:26:59,940
Should I go right now?

346
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,550
No.

347
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:06,690
Ahjusshi might need some time,

348
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:08,760
so how about you go tomorrow?

349
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:14,170
All right. I'll go tomorrow.

350
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,180
What would I have done without you?

351
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,250
Thank you. Sincerely.

352
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,640
No problem.

353
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,180
Even if it were someone else, they would've told you the same.

354
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,230
Regardless.

355
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:39,410
So? You just let him leave like that?

356
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:43,350
I already gave him an earful.

357
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,370
I'm not saying I did a good thing...

358
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:49,070
Go ask all the biological fathers in the country.

359
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:53,090
If their child gave them money to buy a building,

360
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:58,530
100 out of 100 would be dancing barefoot with pure joy.

361
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,870
Would your dad do that, too, Inspector Kim?

362
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:05,020
Pardon? Oh, my dad?

363
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:10,300
Yes, I think my dad would've danced in pure joy, too.

364
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,950
See? I was right.

365
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:16,160
The reason Mr. Yoon got mad is because of his guilty conscience.

366
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,880
Since you're not his birth dad.

367
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,330
That's just my opinion.

368
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:31,780
Just take it as one opinion.

369
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,100
Anyway, what kind of modeling did Hae Joon do, to make that much money?

370
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,160
Should I look into it?

371
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,250
Let's see.

372
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,980
 Still, you raised me for 10 years– 

373
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,900
 What parent doesn't? It comes naturally! 

374
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,420
 We raise you to eat well, sleep well, and live a joyful life. 

375
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,030
 Did I raise you to give me money? 

376
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:24,400
 The reason Mr. Yoon got mad is because of his guilty conscience. 

377
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,710
 Since you're not his birth dad. 

378
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,200
She's right.

379
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,750
I was shortsighted.

380
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,880
I acted foolishly.

381
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,990
- A cold? 
 - Yes.

382
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,920
But he still got his prescription before going home.

383
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,030
- Do you need candles? 
 - Yes.

384
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:28,600
♫  One day, a precious memory  ♫

385
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:36,140
♫  Entered my small heart the day you smiled brightly  ♫

386
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,900
Kim San Ha!

387
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,580
Kim San Ha!

388
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,970
   

389
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,250
 Yes, what is it? 

390
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,690
- What's your door lock passcode? 
  - What? 

391
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,880
What's your door lock passcode?

392
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,200
Kim San Ha has a cold.

393
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,780
I think he's inside, but he's not picking up.

394
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,640
Yes, okay.

395
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,900
♫  Back then, we were too young to know our hearts were racing  ♫

396
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:17,180
♫  We just argued and delayed things without knowing why  ♫

397
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,220
Kim San Ha!

398
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,630
Kim San Ha!

399
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,120
Are you okay?

400
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,570
Look at this sweat.

401
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,980
You have a high fever.

402
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,440
Were you that worried?

403
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,230
What are you saying?

404
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:47,970
♫  We just believed  ♫

405
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,490
♫  we didn't want to let go of each other  ♫

406
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,380
Get changed.

407
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,070
Is it here?

408
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:56,830
Is it here?

409
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,980
I'll do it.

410
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,280
Are you going to watch?

411
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,980
Oh, please.

412
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,230
Are you done changing?

413
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,930
Yes.

414
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:35,580
Come in.

415
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,930
What are you doing? Lie down.

416
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,560
Okay.

417
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,550
How is it? Does it help?

418
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:07,070
It feels cool.

419
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:20,820
I'll be in the living room. Call me if you need anything.

420
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,830
Thank you.

421
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:27,180
♫  Even if you don't say where it hurts  ♫

422
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:30,400
♫  I know  ♫

423
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:36,170
♫  Like a wildflower growing on its own  ♫

424
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:44,360
♫  The love I've kept hidden hurts  ♫

425
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:57,580
♫  Afraid you'd get caught secretly following me  ♫

426
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,870
♫  Without me knowing  ♫

427
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:05,950
♫  Your back as you looked up to the sky  ♫

428
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:07,430
Why are you here?

429
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:10,060
You should've slept comfortably in your bed.

430
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,630
But you're here.

431
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,020
It'd be a shame.

432
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,450
You must still have a fever.

433
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:22,670
♫  My wish, as it's smaller than my height  ♫

434
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,550
Your fever broke.

435
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,180
This is nice.

436
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:35,250
You still have the picture we took together in high school.

437
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:37,190
Yeah.

438
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:40,100
- You kept it this whole time? 
 - Yes.

439
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,940
- Me, too. 
 - What?

440
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:44,320
I missed you, too.

441
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,290
So, I also looked at the picture when I missed you.

442
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,770
Aigoo, that's great.

443
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,490
Oh, that's right. My goodness.

444
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:07,620
Officer Kim found this yesterday.

445
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,120
I totally forgot to show you.

446
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,620
What?

447
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,720
Take a look.

448
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:23,300
Young people are so good at finding these things.

449
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,730
Look at him. He's something else.

450
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,130
Look.

451
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:32,210
Is this really Hae Joon?

452
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:36,670
We were worried for no reason, calling him a bum when he was doing just fine.

453
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,160
It's all good.

454
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:57,790
- Are you awake? 
 - Yes.

455
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:02,030
All right. Take a seat.

456
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:03,940
There.

457
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,990
- Fried egg, right? 
 - Yes.

458
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:13,170
The bread came out of the oven just now.

459
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,100
You're in for a surprise.

460
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,690
Thank you for the food.

461
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,650
- Yummy, right? 
 - Yes.

462
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,730
 My handsome son. 

463
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,340
What's this?

464
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,630
Is this Kang Hae Joon?

465
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,550
What's this? Is he a celebrity?

466
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:46,280
I was wondering where he got his money.

467
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,440
Where did Hae Joon go, by the way?

468
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,850
He said he'll sleep over at Seok Hoon's so he won't catch your cold.

469
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:56,040
He should be here by now.

470
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,910
 My handsome son. 

471
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:22,800
   
   

472
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,320
Goodness. How is he so handsome?

473
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,800
- I'm smitten. 
 - He's really a model.

474
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,350
Aigoo, your son's so handsome.

475
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,180
Wow, he's something else.

476
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,620
They said it's different than being a model in Korea

477
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,660
because he did it at a big global show.

478
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,170
- Of course! 
 - Yes, it's different.

479
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,470
- It can't be the same. 
 - Yes, isn't that right, Unni?

480
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,360
- Please enjoy. 
 - Thank you.

481
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,950
- Aigoo. 
 - My goodness.

482
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,310
- You came. 
 - Yes.

483
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,060
Don't bother. You'll dirty your hands.

484
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:01,990
Have a seat.

485
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,630
We have a lot of customers.

486
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:12,240
Nice...

487
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,880
- Hey, you! 
 - I-Is that really you?

488
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,390
I can't believe we get to see the day.

489
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,970
A celebrity came out of this tiny Haedong.

490
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:23,610
Hae Joon, I've never seen a celebrity before!

491
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:25,530
- Do you want kalguksu? 
 - Yes, we will take two.

492
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:28,550
- Yes, coming up. 
 - Why aren't there scallion pancakes here?

493
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,130
- Didn't he give you one? 
 - No, he didn't.

494
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,620
Mr. Yoon!

495
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,600
Yes, coming right up!

496
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,610
Hurry it up, will you?

497
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:46,860
Aigoo, let us look at the celebrity up close, too!

498
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,860
You really can't hide where you come from.

499
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:51,660
Whoa, his face is just like his father's.

500
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,600
You're right. I guess you don't take after your mother at all.

501
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,390
Gosh, the thing is, he's–

502
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:01,670
Mr. Yoon also used to be quite handsome in his prime, wasn't he?

503
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:04,620
You're right. I remember.

504
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,810
Did you wait long?

505
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:26,700
No, I just got here, too.

506
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,470
- Let me. 
 - I'll do it.

507
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,740
I was just trying to help.

508
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,050
Did I ask for your help? Are you pitying me right now?

509
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,740
No, it's not pity.

510
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,140
Anyway, let's sit.

511
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,930
Have you been well?

512
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,120
Ask anyone here if I look like I'm doing well.

513
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,580
Or are you making fun of me?

514
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:14,380
- Why would I? 
 - Why wouldn't you?

515
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:19,340
Your ex-wife who left you for a better life

516
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:22,700
lost her new husband and showed up limping.

517
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:27,400
It must be either laughable or pitiable, right?

518
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:31,380
I've never once thought that way.

519
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,010
Try to be honest.

520
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:39,760
Who knows if you secretly prayed for my doom for 100 days?

521
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,000
So why didn't you live a good life?

522
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,690
I let you go for a better life.

523
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,630
Is it my fault your husband died?

524
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,050
Is it my fault your legs ended up that way?

525
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,100
I even let San Ha go because he wanted to save his mom.

526
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,200
What more can I do from here–

527
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,040
Watch what you say!

528
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,190
I've never asked for anything from you.

529
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,900
San Ha came to me on his own ten years ago.

530
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,630
He might say he won't, but...

531
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,180
I'm sure he will come to Seoul in a month.

532
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:13,180
He can't defy me.

533
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,170
He can't abandon me.

534
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,540
For crying out loud.

535
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,880
How can you be so self-centered?

536
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,000
People are all self-centered.

537
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,470
Are you any different?

538
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,500
Gosh...

539
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,340
I'm the idiot for coming here, thinking we'd be able to communicate.

540
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,110
Crap.

541
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:45,660
You came to meet that Ahjusshi? Who is he?

542
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,410
So Hui, should we see Oppa before we go?

543
00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:50,700
Mom!

544
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,950
We came all the way here. Wouldn't Oppa be sad if we left without seeing him?

545
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,590
We came because you said you'll feel better if you see the ocean.

546
00:41:58,590 --> 00:42:02,070
Is this the true reason why you wanted to come to Busan?

547
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:04,180
No, that's not it.

548
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,980
I always liked the ocean.

549
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,880
I'd like to live by the ocean if I can.

550
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:14,950
Don't you?

551
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,780
Dad, Dad!

552
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,910
Dad, give me a marker!

553
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,400
What are you doing?

554
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,870
Even if it was for commercial use, this is way too flashy.

555
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,900
Hey, this much is fine.

556
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,700
- Dal, eat some scallion pancake inside. 
 - Pardon?

557
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:50,380
   

558
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,820
I need to take this call.

559
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,870
How is his pose so cool?

560
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,410
He exudes a bright light.

561
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,840
Did San Ha go to work?

562
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,620
Yes, he wants some scallion pancakes, too.

563
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,520
All right. I got it.

564
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,980
Why isn't Dal coming? Let me go get her.

565
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,160
No, you eat. I'll go get her.

566
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,520
That's not it.

567
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,630
 What can you do on your own? 

568
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:24,330
 Even if you have a man, you should pretend not to have one on those blind dates. 

569
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:25,970
 Do I have to teach you that, too? 

570
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:28,400
I said I'm sorry about that.

571
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,040
He behaved badly, too!

572
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,710
 Stop blaming others. 

573
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:35,720
 If you won't work in a law firm in Seoul, you should marry well for me to feel relieved. 

574
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,940
I'm doing just fine here.

575
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,320
You can be relieved.

576
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,880
 I need to see you live a good life like others to feel relieved! 

577
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,360
I'm sorry.

578
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,030
Mom, I sent you some money to buy spring clothes.

579
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,100
Did you get it?

580
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,590
Yes.

581
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,490
   

582
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,940
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

583
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:38,170
It's because of me, right?

584
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,740
Should I have said something else?

585
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,640
The call dragged on.

586
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,730
I'm hungry.

587
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,860
Let's go inside.

588
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,530
- Joo Won. 
 - Yes?

589
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,500
Take a bite.

590
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:09,240
Is it okay?

591
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:12,630
It's the best. It's awesome.

592
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,340
- Joo Won. 
 - Yes.

593
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,730
Hurry up and come eat.

594
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:19,600
- Scallion pancake. 
 - Is it good?

595
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,750
The fresh kimchi is great.

596
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:23,910
Let's take a ton home.

597
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:28,150
I'll pack you scallion pancakes and fresh kimchi later. Take them.

598
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:30,020
Oh, yes!

599
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,640
Everyone, the model is here!

600
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:39,730
Line up here if you want an autograph.

601
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:42,850
- I want one! 
 - Me, too!

602
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:44,920
- One for me, too! 
 - Make a line.

603
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,450
How nice!

604
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:49,290
Let me take a look.

605
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:52,070
My goodness. Even your autograph is amazing.

606
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:54,910
Sign my handkerchief here.

607
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,830
Was it Ahjumma?

608
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,380
Yes.

609
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,930
Don't force yourself if you don't have an appetite and give it to me.

610
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:08,750
- Thanks. 
 - Thank you.

611
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:12,730
What should we have with fresh kimchi for dinner?

612
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,390
Parboiled octopus? Half-dried mackerel?

613
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:17,520
Or should I boil some pork belly? A drink?

614
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:20,340
It's not like this is the first time.

615
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:24,470
I think I'll be late because I was away from the office this morning.

616
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:28,980
All right. Let's eat something delicious tomorrow, then.

617
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,580
Take care.

618
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:41,440
   

619
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:45,250
   

620
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,360
Yes. Hello?

621
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,590
 Hae Joon's excited, right? 

622
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:54,440
You know Kang Hae Joon's fine as long as Dad is happy.

623
00:46:55,450 --> 00:47:00,370
I think I'll get off early today. At about seven o'clock.

624
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:02,540
Do you want to have dinner with me?

625
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,180
"Dinner"?

626
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,390
What are we going to have?

627
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,370
I'll look into it.

628
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:11,560
Well, shall we, then?

629
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,230
Yes.

630
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,810
What's this?

631
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,300
Why are you suddenly smiling? Is something good going on?

632
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,960
Do you know any place for dinner nearby?

633
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,160
"Dinner"? What's the occasion?

634
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,550
A date.

635
00:47:30,490 --> 00:47:33,600
Do you have a girlfriend? Daebak.

636
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,250
Hey, who is it?

637
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,020
- Gosh, stop it. 
 - Hey, who is it? Tell me.

638
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,850
There are tons of models in the U.S.

639
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:44,480
It's not like I was that famous. I only took a few pictures and stopped.

640
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,600
You should've done some more if you had fun.

641
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,600
I would've if I knew you'd be this happy.

642
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:56,940
I'm happy you're healthy.

643
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,070
You must be hungry. Eat at home before you go, if you have time.

644
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:01,480
Okay.

645
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:20,240
Seok Hoon wants to see me.

646
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,910
I'll come to eat next time.

647
00:48:22,910 --> 00:48:25,820
Why? Eat if it's not urgent.

648
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:29,090
He said the entire basketball team was there to eat together.

649
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:31,510
All right. Come tomorrow, then.

650
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:34,560
Yes. I'll get going.

651
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:42,440
 I gave this a lot of thought. 

652
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:46,900
 But I just can't forget your face that day. 

653
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,260
 So I told her you're back here. 

654
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,600
 It's up to you if you want to go see her or not. 

655
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:54,380
Taxi!

656
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,660
Take care.

657
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:27,540
- Boss. 
 - Yes?

658
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,200
Why are you in such a good mood these days?

659
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:33,070
Really? Do I look happy?

660
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,630
Yes.

661
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,880
 I'll bring your favorite hamburgers when I come back, Hae Joon. 

662
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,450
So frustrating. Aigoo.

663
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:46,760
You should've at least said something for your child's sake.

664
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,130
I'll take care of it. Mind your own business.

665
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:51,430
And if I do?

666
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:59,410
I mean, I'll make sure to try talking to her again.

667
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:04,920
What about you? What will you tell Hae Joo's mom?

668
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,080
What do you think?

669
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,910
I'll tell her to come see Hae Joon, who has grown up nicely.

670
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,790
I'm different from you-know-who. I keep my word.

671
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,900
We will see about that!

672
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:56,900
Did you wait?

673
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,450
No.

674
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:09,290
What?

675
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:11,670
Someone might see.

676
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,590
I'll see Dad this weekend and tell him everything.

677
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,760
About that... Should we tell Kang Hae Joon first?

678
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,560
What does he know?

679
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,560
Not that he'd know anything. I just don't want him to be upset later.

680
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:36,690
Isn't that Kang Hae Joon?

681
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,810
As expected of model Kang.

682
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:46,630
You're just sitting, and it's still a photoshoot.

683
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,770
Hey, extend your leg–

684
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,240
What is it?

685
00:53:03,270 --> 00:53:05,150
Is something wrong?

686
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:09,420
I saw Mom.

687
00:53:14,370 --> 00:53:16,030
Where?

688
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,530
Auntie told me she opened...

689
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,770
a hair salon in Busan.

690
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,410
And?

691
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:31,460
What did she say when she met you?

692
00:53:35,270 --> 00:53:37,190
I didn't meet her.

693
00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:39,740
I only saw her from afar.

694
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:49,900
She smiled brightly...

695
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,250
and seemed to be doing well.

696
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:02,220
Get up.

697
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:05,330
What?

698
00:54:06,130 --> 00:54:09,580
Go ask her why she never contacted you.

699
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,770
If you can't do it alone, I'll come with you.

700
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:13,570
No, I'll do it for you. Get up!

701
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:16,470
Stop acting so pitiful and get up!

702
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,840
Hey, I can't ask her that.

703
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,020
Why can't you?

704
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,040
I'm not prepared to hear her answer.

705
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,780
I'm too scared to ask her.

706
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,150
Let's head inside.

707
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:46,350
Are you hungry? Should we order delivery?

708
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:48,950
You two can eat.

709
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:51,250
I'm a bit tired today.

710
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:59,570
I feel better with both of you, though.

711
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,350
What?

712
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,420
Did you find it?

713
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:33,430
Yeah, the address was in a text from Auntie.

714
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,250
Hae Joon has been–

715
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:56,100
Dad!

716
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:00,690
How did you know about this place?

717
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,480
How did you two...

718
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:36,770
Where did they go?

719
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:46,440
Did I leave this here?

720
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,670
Who is it?

721
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:59,780
So that's why you never contacted Hae Joon?

722
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:02,550
And why you don't plan to in the future?

723
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,140
Yes.

724
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:08,020
If Hae Joon finds out,

725
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,820
you're willing to go wherever?

726
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:17,560
Then why did you have to open this store in Busan?

727
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,270
It just turned out like this.

728
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:25,240
That's not it.

729
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,850
It's because it's close to Hae Joon.

730
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,660
So, does Hae Joon...

731
00:57:34,620 --> 00:57:37,330
Does Hae Joon also know that I'm here?

732
00:57:40,150 --> 00:57:41,820
He doesn't.

733
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:48,530
Kang Hae Joon doesn't know.

734
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:52,220
We came after hearing about it by coincidence.

735
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:56,380
We didn't tell him about coming here...

736
00:57:57,350 --> 00:58:01,130
in case he'd be disappointed.

737
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,760
Is it okay as long as you feel at ease?

738
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,890
What about Kang Hae Joon?

739
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:22,080
Kang Hae Joon lived his entire life in the dark, believing he was just baggage.

740
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:27,080
Ever since you cut him off,

741
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:30,000
he thought he was dead weight to you.

742
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,800
People kept saying my dad took in a charity case!

743
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,950
So he has thought of himself as an outsider for his entire life!

744
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:41,030
Do you even know?

745
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:00,870
Thank you.

746
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:17,690
 Where are you? Are you at the hospital? 

747
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:21,380
 Hurry home. Or call me when you see this. 

748
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:47,280
Gosh, what are you doing, Seo Hyeon?

749
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:50,770
I just want him to...

750
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:58,220
live an ordinary life.

751
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:21,050


752
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:30,200
♫  One day  ♫

753
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:34,200
♫  A precious memory  ♫

754
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:40,920
♫  Entered my small heart the day you smiled brightly  ♫

755
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:43,660
   

756
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:46,480
 You abandoned me, lived happily, and even met a man. 

757
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,190
 Should I not have shown up in your great life? 

758
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:50,100
 How did you find this place? 

759
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:52,480
 - Pretend you never saw me today. 
 - I'm sorry. 

760
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:55,920
 I've made up my mind, and I'm never coming back. 

761
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:58,920
 You even changed the hospital? 

762
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:03,150
 So you'll be selfish until the end and do what you want? 

763
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:05,990
 Must you see me die? 

764
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:09,200
 Take So Hui and go back to Seoul. 

765
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:10,360
 I'm not going. 

766
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,900
 San Ha's mom seemed determined to take San Ha with her. 

767
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,780
 If you're staying here because of me, it's okay. 

768
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:20,460
 I won't say stay by my side or stay here. 

769
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,230
♫  Maybe...   ♫
