1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:12,250


2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,960
   

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,130
   

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,700
   

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,760
   

6
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,830
   

7
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,930
   

8
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,600
- Everyone, isn't it so nice to be outside? 
   - Yes! 

9
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,770
I love it, too!

10
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,380
Wow, the flowers are flying!

11
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:57,410
Oh, it's so pretty! 
    

12
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,310
Who has made pinwheels before?

13
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,730
 Me, me! 

14
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:02,540
Wow, everyone has made it before.

15
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,090
As expected. 
    

16
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:06,350
Everyone! What is this?

17
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,840
 An acorn! 

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,020
That's right. It's an acorn.

19
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,860
"Acorn" is how many syllables? 
  (TN: Acorn - Dotori - is three syllables in Korean) 

20
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,500
 Three! 

21
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,660
We're going to try saying words that have three syllables.

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,170
Ready, go!

23
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,080
 - Me, me!  
 - You can go first.

24
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,770
- Fish. 
 - "Fish." That's right. What about you?

25
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,470
- Cruise ship. 
 - Oh, "Cruise ship."

26
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,370
- Cat. 
 - Okay, "Cat."

27
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,720
- Apartment. 
 - Puppy.

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,820
- Rainbow. 
 - Right!

29
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,180
- Plane. 
 - Squid.

30
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,580
"Squid," that's right!

31
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,240
Oh, how about you, Joo Won?

32
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:52,800
Tre-ee?

33
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,050
"Tree"?

34
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:56,580
"Tree" only has two syllables.

35
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,020
Joo Won.

36
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,670
Pine tree...

37
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,100
Horaebi! 
  (TN: Widower in Korean) 

38
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,800
"Horaebi"?

39
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,170
Teacher, what is a horaebi?

40
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Well, that is...

41
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,810
A horaebi can do anything!

42
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,470
A horaebi can even give you an oppa!

43
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,780
   

44
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,920
- All right! 
 - Joo Won, are you back?

45
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,250
Joo Won, it's your dad.

46
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,130
Daddy!

47
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:47,210
All right.

48
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,040
Thank you.

49
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,410
Are you really a horaebi?

50
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,700
Is it true? Are you really a horaebi?

51
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,270
Ahjusshi, are you really a horaebi?

52
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,700
Ahjusshi, can you really do anything?

53
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,180
Yes.

54
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,790
Then is Joo Won going to have an oppa?

55
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:10,160
Of course! A horaebi can do anything!

56
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,950
Children, sit down and put on your seat belts.

57
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,150
Did someone say that Daddy was a horaebi?

58
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,440
Madam.

59
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,660
Madam!

60
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:42,770
D-Did Madam l-lie?

61
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,310
Well, it isn't exactly a lie,

62
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,830
but it isn't entirely true, either.

63
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,890
   

64
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,600
But Joo Won, must you have an oppa?

65
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,240
You have me.

66
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,840
But you have to sell noodles, you can't play with me.

67
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,870
That's true.

68
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:08,310
I do have to sell noodles.

69
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,230
But you can't suddenly make an oppa appear out of nowhere.

70
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,910
I know that.

71
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,220
You do?

72
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,720
Did Madam tell you that, too?

73
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,150
Yes, she said you needed to go on a blind date.

74
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,130
But Daddy, what is a blind date?

75
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:23,550
She said I needed to go on a blind date?

76
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,220
So what is a blind date?

77
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,530
Blind...

78
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,900
S-Sun! 
  (TN: Sounds like "blind date" in Korean) 

79
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,650
S-u-n, the sun.

80
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,420
It's the sun.

81
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,990
Is it the third floor?

82
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,330
 "Third floor"? 

83
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:46,460
 Yes, we have new neighbors moving in on the third floor. 

84
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,300
- Maybe an oppa is coming, too. 
 - "Oppa"?

85
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,260
- Let's go. 
 - Let's go!

86
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,280
   

87
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,920
It isn't as rural as I'd thought.

88
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,680
- Yes. 
 - It should be rural.

89
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,240
We intentionally moved somewhere nobody would know us.

90
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,580
You are right.

91
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,150
You're right.

92
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,780
- It's oppa! 
 - Oh, there is an oppa.

93
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,340
Oppa!

94
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,600
You moved here, right? On the third floor?

95
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,150
Hello.

96
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,760
It's nice to meet you.

97
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,810
I'm your second-floor neighbor.

98
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,000
Hi.

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,270
Honey, he's our second-floor neighbor.

100
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,140
Hello.

101
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,680
San Ha, say hello, too.

102
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,930
Oh, hi!

103
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,860
San Ha.

104
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,960
Are you sweating?

105
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,440
I don't know if you saw a noodle shop on the way

106
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,200
with lots of stairs before you turn the corner.

107
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,280
I'm the owner of that restaurant.

108
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,760
Come by for some noodles sometime.

109
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,290
I'll treat you to celebrate you moving in.

110
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,110
I guess you're a family of three.

111
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,890
Yes. We're a family of three.

112
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:18,910
A family of two lives on the second floor, and a family of three lives on the third floor.

113
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,850
That's so cool!

114
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,210
It is very cool.

115
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,860
What is so funny?

116
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:31,450
- Pardon? 
 - Is that so funny?

117
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:34,660
I'm asking if a family of three is that funny.

118
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,940
No.

119
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,880
What's with him? So annoying.

120
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,480
The ahjumma is scary.

121
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,080
Yes. She's really scary.

122
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,770
Yes.

123
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,790
What? Should I have laughed along with him?

124
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,230
I'm saying you didn't have to be so rude.

125
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,260
Do you laugh or cry as you see fit?

126
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:14,840
"We were originally a family of four, but we are three now, ha-ha, ho-ho."

127
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,270
Why didn't you say that?

128
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,130
He asked first so he could tell us they're a family of two

129
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,370
so his child wouldn't say she has no mom.

130
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,440
How do you know that?

131
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,780
Why did you want to come to a rural place like this?

132
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:30,540
You hated people whispering about us.

133
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,520
You wanted to live quietly where nobody knew us.

134
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,620
Didn't you say that?

135
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,430
To do that, you should get along with others.

136
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,980
- Let's move again! 
 - To where?

137
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,340
Wherever!

138
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,520
Stop being so unreasonable!

139
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,910
Gosh, darn it!

140
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,290
 Hello. 

141
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,920
 - Let's just end it all! 
 - Gosh, you're driving me nuts! 

142
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,710
 Tomorrow is my first day at work after the transfer. Do you have to do this? 

143
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,170
 That's perfect. 

144
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:00,480
 Then you could quit right away! 

145
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:03,180
Is anyone home?

146
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,580
 We received a report. 

147
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,310
We received a noise complaint...

148
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,110
S-Sergeant.

149
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,640
I didn't know it was your home.

150
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,320
Can I explain everything tomorrow at work?

151
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,810
Oh, okay. Then see you tomorrowâ€“

152
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,400
Is it okay to just go like this?

153
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,600
Since he knows we received a complaint, I'm sure they'll be quiet tonight.

154
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,020
You heard from the chief, right?

155
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,720
Pardon? About what?

156
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,110
They lost their daughter last year, and the three of them moved here.

157
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:45,320
It'd be weirder if their relationship was good.

158
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,870
Make sure to watch your mouth elsewhere.

159
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,600
Is that true?

160
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:54,130
Did they originally have a daughter?

161
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:55,730
Did they have a daughter?

162
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,700
Oh, goodness.

163
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,380
Gosh, I'm so forgetful. I came out while eating dinner.

164
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:08,060
Oh, well, I suppose it could be noisy on the move-in day.

165
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,900
Let's go inside.

166
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,480
- Hurry up and get in. 
 - Okay.

167
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,940
Daddy, what does "losing a daughter" mean?

168
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,800
Joo Won, weren't you sleeping?

169
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:45,770
When you see the family living above us,

170
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,290
let's not talk about younger siblings, okay?

171
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,080
Why not?

172
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:55,520
Joo Won, you get sad when people talk about Mom, right?

173
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,630
Yes.

174
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,290
That's right.

175
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,910
You miss her more even though she's gone now.

176
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,530
- Yes. 
 - It's the same.

177
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:12,710
Ahjusshi, Ahjumma, and Oppa would also be sad if someone talks about Oppa's younger sibling

178
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,510
when she's no longer with them.

179
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,270
Yes, they shouldn't be sad.

180
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:21,790
When you meet Oppa tomorrow, bring him home with you.

181
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,520
I'll make something tasty for you.

182
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,540
"Something tasty"? Like meat?

183
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,070
Okay.

184
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,150
Oppa!

185
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,790
What are you doing?

186
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,500
Do you want to watch TV at my house?

187
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,270
Do you want to watch TV?

188
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,410
It's okay.

189
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,120
I was about to head inside anyway.

190
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,540
Oh, really?

191
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,110
Yes.

192
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,780
Mom isn't really angry. You know that, right?

193
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,340
Is she not angry?

194
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:40,830
When people are really sad, it may seem like they're angry.

195
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,020
You and I shouldn't get angry, okay?

196
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,020
Okay.

197
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,980
You'll get hurt.

198
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,820
Hold this.

199
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:17,830
I wondered why a detective in the Violent Crimes Unit in Seoul

200
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,100
would move to a place like this.

201
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,880
Then again, what family doesn't have problems?

202
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,540
Still, if you see them, don't act like you know.

203
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:35,190
If they moved to a place they knew nobody, they want to put it all in the past.

204
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,840
Aigoo, sometimes, you speak too casually.

205
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,400
You even talked about me being a horaebi to Joo Won.

206
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,310
Aigoo.

207
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:49,090
Did you think you could keep it a secret in such a small neighborhood?

208
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:53,740
Mr. Yoon, does anyone in this neighborhood not know you lost your wife in Seoul

209
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,870
and have been a widower for three years?

210
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,470
Everyone knows!

211
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,310
Whatever it is, you have to speak it aloud.

212
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:07,940
That way, you realize the difficulties you're going through

213
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,010
may not be such a big deal.

214
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:14,890
Still, what happened to their family isn't common.

215
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:20,380
Since you mention it, I heard it happened while only the son was present.

216
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,520
- What? 
 - I heard that

217
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,870
something happened when only the son and daughter were home.

218
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:30,330
So it seems the mom partially blames the son for it.

219
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:33,200
There's such a dark shadow over his face...

220
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,620
 How about an adult? Is there an adult with you? 

221
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:28,300
 No one is here. 

222
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,830
 No one... 

223
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:32,390
 It's okay. It'll be fine. Just wait a little. 

224
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,750
 No one is here... 

225
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,560
What is it?

226
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,530
We have tasty food at my house.

227
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,020
I'm not hungry.

228
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,560
I see, you aren't hungry.

229
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,760
If you get hungry, knock on our door.

230
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,490
Children shouldn't be hungry. Okay?

231
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,860
- Ramen? 
 - Yes.

232
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:37,670
He said he wasn't hungry because he had ramen.

233
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,920
 I heard that something happened when only the son and daughter were home. 

234
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,790
 So it seems the mom partially blames the son for it. 

235
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,070
Joo Won, keep eating.

236
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,460
Daddy, what are you making?

237
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,330
What you also like, Joo Won.

238
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,670
Yukjeon (beef pancake)?

239
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,610
Bingo!

240
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,490
Here.

241
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,330
This is really tasty.

242
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,030
We have more at my house.

243
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:58,940
Oh, nice! It's tasty! It's so good!

244
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,600
That didn't work on him.

245
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:11,260
It's tasty, though.

246
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,100
   

247
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,680
Be well-behaved and polite. You can do that, right?

248
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:50,250
What is this?

249
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:56,200
- All done. 
 - Aigoo, you're here!

250
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,710
Hello.

251
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,530
You look better in person than in your photo.

252
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,380
Is he your son?

253
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,430
- Yes. 
 - Hello!

254
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:09,600
Hi, it must have been tiring for you to come.

255
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,330
It isn't too far from here.

256
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:13,650
Okay. Let's go.

257
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,410
We've almost arrived. It's right there.

258
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:31,330
   

259
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:59,760
What are you doing?

260
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,030
- I know... 
 - You know?

261
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,680
Daddy!

262
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,670
I'm home!

263
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,150
Hi.

264
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,290
Hi.

265
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:40,900
She runs a hair salon in Changwon and has a son.

266
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,590
I'm Kang Seo Hyeon.

267
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,500
Hi. I'm Yoon Jeong Jae.

268
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,610
Aigoo, seriously.

269
00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:54,670
You guys look so good together as if you're one family.

270
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,420
"One family"?

271
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,770
Joo Won, didn't you say you wanted an oppa?

272
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:02,170
- "Oppa"? 
 - Yes.

273
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:08,890
Mr. Yoon needs to marry for you to get a mom and an oppa.

274
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,760
"Mom"?

275
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,960
H-Here is a dry towel.

276
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,800
Thank you.

277
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,570
I don't need a mommy! I only need an oppa!

278
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:34,270
Won't you two need to talk?

279
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:37,440
Joo Won, don't you want to go to the supermarket?

280
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,940
I said I didn't need a mommy!

281
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,240
Aigoo...

282
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,700
You should come, too. Let's go.

283
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,380
- Come on. 
 - I don't want to. Just take him with you!

284
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,970
Come on, let's go.

285
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,640
 I'll buy you something tasty. 

286
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,810
   

287
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:59,600
Don't go anywhere and stay right here, okay?

288
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:05,500
Gosh, my belly hurts. Aigoo, aigoo.

289
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:15,060
Do you go to kindergarten?

290
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,460
Are you seven years old?

291
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:21,270
No, I'm a hundred years old.

292
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,430
Really? Are you a hundred years old?

293
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,120
Don't be like that.

294
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,410
My mom and I rode a bus for over an hour for this blind date.

295
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,310
Did I ask you to come?

296
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,050
What is a blind date?

297
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,810
It means seeing each other's faces before getting married.

298
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,180
I told you my dad wasn't getting married!

299
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,530
Where are you going?

300
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,140
- Home! 
 - Hey!

301
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,180
Children shouldn't go around by themselves.

302
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,340
I'm sorry for suddenly showing up at your house, though we just met.

303
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,150
I see, you're sorry... No, no.

304
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:14,860
You got your clothes wet because of me. I'm so sorry.

305
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:20,830
Your house is quite clean.

306
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,350
It isn't easy for someone running a business to keep a clean house.

307
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:26,870
You usually clean only if something comes up.

308
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,290
Pardon?

309
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,980
Do you cook often?

310
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,120
If you work all day at a restaurant,

311
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,020
you wouldn't want to cook at home, right?

312
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,470
Oh, no.

313
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:43,760
I'm so used to it. I cook breakfast and dinner at home.

314
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,640
It's nothing fancy.

315
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,420
I prepare rice, some side dishes, and soup. Just a few things.

316
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,410
That's still quite impressive.

317
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:57,490
I just never got used to housework or cooking.

318
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:00,680
I feel bad Hae Joon has a mom like me.

319
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:05,820
That works out.

320
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,420
Pardon?

321
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,310
I happen to have some galbi.

322
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,920
Have dinner before you go.

323
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,030
Do you know where you're going?

324
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:21,440
Don't follow me!

325
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,090
Hey, children shouldn't go around by themselves!

326
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,110
You know why he moved here from Seoul, right?

327
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,390
Is there anyone who doesn't know?

328
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,780
I heard they fight about it all the time.

329
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:48,040
My mom said his younger sister died because of him.

330
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,440
- She said not to be friends with him if possible. 
 - Why?

331
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,350
Children with family problems may seem normal on the outside,

332
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:02,020
but there's always something wrong with them once you get closer to them.

333
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,090
Children without moms or dads are like that.

334
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,640
Hey!

335
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,230
Hey!

336
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:14,990
There's nothing wrong with my oppa!

337
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,060
You're the one with a problem!

338
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,410
You're the one with a problem!

339
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,130
How am I the one with a problem?

340
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:24,000
I have both my mom and dad.

341
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,340
Then I guess you must be really stupid.

342
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,640
What? I'm stupid?

343
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:53,180
Don't bother my oppa!

344
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,800
Who do you think you are? How dare you beat up my son like a thug?

345
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,870
- First, let's hear the reasonâ€“ 
 - Aigoo.

346
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:30,150
Is it okay to beat someone up if there's a reason?

347
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,730
Is that how you teach your kids?

348
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,450
I'm sorry.

349
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,710
Joo Won, say you're sorry, too.

350
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,890
Hurry up.

351
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:47,450
Aren't you going to apologize?

352
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:51,740
He first teased Oppa that his younger sister died

353
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:56,990
and said children without a mom or dad were stupid!

354
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,690
I didn't say it like that.

355
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:03,770
But you did say that?

356
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,260
That's what you told me, Mom.

357
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:11,410
You feel sorry for them, but they're unlucky, so I shouldn't be friends with them.

358
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,340
Let's talk for a bit separately.

359
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:20,120
You should apologize before you go.

360
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,680
Pardon?

361
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:26,890
You should apologize to the child for speaking rashly.

362
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,260
Okay. Aigoo, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

363
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,610
You should apologize, too.

364
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,380
Hurry.

365
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,810
I'm sorry.

366
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,470
Are we good now?

367
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,030
If you see me next time, be sure to say hello.

368
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,100
I'll buy you something tasty.

369
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:50,200
I'm sorry. Let's go.

370
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,940
Where are you going?

371
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,450
Pardon?

372
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,150
I'm going home.

373
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,120
Eat dinner at my house before you go.

374
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,630
I made galbi.

375
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,170
"Galbi"?

376
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,530
Galbi!

377
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:23,980
Oppa, let's hurry up and go. Our galbi is very tasty.

378
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:25,720
Let's head inside.

379
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,010
- Okay. 
 - It's really, really good!

380
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,860
- Galbi! 
 - Wow...

381
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,520
Please eat. Eat up!

382
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,030
â™«  How much I missed it  â™«

383
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:45,820
Â­â™«  Never know  â™«

384
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,450
Here.

385
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:57,890
Â­â™«  Everything is spreading red like a sunrise  â™«

386
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:59,700
You, too, San Ha.

387
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:06,720
Â­Â­â™«  The things I followed  â™«

388
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,010
Is it good?

389
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,380
Here.

390
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:24,180
Â­Â­â™«  Looking back, I looked a little like them  â™«

391
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,780
Eat this.

392
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:35,050
Â­â™«  How much I, I missed it  â™«

393
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:39,140
â™«  Beyond the sunrise  â™«

394
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,840
- It's okay. 
 - It's heavier than I had thought.

395
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,100
- I'll carry it for you to the bus stop. 
 - Okay.

396
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,720
Joo Won, can you play with San Ha for a moment?

397
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,450
San Ha, could you stay with Joo Won for a moment?

398
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,920
- Okay. 
 - All right.

399
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,240
Let's go.

400
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,650
Okay.

401
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,240
Do you not like it?

402
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,400
It'd be nice if a pretty ahjumma became your mom.

403
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:43,300
I have a mommy, and my mommy is prettier.

404
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,550
Sorry.

405
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,610
But why are you digging the ground?

406
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,100
I'll give you a present.

407
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,870
"A present"?

408
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,180
It's cute, right?

409
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,820
Don't come near me.

410
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,540
Oppa.

411
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,420
Get away.

412
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:47,640
Should I show you?

413
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,220
I've seen enough.

414
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,160
Not this. My mommy.

415
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,350
What?

416
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,070
What do you think?

417
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,770
She looks like you.

418
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:10,170
I can only look at it when Daddy isn't looking.

419
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:15,230
When I open this to look at it, my dad gets sad.

420
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,560
Why?

421
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,960
Because he can't see her again, even though he misses her.

422
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,510
He told me not to mention your younger sister to you, too.

423
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:30,680
I guess Ahjusshi knows everything.

424
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:35,180
Yes. Because my daddy is a widower, he knows everything.

425
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,210
- Really? 
 - Yes.

426
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:42,240
If you ever miss your younger sister, you can secretly look at her photos.

427
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,270
Do you have a photo of her?

428
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:51,210
Yes, I do.

429
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,720
I see.

430
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,060
This is me.

431
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,070
I'm cute, right?

432
00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:00,220
Really?

433
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,120
Is this you?

434
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,320
Goodbye, Hae Joon.

435
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,000
Does it hurt?

436
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,640
I'm fine.

437
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,800
When we go home, will you make this for me, Mom?

438
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:32,860
Was it good?

439
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,350
It was the first time eating something tastier than bulgogi burger.

440
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:38,440
That means it was really good.

441
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,120
Yes.

442
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,380
Just a moment.

443
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,940
Hello?

444
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,940
Yes, I am Kang Seo Hyeon.

445
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:00,610
 If you ever miss your younger sister, you can secretly look at her photos. 

446
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,860
Should I sing you a lullaby?

447
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,110
I was sleeping...

448
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:03,200
â™ª Sleep tight, my child â™ª

449
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,300
â™ª My Joo Won â™ª

450
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,660
â™ª One, two, sleep tight â™ª

451
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,810
Daddy...

452
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,380
You're not getting married, right?

453
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,330
Of course not.

454
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:30,400
I wouldn't do anything my daughter doesn't like.

455
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,100
   
   

456
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,500
So she changed her phone number?

457
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:50,840
Yes. The old lady kept insisting that the man must have upset her.

458
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:55,350
I said Mr. Yoon isn't like that and that couldn't be the case,

459
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,120
but she said whatever she wanted.

460
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:01,290
So I left the joint fund meeting.

461
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:06,460
You liked that joint fund meeting because they went to popular restaurants.

462
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,700
Don't worry about it. I guess we weren't meant to be.

463
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:14,940
Who changes their number and cuts off all contact

464
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,860
just because a blind date went wrong?

465
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:25,080
There must be some other major issue she's dealing with.

466
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,590
How can I take care of the child by myself?

467
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:31,570
Just take care of him for a short while.

468
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:35,220
I'll come get him as soon as I'm settled in Seoul.

469
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,240
I'll bring your favorite hamburgers when I come back, Hae Joon.

470
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,830
I don't need them.

471
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:46,310
Don't buy anything. Just come back quickly!

472
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,880
I'm leaving now.

473
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,670
Bye.

474
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:44,740
- Hello. 
 - Hi, officers.

475
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:47,430
I guess you've become partners now, haven't you?

476
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,330
- Yes. 
 - Welcome.

477
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:52,710
Please sit down. I'll get you some cold barley tea.

478
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,280
- Two, please. 
 - Okay, two.

479
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,770
Don't fight all the time and be good to her.

480
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:10,020
Madam.

481
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,790
What?

482
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:16,870
This neighborhood is probably less interesting than Seoul.

483
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:22,070
Buy her tasty food, be sensitive, and pay attention to her.

484
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:26,370
No matter how big the issue is, continue to cover it by doing small things.

485
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:29,620
Yes, I'm trying to do that.

486
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:37,100
Joo Won is here.

487
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,250
Daddy, there's a police car outside!

488
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:41,120
Yes.

489
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:44,070
It's the third-floor Ahjusshi.

490
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,870
Ahjusshi, Ahjusshi.

491
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:49,910
Wow...

492
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:52,340
Daddy, Ahjusshi is a police officer.

493
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,560
You should say hello.

494
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,650
Hello, Ahjusshi.

495
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:58,330
Is it okay if Oppa eats at our house today?

496
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,800
He ate at our house last time, too.

497
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,330
San Ha did?

498
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:04,920
We invited him since we were eating anyway.

499
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,790
I'm sure he isn't being fed properly at home.

500
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:12,030
If it isn't too much trouble, please.

501
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:15,280
Of course. It isn't a problem at all.

502
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,390
Ahjusshi says San Ha can eat at our house again.

503
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:19,930
- Really? 
 - Yes.

504
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:24,250
Wow, I'm so excited!

505
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,060
All right.

506
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,270
You're back, San Ha.

507
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,630
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

508
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:37,730
Oppa!

509
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,770
Eat noodles before you go.

510
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,130
Let's go.

511
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,270
All right, let's go inside.

512
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:49,310
   

513
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,500
Hello?

514
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,150
Yes.

515
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:15,090
Seo Hyeon?

516
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:17,940
 Yes. Have you been well? 

517
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:21,800
Oh, yes, yes. How are you?

518
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:28,260
 Who changes their number and cuts off all contact just because a blind date went wrong? 

519
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:33,400
 There must be some other major issue she's dealing with. 

520
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:37,030
Everything is okay, right?

521
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,020
 By chance, well... 

522
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,570
Yes, go on.

523
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,350
 I don't usually say things like this, 

524
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:52,970
 and I can give it back to you once I sell my hair salon... 

525
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,020
 I just need it temporarily... 

526
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,180
Well...

527
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,600
How much do you need?

528
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:13,000
Yes, just a moment.

529
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:18,420
1020...

530
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,320
Hae Joon is fine, right?

531
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:39,130
Ahjusshi.

532
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,470
Why are you outside when it's cold out?

533
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:54,650
Mom called me and said you were coming, Ahjusshi.

534
00:43:58,050 --> 00:43:59,850
What about your aunt?

535
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:12,720
Ahjusshi, should I make you some ramen?

536
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,080
All you need to do is add water.

537
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,140
It's the tastiest thing in the world.

538
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,070
Hae Joon, eat these dumplings

539
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:25,840
while they're still hot.

540
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:27,660
Here.

541
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,560
Thank you.

542
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,840
Aunt.

543
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:45,310
- Hello. 
 - Yes, hello.

544
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,160
I received a text from Unni that you were coming.

545
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,320
My place is a bit of a mess.

546
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,590
It's all right.

547
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:55,440
I'm sorry for coming in when you weren't home.

548
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:57,660
As you know, Unni went to Seoul,

549
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,430
and I have no time to babysit since I'm studying for an exam.

550
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:05,770
But still, Hae Joon eats well by himself and is doing okay.

551
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:09,290
That's right. I'm doing fine by myself.

552
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:14,170
Mom said she would come back quickly after making some money.

553
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:19,080
Really?

554
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:29,800
Then...

555
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:37,350
Then would you like to stay at my house for a bit?

556
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:44,220
Until your mom comes back.

557
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,710
That's okay, right?

558
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,770
My mom, she isn't angry.

559
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:40,400
Is she not?

560
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:44,370
Yes. She's just...

561
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:47,110
very sad.

562
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:51,510
When people are really sad, it may seem like they're angry.

563
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:53,000
Okay.

564
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,750
Yes.

565
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:08,200
 Buy her tasty food, be sensitive, and pay attention to her. 

566
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:23,750
Honey, what's wrong?

567
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:25,630
What happened?

568
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:29,830
Look at this.

569
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:36,620
Did San Ha have this?

570
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:39,000
You know, Honey,

571
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:40,740
I...

572
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,580
can't stop thinking about one thing.

573
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:50,190
You know that San Ha was there, too.

574
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:58,140
He was alone with So Jeong.

575
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,100
What was he doing then?

576
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:06,830
Didn't you ever think about that?

577
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:08,770
 How can you say that? 

578
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:11,280
 Have you never? Really? 

579
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,330
 Have you never thought that before? 

580
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:15,790
 - Come to your senses! 
 - Me? 

581
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:19,370
 The problem is that I'm too sane! 

582
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:21,940
 The problem is I'm so sane that 

583
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,260
 this thought doesn't leave me! 

584
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:27,070
 - Okay, Honeyâ€“ 
 - I wish I was crazy... 

585
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:31,590
 I wish I was crazy and didn't think about any of this! 

586
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:33,330
San Ha was just eight years old!

587
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:36,300
 How could an eight-year-old babysit a child? 

588
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,010
How could it be San Ha's fault?

589
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:40,560
Then whose fault is it?

590
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,030
 It isn't anyone's fault. 

591
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:47,290
 Do you know what's driving me crazy? 

592
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:50,810
 Ever since we moved here, 

593
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:54,100
San Ha is always smiling.

594
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:58,830
 I can't even bring myself to swallow any food, 

595
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:02,240
 but San Ha is stuffing himself with hot food 

596
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,200
 at our neighbor's place downstairs! 

597
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,070
 I just can't stand to see that! 

598
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,960
Please let me go.

599
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:18,070
Please let me go, Honey.

600
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,470
Please let me go, Honey.

601
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,800
Please save me...

602
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:28,290
Mom...

603
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:30,390
Mom, Mom, I'm sorry.

604
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:32,700
I'll never go to the neighbor's place downstairs

605
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,310
or smile, and I won't eat, either.

606
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:38,790
I'm sorry, Mom.

607
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:41,340
Please forgive me...

608
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,770
I'll talk to her. Go to your room.

609
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:46,600
I'll never do that again, please...

610
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:51,300
Mom, I'll never do that again. I'm sorry.

611
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:56,130
Okay? I'll never do that again. Forgive me...

612
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:59,390
I'm sorry...

613
00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:03,840
Mom...

614
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,400
Mom... Mom!

615
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,690
Mom!

616
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:13,630
Mom... Mom.

617
00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:15,680
Mom...

618
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:19,280
I'm sorry...

619
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:22,180
Mom...

620
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:01,950
It's okay.

621
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:07,300
She's angry San Ha upstairs didn't keep his promise to go to the playground.

622
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:09,070
I see.

623
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:11,650
As for this, let's see.

624
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:14,030
And...

625
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,390
once we move these to the balcony,

626
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:18,770
we'll have space to put a bed here.

627
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:20,840
"A bed"?

628
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:25,760
I have to go when my mom comes back, though...

629
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,810
She said she was coming soon.

630
00:51:29,890 --> 00:51:32,050
I'm not buying one.

631
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:35,100
Madam said she would get us one.

632
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,570
Thank you, Ahjusshi.

633
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:41,210
To be honest, Ahjusshi, I wish...

634
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,830
I wish you were my dad.

635
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:01,440
Okay.

636
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,430
- Pardon? 
 - While you're here, I'll be your dad.

637
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,210
Really?

638
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:09,220
That's right.

639
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,850
No!

640
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:13,590
He isn't your dad!

641
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:20,110
No, he isn't.

642
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:22,570
Let's eat dinner.

643
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:43,120
You can eat slowly.

644
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,090
Why did he come?

645
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:50,890
You shouldn't point your finger at Oppa.

646
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:53,420
Hae Joon will be here temporarily.

647
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,520
No!

648
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,370
Go back to your house, you dummy.

649
00:53:00,370 --> 00:53:01,970
I have a mommy.

650
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:04,490
My daddy isn't getting married!

651
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:06,630
That ahjumma is coming along with him.

652
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:09,920
I already know everything!

653
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:25,720
It's okay. Eat up.

654
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:32,250
Yoon Joo Won, I'm going to eat all of this.

655
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:35,320
Don't eat, then.

656
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:01,350
Dad...

657
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,330
Dad...

658
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,170
Why?

659
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:13,820
Anyways,

660
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:18,220
I won't go to your house or the restaurant from now on,

661
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,110
so don't talk to me again.

662
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:21,640
I don't want to.

663
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,520
I said I don't want to.

664
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,490
Ahjumma, where are you going?

665
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:32,580
Oppa can play at our house, right?

666
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:36,800
He can watch TV and eat at our house, right?

667
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,570
Stop it.

668
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:47,720
Is San Ha your oppa?

669
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,320
Yes.

670
00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:55,190
Okay, then.

671
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,470
You can have him.

672
00:54:57,470 --> 00:54:59,430
Yes, that'll work.

673
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,840
Can I have him?

674
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,280
Really?

675
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,560
Then can he just stay at our house?

676
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:09,940
Sure.

677
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:20,550
Wow! Wow! Oppa!

678
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,840
Oppa!

679
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,740
   

680
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:00,830
Take my sword. 
    

681
00:56:00,830 --> 00:56:03,390
 Oppa, let's play, let's play. 

682
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:05,060
Let's play.

683
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,770
Play with me!

684
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:09,970
Let's play.

685
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:13,270
If you don't play with me...

686
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:16,460
Take this!

687
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,860
Take this.

688
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:34,530
Take my sword, you villain.

689
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:45,210
Hey!

690
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:48,060
   

691
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:51,490
It looks yummy.

692
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:53,490
You want to eat it quickly, right?

693
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:54,950
Yes.

694
00:57:11,950 --> 00:57:14,440
- I scared you, right? 
 - Yes.

695
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:55,300
   

696
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:51,470
   
   

697
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:52,810
   

698
00:58:52,810 --> 00:58:54,930
   
   

699
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,630
Dad, tofu!

700
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:03,210
Okay.

701
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,130
The food is ready.

702
00:59:10,070 --> 00:59:12,310
The food's ready!

703
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,480
- Ahjusshi, good morning! 
 - Hey.

704
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,580
Did you sleep well?

705
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:19,700
I couldn't sleep.

706
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:21,840
I had to stay overnight at the precinct.

707
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,650
Aigoo, you've been through a lot.

708
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:25,550
Go upstairs and sleep.

709
00:59:25,550 --> 00:59:27,910
Today's the first day of the semester. We should at least eat together.

710
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:29,140
I sent you the living expenses.

711
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:31,420
Then wash your hands and sit down.

712
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:48,000


713
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,100
What are you doing?

714
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,370
This is the last time.

715
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:59,050
How come I can never get it?

716
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:02,490
Stay still.

717
01:00:02,490 --> 01:00:04,710
And pull it up.

718
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:06,290
Let's eat.

719
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,480
Good morning.

720
01:00:10,730 --> 01:00:13,620
Aigoo, it's nice to eat together.

721
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:16,560
Let's eat.

722
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,920
 Thank you for the meal! 

723
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,160
Yes, this is it.

724
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:28,240
Eat more after you finish that.

725
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:34,330
Everyone, have you thought about

726
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:37,820
the adoption contract I mentioned last time?

727
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:40,990
You still haven't given up on that, have you?

728
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:47,380
Do you even know what an adoption contract is?

729
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:49,310
Of course. If you sign an adoption contract,

730
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:52,790
you're legally a biological parent and child, even if you aren't blood-related.

731
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:55,820
What do you think? Great, right? Nothing's bad about it.

732
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,620
Who will become whose adopted son?

733
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:01,180
   

734
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:03,180
Since Ahjusshi is older,

735
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:05,760
how about you become Ahjusshi's adopted son, Dad?

736
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,090
"Adopted son," she says.

737
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:12,220
I've heard of quantum* physics. 
  (TN: *Homonym of "adopted son" in Korean)   

738
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:14,320
Then, Ahjusshi will be my hyung,

739
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:17,370
and I'll become your uncle.

740
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:20,340
Hey, call me "Uncle."

741
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,850
What? What's wrong with calling him "Uncle"...

742
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,300
The soup is very good today. Eat up.

743
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,460
Anyway,

744
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:43,370
we need to unify our last names.

745
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:48,270
That's the only way I can survive.

746
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,210
   

747
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:59,250
â™«  Back then, we were the world  â™«

748
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:02,980
â™«  Everything existed for us  â™«

749
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:08,600
â™«  Like the sun in the clearest summer sky  â™«

750
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:20,500
â™«  We were dazzling and were united as one  â™«
