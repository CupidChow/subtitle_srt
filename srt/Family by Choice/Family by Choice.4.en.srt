(Incoming call)

9
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:01,755
Breakfast is ready!

10
00:02:02,494 --> 00:02:03,555
I'm coming.

11
00:02:28,744 --> 00:02:30,515
- Let's eat. - Darn you.

12
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:41,724
You didn't sleep well.

13
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:44,994
- Your eyes are puffy. - And bloodshot.

14
00:02:46,635 --> 00:02:49,235
I look pretty good for a guy who gets A-plus in every subject.

15
00:02:52,744 --> 00:02:54,644
You can't lose any more weight.

16
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:56,175
- You should eat well. - Okay.

17
00:02:57,914 --> 00:02:59,343
Hey, it's five passed!

18
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:00,344
- Five passed. - Okay.

19
00:03:00,344 --> 00:03:01,344
- What? - The bus.

20
00:03:01,345 --> 00:03:02,654
- Hey, wait. - Hurry up.

21
00:03:02,714 --> 00:03:04,753
- Okay. - Eat one more each.

22
00:03:04,754 --> 00:03:05,985
Eat some more.

23
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,154
One more?

24
00:03:07,885 --> 00:03:08,924
Move it.

25
00:03:08,925 --> 00:03:10,795
See you. Sorry.

26
00:03:11,025 --> 00:03:12,764
Okay. Have a nice day.

27
00:03:12,765 --> 00:03:14,594
- I will. - See you!

28
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,164
(Episode 4)

29
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:22,305
How can you date someone you don't even know?

30
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,335
I'll figure it out.

31
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,805
Figure it out first, then.

32
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:27,605
What if he's 160cm tall and weighs 100kg?

33
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,275
It's shallow to judge someone by their looks.

34
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:34,085
Will you say something?

35
00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:37,455
- Let her be. - What?

36
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,184
It's such a lovely day.

37
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:43,055
It's a perfect day to fall in love.

38
00:04:02,914 --> 00:04:04,344
- Hello. - Hi.

39
00:04:05,175 --> 00:04:06,783
- What? - I figured it out.

40
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,485
- Figured what out? - "X."

41
00:04:10,055 --> 00:04:11,055
Who is it?

42
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:18,854
What if it's some weirdo?

43
00:04:19,294 --> 00:04:22,765
Do you know why Romeo and Juliet risked taking their own lives?

44
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:26,234
- Why? - Because people...

45
00:04:27,664 --> 00:04:28,864
tried to tear them apart.

46
00:04:30,174 --> 00:04:31,205
I see...

47
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:34,604
Wait up.

48
00:04:36,844 --> 00:04:38,375
Who is it? How did you find out?

49
00:04:38,914 --> 00:04:41,714
Jae Eun and Ki Hun saw him during their morning date.

50
00:04:43,214 --> 00:04:44,913
An early-morning date at school?

51
00:04:44,914 --> 00:04:47,483
They came really early to spend time alone,

52
00:04:47,484 --> 00:04:49,455
but someone was already in the classroom.

53
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:50,525
They didn't know who it was.

54
00:04:50,525 --> 00:04:51,525
(Yoon Ju Won)

55
00:04:51,526 --> 00:04:52,723
They assumed it was a troublemaker.

56
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:54,294
- But? - Sorry.

57
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:57,094
One more look and they recognized him right away.

58
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,635
Hae Jun's younger sister Ju Won.

59
00:05:01,065 --> 00:05:03,604
I know who left the letter on her desk.

60
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:05,204
Do you? Who was it?

61
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,205
What's going on?

62
00:05:13,585 --> 00:05:15,385
- He's so cute. - I love him.

63
00:05:15,645 --> 00:05:17,385
He's class president and smart.

64
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,255
I heard he's handsome and tall too.

65
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:22,525
He entered the top of his year...

66
00:05:22,526 --> 00:05:23,924
and gave a speech at the entrance ceremony.

67
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:25,724
We don't have to tear them apart.

68
00:05:25,895 --> 00:05:26,964
That's all good, then.

69
00:05:29,435 --> 00:05:31,434
- Where are you going? - I can't relax until...

70
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:33,164
I see for myself if he's a good guy.

71
00:05:35,364 --> 00:05:36,674
He's Year 1 Class 1.

72
00:05:56,195 --> 00:05:57,525
His smiley face.

73
00:05:58,054 --> 00:05:59,395
It's pretty enough.

74
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:03,094
Are you sure? Can I ask?

75
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:04,695
There's even a witness.

76
00:06:06,404 --> 00:06:07,734
This might be abrupt,

77
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,104
but I won't shy away.

78
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,375
Good luck.

79
00:06:34,724 --> 00:06:37,065
Did you find out it was me?

80
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:40,364
My gosh.

81
00:06:43,075 --> 00:06:45,404
I was going to tell when I was ready.

82
00:06:47,945 --> 00:06:50,015
It's nice to save time.

83
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:55,284
If you don't have plans, shall we go out to eat today?

84
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:57,455
- You and me? - Yes.

85
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:01,984
Sure. Shall we?

86
00:07:07,664 --> 00:07:10,034
- Not bad. - Not bad, right?

87
00:07:23,544 --> 00:07:25,515
- Thank you. - Enjoy the food.

88
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:47,265
- Is it too spicy? - What?

89
00:07:47,435 --> 00:07:48,635
- Is it too spicy? - Yes.

90
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:50,135
- It's spicy. - Right?

91
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:51,505
It's so spicy.

92
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:52,974
It's spicy.

93
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:55,704
I'm quite full.

94
00:07:55,705 --> 00:07:56,945
Eat lots and lots.

95
00:08:24,034 --> 00:08:25,335
- Ju Won! - What?

96
00:08:25,775 --> 00:08:27,103
- Drink up. - Okay.

97
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:28,875
How do people drink this and eat cake?

98
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,745
It's too sweet for me.

99
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:41,885
You said you take the bus across the road.

100
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:45,054
I can take you home first.

101
00:08:47,395 --> 00:08:49,765
I think you grew up to be bright and cheerful.

102
00:08:50,595 --> 00:08:52,164
I get that a lot.

103
00:08:53,204 --> 00:08:56,204
My mom always said a person's background is important.

104
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,605
You're proof that it's just a stereotype.

105
00:09:00,704 --> 00:09:03,345
What do you mean? I have a great family.

106
00:09:04,975 --> 00:09:06,284
You have a single dad.

107
00:09:08,044 --> 00:09:10,355
Does that mean you have a poor background?

108
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,954
- Do you have both parents? - What?

109
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:22,025
Yes. Most kids do.

110
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,294
- Do you have a big brother? - An older brother?

111
00:09:26,904 --> 00:09:28,834
No. I'm an only child.

112
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:30,804
I have two older brothers.

113
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:33,674
Doesn't that mean I have a better background?

114
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:35,174
We have a bigger headcount.

115
00:09:35,944 --> 00:09:37,975
A bigger headcount?

116
00:09:38,975 --> 00:09:41,784
Is not having a mom my only identity?

117
00:09:42,684 --> 00:09:45,754
If I said to you, "Gosh. As an only child, you should be..."

118
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:49,125
"lonely, selfish, and have a personality disorder,"

119
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:50,924
"but you grew up pretty nicely,"

120
00:09:51,154 --> 00:09:52,154
would you like that?

121
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,025
No.

122
00:09:55,324 --> 00:09:56,434
You don't have to take me home.

123
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:03,934
And don't say hi even if you see me.

124
00:10:24,525 --> 00:10:26,495
Haven't you heard from your mom yet?

125
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:29,194
No.

126
00:10:29,265 --> 00:10:31,164
What kind of assortment is this?

127
00:10:31,495 --> 00:10:32,735
I know, right?

128
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:36,334
You're all so unfortunate.

129
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:40,174
My mom always said a person's background is important.

130
00:10:40,745 --> 00:10:42,145
You have a single dad.

131
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:48,645
I don't live in poor circumstances.

132
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:52,485
We're special...

133
00:10:54,084 --> 00:10:55,525
in our own way.

134
00:11:18,975 --> 00:11:21,284
He has a great personality, so he has lots of friends,

135
00:11:21,485 --> 00:11:23,684
and he's good-looking and is as tall as me.

136
00:11:24,554 --> 00:11:25,583
Really?

137
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,584
Where did such a cutie come from?

138
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,424
People would think you have a boyfriend.

139
00:11:30,824 --> 00:11:32,824
What's wrong? You don't like him?

140
00:11:34,294 --> 00:11:36,595
You can never tell a person from their looks.

141
00:11:37,135 --> 00:11:39,803
If she's not home yet, it means they're getting along.

142
00:11:39,804 --> 00:11:41,404
Yoon Ju Won got really lucky.

143
00:11:42,865 --> 00:11:44,673
Call and see if she's almost home.

144
00:11:44,674 --> 00:11:45,674
Okay.

145
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,775
I'm home.

146
00:11:58,414 --> 00:11:59,454
Thanks for the food.

147
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:02,783
You said you'd come home after dinner.

148
00:12:02,784 --> 00:12:04,653
We had tteokbokki. That's not dinner.

149
00:12:04,654 --> 00:12:05,794
Why are you home already?

150
00:12:06,595 --> 00:12:07,694
I guess...

151
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:09,894
she didn't like him that much.

152
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,095
What's there not to like? How did it go?

153
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:14,365
We decided to call it quits.

154
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,005
What for? Why would you do that?

155
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:22,145
Did you...

156
00:12:23,615 --> 00:12:25,044
go all gluttony around him?

157
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:28,985
Then what?

158
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:32,184
He doesn't like sweet stuff.

159
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,095
Tteokbokki? So he rinses it in water.

160
00:12:37,525 --> 00:12:39,994
The carrots in gimbap? So he picks it all out.

161
00:12:39,995 --> 00:12:40,995
But...

162
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:46,934
He doesn't eat cake.

163
00:12:48,704 --> 00:12:51,174
There was a cabinet full of cakes right there.

164
00:12:51,475 --> 00:12:53,074
That cafe is known for its cakes.

165
00:12:54,105 --> 00:12:56,204
Do you believe that? Do you?

166
00:12:56,914 --> 00:12:59,215
You don't believe it, do you?

167
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,154
- What? - You call that a reason?

168
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,485
You're being picky.

169
00:13:07,924 --> 00:13:09,424
You're not ready to date yet.

170
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,125
How so?

171
00:13:11,454 --> 00:13:14,124
The kid lacks some serious sense.

172
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:15,365
- Right? - Yes.

173
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,164
Are you serious?

174
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,664
You date him if you like him that much.

175
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:24,904
- Is that all? - Yes.

176
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:26,404
That's all.

177
00:13:34,115 --> 00:13:35,715
You said all you wanted was a pretty smile.

178
00:13:36,145 --> 00:13:37,154
Yes.

179
00:13:38,454 --> 00:13:39,954
You said his smile was pretty enough.

180
00:13:40,855 --> 00:13:42,054
Yes.

181
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:44,894
You rejected Jun Ho?

182
00:13:44,895 --> 00:13:46,124
She has high standards.

183
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,395
Because she always hangs out with her brothers.

184
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,395
I can't believe he got rejected by Ju Won.

185
00:13:50,595 --> 00:13:52,164
He's not the Jun Ho we knew.

186
00:13:52,434 --> 00:13:54,465
What's wrong with Ju Won?

187
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:59,135
You talk as if you all have boyfriends.

188
00:14:02,304 --> 00:14:04,615
Hey. What is wrong with Ju Won?

189
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:06,215
It's fine. Let them be.

190
00:14:06,715 --> 00:14:08,745
Hey, it's Jun Ho.

191
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:10,214
Jun Ho is here.

192
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:11,953
- Why is he here? - Didn't she reject him?

193
00:14:11,954 --> 00:14:12,954
What's going on?

194
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:17,095
It's Lee Jun Ho.

195
00:14:19,324 --> 00:14:20,365
I'm sorry.

196
00:14:23,595 --> 00:14:25,635
We can start off as friends.

197
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:27,765
I'd like you to reconsider.

198
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:33,904
Did you tell anyone what we said at the bus stop?

199
00:14:38,174 --> 00:14:40,944
If you didn't tell anyone, I'll think about it.

200
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,215
Okay.

201
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:52,054
At the bus stop?

202
00:14:52,794 --> 00:14:53,824
What did you talk about?

203
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:55,625
Just some stuff.

204
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:57,834
Hey!

205
00:14:59,934 --> 00:15:01,005
What was it?

206
00:15:23,084 --> 00:15:24,454
Start from friends? As if.

207
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:26,624
Don't give him hope.

208
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,265
Just tell him straight out that you don't like him.

209
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:30,394
I'll figure it out. Mind your own business.

210
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:31,635
You told us not to hold anything back.

211
00:15:32,034 --> 00:15:33,135
You should be honest too.

212
00:15:33,204 --> 00:15:34,604
I said we should tell each other everything.

213
00:15:34,605 --> 00:15:37,434
I never said we should meddle in each other's business.

214
00:15:48,245 --> 00:15:51,715
(Haedong High School)

215
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:58,294
You didn't answer your phone.

216
00:16:04,395 --> 00:16:05,395
Get going.

217
00:16:33,924 --> 00:16:36,025
You haven't changed one bit, so I recognized you right away.

218
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:44,775
You must be surprised to see me out of the blue.

219
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:48,745
You called me so I wouldn't be surprised.

220
00:16:50,775 --> 00:16:52,345
You're still quick-witted, just like before.

221
00:16:53,745 --> 00:16:54,814
I didn't pick up.

222
00:16:56,385 --> 00:16:58,684
Couldn't you have caught on that I didn't want to answer your call?

223
00:17:04,755 --> 00:17:06,863
I've been neglecting you, haven't I?

224
00:17:06,864 --> 00:17:08,225
I understand you were disappointed.

225
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:10,334
"Disappointed?"

226
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:13,864
You didn't call me once in the past ten years.

227
00:17:15,005 --> 00:17:16,304
You didn't even answer my calls.

228
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:20,643
I'll be in Busan until this winter.

229
00:17:20,644 --> 00:17:22,405
It's close, so I'll come and see you with So Hee.

230
00:17:23,415 --> 00:17:25,814
Right, you've never met So Hee.

231
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:28,445
She's seven now.

232
00:17:29,144 --> 00:17:31,254
You two are siblings, but you guys haven't even met.

233
00:17:31,255 --> 00:17:33,254
It makes no sense, right?

234
00:17:33,255 --> 00:17:34,725
Don't talk like it's someone else's fault.

235
00:17:35,925 --> 00:17:37,824
You're the one who never even tried to introduce us.

236
00:17:45,894 --> 00:17:47,304
He looks just like her.

237
00:17:48,564 --> 00:17:51,175
In what way? I don't see the resemblance at all.

238
00:17:52,074 --> 00:17:53,544
Anyway, how did you call me here?

239
00:17:54,104 --> 00:17:55,675
We should rescue him together if need be.

240
00:18:02,284 --> 00:18:03,883
Hey, why would we need to rescue him?

241
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:05,455
Don't bother them. Let's just go.

242
00:18:06,415 --> 00:18:08,553
You can go if you want. I'm staying.

243
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,655
Do whatever you want, then.

244
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:12,354
What's with him?

245
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:20,735
Must you be like this when you haven't seen me in ten years?

246
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:21,834
Yes, exactly.

247
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:24,104
Why did you suddenly show up after ten years?

248
00:18:24,634 --> 00:18:25,874
To forgive you.

249
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,175
To try to forgive you.

250
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,215
Forgive me, for what?

251
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:54,534
Bye.

252
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:07,784
Don't say things you'll regret later.

253
00:19:08,215 --> 00:19:10,515
If you're mean to your own parents, you'll get it all back later on.

254
00:19:10,685 --> 00:19:11,685
From who?

255
00:19:11,755 --> 00:19:12,955
Get what back? And why?

256
00:19:14,124 --> 00:19:15,324
Why would I get it back?

257
00:19:15,824 --> 00:19:18,324
I'll get punished for not welcoming my mom who abandoned her own son?

258
00:19:19,255 --> 00:19:20,265
You'll try to forgive me?

259
00:19:20,965 --> 00:19:22,464
What wrong have I done to you?

260
00:19:22,465 --> 00:19:23,864
Are you going to keep playing dumb?

261
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:27,104
You and So Jung.

262
00:19:28,564 --> 00:19:29,765
You two were alone in the house.

263
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,544
San Ha was with her.

264
00:19:38,945 --> 00:19:40,584
He and So Jung were home alone.

265
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,515
What was he doing?

266
00:19:44,655 --> 00:19:45,655
What?

267
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,685
How could you...

268
00:19:50,054 --> 00:19:51,255
bring up So Jung now?

269
00:19:54,364 --> 00:19:55,525
Why did you make me do it?

270
00:19:59,794 --> 00:20:01,905
If you're done talking, I'll say what I have to say.

271
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:05,334
Grandma calls us too often.

272
00:20:06,304 --> 00:20:07,704
I hope she can try to call us less often.

273
00:20:07,705 --> 00:20:09,005
I came here to say this.

274
00:20:09,874 --> 00:20:11,275
Do you think she'll listen to me?

275
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:17,415
I hope you can be happy.

276
00:20:19,614 --> 00:20:21,084
I wish you well.

277
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:35,804
Are you all right?

278
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:39,304
I'm fine.

279
00:20:47,344 --> 00:20:48,415
You hope I can be happy...

280
00:20:49,445 --> 00:20:51,255
and wish me well?

281
00:21:39,265 --> 00:21:41,834
Mom, Dad...

282
00:22:10,965 --> 00:22:11,965
I didn't see it.

283
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:15,064
You didn't see it? Do you want to die?

284
00:22:17,534 --> 00:22:19,334
Why talk like you want me dead when you just saved me?

285
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:21,604
Don't smile.

286
00:22:21,874 --> 00:22:23,715
How can you smile right now?

287
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:27,114
Look at me.

288
00:22:28,384 --> 00:22:31,314
Tears are welling up in my eyes because I was so scared.

289
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:37,455
Aren't you a bit too old to cry on the street?

290
00:22:37,725 --> 00:22:39,255
Whose fault is it?

291
00:22:39,425 --> 00:22:41,864
Even little kids know not to cross under the red light.

292
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:43,935
You didn't even notice the red light.

293
00:22:44,735 --> 00:22:46,864
Who tried to cross the street at the red light?

294
00:22:47,134 --> 00:22:48,735
Whose fault was it?

295
00:22:50,505 --> 00:22:51,935
You'll rip my sleeve.

296
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:57,144
What did she say?

297
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:01,445
You promised to tell me everything.

298
00:23:02,784 --> 00:23:04,114
That you wouldn't keep secrets.

299
00:23:06,655 --> 00:23:07,725
I got scolded.

300
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,054
What?

301
00:23:11,794 --> 00:23:13,195
How did she scold you?

302
00:23:15,364 --> 00:23:16,564
She said I'd be punished.

303
00:23:17,495 --> 00:23:18,495
"Punished?"

304
00:23:21,104 --> 00:23:22,165
She's right about that.

305
00:23:22,604 --> 00:23:24,975
You make fun of me and Hae Jun all the time.

306
00:23:25,675 --> 00:23:27,775
The other day, you clicked your tongue at my report card.

307
00:23:28,104 --> 00:23:31,044
You sure will be punished for making fun of others like that.

308
00:23:31,475 --> 00:23:33,344
No. I want you to be punished.

309
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,084
Goodness.

310
00:23:43,624 --> 00:23:46,425
I used up all my calories to save someone's life.

311
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,364
Should we go and have some cake?

312
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:52,465
No, a burger first.

313
00:23:59,275 --> 00:24:00,374
- Is it good? - Yes.

314
00:24:04,374 --> 00:24:05,715
Eat one at a time.

315
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:11,685
Come on.

316
00:24:17,324 --> 00:24:18,324
Shall we have this one?

317
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:19,725
This one?

318
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:22,894
That one?

319
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:29,965
- Let's have this one here. - Okay!

320
00:24:30,405 --> 00:24:31,435
This here.

321
00:24:39,114 --> 00:24:41,215
- Is it good? - This place is very famous.

322
00:24:41,415 --> 00:24:42,985
People come from far away to eat this.

323
00:24:43,384 --> 00:24:44,455
This is crazy good.

324
00:24:50,354 --> 00:24:51,425
How is it?

325
00:24:52,294 --> 00:24:54,925
- It's nice. - No, not just "nice."

326
00:24:56,425 --> 00:24:57,534
It's delicious.

327
00:24:58,465 --> 00:25:00,804
Yes, it's delicious.

328
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:03,534
All right.

329
00:25:05,834 --> 00:25:06,874
It's so good.

330
00:25:09,604 --> 00:25:12,343
I asked him to leave because he left sand everywhere.

331
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,344
Right, I understand.

332
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,883
What did I do? I shook off the sand before I walked in!

333
00:25:15,884 --> 00:25:17,014
Right, I understand.

334
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,154
- My goodness. - I'm so sick of it.

335
00:25:18,155 --> 00:25:19,684
I keep cleaning, but people come and make a mess.

336
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:21,455
- Right. - Whatever, I'm leaving. Okay?

337
00:25:21,824 --> 00:25:23,225
Good grief.

338
00:25:23,354 --> 00:25:24,955
- What is her problem? - Have a good day.

339
00:25:25,225 --> 00:25:26,425
Oh, he left.

340
00:25:27,195 --> 00:25:28,725
- Thank you. Have a good day. - You too.

341
00:25:29,824 --> 00:25:30,834
Take care.

342
00:25:37,175 --> 00:25:40,205
Why does everyone get offended so easily?

343
00:25:40,945 --> 00:25:42,745
I'm just glad it didn't turn into a big fight.

344
00:25:43,505 --> 00:25:44,614
It's quite fascinating, isn't it?

345
00:25:45,344 --> 00:25:46,975
The resentment goes away when someone listens to them.

346
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:55,655
Someone is standing there.

347
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:00,725
Hello.

348
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:03,425
How may we help you?

349
00:26:04,534 --> 00:26:05,534
I'm here to...

350
00:26:13,304 --> 00:26:14,475
Have you eaten yet?

351
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:16,175
I'm hungry.

352
00:26:40,364 --> 00:26:43,364
This is the best restaurant in the area.

353
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,435
They only use homegrown ingredients.

354
00:26:47,275 --> 00:26:49,175
See? Everything's homegrown.

355
00:26:56,584 --> 00:26:58,084
So? What brings you here?

356
00:26:59,015 --> 00:27:01,124
My husband opened a second clinic in Busan.

357
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:03,454
The family will live in Busan...

358
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,123
until things are established at the clinic.

359
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,195
Really?

360
00:27:06,995 --> 00:27:09,695
Yes. I was worried about So Hee's kindergarten,

361
00:27:10,394 --> 00:27:12,093
so I thought So Hee and I should stay in Seoul,

362
00:27:12,094 --> 00:27:15,304
but my husband said a family should never be separated.

363
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:27,215
Right, a family should live together.

364
00:27:29,185 --> 00:27:30,245
Good for you.

365
00:27:34,624 --> 00:27:35,985
I met San Ha earlier.

366
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,495
I told him I wanted to stay in touch.

367
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:43,995
What did he say?

368
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,074
I guess you thought he'd be happy to hear that.

369
00:27:52,134 --> 00:27:54,175
You know I am doing this for San Ha's sake.

370
00:27:54,775 --> 00:27:56,274
You need to think about his future too.

371
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:58,175
Will you keep neglecting a high school senior like this?

372
00:27:58,574 --> 00:27:59,574
If I take him to Seoul,

373
00:27:59,575 --> 00:28:01,745
I can have him meet some college admission consultants...

374
00:28:02,844 --> 00:28:04,715
You abandoned him. How could you say that now?

375
00:28:06,515 --> 00:28:08,383
San Ha is old enough to understand me now.

376
00:28:08,384 --> 00:28:11,195
Do you understand everything now that you're older?

377
00:28:11,394 --> 00:28:13,354
You suddenly understand those you couldn't understand before?

378
00:28:15,124 --> 00:28:17,594
What? "A family shouldn't be separated"?

379
00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:22,104
A husband and wife...

380
00:28:23,165 --> 00:28:24,405
become strangers once divorced.

381
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:26,604
But what about your child?

382
00:28:27,675 --> 00:28:29,143
When you left us to live your life,

383
00:28:29,144 --> 00:28:30,745
did you not consider San Ha your son?

384
00:28:31,745 --> 00:28:34,344
He never said it, but he waited for your call!

385
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:39,015
- He waited for your call... - He has turned into a rude brat.

386
00:28:39,455 --> 00:28:41,353
Then what? Does he always have to be an angel...

387
00:28:41,354 --> 00:28:42,623
who obeys his mom no matter what?

388
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,623
Why? Why does San Ha have to understand you?

389
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:47,364
Can't you try to understand him?

390
00:28:47,624 --> 00:28:48,965
I mean, you are his mom.

391
00:28:49,165 --> 00:28:52,394
"I understand why he's being like this." Why can't you think that?

392
00:28:53,935 --> 00:28:55,964
Even if we hate each other, I am his mom, and he is my child.

393
00:28:55,965 --> 00:28:57,033
Why didn't you say that ten years ago?

394
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:59,533
It's all in the past! What do you want me to do about it?

395
00:28:59,534 --> 00:29:00,775
Goodness. It's so convenient for you.

396
00:29:01,344 --> 00:29:03,705
I have to say, I wish I could think like you.

397
00:29:05,574 --> 00:29:06,574
Oh, dear.

398
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:09,584
(10 dollars)

399
00:29:40,275 --> 00:29:41,884
Can't you just leave San Ha alone?

400
00:29:42,945 --> 00:29:45,215
He still suddenly wakes up in the middle of the night.

401
00:29:48,025 --> 00:29:49,124
Darn it!

402
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,333
The child's opinion does matter,

403
00:29:59,334 --> 00:30:01,465
but his biological father does have the upper hand legally.

404
00:30:01,864 --> 00:30:02,905
It won't be easy.

405
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:08,945
(Law Office ANDA)

406
00:30:19,854 --> 00:30:20,985
Would you like some jujube?

407
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:22,853
How much is it?

408
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:25,094
It's three dollars. I'll give you a lot.

409
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,824
Okay then.

410
00:30:37,165 --> 00:30:38,175
Hello?

411
00:30:56,084 --> 00:30:58,495
I'm going on a date today.

412
00:30:58,854 --> 00:31:00,353
Go ahead.

413
00:31:00,354 --> 00:31:01,394
- I'll take care of it. - Thanks.

414
00:31:03,965 --> 00:31:04,995
Go.

415
00:31:10,975 --> 00:31:11,975
Sir.

416
00:31:13,634 --> 00:31:17,675
His ex-wife came today.

417
00:31:21,044 --> 00:31:22,044
Okay.

418
00:31:34,965 --> 00:31:36,064
These are jujubes.

419
00:31:37,894 --> 00:31:39,634
San Ha hasn't been sleeping well these days.

420
00:31:39,995 --> 00:31:41,765
Jujube tea...

421
00:31:42,435 --> 00:31:44,064
helps you sleep well at night without waking up.

422
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:46,604
Oh, my. Thank you.

423
00:31:48,505 --> 00:31:50,405
Both Hae Jun and San Ha...

424
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:52,774
will go to college and become adults next year.

425
00:31:52,775 --> 00:31:54,114
Why are they making a fuss now?

426
00:32:08,064 --> 00:32:09,265
Did she see San Ha as well?

427
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:15,935
Is he all right?

428
00:32:17,005 --> 00:32:18,104
I didn't ask.

429
00:32:22,475 --> 00:32:23,574
Why not?

430
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,945
He and I...

431
00:32:30,884 --> 00:32:33,554
don't talk about his mom for no reason.

432
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:37,695
You should now.

433
00:32:38,995 --> 00:32:41,195
Why do you guys not talk about important matters?

434
00:32:42,465 --> 00:32:43,995
You keep avoiding it like that.

435
00:32:44,894 --> 00:32:46,495
That's why he doesn't expect anything from you.

436
00:32:52,874 --> 00:32:53,975
What did I do?

437
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:59,043
He's not even 20.

438
00:32:59,044 --> 00:33:01,015
But he's already acting like an adult because of someone.

439
00:33:02,015 --> 00:33:04,185
Sit with him and have a proper conversation.

440
00:33:06,814 --> 00:33:09,225
About what? There's nothing to ask.

441
00:33:09,425 --> 00:33:11,995
Did I tell you to interrogate or question a criminal?

442
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:15,465
Ask how he feels and if he's okay.

443
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:19,965
Just asking him will make him feel a lot better.

444
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:23,033
Your job is to listen to everyone's complaints.

445
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:25,074
Why can't you listen to your child's?

446
00:33:29,705 --> 00:33:32,215
- Do you get it? - I get it.

447
00:33:35,185 --> 00:33:37,044
Don't make a scene and get up. Let's go.

448
00:33:45,255 --> 00:33:47,624
- Thank you. - Bye.

449
00:33:53,294 --> 00:33:54,304
Are you not coming?

450
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:56,965
Stay here if you want to walk home.

451
00:34:19,494 --> 00:34:21,494
- Mom! - So Hee.

452
00:34:22,325 --> 00:34:24,123
It was your first day in the kindergarten. How was it?

453
00:34:24,124 --> 00:34:25,235
Did it go well?

454
00:34:25,535 --> 00:34:26,695
What did San Ha say?

455
00:34:27,035 --> 00:34:28,604
Can I go meet him?

456
00:34:29,135 --> 00:34:31,175
If you show up unexpectedly, he'll be surprised.

457
00:34:31,434 --> 00:34:35,544
I told him you missed him in advance.

458
00:34:35,704 --> 00:34:38,115
Does he want to see me?

459
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:41,445
Of course, he does.

460
00:34:48,224 --> 00:34:51,425
If it's too bitter, add a little bit of water.

461
00:34:51,825 --> 00:34:54,224
If you add too much, you'll go to the bathroom many times at night.

462
00:34:54,764 --> 00:34:56,664
How about Mr. Kim? Are you not giving to him?

463
00:34:57,465 --> 00:34:58,465
No.

464
00:34:58,695 --> 00:35:00,595
He'll only stop drinking when he has a sour stomach.

465
00:35:03,104 --> 00:35:05,505
This won't do. Have a cup of tea right now.

466
00:35:18,985 --> 00:35:20,385
Why did he drink after a while?

467
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:23,255
She visited him too, right?

468
00:35:24,394 --> 00:35:25,394
Your mother?

469
00:35:27,325 --> 00:35:28,724
What did she say to him?

470
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:30,494
What did she say to make him drink?

471
00:35:30,664 --> 00:35:32,164
Why do you ask?

472
00:35:32,894 --> 00:35:34,905
It's something between San Ha and him.

473
00:35:35,204 --> 00:35:37,103
It's nice to talk with many people.

474
00:35:37,104 --> 00:35:38,104
Is it really necessary to make such a fuss...

475
00:35:38,105 --> 00:35:39,235
just because a mother came to visit her son?

476
00:35:41,044 --> 00:35:42,075
Why are you mad?

477
00:35:42,544 --> 00:35:44,744
Me? I'm not mad.

478
00:35:47,675 --> 00:35:49,985
I told her not to come.

479
00:35:50,644 --> 00:35:53,255
I'll tell my dad too.

480
00:35:53,555 --> 00:35:54,854
No, but still...

481
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:58,755
Are you happy now?

482
00:36:16,204 --> 00:36:17,544
Let the two of them talk it out.

483
00:36:19,715 --> 00:36:21,715
It's because Hae Jun is missing his mother.

484
00:36:25,314 --> 00:36:27,584
Why did you ask if I was happy?

485
00:36:27,925 --> 00:36:30,025
What does it mean?

486
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:31,954
There's no need to be jealous.

487
00:36:32,854 --> 00:36:34,465
Why would I be jealous of you?

488
00:36:35,095 --> 00:36:37,365
That's what I'm saying. You don't have to be jealous.

489
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:44,674
Mom is still blaming me for So Jung's death.

490
00:36:44,675 --> 00:36:46,674
And I want to let her think that way.

491
00:36:46,675 --> 00:36:47,974
So that she can keep blaming it on me.

492
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:55,385
There was a reason she didn't come home for two days.

493
00:36:57,244 --> 00:36:59,813
She didn't know there was nothing to eat at home.

494
00:36:59,814 --> 00:37:00,814
I just...

495
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,755
I just want to keep it that way.

496
00:37:11,695 --> 00:37:12,894
What if we keep in touch?

497
00:37:15,635 --> 00:37:18,275
What if I can't hold back and tell her what happened at that time?

498
00:37:23,044 --> 00:37:24,144
But she's still your mother...

499
00:37:27,314 --> 00:37:28,314
and you're her son.

500
00:37:28,315 --> 00:37:31,615
There are families that are toxic to each other,

501
00:37:32,555 --> 00:37:34,155
like she and I.

502
00:37:37,925 --> 00:37:38,925
Sorry.

503
00:37:40,124 --> 00:37:41,794
Were you happy when you found our biological father?

504
00:37:42,965 --> 00:37:44,965
Did you think, "He's still my father and I'm his son"?

505
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:48,365
You don't have to be jealous of me.

506
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:55,644
You always upset me when I'm about to feel sorry.

507
00:37:56,544 --> 00:37:57,544
Go.

508
00:37:59,115 --> 00:38:00,215
You must be kidding.

509
00:38:01,144 --> 00:38:02,583
I don't even remember how my mother looks.

510
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:03,885
I'm so sad.

511
00:38:07,514 --> 00:38:09,084
Let's go and get ice cream.

512
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:28,405
Why?

513
00:38:28,744 --> 00:38:29,905
I don't want to join you.

514
00:38:32,845 --> 00:38:33,845
Leave him alone.

515
00:38:34,644 --> 00:38:36,744
Ice cream won't make him feel better.

516
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:40,184
What makes him feel better then?

517
00:38:42,055 --> 00:38:45,494
You should have some sugar when you're sad. It's the truth.

518
00:38:47,195 --> 00:38:48,525
How is it? Don't you feel better?

519
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:50,695
Yes.

520
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,603
My dad said Hae Jun was acting like that...

521
00:38:54,604 --> 00:38:56,604
because he missed his mother.

522
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:00,974
- I know. - You know?

523
00:39:01,945 --> 00:39:04,305
He answers all the spam calls...

524
00:39:04,744 --> 00:39:07,075
- just in case. - Right.

525
00:39:08,684 --> 00:39:11,385
He's too tender-hearted to survive in the harsh world.

526
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:14,825
You're worried about him.

527
00:39:15,655 --> 00:39:17,954
Let me tell you in advance. You don't have to worry about me.

528
00:39:18,724 --> 00:39:21,464
People in the town talk about how miserable we are,

529
00:39:21,465 --> 00:39:22,965
but I don't care at all.

530
00:39:23,664 --> 00:39:25,735
"She's bright for a girl who doesn't have a mother"?

531
00:39:26,635 --> 00:39:28,334
It doesn't bother me at all.

532
00:39:28,764 --> 00:39:30,965
Should I have to cry, realizing I don't have a mother...

533
00:39:31,204 --> 00:39:32,934
even when I find something hilarious?

534
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:34,775
That's ridiculous.

535
00:39:38,244 --> 00:39:39,244
Why?

536
00:39:39,245 --> 00:39:41,285
Who said you were bright for a girl who didn't have a mother?

537
00:39:43,985 --> 00:39:45,454
It's just an example.

538
00:39:45,785 --> 00:39:47,814
You know I naturally smile.

539
00:39:54,195 --> 00:39:55,264
This is nice.

540
00:40:03,905 --> 00:40:05,675
Mr. Yoon made it just for me.

541
00:40:06,305 --> 00:40:07,334
Really?

542
00:40:10,104 --> 00:40:12,945
There's a lot in Ju Won's house. I can bring it again.

543
00:40:13,014 --> 00:40:15,044
- Okay then. - Good night.

544
00:40:16,044 --> 00:40:17,044
Well...

545
00:40:18,184 --> 00:40:19,184
Is there anything...

546
00:40:20,255 --> 00:40:21,485
bothering you?

547
00:40:25,155 --> 00:40:26,624
I heard you had met Mom.

548
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,465
I told her not to come.

549
00:40:35,235 --> 00:40:36,334
Did she say she wouldn't?

550
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:45,974
I'll talk with her again so that she won't bother you anymore.

551
00:40:46,775 --> 00:40:47,974
Don't worry.

552
00:40:49,485 --> 00:40:50,584
Go to bed.

553
00:40:52,584 --> 00:40:53,584
Good night.

554
00:41:02,224 --> 00:41:04,124
Eat your ice cream.

555
00:41:04,735 --> 00:41:06,635
You won't be able to eat it if you don't eat it now.

556
00:41:09,104 --> 00:41:11,704
Are you crying? Is that why you can't open the door?

557
00:41:16,345 --> 00:41:17,404
If you open the door now,

558
00:41:17,405 --> 00:41:19,014
I'll fold all the laundry next week.

559
00:41:23,184 --> 00:41:24,184
Make up with him.

560
00:41:24,445 --> 00:41:26,255
I know you don't want to fight with him. Why are you doing this?

561
00:41:29,325 --> 00:41:30,824
Come out and eat it.

562
00:41:30,825 --> 00:41:32,525
Don't eat it while crying alone.

563
00:41:33,655 --> 00:41:35,064
You should brush your teeth too.

564
00:41:38,264 --> 00:41:39,564
I'm sick of you.

565
00:41:41,604 --> 00:41:42,604
My goodness.

566
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:44,535
My gosh.

567
00:41:45,735 --> 00:41:48,544
How can he not like me just because I didn't raise him?

568
00:41:48,604 --> 00:41:50,604
What about my genes?

569
00:41:51,005 --> 00:41:53,514
Would he have been born without me?

570
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:56,544
He's tall thanks to me.

571
00:41:57,084 --> 00:42:00,413
Sir, if money doesn't work,

572
00:42:00,414 --> 00:42:02,525
how about approaching him in a different way?

573
00:42:03,255 --> 00:42:05,494
- A different way? - Yes.

574
00:42:06,425 --> 00:42:07,425
Like...

575
00:42:08,465 --> 00:42:10,264
embrace him.

576
00:42:10,664 --> 00:42:12,664
Right. Like the sunlight.

577
00:42:14,135 --> 00:42:15,135
The sunlight?

578
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:20,905
The sunlight?

579
00:42:22,644 --> 00:42:26,115
(Haedong High School)

580
00:42:33,854 --> 00:42:34,854
Hello.

581
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:38,224
- Do you know me? - You're Ju Won's brother.

582
00:42:41,664 --> 00:42:42,865
She's still a child.

583
00:42:43,095 --> 00:42:45,595
She's not mentally old enough to have a boyfriend.

584
00:42:46,794 --> 00:42:48,305
Just be her friend.

585
00:42:49,064 --> 00:42:50,135
Do you understand?

586
00:42:55,474 --> 00:42:56,974
What do you like about her?

587
00:42:58,044 --> 00:42:59,244
You don't even know each other well.

588
00:43:00,115 --> 00:43:02,014
She's such a bright girl.

589
00:43:08,454 --> 00:43:09,525
Hey. Hold on.

590
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:14,724
Did you tell her?

591
00:43:15,764 --> 00:43:16,764
About what?

592
00:43:18,695 --> 00:43:21,434
Did you tell her she was bright for a girl who didn't have a mother?

593
00:43:24,505 --> 00:43:26,575
Ju Won told me not to tell anyone.

594
00:43:34,374 --> 00:43:35,385
Oh, my gosh.

595
00:43:35,945 --> 00:43:36,985
Here.

596
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,184
Take it.

597
00:43:39,514 --> 00:43:41,525
Is it a special occasion? Did the teacher buy these for us?

598
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:42,885
It's your father.

599
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:45,394
He said it was the sunlight or something like that.

600
00:43:45,854 --> 00:43:46,954
What sunlight?

601
00:43:47,155 --> 00:43:48,594
- Thank you. - Thank you.

602
00:43:48,595 --> 00:43:49,623
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

603
00:43:49,624 --> 00:43:51,064
- Sure. - Thank you.

604
00:43:52,434 --> 00:43:53,894
He must be in his restaurant at this hour.

605
00:43:55,704 --> 00:43:56,865
No, the rich one.

606
00:43:58,064 --> 00:43:59,075
What?

607
00:44:01,035 --> 00:44:03,244
Come on. We were eating that.

608
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:08,985
Seriously? He's acting all bossy now that he's got a rich dad.

609
00:44:11,084 --> 00:44:12,684
He's just hungry. That's all.

610
00:44:13,215 --> 00:44:14,414
I told you he wasn't his dad.

611
00:44:14,925 --> 00:44:16,723
You'd better not accept anything from his dad.

612
00:44:16,724 --> 00:44:18,655
Or you'll have to answer to me. Got it?

613
00:44:18,994 --> 00:44:19,994
Okay.

614
00:44:19,995 --> 00:44:21,865
So burgers aren't enough...

615
00:44:22,064 --> 00:44:23,965
to make the son of a rich dad happy, right?

616
00:44:27,994 --> 00:44:29,305
Go ahead. Eat that up then.

617
00:44:30,135 --> 00:44:32,374
- You pathetic jerk. - What did you just say to me?

618
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:35,405
How dare you call me that, you punk?

619
00:44:36,204 --> 00:44:37,845
What? I called it as I saw it!

620
00:44:38,005 --> 00:44:39,844
- Hey. - Hey.

621
00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:41,075
- You jerk. - Stop it.

622
00:44:41,244 --> 00:44:42,244
Get off me!

623
00:44:50,485 --> 00:44:51,485
Kang Hae Jun.

624
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:55,663
What?

625
00:44:55,664 --> 00:44:57,124
If you're done, let's talk.

626
00:44:58,224 --> 00:44:59,235
I don't want to.

627
00:45:00,535 --> 00:45:01,865
This is about Ju Won.

628
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:05,635
It'd better be important.

629
00:45:11,644 --> 00:45:14,914
Ju Won's brothers took Jun Ho to the storage closet at the gym.

630
00:45:17,044 --> 00:45:18,044
Hey!

631
00:45:20,055 --> 00:45:22,584
Your brothers are going to beat up Jun Ho.

632
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:23,924
What are you talking about?

633
00:45:23,925 --> 00:45:25,425
They took him to the storage closet at the gym.

634
00:45:25,655 --> 00:45:27,555
Who said you were bright for a girl who didn't have a mother?

635
00:45:27,794 --> 00:45:29,664
- No way. They won't beat him up. - They're not gangsters.

636
00:45:31,325 --> 00:45:32,394
Hey, Ju Won!

637
00:45:42,905 --> 00:45:44,204
Hello.

638
00:45:45,544 --> 00:45:46,544
Hey.

639
00:45:47,414 --> 00:45:48,485
Tell him.

640
00:45:51,584 --> 00:45:53,485
No, Ju Won told me not to tell anyone.

641
00:45:56,124 --> 00:45:57,124
Tell me what?

642
00:45:57,925 --> 00:45:59,393
What else did you say besides...

643
00:45:59,394 --> 00:46:00,894
that Ju Won doesn't have a mother?

644
00:46:01,865 --> 00:46:02,865
What?

645
00:46:04,064 --> 00:46:05,064
Say it.

646
00:46:13,834 --> 00:46:14,874
You.

647
00:46:16,305 --> 00:46:17,974
What did you say to Ju Won?

648
00:46:22,144 --> 00:46:23,144
Ju Won...

649
00:46:24,845 --> 00:46:27,854
told me not to tell anyone, sir.

650
00:46:32,425 --> 00:46:34,595
Hey, slow down.

651
00:46:34,994 --> 00:46:37,994
There's no way they will beat him up.

652
00:46:38,264 --> 00:46:39,494
I'm not worried about him!

653
00:46:48,175 --> 00:46:49,704
She's not always cheerful.

654
00:46:51,175 --> 00:46:52,945
- No, I didn't say anything. - No!

655
00:46:55,584 --> 00:46:57,485
He didn't exactly say I don't have a mother.

656
00:46:57,644 --> 00:46:59,584
He just said...

657
00:47:01,184 --> 00:47:03,755
He only said that I had a difficult upbringing.

658
00:47:08,794 --> 00:47:10,064
Is that really what you said?

659
00:47:11,865 --> 00:47:12,865
What?

660
00:47:14,564 --> 00:47:16,334
You told me not to tell anyone.

661
00:47:17,564 --> 00:47:19,505
Then why was he grabbing you by the collar?

662
00:47:25,115 --> 00:47:26,115
You.

663
00:47:26,445 --> 00:47:28,014
What did you say to Ju Won?

664
00:47:29,544 --> 00:47:33,584
Ju Won told me not to tell anyone, sir.

665
00:48:01,644 --> 00:48:02,644
Well...

666
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,215
I thought...

667
00:48:06,285 --> 00:48:08,755
this wasn't a big deal. I didn't see the need to share.

668
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,624
But so what?

669
00:48:13,325 --> 00:48:14,724
I hear that all the time.

670
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:16,695
People in our neighborhood say that all the time.

671
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,124
I'm totally fine.

672
00:48:20,494 --> 00:48:22,604
If you were, you would have told me.

673
00:48:51,695 --> 00:48:54,235
You can't even be friends with her. Understood?

674
00:48:54,994 --> 00:48:56,805
But that's up to Ju Won.

675
00:49:15,755 --> 00:49:17,655
How is that you and Hae Jun are exactly the same?

676
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:19,095
What do you mean?

677
00:49:19,925 --> 00:49:22,624
That's what Hae Jun said when his birth dad showed up.

678
00:49:23,925 --> 00:49:26,195
He said there was no need to tell you and your father.

679
00:49:27,695 --> 00:49:30,104
He couldn't even handle the fact that his birth dad abandoned him...

680
00:49:30,405 --> 00:49:31,905
even before he was born.

681
00:49:33,035 --> 00:49:35,544
He said, "Let's not tell them. What's the point"?

682
00:49:36,945 --> 00:49:38,305
"I'll just suffer alone".

683
00:49:42,215 --> 00:49:43,314
But that's not right.

684
00:49:44,684 --> 00:49:47,084
If something happens to me or Hae Jun, you ought to know.

685
00:49:49,684 --> 00:49:51,485
If there's something to get angry about...

686
00:49:52,394 --> 00:49:53,994
or to celebrate, you want to be there for us.

687
00:49:58,164 --> 00:49:59,264
You must be okay...

688
00:50:01,135 --> 00:50:02,334
for me and Hae Jun to be okay.

689
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:06,635
I'll tell you everything from now on.

690
00:50:07,235 --> 00:50:08,905
I mean it. I promise.

691
00:50:10,905 --> 00:50:12,115
You should do the same.

692
00:50:24,954 --> 00:50:25,954
What?

693
00:50:30,294 --> 00:50:31,294
Welcome.

694
00:50:35,535 --> 00:50:37,764
- Goodness. - Hello.

695
00:50:42,075 --> 00:50:43,175
It's been a while.

696
00:50:45,675 --> 00:50:46,744
I see.

697
00:50:47,314 --> 00:50:48,514
It's been a while.

698
00:50:48,914 --> 00:50:50,013
San Ha won't answer my calls.

699
00:50:50,014 --> 00:50:52,314
It didn't feel right to wait for him in the empty house.

700
00:50:53,115 --> 00:50:54,715
Could we wait for him here?

701
00:50:56,525 --> 00:50:57,885
Sure. Of course.

702
00:51:00,525 --> 00:51:01,794
Why isn't he coming?

703
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:09,163
We're good now, right?

704
00:51:09,164 --> 00:51:11,635
Mom, isn't that San Ha?

705
00:51:14,474 --> 00:51:16,044
- I'll be down soon. - Okay.

706
00:51:29,485 --> 00:51:30,555
Call him.

707
00:51:32,354 --> 00:51:33,925
San Ha.

708
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:39,365
- You have to call him louder. - San Ha!

709
00:51:58,885 --> 00:52:00,914
So Hee, say hello.

710
00:52:04,854 --> 00:52:05,954
San Ha?

711
00:52:49,204 --> 00:52:50,564
Why did you come into the kitchen?

712
00:52:51,164 --> 00:52:52,505
I can't sit at the table.

713
00:52:55,334 --> 00:52:56,845
Then go home.

714
00:52:57,575 --> 00:52:59,414
If I leave right away, it looks like I'm avoiding her.

715
00:53:02,845 --> 00:53:05,144
- I'll just wash the dishes and go. - Okay.

716
00:53:09,385 --> 00:53:10,825
Didn't Dad call you?

717
00:53:12,724 --> 00:53:14,425
He probably told you never to come back here.

718
00:53:15,595 --> 00:53:17,965
- He did. - Mom.

719
00:53:18,465 --> 00:53:21,365
It's okay. It's just that it's his first time meeting you.

720
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:26,675
You see the resemblance, right?

721
00:53:35,244 --> 00:53:36,244
And if I do?

722
00:53:37,615 --> 00:53:38,644
What then?

723
00:53:39,914 --> 00:53:40,954
Resemblance to whom?

724
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:44,325
- Ju Won. - Yes?

725
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:46,055
Could you take her outside?

726
00:53:46,525 --> 00:53:47,525
Okay.

727
00:54:15,215 --> 00:54:17,424
(Lucky General Store)

728
00:54:17,425 --> 00:54:19,025
Could you buy one for my brother?

729
00:54:20,025 --> 00:54:22,025
He has a lot of them at home.

730
00:54:23,164 --> 00:54:24,525
Do you like him that much?

731
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,394
My mom told me...

732
00:54:27,635 --> 00:54:30,564
when my parents pass away later,

733
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,735
it will be just him and me in the world.

734
00:54:33,204 --> 00:54:35,005
It won't be just the two of you.

735
00:54:35,434 --> 00:54:37,945
There could be 3 or 4 of you. Everyone can live together.

736
00:54:38,204 --> 00:54:39,945
- I can really do that? - You bet.

737
00:54:40,575 --> 00:54:43,014
- Then do you want to come with us? - Go where?

738
00:54:45,314 --> 00:54:48,014
Well, it's a secret.

739
00:54:48,314 --> 00:54:51,584
- Okay. - I wasn't supposed to tell anyone.

740
00:54:51,885 --> 00:54:54,624
What is it? I won't tell anyone.

741
00:54:55,354 --> 00:54:58,664
My mom said we would go back to Seoul...

742
00:54:59,394 --> 00:55:01,764
with San Ha during winter break.

743
00:55:04,035 --> 00:55:05,135
Seoul?

744
00:55:05,704 --> 00:55:09,305
Yes. So he will have meals with me and play with me all the time!

745
00:55:11,845 --> 00:55:12,845
Is that so?

746
00:55:21,155 --> 00:55:22,224
I won't go.

747
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:23,385
Reconsider.

748
00:55:23,485 --> 00:55:24,854
I already told you the other day.

749
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:27,454
I wished you to be happy with your life.

750
00:55:28,195 --> 00:55:29,964
I meant that you and I would be happy separately.

751
00:55:29,965 --> 00:55:30,994
What about college?

752
00:55:31,695 --> 00:55:33,965
I'll be attending it here.

753
00:55:34,235 --> 00:55:35,365
Reconsider that too.

754
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:38,934
You can live with me and So Hee.

755
00:55:40,005 --> 00:55:41,333
(Dad, you can do it!)

756
00:55:41,334 --> 00:55:43,505
It's only right that families live together.

757
00:55:50,445 --> 00:55:51,785
I'm already doing that.

758
00:56:02,124 --> 00:56:03,425
(Machine Laundry)

759
00:56:06,434 --> 00:56:09,334
I want to live with you.

760
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:20,345
Please take care of him just for a while.

761
00:56:22,544 --> 00:56:23,684
When I come back,

762
00:56:24,285 --> 00:56:26,385
I'll bring a hamburger for you.

763
00:56:27,115 --> 00:56:28,215
I don't need it.

764
00:56:28,755 --> 00:56:31,025
Don't buy anything and just come quickly.

765
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:41,334
(Yoon's Kalguksu)

766
00:56:46,704 --> 00:56:48,675
How come you never ask me what I want?

767
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:52,044
Does my opinion not matter?

768
00:56:59,055 --> 00:57:00,255
Please leave.

769
00:57:00,715 --> 00:57:02,325
He has to open the restaurant for dinner now.

770
00:57:05,894 --> 00:57:07,425
And never come back here.

771
00:57:11,425 --> 00:57:12,434
Hey.

772
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:19,704
Excuse me.

773
00:57:23,244 --> 00:57:24,945
You didn't have to be so mean.

774
00:57:25,244 --> 00:57:27,814
- Let's talk later. - if you're not in a good mood,

775
00:57:28,175 --> 00:57:30,885
should I tell her to come back later?

776
00:57:31,445 --> 00:57:33,084
Must I repeat the same thing to you?

777
00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:35,155
Are you that dense?

778
00:57:36,325 --> 00:57:37,583
- What? - That's not the kind...

779
00:57:37,584 --> 00:57:38,885
of the relationship I have with her.

780
00:57:39,724 --> 00:57:41,223
Listen. I meant that...

781
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:44,965
Your mom at least lied that she would come back for you.

782
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:49,164
What?

783
00:57:52,434 --> 00:57:55,374
When your mom comes back, you can be nice to her.

784
00:57:57,244 --> 00:57:58,845
I won't get involved then.

785
00:58:01,914 --> 00:58:03,115
She didn't lie.

786
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,514
She said she'd be back once she saved up money.

787
00:58:10,755 --> 00:58:11,985
She said she'd come back.

788
00:58:20,664 --> 00:58:21,664
Do you...

789
00:58:22,564 --> 00:58:23,735
still believe that?

790
00:58:29,204 --> 00:58:30,204
See?

791
00:58:45,794 --> 00:58:47,254
There are plenty of other kids who are happy with their moms.

792
00:58:47,255 --> 00:58:48,925
Why do you keep taking it out on me?

793
00:58:53,135 --> 00:58:55,264
When other people see us, we're exactly the same.

794
00:58:56,465 --> 00:58:58,264
We're just some kids, abandoned by our moms!

795
01:00:04,505 --> 01:00:06,204
(Family By Choice)

796
01:00:06,575 --> 01:00:08,103
Right. Don't you go to Haedong High School?

797
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,304
Come on. Let's have some fun.

798
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:10,774
These guys looked like they were trouble.

799
01:00:10,775 --> 01:00:11,775
Do you like her?

800
01:00:11,776 --> 01:00:13,344
- What if I do? - I'll bully her.

801
01:00:13,345 --> 01:00:15,075
I'll buy you a prettier pair next time.

802
01:00:15,744 --> 01:00:17,914
Isn't this a clear sign?

803
01:00:18,345 --> 01:00:20,954
Do you really not know why I'm avoiding you?

804
01:00:21,055 --> 01:00:22,623
San Ha is setting the table.

805
01:00:22,624 --> 01:00:25,184
You should join him and try to help out.

806
01:00:25,454 --> 01:00:28,894
It makes me wonder if it's better that you leave with your birth dad.

807
01:00:28,994 --> 01:00:30,194
I'll be more considerate next time.

808
01:00:30,195 --> 01:00:31,525
You need to forget about your mom too.

809
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:33,334
Mr. Yoon Jung Jae?

810
01:00:34,135 --> 01:00:35,365
Do you remember me?
