Is this your birth father's money?

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,350
Gosh, no way!

9
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,440
Where did you get this much money, then?

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,340
I washed dishes and served tables.

11
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,300
I caught a customer's eye and did some modeling, too.

12
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,310
I worked really hard to pay you back-

13
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,760
Worked hard...

14
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,620
Did someone tell you to pay me back?

15
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,910
Still, you raised me for 10 years-

What parent doesn't? It comes naturally!

17
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:13,140
Is it because I'm not your real father?

The reason Mr. Yoon got mad

20
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:24,570
is because of his guilty conscience. Since you're not his birth dad.

- Where?

39

Auntie told me she opened a hair salon in Busan.

00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,930
And? What did she say when she met you?

41
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,890
I didn't meet her.

42

What about Kang Haejun?

Kang Haejun lived his entire life in the dark, believing he was just baggage.

Ever since you cut him off,

52

People kept saying my dad took in a charity case!

- I was?
- Don't you remember?

00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:22,610
You were hurt by the words, "For someone without a mom."

92
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,080
But you didn't tell me or Haejun in case it upset us.

Why don't they talk it out before they hurt?

- In your room.

I wouldn't be like this if it weren't for you.

142
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,980
You think I'm acting like this because I'm drunk?

143
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,790
Because I can't walk?

144

I told you I came back for good.

149

And I said you can't.

You won't die.

You'll be all right, Mom.

155
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,150
You're saying you don't care if I die?

156
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:31,560
How could you treat me like this?

157
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,800
I'm saying you won't blink an eye even if I die!

158

I was scared something would happen to you, too.

You don't know how much I cried for Sojeong!

Did you really cry for Sojeong?

[My daughter]

188
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,740
Hey, Honey.

189
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,390
Of course.

190
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:38,240
Thanks to someone's smarty daughter's words,

191
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,770
there was nothing left for me to say.

192
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,700
Ahjumma will be in touch in no time.

193
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,270
You have to let me know if she does, okay?

194
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,070
Kang Haejun's coming! I'll call you later.

195
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:49,620
Okay.

196
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:55,380
Aigoo...

197
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,020
When did you come?

198
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:01,960
What ahjumma?

199
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:08,990
You still have a long way to go until you need hearing aids, Madam.

200
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,380
You have super hearing.

201
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,170
Why are you changing the subject?

202
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,400
What ahjumma?

203
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,890
I wonder how much lunch traffic we'll get today.

204
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,210
The weather's so nice.

205
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,490
Something's fishy.

206
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,490
I'm sure of it.

207
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,690
Did he get a girlfriend?

208
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:35,640
Mr. Yoon, did you get a girlfriend?

209
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,940
Still no word from Kim Sanha?

210
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,320
He must've been at the hospital all night.

211
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,380
I asked Junho, and he said Oppa was in the ER and just fell asleep.

212
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,940
Hey, I mean, listen.

213
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:55,410
Is it that hard to tell us he's going to the hospital?

214
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,870
Even Ahjumma and the little girl.

215
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,480
I was shocked to discover they all disappeared without a trace.

216
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,640
Anyway,

217
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,750
where did she go?

218
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,380
Who? Dal?

219
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,630
Did she leave early this morning?

220
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,690
She never came home?

221
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,950
What if she did?

222
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:22,990
What's wrong with a single, 29-year-old woman staying out?

223
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:24,610
It's a scary world these days!

224
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,790
How could she stay out all night? She's got no fear.

225
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,790
Does that mean she already found a boyfriend?

226
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,090
Wow, she just asked me to be her flirtation guy the other day.

227
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,810
Who is it?

228
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:42,500
Dal went home yesterday because it was her mom's birthday.

229
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,150
Why did you lie?

230
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,700
What's with the overreaction?

231
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:52,260
What does it matter to you whether Dal stays out or finds a boyfriend?

232
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,660
You know, my sister's friend is my sister.

233
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,870
She's like you to me.

234
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,710
I'm telling you just in case, but I don't need that kind of attention from you.

235
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,550
This won't do.

236
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,530
Pack Kim Sanha's belongings. I'll stop by the hospital.

237
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:07,920
You can go to work. I'll go.

238
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,990
- I'll go.
- There's no need. I'll go.

239
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,420
I said I'll go!

240
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,920

241
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,320
- What?
- Something you're not telling me.

242
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,450

243
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,330

244
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,410
You got your wrist treated at the hospital last time!

245
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,300
Are you in pain again?

246
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,880
You want to see how strong my fist and wrist are?

247
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,750
You have to tell me if it hurts, okay?

248
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,020
I'll pack Kim Sanha's stuff.

249
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,640
He consistently can't read the room.

250
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,850

How does he not have a clue that Dal likes him?

296

If Dal gets a boyfriend, he looks ready to step in like her older brother.

297
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,730
It's a shame to let it go to waste.

A long time ago, Kang Haejun did this.

299
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,090
I was getting scolded in the office for dozing off in class.

300
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:03,000
He saw that and...

301
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,560
Sanha's mom seemed determined to take Sanha with her.

302
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,810
Hi.

303
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,880
Did you know Sanha's mom visited him yesterday?

304
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,630
She visited him?

305
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,890
Stop by the store later.

306
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:24,130
It's because the adults couldn't resolve anything.

307
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,590
It's not something jujube tea will solve.

308
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:30,400
I kept in touch with Sanha while I was in America.

309
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,570
Even then, he always said he was fine, and everything was okay.

310
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,560
Like father, like son. They both don't say a word.

311
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,390
Do I have to slap them on the back to get them talking?

312
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,180
Thank goodness you guys are by his side now.

313
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:49,660
I'm sure Sanha probably came back to have some peace.

314
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,440
- You're shameless.
- What?

315
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,250
I kept chattering for an hour. My throat hurts.

316
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,540
How could you not say a word?

317
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,300
We can do this here?

318
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,850
Did Ahjumma come to take you to Seoul?

319
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,680
Yeah.

320
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:13,030
So, what will you do?

321
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,910
I'm not going.

322
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,220
I told you I'm not going anywhere.

323
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,300
Are you all right?

324
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:24,070
Yeah, Mom will be fine.

325
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,450
I'm asking if you're all right.

326
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,780
I'm all right.

327
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,710
Ten years ago...

328
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,380
Yes, I begged you not to leave.

329
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,360
That was because I didn't want to part with you.

330
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,910
I really didn't want to separate from you.

331
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:46,410
I know.

332
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,900
If you're staying here because of me, it's okay.

333
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:58,570
If you need to care for your mom and Sohui, I won't make you stay here.

334
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:02,670
Back then, Seoul and America seemed really far away,

335
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,330
but if you think about it, Seoul is actually pretty close-

336
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,160
Juwon.

337
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,490
Yes?

338
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,450
Don't let me go.

339
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:21,000
Tell me you can't live without me.

340
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,870
Are you stupid?

341
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:26,460
I feel the same way.

342
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,650
I just tried acting tough.

343
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:31,260
Where do you think you're going? You better not go.

344
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,870
I'll spread rumors to Timbuktu that you're a jerk.

345
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:43,260
You don't think anyone we know will come all the way here, do you?

346
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,730
I wish someone would see us.

347
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:48,090
So, the rumor would spread to Timbuktu.

348
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:52,640
They can't! I just have to hide my face.

349
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,870
- You just have to hide your face?
- Yeah.

350
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,640
Did you speak with Sanha's mom?

351
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,150
Yeah, I called her on my way here, but she didn't answer.

352
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,900
What about Sanha?

353
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:22,500
I plan to stop by the hospital later this evening.

354
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,080
Why are you sitting down? Go to Sanha if you have the time to sit down.

355
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:30,770
Let me catch my breath.

356
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:33,280
I didn't have a single meal today.

357
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,700
It's not like you're defending the Earth.

358
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,540
Are you the only police in Haedong?

359
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:43,390
Why can't you even eat a meal?

360
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,300
Give me a minute.

361
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,690
Interested in a blind date?

362
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,910
What?

363
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,080
If you get married and get a new wife,

364
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,650
and Sanha gets a stepmom,

365
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:05,920
this connection you guys have might be broken.

366
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,240
Hold your horses.

367
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,290
Who would marry me just to break this connection?

368
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,360
Poor woman. Goodness.

369
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,760
Yes, you're right.

370
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:17,500
I misspoke.

371
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:20,940
How did it go with Haejun's mom?

372
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,690
I feel sorry for her.

373
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,170
She got on her knees and cried yesterday.

374
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,470
I thought how sad her life is.

375
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:33,420
It made me wonder how she lasted 20 years without Haejun.

376
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,010
It would've been great if you started living together after the blind date.

377
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,780
Didn't you have feelings for Haejun's mom?

378
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:49,100
Listen to this guy. Who had what?

379
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,730
That's what I thought all this time.

380
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:55,900
Isn't that why you took in Haejun without a second thought?

381
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,700
Goodness.

382
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,950
Don't say that carelessly in front of the kids!

383
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,470
What absolute nonsense.

384
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,310
Finish eating and go to Sanha!

385
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:11,740
If it's not true, just say so. Why get angry?

386
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,320
That's funny! Geez.

387
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,850
Sohui.

388
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,450
Oppa.

389
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,470
What brings you all the way here alone?

390
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,940
Sit down.

391
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,470
Where's Mom?

392
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,900
Mom's still at the hotel in Busan.

393
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,930
She thinks I'm back in Seoul.

394
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:44,960
She said she'd stay one more day and told me to return first.

395
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,890
By yourself?

396
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:51,160
Mom isn't answering her phone right now.

397
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,870
Don't worry. You know she gets like this sometimes.

398
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,410
It's nothing to worry about,

399
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,880
so if you return to Seoul, she'll call you in no time.

400
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,200
Mom cried so much at the hotel yesterday.

401
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,640
Oppa.

402
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,050
Can't I just live with you until I graduate high school?

403
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,620
Mom is better off without me.

404
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,660
That's not true!

405
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,490
Mom was sensitive at times,

406
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:36,150
but that's because she was in pain.

407
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:39,920
But she was able to rehabilitate

408
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,890
because you and I were by her side.

409
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:45,980
Psychogenic?

410
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,120
You can see for yourself, but there's no bone, muscle, or nerve damage.

411
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,180
After so much effort into rehab, but there's no progress?

412
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,080
It could be psychogenic.

413
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,850
Consider transferring her to psychiatry.

414
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:06,920
Mom has a harder time when I'm around.

415
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,700
To Mom, I'm...

416
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,270
Mom! Mom!

417
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,710
I'm like the scar on her leg.

418
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:20,360
If her scar disappeared,

419
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,510
all her painful memories would disappear, too.

420
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,180
But she could still see it.

421
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,940
And every time she sees it,

422
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,350
she feels awful.

423
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,500
- Oppa.
- That's why...

424
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,440
Mom is better off...

425
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,900
without me there.

426
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:53,640
You know how much Mom loves you, right?

427
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:00,890
Mom will get better because of you.

428
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:11,530
I'm here!

429
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:13,230
Hey!

430
00:31:19,090 --> 00:31:21,660
Kang Haejun isn't coming today.

431
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,080
Give me a cupcake. The first one.

432
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,980
- Me, too.
- Two?

433
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,420
Yes.

434
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,250
Did you know Haejun's rumors are rampant at the nurses' station?

435
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:42,620
They're going crazy talking about Haedong's celebrity.

436
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:47,900
I would've also considered that field if my grades didn't make it to medical school.

437
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,300
- To-go?
- Yes.

438
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,180
Was that girl Hyungnim's younger sister?

439
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,510
What?

440
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,130
Yeah.

441
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,710
I saw her and her mom at the hospital a few times when we were still in school.

442
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:07,140
She doesn't look anything like Hyungnim.

443
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,190
- That's true.
- Who went where?

444
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,330
Sanha.

445
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,990
His younger sister came to the hospital.

446
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:20,300
- Alone?
- Yeah, alone.

447
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,040
She looked so dejected.

448
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:25,320
She was looking for her brother so pitifully, so I took her to him.

449
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:29,090
Hey, it'd be weirder if she didn't look dejected.

450
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,390
Their mom must be having another hard time.

451
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,240
Chronic illnesses are hard on the family,

452
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,620
but Sanha's mother is...

453
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:41,010
Do you know Ahjumma well?

454
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:43,070
As if I do.

455
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,380
I just met her a couple of times at the hospital.

456
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,230
All the girls who liked Kim Sanha back in our department

457
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:52,360
would hold strong even when he didn't look at them.

458
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,730
But one visit from his mom to the hospital, and they all dropped away.

459
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,640
Including you.

460
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,220
I never liked Kim Sanha from the start.

461
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,940
I know everything.

462
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,310
After you broke up with Haejun, you went to Sanha like this.

463
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:10,620
Hey, you'd better watch it today.

464
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,300
Kim Sanha seems to be in a bad mood.

465
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:15,400
- Fooling around will get you in trouble.
- Right?

466
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,620
He even worked all night alone even though there wasn't an urgent call.

467
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:22,030
No wonder he had a dark face all day.

468
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:26,380
I saw him smile once when he saw her earlier.

469
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,600
Hey, it was like that in high school, too.

470
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,870
He would be scowling all day

471
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:34,800
but would immediately change when he saw her.

472
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,800
I honestly thought they were dating.

473
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,510
You still have those misunderstandings?

474
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,260
Isn't that right?

475
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,790
What did you say?

476
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,870
Hey, let's go. We're leaving.

477
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,550
[Kim Sanha]

478
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:18,010
There's a patient I need to observe, so I think I'll end late today.

479
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:20,020
Just in case you might wait.

480
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,850
All right. Let me know when you're done.

481
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,560
I'll get changed and come out. Give me a moment.

482
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,740
It was tough to get here. Let's just talk here.

483
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:11,660
There's nowhere to sit here.

484
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,920
I miss Sojeong so much.

485
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,030
I thought about what you said yesterday.

486
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:27,220
I've been a terrible mother to you, huh?

487
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,980
Do you think I was like that to Sojeong, too?

488
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:35,460
Yes, I was probably the same to Sojeong, too.

489
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:39,220
She died because of me.

490
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,550
I wonder how much she resents me.

491
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:49,290
I missed Sojeong so much...

492
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:51,370
I couldn't bear it-

493
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,320
Mom, what I said yesterday-

494
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,960
What you said is all true.

495
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,150
Everything is my fault.

496
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:03,100
How difficult must it be

497
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:08,460
for you, Sojeong, and Sohui...

498
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,960
because of me?

499
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:16,150
Right?

500
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,260
I'll take you to the hotel.

501
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,000
Take me to where you live.

502
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,810
It's so uncomfortable to stay at the hotel by myself.

503
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:35,060
Wait here for a moment.

504
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,940
[Haedong Park Village]

505
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,600
Please give me a moment!

506
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,840
Hello.

507
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,030
Are you drinking alone?

508
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:58,770
Beer is just a beverage.

509
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,810
Beer is alcohol.

510
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:04,300
Got it?

511
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,990
I heard you visited your mom in Seoul.

512
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,630
Did she say anything?

513
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,280
Because of the blind date.

514
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,670
What?

515
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:18,730
- Did you get in trouble?
- It was expected.

516
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,820
She asked who it was and to bring him home.

517
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,360
Let...

518
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,600
Let me know if you need me again.

519
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:35,250
It's okay! I don't need you for that.

520
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,990
Come to think of it,

521
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:42,190
you've only met with doctors, lawyers, and the likes, right?

522
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:44,890
I don't even come close!

523
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,260
What do you mean, "the likes"?

524
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,290
All those men combined don't stand a chance against you.

525
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:58,300
Out of all 27 years of Park Dal's life,

526
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,420

527
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:08,430
You...

528
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,980
To be honest, those photos...

529
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:18,300
I'm only telling you, but they've been slightly photoshopped.

530
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,670
Not too much! Just a bit.

531
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,750
Per standard industry practices.

532
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,460

Now, you worry about Sohui?

Didn't you consider how hard it would be on Sohui when you returned to Haedong?

548
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:04,950
You abandoned your family and left without regard for us.

- Is it so wrong for a mom to want to stay

Why?

553

555
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,270

Tell Ahjumma to take a taxi, and you come with me.

- I can have him?

That I felt so bad whenever I thought about it throughout my entire life.

575
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:34,680
You gave him to me, but I lent him to you for 10 years.

576
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,620
Because you're his family.

577

Well, who am I to blame anyone's mom?

714
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,080
It's no use acting pitiful. Take it elsewhere.

715
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,190
It doesn't work with us.

716
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:13,090
How can I take it elsewhere?

717
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:16,270
Then, they'll really pity me.

718
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,360
- Dad!
- Hey.

719
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,790
What are you doing outside?

720
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:33,320
Well...

721
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:40,090
I'd be happy if you came home often.

722
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,670
But you're busy, too.

723
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:48,100
I know you're busy,

724
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:51,970
but I do pass by the hospital pretty often.

725
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:55,590
So, we can eat in the city, too. Right?

726
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:59,460
You can call me anytime.

727
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,240
Or you can just come by, too.

728
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,920
Sure. Sure, sure.

729
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,540
Sure.

730
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,420
Good job.

731
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:22,930
Seokhun and Jaeeun are coming over later tonight.

732
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:24,550
You should call Dal, too.

733
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:27,210
What time? I'll be at the store, so I might end late.

734
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:29,630
Just close for the rest of the day, and get a good rest!

735
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:31,890
I should open for dinner since I closed in the morning.

736
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:35,200
Demand is skyrocketing these days, so the cakes keep selling out early.

737
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,600
I think word is going around on social media.

738
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,940
Then, I'll drop Juwon off at the store and drop you off at home.

I need to stop by the hospital for a bit.

Then, we'll be eating first. Come when you can.

You remember, right?

747
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:24,910
We ate together when you were this small.

748
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:27,020
Yes.

749
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:31,850
I heard from Haejun's aunt that you grew up like brothers since then.

750
00:56:31,850 --> 00:56:33,550
Thank you.

751
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:41,230
I know why you came here today.

752
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,480
But I'm not ready yet.

753
00:56:46,270 --> 00:56:47,900
I know.

754
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:52,130
I'm not here to convince you.

755
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:55,500
I think I'll regret it if I don't tell you.

756
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:59,270
You can listen and disregard it if you want.

757
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,750
Haejun and I did grow up like brothers.

758
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:14,130
But if we hadn't met like that, we would've never been friends.

759
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:17,490
We're really incompatible from A to Z.

760
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:25,840
The reason I liked him

761
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:30,350
was because we were abandoned by our moms.

762
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:33,350
That was the only reason.

763
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:37,570
I wasn't the only one.

764
00:57:37,570 --> 00:57:39,730
He was like that, too.

765
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:43,130
That comforted me.

766
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,070
I know...

767
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:53,350
that measuring my misfortune with someone else's

768
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:56,900
is terrible.

769
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,750
No.

770
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,840
I don't think badly of you.

771
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:05,230

But I...

775
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:20,490
realized it for sure when you got on your knees.

776
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,860
Haejun...

777
00:58:29,750 --> 00:58:32,210
was never abandoned.

778
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:35,750
I was the only one.

779
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:52,570
Naturally, I should've been jealous,

780
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,500
but I wasn't.

781
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:57,030
I thought, good for him.

782
00:58:57,030 --> 00:58:59,290
Good for him.

783
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:00,800
That his mom...

784
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:04,380
His mom didn't abandon him.

785
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:09,390
Then,

786
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:13,100
he has to know.

787
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,670
Haejun has to know this.

788
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:24,870
