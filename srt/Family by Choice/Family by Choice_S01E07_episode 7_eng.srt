1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:11,240


2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,970
   

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,040
   

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,630
   

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,830
   

6
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,880
   

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:45,930
   

8
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,450
 "2 km SkyBike." 

9
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,770
 But will riding that make them reconcile? 

10
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:54,530
 Doing things together naturally develops friendship. 

11
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,030
 - Let go! 
 - Hey! 

12
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,410
 I said to make up. Why are you fighting again? 

13
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,530
 Hey, don't make up! 

14
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,900
 You're dead if you make up! 

15
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,040
 - Hang out with us. 
 - Gosh, I'm– 

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,100
 Please let go– 

17
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,390
 What the heck? 

18
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,490
 Aren't you Kang Hae Joon's younger sister? 

19
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,040
 What should we do? Is it heatstroke? 

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,740
 Should we call an ambulance? 

21
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,390
 Yoon Joo Won, wake up. 

22
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,530
 Where are they? How dare they hit a girl! 

23
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:22,210
 You! 

24
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,910
 - What? 
 - What? 

25
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,390
 You're Mr. Yoon Jeong Jae, right? 

26
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,100
 Don't you remember lending me money? 

27
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,300
 Why won't you see Hae Joon? 

28
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,030
 Is it hard to tell him his mom paid her debt and left? 

29
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,460
 What dire circumstance would stop her from seeing her child's face? 

30
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,550
 She said she paid her debt before leaving. 

31
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:49,950
 So she said not to worry about the money. 

32
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,370
 Anyway, why is Kang Hae Joon so dense? 

33
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,830
 You're the one Dal's mom wanted to see. 

34
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,410
 Why does he think I brought him along if he's not involved? 

35
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:08,500
 Wasn't that enough for most people to catch on? 

36
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,190
 Was he always so dense? 

37
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,810
 You're dense, too. 

38
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,780
 Why am I– 

39
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,450
What I mean is...

40
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,410
So...

41
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,980
what I mean is...

42
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:43,350
I'm sharp.

43
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,730
What?

44
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:48,300
I said I was sharp.

45
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,540
Was I being dense today?

46
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,240
Tell me if I was.

47
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,310
Tell me.

48
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,940
Why are you laughing?

49
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,370
You said you were sharp.

50
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,490
Can't you tell why I'm laughing?

51
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,210
Why?

52
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,200
Why did you laugh?

53
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,490
It's Bus 900.

54
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,040
"Bus 900"?

55
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,570
Come on. Run!

56
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,550
We have to wait an hour if we miss that one. Hurry!

57
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:24,210
Ahjusshi!

58
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,970
Ahjusshi! Ahjusshi!

59
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,150
Come on.

60
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,830
Go to him.

61
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:33,410
Talk to Ahjusshi!

62
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,260
Thank you.

63
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,500
 Imagine if we missed this one. 

64
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,260
 Forget one hour. 

65
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,880
 We might've had to wait two hours. 

66
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,640
Can you use herb salt to banish a ghost? 
    

67
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,190
Do you talk about this with your friends?

68
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,970
Yes. It's the hottest topic in our class.

69
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,830
You need to prove ghosts exist first.

70
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,640
After proving that, you can ask if salt can banish ghosts.

71
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:20,050
No, this isn't a matter of proving anything.

72
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,100
It's purely for fun.

73
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:25,710
Then herb salt should work since it has salt in it.

74
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,340
Since the main ingredient in herb salt is the salt, not the herb.

75
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,260
Okay, then. A hamster's feet sweat. Yes or no?

76
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,070
Hamsters are mammals, so they regulate their body temperature.

77
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,740
Of course, their feet sweat.

78
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,650
I'm an idiot for asking you.

79
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:44,420
My goodness!

80
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,520
What are you doing over there?

81
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,200
What took you guys so long?

82
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,850
What are you doing here instead of going home?

83
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,510
Didn't you visit Auntie?

84
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,290
Did something happen at the hospital?

85
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:07,800
Why? What happened?

86
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,580
Nothing. Auntie is fine.

87
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,100
Then who isn't fine?

88
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,770
Is it you?

89
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,100
Tell us what's wrong while I'm speaking nicely.

90
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,210
How much was it?

91
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,770
Twenty million won.

92
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,940
I knew because Auntie told me, but...

93
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,880
When did you find out she had borrowed money?

94
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,710
A long time ago.

95
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,580
When I first came here.

96
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,230
I wondered why she always made you walk on eggshells.

97
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,130
Auntie wasn't trying to be mean.

98
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,960
She just felt pressured, too.

99
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,910
She felt bad, too.

100
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,540
It's not Hae Joon's fault.

101
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,330
That's what I'm saying.

102
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,640
Why is he being cautious when it's not his fault?

103
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:06,280
Why feel sorry?

104
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,910
Well, she paid everything back, so it's settled.

105
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,150
You no longer have to feel pressured.

106
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,890
That's right.

107
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,670
I was going to pay it back.

108
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,510
If the money was the reason she couldn't contact me,

109
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,070
I could just pay it back.

110
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,670
But since she paid him back and just left...

111
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,610
I guess money wasn't the reason she didn't contact me.

112
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,950
It would've been nice if it was because of the money.

113
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,710
It would've been nice if she saw you before leaving.

114
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,010
Take it.

115
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,860
Here.

116
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,700
Eat it. I gave you one first.

117
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,690
Eat this, too.

118
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,710
I'm home.

119
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:30,330
 Great. And Joo Won? 

120
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,200
She needs something from Kim San Ha.

121
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,910
Okay...

122
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,450
I'm almost done. Go do what you need to do.

123
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:01,550
You should run the washing machine. Why do you always wash it by hand?

124
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,640
Do you see this? These areas must be washed by hand.

125
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,340
It's not even visible.

126
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,320
Even so.

127
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,740
It feels nice to go out in clean clothes in the morning.

128
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,560
About the money Mom paid you back...

129
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,050
What?

130
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,080
If we use that for my tuition next year,

131
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,010
I'll pay it all back by working.

132
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,850
How did you find out?

133
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,620
She visited Auntie.

134
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,600
Why did she see Auntie and not me?

135
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,710
Was she too busy?

136
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,510
If she comes back next time and looks for me,

137
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,610
tell her I don't want to see her anymore.

138
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,620
She probably won't return since she paid off her debt.

139
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,720
I'm going.

140
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,830
Hae Joon.

141
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,990
Don't say things like you'll pay me back.

142
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,080
You don't need to pay me back for anything.

143
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,310
Don't say anything Joo Won wouldn't say.

144
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,430
Kang Hae Joon told you he's aware his mom came, right?

145
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,720
There are no secrets here.

146
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,010
You should be glad he told you.

147
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,860
That's true.

148
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,700
I'll see you later.

149
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,330
   

150
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,740
One, ten, hundred, thousand, ten thousand...

151
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,620
I'm proud he's saying he'd do what he can to pay you back.

152
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,000
Making a child worry about money is nothing to brag about.

153
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,980
Did something good happen?

154
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,820
Why are you so happy?

155
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,650
San Ha's mom texted me earlier saying she's going to Seoul.

156
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,030
Will she not come here anymore?

157
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,330
It'll be hard to unless she is determined.

158
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,760
Seoul is across the country.

159
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,240
Did you tell San Ha as well?

160
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,350
Yes, as soon as I got the text.

161
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,800
She came out of nowhere and shook up the children.

162
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,730
But they all found their places in the end.

163
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,110
Now that I think about it,

164
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:20,160
Hae Joon's birth father has been quiet these days.

165
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,190
It looked like he'd sue right away.

166
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,400
Can you please just take one look at this?

167
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,160
Hey, do you know I was determined to go to America without you?

168
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,730
But I see you whenever I close my eyes.

169
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,490
And I'm reminded of you when I'm eating something delicious.

170
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:08,220
Don't you think that's what it means to be bound by blood?

171
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,760
You said similar stuff the first time you came, too.

172
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,140
Fool me twice, shame on me.

173
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,360
H-Hey, I'm not trying to fool you.

174
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,240
I'm totally serious right now.

175
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,600
You came to me out of worry that they'll take your assets away!

176
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,030
Well, that was before I met you.

177
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,230
Also, I'm your dad.

178
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,400
You abandoned us.

179
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,680
You abandoned Mom and me, and now you say what?

180
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:40,060
What now, then? What?

181
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,620
Should I beg? Should I?

182
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,480
If that's all, I'm leaving.

183
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,980
- Hey, hold on. 
 - Hae Joon!

184
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,440
What's taking you so long?

185
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,890
I told you to start without me.

186
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,920
We can't. He came all the way from Seoul to see you.

187
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,810
Tell the ones who want to go to college in Seoul to play.

188
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,240
Shut your trap. Hurry up.

189
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,860
"Seoul." "College"?

190
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,890
That's right. Okay.

191
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:11,920
Focus.

192
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,030
Is Number 10 Kang Hae Joon?

193
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:22,620
Yes. He's great at passing and just as great at shooting.

194
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:27,520
If his game management is that good, he can probably go to the pro league, too.

195
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,270
I can't tell since he's hiding in this rural town.

196
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,660
He'd be scouted right away if he went to Myungju University.

197
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,130
We know the limits of doing well without support.

198
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,980
   

199
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,290
Oh my, who are you?

200
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:42,020
I'm just a parent who was passing by.

201
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,070
By the way, Number 10 over there, he's good at this, right?

202
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,110
Is he really good?

203
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,170
   

204
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,600
   

205
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,170
Do I have to come back here in two weeks?

206
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,840
He keeps making me travel far.

207
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,790
 San Ha. 

208
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,370
Dad told me to wash the sheets.

209
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:11,200
I washed them yesterday.

210
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,100
- What? 
 - They're new.

211
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,600
Are they?

212
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:30,300
What?

213
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,730
I told you not to sit on my bed.

214
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,360
I'm lying down, though.

215
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,690
- Get out. 
 - Why?

216
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,090
Since I'm already here, let me stay a minute.

217
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,560
Don't come up to the third floor from now on.

218
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,540
- Why not? 
 - The CSAT is next week.

219
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,260
I need to focus. Hurry.

220
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,090
But why–

221
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,170
Come on.

222
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,560
She should be more careful.

223
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:23,930
Hey, mine, too. I forgot to put in my gym clothes.

224
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:26,730
These are almost done. Do them separately.

225
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,220
Here.

226
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,280
Why would you put something wet in there? Seriously.

227
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,380
Why are you so annoyed?

228
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:39,960
Doesn't Kim San Ha seem sensitive these days?

229
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,350
He has always been sensitive.

230
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,210
It's just a little worse since he became a 12th-grader.

231
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,690
Is that such a big deal?

232
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:53,010
The CSAT needs to be over soon.

233
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,340
"Your mind will be clear, and your stomach won't be upset."

234
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,130
"You'll easily solve problems you didn't know."

235
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:06,400
- Is someone taking the CSAT? 
 - My boyfriend.

236
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,320
Your boyfriend is in Grade 10, though.

237
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,530
I broke up with him ages ago.

238
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,000
He's a coward who ran away.

239
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,270
"Ran away"?

240
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,560
At the park last time.

241
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,570
Even so, aren't you moving on too fast?

242
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:25,980
All the important events in the world always occur suddenly.

243
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,090
Should I make one, too?

244
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,120
With red here?

245
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,100
No, it's purple.

246
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,950
Purple, purple...

247
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,830
I would love to have an oppa.

248
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,150
Do you want to take one?

249
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,730
Kang Hae Joon, if possible.

250
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,380
Come on.

251
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,220
Too weak. You need to hit it harder.

252
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,190
We are almost there. Keep it up!

253
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:03,610
♫  There was a time when I was filled with hopes about my dream  ♫

254
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,260
Five hundred won, a hundred won.

255
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:11,780
♫  That dream made me feel like I owned the world  ♫

256
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:20,190
♫  My empty heart was filled with promises we made  ♫

257
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,280
♫  I didn’t even know it was cold  ♫

258
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,740
   

259
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,590
Don't hold back on the rolled omelet.

260
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,090
Okay.

261
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,280
The doorsill! Don't step on the doorsill.

262
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,210
Stay right there.

263
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,420
The doorsill!

264
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,400
Be careful, or you'll lose good luck.

265
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,340
♫  We were dazzling and were united as one  ♫

266
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:53,410
- Dad, is it done? 
 - Yes, it is. All done.

267
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,960
- Take this. 
 - What?

268
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,450
Eat the chocolate when you're low on sugar.

269
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,540
What are you so nervous about?

270
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,820
I'm nervous for some reason.

271
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,080
I packed the stuff you usually eat.

272
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,480
But you don't have to eat it if you can't.

273
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,410
All right. Let's go. Let's go.

274
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,100
Fighting!

275
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,720
Boldly skip the questions you don't know.

276
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,460
If worst comes to worst, roll your pencil.

277
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,140
And don't miss the right answers.

278
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,260
Okay.

279
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:29,000
Today's dinner will be a special one, right?

280
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,300
Of course. I asked Madam to prepare the best meat she had.

281
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,080
- Yes. 
 - That's not it.

282
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,900
On days like this, you step back so they can have fun by themselves.

283
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,130
Mr. Yoon can grab one with me.

284
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,040
As if.

285
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,100
We should take care of the children who had a long day, not grab a drink.

286
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,340
Dad, do we still have the tent we used last year?

287
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,930
We do have the tent, but why?

288
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,550
Dad, you can go grab a drink with Ahjusshi.

289
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,490
I'll take care of things here.

290
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,900
Will you?

291
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,900
What will you do?

292
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,860
I'll have to invite Dal over, too.

293
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:08,260
   

294
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,880
 It's generally said to be a bit harder compared to the mock exam, 

295
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,920
 but it's said to be a lot harder than last year's. 

296
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,820
 This year's Korean Language and Math were harder than last year's. 

297
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,540
 So it was said to have fulfilled the assessment function. 

298
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,020
Yes, it's over!

299
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,780
 - Gosh, I wrecked it. 
 - I'm doomed. 

300
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,230
 I'm done for. 

301
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,700
Hey.

302
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:32,500
Which answer choice appeared the most?

303
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,990
- Which one did you choose? 
 - Number three.

304
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,720
Oh, number three did appear the most.

305
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,480
But you're in liberal arts.

306
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,440
It's different from mine.

307
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,260
Oh, you're right.

308
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:51,180
You got the message to wash your hands and go up to the rooftop, right?

309
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,030
Did they say they'll order chicken?

310
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,450
I don't know. Let's go.

311
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,630
What are you doing? Take a seat.

312
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,310
Did you also come?

313
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,620
How did you do on your exam?

314
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,650
Aigoo, you're supposed to take exams using your usual skills.

315
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,480
He's saying he didn't do well.

316
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,540
Who put up the tent?

317
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,700
Ahjusshi put up the tent.

318
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,280
Dad made the soybean paste stew and pork belly.

319
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,810
Dal brought the snacks.

320
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:29,310
- What about you? 
 - Me?

321
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,930
I showed up.

322
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,050
Anyhow.

323
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,980
Congrats on finishing the CSAT.

324
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:01,600
Did you both apply to Myungju University?

325
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,140
It's decided for Hae Joon, and I need to pass the admissions.

326
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,650
How great. You get to go to school together.

327
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,270
Our classes will be different. How can we go to school together?

328
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:14,200
Why can't you? You can just schedule...

329
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,260
Why aren't you careful?

330
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,230
You scared me.

331
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,980
Hey, your yelling scared me more.

332
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,710
I just got singed a bit.

333
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,560
You still need some ointment.

334
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,010
You two can keep eating.

335
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:42,720
I'll be right back.

336
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,830
Hey, it's fine. He won't be upset for too long.

337
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,230
He has never hurt anybody.

338
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,980
I see.

339
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,110
I'm fine, right?

340
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,530
It's nothing, right?

341
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,640
I thought you got seriously hurt.

342
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:17,270
The CSAT is over now, so stop being so sensitive.

343
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:20,300
Was I being sensitive?

344
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:23,110
You told me not to even come up to the third floor.

345
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:28,860
That's not necessarily because of the CSAT.

346
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,710
What, then?

347
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:38,690
It's fine. Go back up.

348
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,060
What?

349
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:54,110
Let's give those two some time alone.

350
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,910
This is long enough.

351
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:28,470
Here, eat this.

352
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:31,520
N-No, I'll do it myself.

353
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,920
Okay.

354
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:52,610
Hey, my mom was here.

355
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,370
Your mom?

356
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,350
Yes.

357
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,830
I thought I should at least tell you.

358
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,210
I'm glad.

359
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:10,780
Why couldn't she come all this time?

360
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,570
I don't know.

361
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,560
I couldn't even see her face.

362
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,290
She borrowed money from Dad ten years ago.

363
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:23,180
She only repaid him and left without seeing me.

364
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,490
Why?

365
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,520
I guess she didn't want to see me.

366
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,130
But you missed her.

367
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:39,310
You even looked for her in the streets.

368
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,140
Not at all. I hate her now.

369
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,340
She said she won't see me, so wh-what can I possibly...

370
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,720
I resent her.

371
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,400
But I also miss her.

372
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,850
I think I miss her even more.

373
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,120
I'm such a fool, right?

374
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,540
Do you want some onions? Should I grill them?

375
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:27,010
Onions? Hey, the onions...

376
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,210
Hey, why are you crying?

377
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:40,440
I always cry when someone else cries.

378
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,120
But I'm not crying.

379
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,880
You look like you are.

380
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,540
I mean, well... I do feel like crying.

381
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,020
But I know it, too.

382
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,190
You like San Ha, right?

383
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,910
Hey, don't worry. I didn't tell San Ha.

384
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,900
A third party shouldn't get involved in such things.

385
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,100
You should tell him yourself.

386
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,230
N-No, I don't.

387
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:39,110
I don't like San Ha Sunbae.

388
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,040
Oh, is that so?

389
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,420
I swear I really don't.

390
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,410
Of course, you'd say you don't.

391
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:51,120
I'll just say you don't.

392
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,710
Hey, I said I would grill it for you.

393
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,300
 Spit it out. Spit it. 

394
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,430
 - It's spicy. Spit it out.  
 - He's shouting.

395
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,050
 How many times did I say I really don't? 

396
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:10,870
Hey, all right. I got it.

397
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:14,330
Let me tell you, just in case. San Ha doesn't like Hui Joo.

398
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:16,370
I'm certain about that, so don't worry.

399
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,320
I said I really don't.

400
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,780
What is she talking about?

401
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:28,600
Joo Won, did you put ointment on?

402
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:29,970
I should've done it instead of you.

403
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,760
No, I'm fine.

404
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,040
Isn't it about time for the last bus?

405
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,910
Your mom will worry if you stay out too late.

406
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,180
Walk her to the stop.

407
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,710
Excuse me?

408
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:44,120
You should walk her, Kang Hae Joon.

409
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,560
I'll...

410
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,890
walk her to the bus stop.

411
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,210
It's okay, right?

412
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,670
I'll come with you, then.

413
00:30:57,670 --> 00:30:59,910
Do you want me to clean this up alone?

414
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,000
Text me when you get home.

415
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,110
- Make sure you see her get on the bus. 
 - Yes.

416
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,820
Let's go.

417
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,360
I'll go now.

418
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,800
Take care.

419
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,980
Can't you read the room?

420
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,510
Don't you know to stay out of it when you should?

421
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:34,680
Why?

422
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,620
Why is everyone telling me to catch on lately?

423
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:43,020
Why? Did Kim San Ha say he liked Dal?

424
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,280
Aigoo, you're seriously...

425
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,910
Hey, use your brain.

426
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:52,180
- He doesn't? 
 - He doesn't.

427
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:54,510
I thought it was about to get complicated.

428
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:56,700
Come on, clean up.

429
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,020
 She doesn't even know her friend likes Kim San Ha. 

430
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,980
 He doesn't even know Dal likes him. 

431
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:24,070
E-Excuse me.

432
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,580
I'm saying this not to be misunderstood...

433
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,510
but I don't have feelings for you, Sunbae.

434
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:34,770
I know. You like Kang Hae Joon.

435
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,380
Try to be understanding.

436
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:42,450
Kang Hae Joon is clueless in these matters.

437
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:46,520
He's the type to understand only if you're straightforward with him.

438
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,550
I'll never be able to get to him, then.

439
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,120
Why didn't you tell him?

440
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,060
It was great timing.

441
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,890
What if I never get to see him after?

442
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:05,250
Once I confess, I can never go back to before I confessed.

443
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,580
That's true.

444
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,310
He might say he'd never see you again.

445
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,720
I can just walk alone from here.

446
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,030
It must be hard to clean up by themselves. You should head back.

447
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:24,320
Joo Won told me to see you get on the bus.

448
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,880
Let's go.

449
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,120
Okay.

450
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:46,240
   

451
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,850
   

452
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,000
Why do you keep calling me?

453
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,950
If I didn't answer, just take that as an answer.

454
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,270
 Oppa. 

455
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,110
So Hui, it's you.

456
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,120
 I told her you mistook her for someone else, but I don't think it worked. 

457
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,470
She cried herself to sleep.

458
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:14,640
 What did you think I'd say that you let So Hui call me? 

459
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,180
I was sure it wouldn't be something nice.

460
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,480
Don't use So Hui as your shield.

461
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,520
 I'll talk to So Hui myself next time. 

462
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,710
Did you do well on the exam?

463
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:35,470
 I called to ask about that. 

464
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,980
Did you choose which college to apply to?

465
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,170
Not yet.

466
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,700
You must have a few options.

467
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,210
 If you choose Seoul, we'll see each other often. 

468
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,740
 I need to know in advance to help you. 

469
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,470
No. I'll be going to college here.

470
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:51,750
 Will you live the rest of your life in that rural town? 

471
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,960
 Is that really all you're worth? 

472
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,170
Yes. That's all I'm worth.

473
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:03,460
 I'll have to be on my deathbed to see your face, won't I? 

474
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,700
- Why do you talk like that– 
  - I'm hanging up. 

475
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,200
   

476
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,750
   

477
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,760
Did you truly get only one wrong?

478
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,990
I guess that's my limit.

479
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,550
Who are you calling?

480
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:01,890
I need to ask the administration to get an estimate for a banner.

481
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,710
Did you tell your father you're applying for Seoul National University's medical school?

482
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,590
Hold on a minute.

483
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,610
What's your dad's phone number?

484
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:20,930
I've been telling you for a year that I'm going to Myungju University.

485
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,100
I said I would discuss this with your father.

486
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,310
Gosh, why bother leaving home to suffer?

487
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,920
Should I leave my warm home and warm meals?

488
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,350
Why? Why do you insist on going to Myungju University?

489
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:35,370
I mean, Myungju University is closest to home.

490
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:39,840
Hey, people wish to enroll at Yeonhui University, but they can't.

491
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,500
But what did you say? "It's closest to home"?

492
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,160
Do you have treasure hidden in your house?

493
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:53,190
Don't you aspire to play basketball where the big leagues are?

494
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,650
Why do you play basketball?

495
00:36:58,270 --> 00:37:00,340
Because I take after my dad.

496
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,660
Anyway, I'll beat all the Seoul guys this time, Teacher.

497
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,670
I'll go to Myungju University and beat all the Seoul guys.

498
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,080
I'll just win against them all.

499
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,070
Why, you little.

500
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,380
Oh, really? Why, you little...

501
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,740
What? Hey, stay put.

502
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:15,650
You're fooling around again. Stay put.

503
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,500
   

504
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:24,860
   

505
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:32,340
I'm nervous.

506
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,240
Let's take it easy today.

507
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,020
Sure. They're nothing.

508
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,030
I'll just make ten three-pointers and sub out.

509
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,370
Jeong Hoon, you can beat him on your own. You know, right?

510
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,080
Hey, the game's starting soon!

511
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,390
Oh, San Ha.

512
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,700
Didn't you talk with Dad over the phone?

513
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,580
Your dad told me to go with whatever you want.

514
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:06,860
Are you laughing? Can you laugh right now?

515
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,200
When a person is born, he goes to Seoul.

516
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,130
When a horse is born, it goes to Jeju Island.

517
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:15,190
You were born in Seoul, so why won't you go to Seoul?

518
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,630
Look here now.

519
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,580
As one sows, so shall he reap.

520
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:21,600
However, if you reap what you didn't sow, then the seed

521
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,710
must return to where it was from. Don't you agree?

522
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:47,650
I don't even know if this will be of any use.

523
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,950
- Hurry up. 
 - There won't be any seats.

524
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:59,050
There won't be any seats. Hurry.

525
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,310
Hurry up and come.

526
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:02,740
We won't get a seat.

527
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,260
O-Over here!

528
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,910
Over here.

529
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,850
Nice seats.

530
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,150
Right?

531
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,300
I came a bit early to get the best seats.

532
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,800
- Do you like basketball? 
 - No.

533
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,100
I like you.

534
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,840
Why is he so bold?

535
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,280
I can never change my heart once it's set.

536
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,420
Just like a rock.

537
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,090
I can spend time with you throughout the game.

538
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,900
So would I miss this chance?

539
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,370
- Do you want to change seats? 
 - No.

540
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,440
Where's your sketchbook? Let's show some support.

541
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,150
If you also want to cheer, hold the other end.

542
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,640
I prepared my own.

543
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,110
   

544
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,700
   

545
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:31,400
No need to be intimidated. That Unni has nothing going on with Kang Hae Joon.

546
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,200
Yes, you're right.

547
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,850
   

548
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,360
   

549
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,250
Over here!

550
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,610
Here.

551
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,520
Why?

552
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,600
It's nothing. I must've been mistaken.

553
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,670
It's tight here.

554
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,170
There are no other seats.

555
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:24,450
 The friendly match between the two schools known for their basketball teams, 

556
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:29,100
 Haedong High and Hwimyeong High will begin in five minutes. 

557
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,000
- He's not a big deal. 
 - He's got nothing.

558
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,540
He can't even grab a ball properly.

559
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,640
Do you know him?

560
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,440
Well, he was here in Grade 10.

561
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,800
He lost the captain position to Hae Joon all the time.

562
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,910
I heard he's learning from a pro or something, but he just transferred to Seoul.

563
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,470
But why is he doing that?

564
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:52,810
Ignore him. Safety always comes first.

565
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,100
Long time no see.

566
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:08,030
Your dad still makes kalguksu, right?

567
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,420
Yes.

568
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:14,780
Aigoo, his business must be doing badly.

569
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:17,430
Those were on sale at the outlet.

570
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,440
Learn elite basketball today for free.

571
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,310
You can take notes, too.

572
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,210
And don't cry when you lose.

573
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,050
Guys,

574
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,840
tighten your shoelaces.

575
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,480
If I see anyone's feet stuck to the ground,

576
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,270
you're dead meat after the game.

577
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,290
   

578
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,130
One shot!

579
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,680
   

580
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:31,690
♫  There was a time when I was filled with hopes about my dream  ♫

581
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:40,360
♫  That dream made me feel like I owned the world  ♫

582
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:48,850
♫  My empty heart was filled with promises we made  ♫

♫  Everything existed for us  ♫

587
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:13,620

588
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:16,060

00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:24,100
♫  Those shattering days when we lived for each other  ♫

590
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,510
Well done!

591
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:32,800
   

592
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,880

597
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:24,100
- Don't, don't. 
 - Don't stop me!

598
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,630
When will you teach me some elite basketball?

599
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,030
Don't cry.

600
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,590
Darn, so annoying.

601
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:47,830
   

602
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,520

00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:19,370

00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,480

 It's okay! It's okay! 

607
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:32,380
♫  It can't stop me  ♫

608
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,600
   

609
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:56,540

00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,150
   

612
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,560
Darn it.

613
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,510
Why are you here again?

614
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,780
Gosh, you scared me.

615
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,790
What? Can't a dad watch his son's basketball game?

616
00:47:31,790 --> 00:47:33,620
What are you scheming?

617
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,680
Children should stay out of this.

618
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,040
The adults will take care of it.

619
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,970
That's because I made a great pass.

620
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:53,420
What are you saying? It's because I scored the basket.

621
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,490
Without my pass, you couldn't have scored.

622
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,970
What?

623
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:06,840
Oh, hey!

624
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,470
We have an afterparty to go to.

625
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:10,090
It'll be just a moment.

626
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,750
Hey, I'm hungry.

627
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,620
That man was just here.

628
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:16,220
Who?

629
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:18,370
Your birth dad.

630
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:21,260
And?

631
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:23,250
Did he leave?

632
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:26,570
I think he's on his way to Ahjusshi to discuss things.

633
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,350
Darn it.

634
00:48:29,390 --> 00:48:33,810
Hey, come if you can, even if it's late! Got it?

635
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,430
- Let's just go. 
 - Let's go.

636
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:37,280
- Let's go eat without him. 
 - Forget him.

637
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,450
Dad, you could've come to watch if it weren't for the store.

638
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:43,910
I raised Kang Hae Joon well, didn't I?

639
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:46,610
That's great if he won.

640
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:48,260
Really?

641
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,900
Then I'll have dinner with Ahjusshi.

642
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:56,430
Okay. Call me if you'll be late.

643
00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:57,880
All right.

644
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:07,810
What are you doing here?

645
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:10,110
This is my store.

646
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:13,600
You didn't even watch the game during such a historic victory.

647
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,220
Instead, you're carrying that stuff around?

648
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:19,000
My goodness. Get in the car.

649
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,990
I'm not getting in.

650
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,550
Aigoo, I knew this would happen.

651
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,870
The envelope got bigger.

652
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:55,570
This very famous school sent three students to prestigious universities last year.

653
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:57,870
Why didn't you tell me Hae Joon was great at basketball?

654
00:49:57,870 --> 00:49:59,560
Did you hide it from me?

655
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,010
Why are you speaking informally?

656
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:04,100
I've heard parents go crazy when their children are lacking.

657
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:08,320
But who knew a parent could go crazy when their children are incredible, too?

658
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:12,000
Why go crazy when they're incredible?

659
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,620
I know Hae Joon is incredible,

660
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,430
but I haven't gone crazy.

661
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:24,730
That's what's driving me crazy.

662
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:28,310
You know it. You're well aware.

663
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:30,900
Then, you should've sent him to Seoul!

664
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:34,840
All the boys in the opposing team from Seoul learned from the pros.

665
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:38,030
How will he beat kids like them in this small town

666
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:41,030
without a proper director or coach? He's not a god!

667
00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:44,420
How great would it have been to send him to a basketball class?

668
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:47,710
He would have had a notable title by now!

669
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:54,120
How will you raise him when he's so amazing?

670
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,330
If you can't, I'm telling you I will!

671
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:01,240
Why do you keep getting in his way?

672
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:03,990
You scum.

673
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:07,860
"In his way"? In whose way?

674
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,950
Don't.

675
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:14,340
Mr. Yoon opens the store at 5:00 a.m. and prepares the flour.

676
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:17,410
Then, he goes home at 7:00 a.m. to feed the kids breakfast.

677
00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:19,000
For ten years straight.

678
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,000
He fed the child you abandoned like that for ten years straight. Got that?

679
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,810
I mean, feeding the children is a given.

680
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:30,530
Are there any children out there who starve these days?

681
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:36,000
And what I'm talking about is something on a higher level...

682
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,370
Seriously. Tragedy doesn't come after failure.

683
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:43,250
It starts with complacency.

684
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:47,030
What you're doing is setting up my son, Yang Hae Joon, for failure!

685
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:48,810
Hae Jon's last name is Kang.

686
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:52,620
Who are you to change his surname as you wish?

687
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,950
If anyone is sending him to America, it'll be me.

688
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:10,050
By what means?

689
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:11,890
That's for me to figure out.

690
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:13,740
The store is under my name, too.

691
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:15,450
"The store"? This store?

692
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:17,270
This store that has been around for ages?

693
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:20,430
This jerk! Where is the salt?

694
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:23,400
Darn. Fine. We will see.

695
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:29,370
That fool. Petty scum.

696
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,290
This jerk.

697
00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:38,070
You scumbag.

698
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:40,370
He is Yang Hae Joon.

699
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:43,790
He's my son, no matter what anyone says.

700
00:52:43,790 --> 00:52:45,310
Hey!

701
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:50,060
Wh-Who does he think he is?

702
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:53,140
Gosh, that jerk is really fast.

703
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,020
Why are you looking at these?

704
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:59,590
Let me just take a look.

705
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:02,040
It doesn't cost money to look.

706
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,120
Wow...

707
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:07,720
They have a real basketball team here.

708
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:11,790
I would've looked into these if only I had known.

709
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:15,430
Well, now you do. So will you let that man take him?

710
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:17,450
No way.

711
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:21,160
I won't.

712
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,060
I'm not someone who should be treated like this.

713
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:34,120
Why is he running like that?

714
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,310
Why did you visit Dad again?

715
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,360
What did you tell him?

716
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,930
Did that arrogant-looking boy tell on me?

717
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:49,580
What did you tell him?

718
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,490
Get in for now.

719
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,050
Do you want to talk in the middle of the street?

720
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,340
It has been over a year since I quit flour.

721
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:06,810
We aren't here to eat.

722
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,840
What did you tell Dad?

723
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:10,580
"Dad"?

724
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:14,890
We talked about America and basketball. All that I mentioned before.

725
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:16,300
I'm not going.

726
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:17,670
You have to.

727
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:19,740
I saw you play today.

728
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,750
I'm not going!

729
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:22,380
Go.

730
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,970
Why are you angry?

731
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:28,980
I'm the one who unfairly got rejected for offering to support you.

732
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:30,760
Honestly, your dad...

733
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:35,790
If that man wasn't lying about raising you like his own,

734
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:38,100
he would tell you to follow me.

735
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,880
If he stops you from going,

736
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:44,140
then you're just someone else's child to him.

737
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,480
Stop with the nonsense.

738
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,360
Why would he send his child away?

739
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,950
To prosper.

740
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:53,760
What parent would keep his child in this rural town

741
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,680
to block any chance of studying?

742
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:05,820
I can achieve everything I want to in Haedong.

743
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,470
That's that.

744
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,010
I'm leaving.

745
00:55:09,910 --> 00:55:11,410
Hey.

746
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:13,140
What?

747
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:16,860
Do you...

748
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:21,800
think this world is easy for someone like me

749
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,340
to get a free pass in life?

750
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:27,000
What are you saying?

751
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:30,900
I'm saying I've had to cross the line at times in my life.

752
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,780
If I were to go astray in the slightest,

753
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:38,820
that small-town restaurant...

754
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,560
could disappear as soon as tomorrow.

755
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:49,100
Stop being ridiculous.

756
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:52,030
Feel free to resist me if you're curious.

757
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:58,270
I'm telling you loud and clear.

758
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:00,160
Don't mess with Dad.

759
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:02,630
If you want to see how I'll react,

760
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:05,190
feel free to challenge me.

761
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,910
Even when he throws a tantrum,

762
00:56:16,910 --> 00:56:18,990
he's adorable.

763
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,000
 If I were to go astray in the slightest, 

764
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,500
 that small-town restaurant 

765
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,600
 could disappear as soon as tomorrow. 

766
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,000
Darn it!

767
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:05,300
 Is the afterparty not over yet? 
   

768
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:16,320
 Come home and eat if you're still hungry. 

769
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:27,800
Forget it.

770
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,680
I told him loud and clear.

771
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,490
I'll just tell him to leave again if he comes back.

772
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,930
Yes.

773
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,840
   

774
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:47,700
Did that ahjusshi come back? Why?

775
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,140
Probably to convince him to go to America with him.

776
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:54,350
But if he goes to America, he probably won't be able to come back.

777
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:59,190
What if Kang Hae Joon is unable to reject him again?

778
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:01,170
That won't happen.

779
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,990
He even plans to attend college nearby.

780
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:05,670
America?

781
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:07,290
No way.

782
00:58:07,290 --> 00:58:09,170
That's true.

783
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:13,300
By the way, this is really good.

784
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:14,930
Stop eating.

785
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,130
You said it's good.

786
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:19,600
Restrain yourself so we can eat it with everyone at home.

787
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:23,420
Ahjusshi, give us one bag of red beans and one bag of Choux cream fillings.

788
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,920
All right, please wait a moment.

789
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,970
- Do you want me to carry it? 
 - No, it has to stay crispy.

790
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,420
Wait until we get home to eat it.

791
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,750
I thought you went to an afterparty? Did you not eat much?

792
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:46,290
Yes.

793
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:49,720
Sure.

794
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,070
Eat slowly.

795
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:14,470
Okay.

796
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:23,480
I'm asking you just in case.

797
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:30,090
I heard the Seoul team you beat today are actually really good players.

798
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,700
To have beaten that kind of team...

799
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:40,930
Do you want to play basketball at a higher level?

800
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:47,210
Why all of a sudden?

801
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:49,430
Did someone say something?

802
00:59:49,430 --> 00:59:54,670
No, I just heard kids go to America to pursue basketball these days.

803
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:59,530
I haven't been able to watch your games these days because I'm so busy with the store.

804
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:04,820
The townspeople say it's a waste to let your skills rot in this town.

805
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,730
What townspeople?

806
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:08,110
What?

807
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:12,200
Just some townspeople.

808
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,140
It's not like Seoul or America is close by.

809
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:16,800
How can I live there alone?

810
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,800
I mean, you can still think about it.

811
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,180
This crab.

812
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,130
 So he just left? 

813
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:29,440
Yes.

814
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,230
I told him to leave and never come back.

815
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:33,570
Where did you buy this?

816
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:35,530
It's the best fish-shaped bun I've had recently.

817
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:37,160
Take your time eating it.

818
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,900
How can I eat any slower than this?

819
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,630
Who is it at this hour? 
    

820
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:47,340
My mom.

821
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:48,660
Are you not answering it?

822
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:51,990
It's probably So Hui. I made a mistake last time.

823
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,730
You guys can keep eating.

824
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:55,570
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

825
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,230
Hello?

826
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:07,780
Sorry?

827
01:01:21,130 --> 01:01:22,980
 Dad! 

828
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:25,230
I...

829
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:31,400
Mom... Mom was in an accident.

830
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,440
So Hui's dad, in the driver's seat...

831
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,840
passed away.

832
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:57,690


833
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:22,860
♫  One day  ♫

834
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,800
   

835
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:27,980
♫  A precious memory  ♫

836
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:35,610
♫  Entered my small heart the day you smiled brightly  ♫

837
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:40,670
♫  And another day  ♫

838
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:44,020
♫  The memory of you holding me  ♫

839
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:52,080
♫  The day I wept freely, surrendering all my pain and struggles  ♫

840
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:57,170
♫  We loved all those days  ♫
