You're not!

72
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,530
Dad is acting like that out of concern for you.

73
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:33,920
He could be opposing us because Huiju is better than me.

When I said I'd marry you, he was against that, too.

He said to stop talking nonsense and didn't even take me seriously.

78
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,170
That was truly nonsense, though.

It won't be good if you keep treating me like this.

It's natural for him to oppose us.

How could anyone give a daughter like Juwon so easily?

86
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,930
Any dad would feel she's too precious.

87
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:14,990
I would feel that way, too.

95
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,910
Is it because it's too sudden?

Even so, how could you leave so sternly?

97
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,110
Wait, is it because you don't like Sanha as Juwon's match?

98
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,920
Yeah, I don't.

99

A single dad with an only daughter

so I'm sorry. And I don't like him

103

Go ahead!

106
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,650
Is Sanha someone who'd make Juwon suffer?

107
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,820
Regardless of who's at fault,

108
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,430
does Sanha or Juwon ever openly tell us about their struggles?

109
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,250
Do you think they'll ask us to take their side in fear of worrying us?

110
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,690
Why do you think about them fighting and suffering first?

111
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,400
Is life only about rainbows and butterflies?

112
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,610
Is that why you live alone?

113
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,300
Come on! They're different from Sanha's mom and me!

114
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,450
And it's not like they're getting married right now.

115
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,460
That's what I'm worried about!

116
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,460
What happens if they decide they won't work out anymore?

117
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:21,550
Will you tell them to go back to being good brother and sister?

118
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,960
You know they're not the type to bring this up lightly.

119
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,660
That's why I'm against them. That's exactly why!

120
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,800
Will you really make them swear,

121
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,580
"You two better not break up, no matter what happens"

122
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,640

123
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:49,040

124
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,270
"Come home anytime.

125
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,090
I'm on your side, no matter what." I want to say that.

126
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,330
But it's Sanha. How can I say that?

127
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,480
I'll only think about my Juwon.

128

182
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,200
No, you have so many reasons to oppose us.

183
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,120
If you said you would never approve of us,

184
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,770
I wasn't confident I'd be able to find a solution.

185
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:33,110
I reassured Juwon not to worry.

186
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,960
But I was scared I wouldn't be able to do anything.

187
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:41,840
So I hoped you wouldn't be against us.

188
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,670
Why make things complicated when you already know?

189
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,040
Why even start it?

190
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,440
You should've cut her off in advance.

191
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,640
You should've told her, "Let's treasure each other like siblings."

192
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,300
Even if Juwon liked you,

193
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,470
you should've discouraged her.

194
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,760
I couldn't.

195
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,280
It was impossible,

196
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,970
so I clung to her.

197
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,740
My precious Juwon.

198
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,890
My daughter is everything to me.

199
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:26,500
I'll do everything I can.

200
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:31,210
I'll wait until you approve of us, whether it takes a year or two.

201
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,770
I'll resolve all of your worries.

202
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,100
Resolve?

203
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,190
What can you resolve?

204
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,590
Because of me...

205
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,590
she secretly looked

206
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,730
at her mom's photo, not to upset me.

207
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,770
So it doesn't show that she's motherless

208
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,650
and to act indifferent to people whispering,

209
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,570
she insisted you were her real brother with a different last name.

210
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,330
And she wore a smile every day. How do you think she felt?

211
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,760
How on earth will you "resolve" the fact

212
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,260
that Juwon is that kind of girl?

213
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,620
I'll make sure Juwon doesn't have a hard time.

214
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,210
I'll make sure she doesn't struggle.

215
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:32,150
Sanha.

216
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,810
You know, I just want

217
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:43,400
Juwon to live like everyone else, ordinarily, without having to try so hard.

218
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,670
That's all.

219
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,430
I'm sorry.

220
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,170
I'm fine.

221
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:51,530
I always told myself ever since developing feelings for Juwon.

222
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,850
I want to grow up

223
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:02,160
and live ordinary lives with Juwon like everyone else.

224
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:10,330
I want to live like that with Juwon, Ahjussi.

225
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,130
You didn't have to buy this!

226
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,870
You probably skipped breakfast again.

227
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,430
It's fine since I usually don't.

228
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:00,780
Exactly. Start eating breakfast from now on.

229
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,390
All right. Let's eat.

230
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:05,600
Gosh, it looks delicious.

231
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,560
Let's eat. Here.

232
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,260
Do you want to live with me?

233
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,700
Never mind. I'll live with you.

234
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,200
I planned to move in with Dad,

235
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,200
but you live alone.

236
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,840
Dad has Ahjussi and the kids.

237
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,100
I've lived alone for so long that I'm used to it.

238
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,500
As if! You can't fool me twice.

239
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,010
Let's move together to Dad's neighborhood.

240
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:46,350
- Haejun-
- I'll do what I want.

241
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:56,940
What's this?

242
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,150
Oh, this?

243
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,980
Jeongjae sent me a few of your photos.

244
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,920
Isn't there anything else? It's embarrassing.

245
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,840
How so?

246
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,060
All right, then.

247
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,040
- What about this one?
- No!

248
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,560
- This one?
- No, something else.

249
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,620
How about this one? I like this one.

250
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:22,740
They all came out nice.

251
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,990
You don't play basketball these days?

252
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,110
- I don't.
- Why not?

253
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,800
What's the use when I can't even go pro?

254
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:42,700
You have the same expression here as you did as a baby.

255
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,660
This is exactly how you looked as an excited baby.

256
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,550
Is that right?

257
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,900
Do you have to be a pro?

258
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,400
Did you learn basketball to become a pro?

259
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,120
Why don't you play when it makes you this happy?

260
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,780
Something's off. Tell me the truth.

261
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,650
Where were you last night? Why are you changing the subject?

262
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,570
Are you at work?

263
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,580
Did you visit Dad?

264
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,910
You have me in the palm of your hands.

265
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,680
You couldn't get his approval?

266
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,060
Yeah, I couldn't.

267
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,450
Did you get scolded?

268
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,590
No.

269
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,790
Stop by the store later.

270
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,200
Why?

271
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,160
Because I miss you.

272
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,610
You can see me now, then.

273
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,900
[Juwon]
So, he's at the hospital right now?

274
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,580
I'll be right there.

275
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,410
He's fine. His forehead is a bit bruised, and his ribs are slightly injured.

276
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,080
See? Huiju is taking care of him.

277
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,080
The internist isn't here, so don't worry too much.

278
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,040
Also, look here.

279
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,150
Y-You have me here.

280
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:19,190
I told you I didn't have to come to the hospital.

281
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:22,490
Trust your boyfriend more, Yoon Juwon.

282
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:28,990
Be gentle.

283
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,980
W-Wait, one second!

284
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,190
Wait, really? Is this real?

285
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,210
Dr. Lee, are you free?

286
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,550
You know we have a group wellness checkup, right?

287
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,820
Follow me.

288
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,610
Hurry up and go.

289
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:46,920
Elders, please come here and fill out the questionnaire in order.

290
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,470
If you need any help, I'm here for you.

291
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,840
Isn't that Mr. Yoon?

292
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,140
Mr. Yoon said he can't come to the wellness checkup because he's hungover.

293
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,800
What's this? What happened? Did you hurt your head?

294
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,160
I'm really fine.

295
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,070
What on earth did you do for Sanha's face to end up this way?

296
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,510
I mean, I was just...

297
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,610
It's not Juwon's fault. I was the one-

298
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:18,870
I'm sure you'd deny it even if it was Juwon's fault!

299
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,660
How upset will your father be to see this?

300
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,460
I'm really fine.

301
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,650
Aigoo, what will we do about that?

302
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,560
Hurry up and put it on.

303
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:47,540
It is you! I followed you because I thought I saw you!

304
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,440
My goodness. What's wrong with his face?

305
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,830
Did you do it?

306
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:56,480
I did do it, but...

307
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,650
- Madam, you came for the wellness checkup, right?
- Yeah...

308
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:03,100
Your turn must be coming up. Let's hurry up and go.

309
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,220
Never a dull moment, seriously.

310
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,150
Aigoo, what if it leaves a scar?

311
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,760
If it's not serious, it's fine. I'll get going.

312
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,570
Dad.

313
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:16,660
I have to go to the store because Madam isn't there, either.

314
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,560
How badly were you hurt?

315
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,400
I didn't need to come to the hospital.

316
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,850
But Juwon insisted I had to, so I came.

317
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:26,720
It's fine, then.

318
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,880
Juwon must've been scared.

319
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,140
How did you come so quickly?

320
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,330
You said you'll only think about Juwon.

321
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,780
I'll get going now.

322
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,400
If you came worried about Sanha, eat with us before you go!

323
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,190
How can a business owner eat when his store is unattended?

324
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:43,680
Aigoo, seriously.

325
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:47,190
I think I'll have to go back inside.

326
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,370
The neighborhood elders are here, too.

327
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,590
I'll call you later.

328
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,380
Yes, go back inside.

329
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,360
I'll drop off Juwon.

330
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,200
You got scared, huh?

331
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,530
It's fine.

332
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:02,340
Sanha is so calm that he's never even had a bone broken in his life.

333
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,790
Just look at Haejun. His entire body is full of scars and bruises.

334
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:09,180
They're all like that. Don't worry.

335
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,870
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

336
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,770
Don't say such a thing!

337
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,890
Shall we eat before we go?

338
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,840
Should I make you something tasty at the bakery? A brunch?

339
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,620
Sounds great. Let's go. Come on now.

340
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,000
Is your leg okay?

341
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,520
It's okay.

342
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,490
Let's talk for a bit.

343
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,640
I'm late to a meeting.

344
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,040
Taxi! Taxi!

345
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,260
Let's talk on the way, then.

346
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,610
Get in.

347
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,640
I couldn't even confirm properly because you left like that.

348
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,840
Sorry? Confirm what?

349
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,380
You said you like me?

350
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:36,740
- Yes.
- You've never liked Kim Sanha?

351
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,130
Yes.

352
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,370
But why didn't you tell me until now?

353
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,280
Because you don't like me, Sunbae.

354
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,020
Did I?

355
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,130
"Did I"?

356
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,630
But why'd you suddenly tell me?

357
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,760
Sorry?

358
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,210
Why'd you suddenly tell me something you didn't tell me 10 years ago?

359
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,280
Well, that's...

360
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,390
I got carried away that day.

361
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:14,480
I said it on impulse, too.

362
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:19,560
I regretted it a lot after confessing like that.

363
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,550
That's fine, then.

364
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:26,290
If it was impulsive for you, I'll just pretend I never heard you.

365
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:29,480
Just continue to think of me as Juwon's oppa.

366
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,750
Ahjussi, please drop me off here.

367
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:36,620
You want to get off here? It's in the middle of the road.

368
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,220
It's fine. You can just drop me off.

369
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,910
Just forget it.

370
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:51,410
You're like a sister I cherish only less than Juwon.

371
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:53,500
It'll continue like that.

372
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,640
Please drive her safely.

373
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,550
Let me see.
[Break Time]

374
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,000
Does it hurt a lot?

375
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,470
- It hurts.
- Wait here. I'll go grab some ice-

376
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:25,800
I should've told Ahjussi earlier, "My head is messed up because Juwon hit my head.

377
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,560
She has to take care of me now for good."

378
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:35,610
If you were hurt any worse, Dad might've beaten me to death.

379
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,860
- I'm sure you're wrong.
- I swear.

380
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,390
Didn't you see Dad's face earlier?

381
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:47,410
Dad must be against me, not you, Oppa.

382
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:49,000
Juwon.

383
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,290
I really like Ahjussi.

384
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:56,240
I want to like you more than Ahjussi does.

385
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,690
I can't lose to him.

386
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:02,670
But Ahjussi's so strong, I must try harder.

387
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:05,620
Yes, you need to try harder.

388
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:09,270
Did my dad eat here before he left?

389
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,800
Yes, he said he loves my brunch

390
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,230
since he always eats Korean food my dad makes.

391
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,810
Dad doesn't like to eat bread in the morning, though.

392
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,010
I don't think so.

393
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:23,080
He said he wants to eat the brunch I make every day from now on.

394
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,580
Gosh, that's great. How nice.

395
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,430
Didn't you just eat before coming in?

396
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,440
Hey, this is dessert.

397
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,560
- Sorry?
- Well, you see...

398
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:42,640
Juwon gave me a bunch of bread and grass, saying it was brunch or something.

399
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,330
But I became hungry soon after.

400
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,660
They say a man living alone has the hardest time eating meals on time.

401
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,600
I guess you don't have that problem because you have Mr. Yoon.

402
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:59,140
For your information, I eat whatever is given to me, whether it's bread or grass.

403
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:03,090
Man, to think about it, Mr. Yoon didn't raise just Sanha.

404
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:05,760
He also fed you, more or less.

405
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,350
Hey...

406
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:12,820
what's a good way to ask your in-laws to look favorably upon your child?

407
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,970
When I went to meet my wife's family for the first time,

408
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,990
my mother was really worried.

409
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:24,460
Saying there's nothing to like about a policeman son-in-law.

410
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,710
What's so bad about you, Lieutenant Kim?

411
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:29,120
That's not the point. I heard they're just saddened.

412
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:34,010
- Really?
- Anyhow, for the first meeting, prepare

413
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,520
lots of what her parents might like.

414
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,860
Right.

415
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,010
He went empty-handed with no plan and said, "We're dating."

416
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:43,800
Of course, that's not going to work. Aigoo.

417
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,550
I should've taught him these things sooner.

418
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:50,770
Excuse me, ma'am. How much is that one?

419
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,840
Aigoo...

420
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,730
What's with you?

421
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,940
My goodness...

422
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:12,070
Is it because of what Juwon did again?

423
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:15,420
What do you mean again? Juwon doesn't cause trouble all the time.

424
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,990
She cares for her brothers so much.

425
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,930
That's true.

426
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:28,910
I saw how Sanha was taking care of the neighborhood folks in that white gown.

427
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,620
How did he grow up so well? Even I was so proud of him.

428
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:39,130
That's all thanks to you and Juwon.

429
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:42,040
Think of when he first came to this area.

430
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,120
His face was...

431
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,940
so full of worries.

432
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,660
Whenever he was being cold to people,

433
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,280
he was just like his mother, you know.

434
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,630
Madam, please watch what you say.

435
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,770
Don't think like that.

436
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:00,490
Because you say those things out loud...

437
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,920
Never mind.

438
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,400
[Mr. Yoon's Kalguksu]

439
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,860
Oh, my, my...

440
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,200
- My goodness.
- Yes-

441
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,140
Are you okay?

442
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,400
Yes.

443
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,600
Well...

444
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,030
I'm sorry for startling you.

445
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:10,550
Not at all. I'm the one who suddenly showed up without calling...

446
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,910
Are you filming a movie?

447
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,370
Madam, did you finish trimming the cabbage?

448
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,880
- Of course.
- I see.

449
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,960
What about anchovies?

450
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,730
I finished them ages ago.

451
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,160
Haejun's mom, how are you still the same? You didn't age a bit.

452
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,070
Not at all.

453
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,220
I mean it.

454
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:54,130
I got so scared because you looked exactly the same as when you first came here.

455
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:56,300
I thought you were a ghost.

456
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,260
Where are those flies coming from?

457
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,610
I didn't even thank you properly all this time.

458
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,530
Thank you.

459
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:15,420
I mean, I'm not trying to get thanked.

460
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:21,610
But do you know how upset I was after I made a mistake of setting you two up?

461
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,170
- Madam, I...
- Yes.

462
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,990
You need to get going now.

463
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,740
- Huh?
- You should get off early.

464
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:32,390
You got a checkup and had blood drawn. You can't stand too long.

465
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,980
Please go home.

466
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:41,230
As I was saying, you have to take responsibility for Mr. Yoon

467
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:44,930
who aged so much from raising Haejun. Okay?

468
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,150
G-Get home safe.

469
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,530
Well...

470
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,550
I heard Park Dal publicly confessed to Haejun, huh?

471
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,480
So, what did Kang Haejun say?

472
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,430
You can ask the man himself.

473
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:08,690
What does Yoon Juwon like about this brat?

474
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:17,910
- It's true Juwon is too good for me.
- Of course.

475
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,580
Do Huiju, don't waste time poking around here and there.

476
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:24,510
Just tell Kang Haejun properly and get rejected quickly.

477
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,880
Hey!

478
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,360
One sure thing is you have no chance with Kang Haejun.

479
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,210
Just forget him before you get rejected and embarrass yourself.

480
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:36,390
We're a small, tight group of friends. We should tell it like it is.

481
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,660
What an asshole.

482
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:44,850
Okay.

483
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:54,870
Hey, is the basketball class you mentioned last time still open?

484
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:57,480
Really?

485
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,090
Really?

486
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:02,920
Are you really going to play basketball again?

487
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,600
Yes.

488
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,190
I'll call them right now, okay?

489
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,860
Right now!

490
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,270
By the way, why did you suddenly change your mind?

491
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:17,030
It's an important decision, so why'd you suddenly-

492
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,580
Could it be because of Dal?

493
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,870
What does Dal have to do with this?

494
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:26,590
The entire town knows Dal publicly confessed to you.

495
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,530
Why? Did you decide to go out with Dal?

496
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:35,310
Aren't you trying to spread your wings again to impress her?

497
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,640
Are you writing a novel?

498
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,640
It's because of my mom.

499
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,460
My mom wants to see me energetic again.

500
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,970
And I also...

501
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:49,470
Well, anyhow, that's the story.

502
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,050
Is that so?

503
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,830
By the way, does everyone really know?

504
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:59,330
I'm sure everyone in Haedong knows.

505
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,200
Why? Did you reject her?

506
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,210
Did Dal get rejected?

507
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,560
What do you mean get rejected?

508
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,310
It's not like that.

509
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,740
If you didn't accept her, that's rejection. What else?

510
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,150
This is what Jaeeun told me.

511
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,070
When Dal became a lawyer in Seoul and came back to Haedong,

512
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,070
her mom was furious.

513
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:29,190
Because Dal moved to the countryside instead of working at a law firm in Seoul.

514
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:33,020
So, she tells her to go on blind dates all the time to marry well, at least.

515
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,650
Gosh. To be honest, you two wouldn't have lasted long, even if you said yes.

516
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:42,350
Her mom wouldn't have left Dal alone.

517
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,540
I like you, Sunbae!

518
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,790
Now that I think about it, she might look fine outside,

519
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,850
but I feel sorry for her.

520
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,870
Gosh, this is driving me nuts. Why is it bothering me?

521
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:06,330
Aigoo, forget it. She and I aren't a good match anyway.

522
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:10,020
She seems fine, but why would she like me and go through all that?

523
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,620
Who on earth is it?

524
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,700
You ruined the blind date, saying you're dating someone.

525
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,550
How bad is he that you can't even bring him to see me?

526
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,330
Park Dal!

527
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:25,800
It's not because he's bad. It's me. I'm lacking.

528
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,230
What?

529
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,820
He doesn't like me.

530
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,690
What does he do for a living?

531
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,670
How idiotic were you for a man to reject you?

532
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:42,270
What did I tell you? It's because you're so pathetic-

533
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,970
Because you're like this.

534
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,910
Because you say, I'm pathetic, lacking, and stupid all the time.

535
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:53,630
That's why I can't even tell the person I like that I like him.

536
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:58,580
Just like an idiot, I ruined it all while walking on eggshells around him.

537
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:02,610
Even my mom thinks nothing of me

538
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:06,250
and tries to put me out for sale on blind dates.

539
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,730
Who'd ever like me?

540
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:11,140
I want you to meet a man of your level and upgrade your life.

541
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:14,050
I don't want you to meet some nobody and ruin your life-

542
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,930
Mom!

543
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:21,860
The man I like doesn't like me!

544
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:26,070
That's why I'm upset.

545
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,980
My heart is aching.

546
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:34,170
I don't care about levels and upgrading my life.

547
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:38,730
It feels like my life is ruined because that man doesn't like me!

548
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,390
We'll take the cast off tomorrow as planned.

549
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:57,970
At this rate, he could get discharged in two weeks.

550
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,730
Gosh, Doctor!

551
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,790
Thank you.

552
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,970
Thank you so much, Doctor!

553
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,540
After today, you'll feel a lot better.

554
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,960
What about my mom?

555
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,170
Will my mom feel better, too?

556
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:16,300
My mom told me this.

557
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:20,490
It was the easiest when I was in her belly.

558
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:23,350
Now that I'm born, I'm giving her a hard time.

559
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:26,970
So, will you go back into mommy's belly?

560
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:31,520
You said it's nice to have me in a cast and be still for once.

561
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,190
In that case, you'll have to live with a cast for life because of me, right?

562
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:39,580
No more soccer. No more playground?

563
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:48,610
You don't like your mom having a hard time?

564
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:52,800
I was also the same.

565
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,090
When my mom was having a hard time, I said I'd never do it again.

566
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:04,670
So, did you quit soccer and riding bicycles even though you didn't want to?

567
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,150
Yes.

568
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,780
Really?

569
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,300
Yes.

570
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:14,210
Though I stopped playing soccer and riding bicycles,

571
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:16,870
my mom wasn't happy at all.

572
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,620
Why?

573
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,420
I guess my mom...

574
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:26,900
wasn't struggling over those things.

575
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,360
What was it, then?

576
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:41,000
I think you can talk about that with your mom, Woohyeon.

577
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,070
Well, then.

578
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,350
Can I still play soccer?

579
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,580
Maybe.

580
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,240
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Thank you.

581
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,870
Good night.

582
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,630
[Mom]

583
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,970
[Mom]

584
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,930
What?

585
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,240
I was wondering how you're doing.

586
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:34,760
Why do you care after sending me off alone so you can live as you please?

587
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,210
I'll visit you next week.

588
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,370
I have something to tell you.

589
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,220
[Mom]

590
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:08,190
Are you on night duty today again?

591
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,770
Yes. Don't stay out too late and get home safe.

592
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:16,560
Get some sleep here and there.

593
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,130
Don't worry about me.

594
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,720
Text me when you get home.

595
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,570
Yes.

596
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:51,810
I came here on the off chance. And the lights were on.

597
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:57,240
Please have a seat.

598
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:27,090
Would you like something to drink?

599
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:28,660
No.

600
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,970
Are you dating my Sanha?

601
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,710
Yes.

602
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,030
Sit down.

603
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,430
Sanha said he'll visit because he has something to tell me.

604
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:56,860
I figured it had to do with you.

605
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:03,110
I won't tell Sanha I'm against you.

606
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:06,320
It's not like he'd listen even if I do.

607
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,660
So I'd like it...

608
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:12,160
if you could just break up with my Sanha.

609
00:44:21,810 --> 00:44:24,850
The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

610
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:26,560
[Juwon]
After you're connected...

611
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,690
Yes?

612
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:41,490
- Hey-
- Juwon spent the night at the bakery last night.

613
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:45,260
She used to stay up at the bakery frequently before-

614
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:58,880
Yoon Juwon.

615
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,750
Oh, you're here.

616
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,560
Did you sleep here?

617
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,550
Yes, I didn't like the new menu for summer.

618
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:11,100
But why didn't you tell me you're sleeping here?

619
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,410
I didn't tell you?

620
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,850
Yoon Juwon.

621
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:16,940
I'm still a business owner.

622
00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:20,640
I've been neglecting the store while having too much fun with you.

623
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:26,580
There's really nothing wrong, right?

624
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,380
Nothing's wrong.

625
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,350
Look at the time already.

626
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:38,040
Did you eat? What should we eat-

627
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:41,980
Are you okay?

628
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,490
I think I worked too hard.

629
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,370
I'm really okay.

630
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,660
You have a slight fever, too.

631
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,560
Juwon.

632
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,460
Take the medicine and sleep.

633
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:24,640
Get some sleep.

634
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:55,590
So, I'd like it if you could just break up with my Sanha.

635
00:46:55,590 --> 00:46:59,370
When Sanha's having a hard time, it's possible you can console him.

636
00:46:59,370 --> 00:47:01,700
That was the case ever since you two were young.

637
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:09,630
It's possible for Sanha to rely on you because of me. It can happen.

638
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:14,140
However, what if I stop giving Sanha a hard time?

639
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:16,800
I'll let Sanha live in peace now.

640
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:23,210
Wouldn't it be good for Sanha to live a normal life

641
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:26,230
with someone who doesn't know about his scars?

642
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:30,340
Someone I can also live comfortably with as a family.

643
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,560
You and I can't do that.

644
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,250
Isn't that right?

645
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:41,210
I don't like you as Sanha's match.

646
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:46,530
Will you let Sanha lose his mom forever?

647
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:57,080
What you guys are doing isn't love.

648
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,960
It's delusional.

649
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,500
It's because you grew up under unusual circumstances.

650
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:16,220
[The boss is sick. Only simple menus today. We apologize.]

651
00:48:20,310 --> 00:48:22,140
Thank you.

652
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,180
Hey, you came, Dal.

653
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:49,040
Yes, there's something Juwon asked me to do.

654
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:51,700
I see.

655
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,040
She could've asked me.

656
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,040
I-Is something missing?

657
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,790
I'll look for it.

658
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:21,940
I'll get going first.

659
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,890
Yes. Okay.

660
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,470
By the way...

661
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:46,430
I don't need an oppa.

662
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:48,120
Huh?

663
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:51,540
You don't have to say I'm a sister like Juwon.

664
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,110
Thank you for caring about me.

665
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,890
I came to win against you.

666
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,690
What?

667
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:24,320
I came to cry, plead, and beg you

668
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:27,170
to let me do what I want.

669
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:31,940
To ask you to look at your son's pain.

670
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:34,180
I'm here to beg.

671
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:55,940
Mom.

672
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,470
I don't resent you.

673
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,070
I just...

674
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:09,570
didn't want you to be sad.

675
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:17,860
You made my life like this!

676
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,560
I didn't want you to be in pain.

677
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,030
That's hot!

678
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:24,900
Sohui! How on earth...

679
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,040
Sanha, get some ice. Hurry up!

680
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,150
Sit down.

681
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:32,480
Hurry up with the ice!

682
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,500
You should've been careful.

683
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,840
It hurts so much.

684
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:42,500
So, I couldn't be honest with you. Not even once.

685
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,070
- That it was so hot.
- Are you okay?

686
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,620
That it really hurt.

687
00:51:48,620 --> 00:51:52,030
I couldn't even show you the scar.

688
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:58,100
Why are you telling me that now?

689
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,750
Mom.

690
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,700
Mom! Mom!

691
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:20,710
If you weren't in pain...

692
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,750
If you weren't sad...

693
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:29,180
I thought we'd also get better one day.

694
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,750
I'm sorry.

695
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,220
I shouldn't have pretended to be okay.

696
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,170
I shouldn't have acted like an adult.

697
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:45,370
I should've told you everything sooner.

698
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,130
That I was hurting, too.

699
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:52,780
That I was really sad, too.

700
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:56,220
That I'm so scared...

701
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:01,160
and that I needed a hug.

702
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:07,580
That I'm also tormented because I feel like Sojeong died because of me.

703
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,270
That...

704
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,530
I really miss Soejong, too.

705
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,560
So, Mom.

706
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:26,330
I should have asked sooner that we should live together.

707
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:36,540
♫ We probably didn't know what farewell meant ♫

708
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,150
Mom.

709
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,870
We...

710
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:47,990
can be happy.

711
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,660
We can be happy.

712
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:27,570
What brings you here at this hour?

713
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:31,130
Because I missed you, Dad.

714
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:34,070
You should've come inside then. Why are you sitting there?

715
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:38,130
What's with the long face?

716
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:39,380
Are you sick?

717
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,970
Overworked.

718
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:43,430
Running a small business is tough.

719
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:48,650
That's why I told you to hire more people.

720
00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:52,220
I think I've been saying that to you for the past 20 years.

721
00:54:55,530 --> 00:54:56,730
Dad.

722
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:58,870
If you're asking to approve of Sanha-

723
00:54:58,870 --> 00:55:00,810
That's not it.

724
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:03,150
Then?

725
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:08,310
What is love?

726
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:13,820
Love?

727
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:18,210
How do you love Kang Haejun like that?

728
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:20,770
Isn't it a bit funny to ask what love is

729
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:24,140
to your dad, who's against your boyfriend?

730
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:26,020
I'm your daughter.

731
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,880
We have the same blood.

732
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:31,470
It comes naturally, so loving me is a no-brainer.

733
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:35,250
But Kim Sanha and Kang Haejun are strangers to you.

734
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,110
But how do you love them so dearly?

735
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:41,120
I bathed them, clothed them, and fed them with my own hands.

736
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:44,260
It's not a matter of sharing blood or not.

737
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,220
What about Mom?

738
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:52,190
What was it like to love Mom?

739
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:54,980
You didn't raise her.

740
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:05,510
It felt like your mom was my entire world.

741
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:11,250
Is it like that for everyone else, too?

742
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,270
I would assume so.

743
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:20,820
You feel like you can't live without that person.

744
00:56:20,820 --> 00:56:24,750
Like everything will be okay as long as you're with that person.

745
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:29,350
I see.

746
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:32,030
"I see"?

747
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:36,990
Did you break my heart when Sanha doesn't even feel like your entire world?

748
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,400
So, it's like that for everyone?

749
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,710
That's a relief.

750
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:49,780
I wondered since we're a bit different,

751
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,250
because our circumstances are a little complicated

752
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:55,460
that we think we're the only ones for each other.

753
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,670
And what if we mistake this for love?

754
00:56:57,670 --> 00:57:00,290
That thought suddenly crossed my mind.

755
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:04,510
I don't think Kim Sanha can live without me.

756
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:09,020
And no matter how I think about it, I can't live without Kim Sanha, either.

757
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:11,730
That's a relief.

758
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:15,390
It's a relief that other people feel like that, too.

759
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:18,430
Thanks, Dad.

760
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:21,250
I didn't approve of him yet.

761
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:22,700
Yeah.

762
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,180

I'll be there in an hour. I'll go to the cafe.

Yeah.

781
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:11,860
I had a profound realization yesterday.

782
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:14,610
About what?

783
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:22,540
Kim Sanha, I really...

784
