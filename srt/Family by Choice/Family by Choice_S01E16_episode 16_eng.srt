1
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:12,530


2
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:14,940
   

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,030
   

4
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,540
   

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,850
   

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,780
   

7
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,990
   

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,590
Why didn't you tell me Mom paid a visit?

9
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,130
I had things to think about.

10
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,130
"Think"? About what?

11
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:09,380
About whether you should really break up with me as Mom told you to?

12
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,960
No.

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,910
I should've watched more dramas.

14
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:16,130
Money envelopes and a glass of water to the face.

15
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,970
I thought I could handle those things like they do in dramas,

16
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,830
but I couldn't say a single word to her.

17
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,660
Did Mom speak harshly to you?

18
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,250
Yes.

19
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,060
She told me what we have isn't love.

20
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,180
What?

21
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,470
You don't know how much I regretted it all night.

22
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,760
Should I go to Seoul right now and tell her?

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,900
That I love you so much!

24
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:50,920
So, you're saying that you didn't tell her that, right?

25
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,340
What?

26
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,420
That's what my profound realization was about.

27
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,050
I love you!

28
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,310
I said I love you! I love you.

29
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,680
I love you.

30
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,820
I love you, Kim San Ha. I love you.

31
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,910
Welcome.

32
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,670
Have a seat.

33
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,110
Yes.

34
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,550
I told you I'd wait until you gave us your approval.

35
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,510
But I came because I couldn't wait.

36
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,060
Fine, go on.

37
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:10,680
I want to make sure Joo Won keeps smiling, eats well,

38
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:14,140
and stays happy.

39
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,910
When I left Haedong ten years ago,

40
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,700
I promised myself that when I was truly healed

41
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,320
and no longer needed to lean on Joo Won,

42
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,960
I would come back.

43
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,320
I missed her so much every day,

44
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:37,900
but I didn't have the courage to hide my pain...

45
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:41,140
so I couldn't come back.

46
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,790
I wanted to come back after becoming a true adult.

47
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:55,300
Is that why you endured it for 10 years and never once came back?

48
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,680
Yes.

49
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,440
But in the end, I couldn't endure it

50
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,280
and just came back.

51
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,400
Then I met Joo Won again,

52
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,060
came back to my family

53
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,250
and everything was better.

54
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,580
I truly won't worry Joo Won.

55
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,640
Joo Won and I will live ordinary lives like other people.

56
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,260
People's lives are pretty much the same.

57
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,260
What makes you different from other people?

58
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:42,160
Who in life can avoid difficult times?

59
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,370
I'll always be on Joo Won's side whenever it gets tough.

60
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,530
From now on

61
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,870
I won't be on your side.

62
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,880
Yes.

63
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,010
You know how scary I get when I'm angry, right?

64
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,680
I do.

65
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,740
That's enough, then.

66
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,480
Have you eaten?

67
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,400
No.

68
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,600
- Have a bowl of noodles before you go. 
 - Okay.

69
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:29,820
There's a tiny basketball class next to Haedong High.

70
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,450
I'm going to take it over.

71
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,730
"A basketball class"?

72
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,090
I played basketball in America, didn't I?

73
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:37,990
What about your dad? What does he say?

74
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,300
As for me, I support anything you want to do.

75
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,870
Dad does, too.

76
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,720
He's okay with anything I do.

77
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,250
Really?

78
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:56,530
Calling you Mom and Dad makes it feel like you really are my Mom and Dad.

79
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,500
Madam told me.

80
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,120
I heard you visited Dad's store yesterday.

81
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,730
Yes.

82
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,310
Since you're looking into moving into that neighbourhood,

83
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,900
I had a few things to ask him.

84
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,090
Is that right? Dad likes that neighborhood, too, right?

85
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:17,340
Yes.

86
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:21,910
He says you'll be at ease there.

87
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:25,720
All right.

88
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,710
I'll take care of it, then.

89
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,450
Madam's information is solid. 
    

90
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,670
It seemed like that to me, too.

91
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,510
You know things don't just work themselves out, right?

92
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,550
Do you know what I've always regretted?

93
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,500
What?

94
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,180
That time I opposed Ahjumma, saying I didn’t need a mom.

95
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,720
 I don't need a mommy! I only need an oppa! 

96
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,910
Back then, I was too young.

97
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,770
I felt really bad because I felt like I wronged Dad, Ahjumma, and you.

98
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,010
You were seven years old at the time.

99
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:07,280
It's natural for a child to act like that.

100
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,990
Were you still consumed by that?

101
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,080
That's just how I felt.

102
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,920
Wow, Yoon Joo Won is all grown up.

103
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,780
So will it be Ahjumma or Dad?

104
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,940
It’s probably better to push Dad to take action, right?

105
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,800
Isn't there a natural way to do this?

106
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,300
By chance...

107
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,100
Let's tell him we are going to introduce Dae Wook Ahjusshi to her.

108
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,900
Are you crazy?

109
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,210
How messed up are you trying to make our family tree?

110
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,380
Is that too ridiculous?

111
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,090
I think it's all right.

112
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,360
Actually, the jealousy strategy...

113
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,900
doesn't seem like a bad idea.

114
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,610
Jae Eun set Dal up on a blind date.

115
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,840
I guess that's today.

116
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,100
- "Blind date"? 
 - Yes.

117
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,450
Since Dal's mom keeps arranging blind dates for her,

118
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,060
Jae Eun suggested we step in.

119
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,440
We gathered all our Haedong High alumni

120
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,070
and arranged a blind date with someone Dal's mom would approve of.

121
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,520
Did Dal agree to that?

122
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,770
She doesn't even like blind dates.

123
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,240
Yes.

124
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,830
Dal is not exactly in a position to disagree.

125
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,710
Since rumors about someone rejecting her have spread all over Haedong.

126
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:34,630
She didn't get rejected!

127
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,920
Thank you.

128
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,400
He's a catch.

129
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,960
What would you like to order?

130
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,640
What would you like?

131
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,340
Your most delicious menu item.

132
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,290
"Delicious"?

133
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,380
Why are you outside?

134
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,480
Someone just left.

135
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,330
Oh, they stopped by?

136
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,420
Who do you think it was?

137
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,920
There's nothing to be shy about.

138
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,510
Family should be understanding about these things.

139
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,260
I know everything.

140
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,610
Fine. There's no parent who can win against their child. I lost.

141
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:35,950
When I said I didn't approve of San Ha, you should've consoled the kids

142
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,200
and paid more attention to the family.

143
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,000
You were out of sight all this time.

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,740
But now that I've finally approved of San Ha,

145
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,740
you're absolutely ecstatic, aren't you?

146
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,340
I see, you've already approved of them.

147
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,750
"Already"? "Already"?

148
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,210
Gosh, Mr. Yoon.

149
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:56,810
Team Leader Kim came with a fruit basket to ask you to look favorably on San Ha.

150
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,670
Team Leader Kim was really concerned, too.

151
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,270
You should've told me, then. It's not like I'm God.

152
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,170
How would I have known?

153
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,210
Well...

154
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:20,850
How could I tell you when you were with her doing this?

155
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:23,320
"You're light."

156
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,740
What are you talking about?

157
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,000
And I didn't grab her back like that.

158
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,840
I just caught her before she fell and it happened that way.

159
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,930
- Is that so? 
 - Hey...

160
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,630
Now that I think about it, I had a lot of bread.

161
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,760
I can do without the noodles.

162
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,890
Team Leader, I'll head out first.

163
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:44,800
Okay, sure. I'm going to leave, too.

164
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,780
What?

165
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,870
There's food left over from San Ha's visit. Eat before you go.

166
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,860
What did you make for San Ha?

167
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,160
What did you make?

168
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,770
   

169
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,320
Joo Won.

170
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:58,590
Why?

171
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:01,100
She made this herself?

172
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:05,500
Yes, Joo Won made every one of them from scratch.

173
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,940
Hello.

174
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,360
- Is your elbow better? 
 - Doctor.

175
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,300
Hey, Dal. He came in to treat his elbow recently.

176
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,650
You remembered me right away.

177
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:34,020
I remember you were eager about treatment so you could play basketball.

178
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,480
Is it feeling better these days?

179
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,290
Are you still doing great at basketball?

180
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,720
Yes, of course. My club just can't run without me.

181
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,260
My buddy over there played basketball in America.

182
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,780
A former Haedong High player.

183
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:50,630
Oh, really? From America?

184
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,100
Hello.

185
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:57,330
It would be great if you guys had time to play a game.

186
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,240
I'm fine whenever.

187
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,310
Today works, too.

188
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,370
Then, shall we play a round?

189
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,450
Hurry, Babe.

190
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,200
Hurry over here.

191
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,740
The game that will decide Kang Hae Joon's life is about to begin.

192
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:15,350
Hurry up! Yes!

193
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:20,580
Oh, thank you.

194
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,070
What do you have planned?

195
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,900
The final victory.

196
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,150
Among men, it's over if you lose in a game.

197
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,050
What's this?

198
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:40,670
Why are you here?

199
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:44,150
Why? Can't I watch Kang Hae Joon play basketball?

200
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,190
I haven't been rejected yet.

201
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,730
Fighting.

202
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,640
You should reconsider.

203
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,790
You're too good for him.

204
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,930
She has a good eye for people.

205
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,470
Come on!

206
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:04,420
I'll be back.

207
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,310
Be careful.

208
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,060
All right, that's done.

209
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,700
The team that loses will pay for pork belly and soju.

210
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,570
- Sounds good. 
 - Why are you making such a big deal?

211
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:19,850
Just trust me.

212
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,600
I even got my girlfriend's father's approval.

213
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,750
What nonsense are you spewing?

214
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,080
Think about it while you do something you love.

215
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,970
Don't regret it.

216
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,460
Fighting.

217
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,320
Fighting.

218
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:36,470
You know I only settle for first place, right?

219
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,090
Just tighten your shoelaces.

220
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:42,130
- Let's go! 
 - Oppas, do your best!

221
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,100
- Fighting, Babe! 
 - Fighting, Kang Hae Joon!

222
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,760
Let's go.

223
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,810
Hurry and give it to me.

224
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,980
Hey, take him out of here.

225
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,880
I'll get it next time.

226
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,470
- Oh, hey! 
 - Pass!

227
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,160
Hey, pass!

228
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:16,130
- Hae Joon, let's do this. 
 - Crab! Crab!

229
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,650
- Hey, come fast! 
 - Go, first!

230
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,700
- Go long! 
 - Is that all you've got?

231
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,050
- Come here! Next to me. 
 - Okay.

232
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,220
You can do it.

233
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,900
Go, go!

234
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,730
♫  I begin to mirror your smile  ♫

235
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,460
- Kang Hae Joon! 
 - Nice!

236
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:37,020
- Here. 
 - Okay, I got this.

237
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,140
Nice!

238
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:52,550
♫  I am at my most beautiful when we are together  ♫

239
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:55,440
♫  So I keep searching for the me reflected in your eyes  ♫

240
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,660
Babe, fighting!

241
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,170
Nice!

242
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:10,290
♫  The fact that someone more precious to me than myself exists  ♫

243
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,850
♫  In this world that remains sorrowful  ♫

244
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:23,140
♫  It gives me reason to smile  ♫

245
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,040
I lost today, so I'll treat you to pork belly.

246
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:48,400
I don't need pork belly, but let me ask you for a favor.

247
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,970
You can ask me anything.

248
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,830
I'll take Dal...

249
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,690
with me today.

250
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,270
Pardon?

251
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:16,740
- Well... 
 - You don't have to say anything.

252
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,800
What?

253
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,810
Whatever you say, it doesn't matter to me.

254
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,290
No, I...

255
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,610
Let me talk first.

256
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,140
I like you, Sunbae.

257
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:43,070
No matter how stupid I am, I'm certain of that one thing.

258
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,110
I was told to study, so I did.

259
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,620
I was told to go to law school, so I did.

260
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,570
I was told to become a lawyer, so I did.

261
00:16:53,570 --> 00:17:00,300
There's exactly one thing I did of my own accord.

262
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,850
That was coming down to live in Haedong.

263
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:11,050
But that wasn't because I love Haedong.

264
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:16,620
It was because Seoul was too difficult for me.

265
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,610
Throughout my life, there weren't many instances

266
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:27,080
where I thought, "I'll do it" or "I want it,"

267
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,990
just because I liked something.

268
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:38,170
In high school, you were the first.

269
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,420
The first time I liked anything.

270
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:50,270
But after today,

271
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,420
I realized I still like you.

272
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,460
So,

273
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,710
I like you.

274
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,580
"I like you, so what?"

275
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,560
That's what I'll tell you.

276
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,430
It's the first time I've ever told anyone I liked them.

277
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,130
But if I hide in embarrassment,

278
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:24,840
then I'll feel...

279
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,530
really pathetic.

280
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,200
Can I talk now?

281
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,550
Even in my sleep, I suddenly wake up.

282
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,880
And suddenly, while walking the streets,

283
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,060
I worry about you

284
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:46,340
and think about you.

285
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,960
You must not be a sister to me like Joo Won is.

286
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,440
It would be difficult

287
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:58,640
to call you a sister.

288
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,680
I don't feel as strongly as you do...

289
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,110
yet.

290
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,680
Pardon?

291
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,370
Do you want to date me?

292
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,570
Pardon?

293
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:20,470
Just say yes.

294
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,490
You say that well.

295
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:29,240
♫  Beyond the sunrise  ♫

296
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,060
Yes.

297
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:52,240
There's a reason you were good at studying.

298
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,190
I did that on purpose to make Kang Hae Joon stand out.

299
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,720
If that was acting, you could've been an actor.

300
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,610
Did you like guys who were good at basketball?

301
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,660
It's good to do well at anything.

302
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:06,560
What about soccer? I'm really good at soccer.

303
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:12,270
What can I do to make Yoon Joo Won fall for me?

304
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,350
How about we go camping since we got Ahjusshi's approval?

305
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,580
Should we go camping while we are on the subject?

306
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,490
The breezy beach

307
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:25,540
or the starry mountains?

308
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,530
What is it?

309
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:34,390
I wonder what kind of person you were originally.

310
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,860
If you didn't need to pretend to be okay,

311
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,980
I wonder what Kim San Ha would've been like.

312
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,200
If you didn't need to hide your feelings

313
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,600
and could talk about them instead,

314
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,280
I wonder how you would've turned out.

315
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,070
Whatever I may have been,

316
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,900
the fact that I like only Yoon Joo Won wouldn't change.

317
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,630
No, let's not think about it.

318
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,280
I think you would've been thick-faced, talkative,

319
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,500
cheesy, and a total playboy.

320
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,050
- "A playboy"? 
 - Yes.

321
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,620
- "Cheesy"? 
 - Yes.

322
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,970
- Am I cheesy? 
 - A bit?

323
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,550
"A bit"?

324
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,890
Shouldn't you renovate the house a bit?

325
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:27,200
That came out of nowhere. Is something broken?

326
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,290
Isn't Hae Joon's mom moving in with you?

327
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,630
What the heck are you talking about?

328
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,210
That's what Madam said earlier. That she's moving here.

329
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,670
Not this house.

330
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,760
She asked me to look in this neighborhood.

331
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,910
I didn't suggest it. Hae Joon did.

332
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:44,080
Hae Joon did!

333
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,680
Oh, is that so?

334
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:51,200
And stop making things uncomfortable like that.

335
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,110
Did someone say they were uncomfortable?

336
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:00,520
 Hae Joon asked how I felt about moving to this neighborhood. 

337
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,860
 That's great! It would be convenient for the kids, and I could look out for you, too. 

338
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,530
 Why would you do that? 

339
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,610
 What am I to you, that you would look out for me? 

340
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:13,430
 Well, you're Hae Joon's mom and– 

341
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:15,920
 With a man I went on a blind date with once, 

342
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,980
 I left my child and didn't show up for 20 years. 

343
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:24,580
 I'll probably see you a few times because of Hae Joon, 

344
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:29,620
 but I feel uncomfortable with people looking at us weirdly. 

345
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:39,490
She looks like she'd live however she wants,

346
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:41,850
without caring about what others think.

347
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:45,180
But when Hae Joon is involved, she won't allow even a single flaw

348
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,420
and won't do anything for her own comfort.

349
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,560
What kind of person is like that?

350
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,700
How long will she live like a sinner?

351
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,060
She's frustrating.

352
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,690
Yes, you're right.

353
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,710
I'm going up.

354
00:23:02,710 --> 00:23:06,560
Why, already? There's plenty left.

355
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,070
Young, so young.

356
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,920
You're still in your youth.

357
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,670
Dad's youth.

358
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:18,800
He's the one who bought the alcohol.

359
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,490
- Are you going to work out? 
 - Yes.

360
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,290
What are you waiting in here for?

361
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,750
Oh, I'm going. I'm going now.

362
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:33,830
What should I wear?

363
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,370
Hey, Dal.

364
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,190
Are you going to work?

365
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,490
Hey.

366
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,010
It's Dal.

367
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,190
Dal, are you going to work?

368
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:59,230
- Did you sleep well? 
 - Yes.

369
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,240
How are you getting to work?

370
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,970
The bus.

371
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,970
Can I drop you off?

372
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,260
- Yes. 
 - Hurry up.

373
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:12,840
- Okay. 
 - Hurry up.

374
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,190
Did I say I wouldn't buy it for you?

375
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,380
I asked if you really had to buy it!

376
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:19,960
That's the same thing!

377
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,750
So I said just buy it if you want to!

378
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:24,210
How can I buy it when you have that unpleasant expression?

379
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,160
Forget it. I won't buy it.

380
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,370
 Just buy it if you'll whine about not buying it! It's all right. 

381
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:31,770
 "Whine"? 

382
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,640
 "Whine"? 

383
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,590
 You still complain even if I buy it for you. What do you want from me? 

384
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,690
 You should've bought it happily from the start! 

385
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,450
 Babe, why should I pay 50 million won for that tiny little thing... 

386
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,000
Should we go and de-escalate things?

387
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,900
Getting involved is more dangerous.

388
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,230
Geez, you should live alone.

389
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,730
Living alone is the best.

390
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,740
You'd get in trouble if my wife heard that.

391
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,300
Team Leader, do you really not want to get remarried?

392
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,650
Aigoo! And go through that again?

393
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:07,740
I don't even have the energy anymore.

394
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,220
 I'm really sorry. 

395
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,860
 I'm sorry, Honey. I'm really sorry. 

396
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:14,220
Should we go and buy your gift now? Okay? I'm sorry.

397
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:19,350
My mother told me everyone lives like that.

398
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:30,310
 What is it? 

399
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,380
Well, San Ha is seeing someone.

400
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,370
It's about time you told me.

401
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,910
You already knew?

402
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,770
So did you call to tell me not to oppose San Ha?

403
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,770
To just leave San Ha alone?

404
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:49,210
It'd be great if you could, since it's San Ha's business.

405
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,740
 If San Ha gets married, 

406
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,360
 we will have things to discuss, too. 

407
00:25:55,450 --> 00:26:00,530
Even if they say divorced couples are worse than strangers,

408
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:03,270
 you're still San Ha's mom. 

409
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,100
So Hui wants to study in England.

410
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,230
What?

411
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,900
 I'm going to focus more on So Hui. 

412
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,490
 I'm going to take her there. 

413
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,560
San Ha's mom.

414
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,110
There's still some time before we leave.

415
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,050
I'll see San Ha before we go.

416
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,220
Of course, you should.

417
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,550
There's nothing I can help you with?

418
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,800
Are you happy I'm leaving?

419
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:40,850
I wished you a happy life even when you said you were getting remarried.

420
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,660
 Put the past behind you 

421
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,110
 and live comfortably. Be at peace. 

422
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,210
I'm hanging up. I'm busy.

423
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,120
Dr. Do Hui Joo?

424
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,750
Thank you.

425
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,980
Why did you disappear that day? I couldn't find you after the match.

426
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:05,800
I saw something I shouldn't have.

427
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,540
We really must be old now.

428
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,990
You know how to read the room now.

429
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,900
Forget it. Just buy me a drink.

430
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,200
- Should I? 
 - Really?

431
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,850
Yes, I'll go with Joo Won.

432
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,930
Gosh, you're so full of it.

433
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:35,470
I'm leaving.

434
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,290
Hey! Hey, hold on.

435
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:40,770
What do you think about Dal's blind date? I can hook you up.

436
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,610
Should I just throw a tantrum for Mom and Dad to marry?

437
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,210
No.

438
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:56,260
Look. Mr. Yoon needs to simmer for a while, like beef broth

439
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,210
before you can see his pearly feelings.

440
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:02,320
He hasn't simmered enough yet.

441
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,050
So should I just wait?

442
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,970
No.

443
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:12,570
You have to watch the fire and turn it low and high at the right times.

444
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,160
What are you telling me to do?

445
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,730
Madam.

446
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:18,310
Are you nagging Hae Joon again?

447
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,240
No, no.

448
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,990
There's no decent house in the neighborhood?

449
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:28,040
Yes, house prices have skyrocketed in this neighborhood.

450
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,730
After taking over the basketball class, I have some money–

451
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,430
I have none left.

452
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,410
Yes! I don't have money.

453
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,210
Gosh, I don't have money.

454
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,610
Why? Do you need money?

455
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,950
There's some money I saved up.

456
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:47,860
I was going to buy a store for you, but you're doing well on your own.

457
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,140
I planned to give it to you when you get married.

458
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,690
Then you shouldn't touch that money.

459
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,590
You shouldn't lay a finger on his wedding fund.

460
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:59,420
She's right. I need to get married.

461
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,420
Are you seeing someone right now?

462
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,920
You are.

463
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,530
Aigoo...

464
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:18,160
He's acting like this, so you and his mom settle down together.

465
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,130
Aigoo, this is too frustrating, I can't do this anymore.

466
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,350
What are you so focused on?

467
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:32,940
The rice cake shop owner out front told me this.

468
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:38,280
Hae Joon's aunt's company is supporting businesses in the neighborhood. 
    

469
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,720
This is vital to small business owners like me.

470
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,450
I'm looking into it so I can apply.

471
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:48,750
Yoon Joo Won, you're quite the boss.

472
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,630
You just haven't seen it.

473
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,450
I paid back my loan within five years of opening the store.

474
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,080
Determined to pay back my loan within five years,

475
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,470
I never used a part-timer.

476
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,200
And I even baked my own cakes.

477
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,260
And I really paid off my loan on the five-year mark.

478
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,490
I cried so much that day.

479
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:16,810
The first few years, I was afraid I'd go bankrupt.

480
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:23,090
How come you never talked about it?

481
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,320
Never mind.

482
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,110
I should've known even if you didn't say anything.

483
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,140
It's okay.

484
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,180
I'm debt-free now and Daldal Bakery has many regulars.

485
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,020
It's only uphill from here.

486
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,720
It's totally an opportune life.

487
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,200
So I need to apply today for that opportunity.

488
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:58,450
Joo Won insisted she wouldn't go to college after graduating.

489
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,560
All the friends tried hard to change her mind.

490
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,450
- Is that right? 
  - She said she wanted to bake cakes 

491
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:06,260
and applied to a baking academy during winter break.

492
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,540
I was surprised she was actually doing what she set her mind on.

493
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:13,250
 Running a small business isn't easy. 

494
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,850
Park Dal.

495
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,500
- Yes? 
 - Tell me something about yourself.

496
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,690
- Pardon? 
 - Do you have any struggles?

497
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,280
I don't.

498
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,240
If you're an attorney, are you ever in any dangerous situations?

499
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,280
I'm not trying to stop you or anything,

500
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,530
but if you ever end up having to defend

501
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:39,760
thugs, loan sharks, serial killers, and the like–

502
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,510
Sunbae, you watched too many dramas.

503
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,540
Sunbae, did I offend you?

504
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:09,300
I really asked out of worry.

505
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,090
- Sorry. 
 - Oh, it's okay.

506
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,090
I didn't mean to make you apologize.

507
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:17,370
By the way,  you laugh out loud like that?

508
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,940
It's very nice to hear.

509
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,400
Do you want to come out?

510
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,830
 It's hot. 

511
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,860
Let's go for a walk.

512
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,310
Okay.

513
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,180
Yoon Joo Won.

514
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:12,080
♫  Even if you don't say where it hurts  ♫

515
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,200
♫  I know  ♫

516
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,860
Joo Won.

517
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,280
Yes.

518
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,650
I'm sorry.

519
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:28,760
You couldn't even complain to our dads when you were having a hard time.

520
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,440
You must've worked so hard to grow up so well

521
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,800
on your own all this time.

522
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,490
Just how worried you must've been.

523
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:45,900
 As for me, because coming back here was so difficult, 

524
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:50,010
 I couldn't think about you, who was struggling to protect this place. 

525
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,420
I'm sorry.

526
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:58,400
I'm really sorry.

527
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,090
♫  My wish, as it's smaller than my height  ♫

528
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,930
You did great.

529
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:15,470
♫  I can't be the tree that you can take shelter under  ♫

530
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:19,500
What the heck? You said you'll wake me up in 10 minutes.

531
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,160
♫  Like the beautiful moon  ♫

532
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:38,310
♫  I will always, as I have always done, be with you  ♫

533
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,610
Where did you go so late last night?

534
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,000
A walk.

535
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,820
It was hot, so we took a walk around town.

536
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:55,710
Why go out when it's hot? You should stay home.

537
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,080
Can I also go on night walks with Joo Won?

538
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Can I?

539
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,080
No way.

540
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,370
Why can't we go on walks?

541
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,340
What do you do on your walks?

542
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,380
That's enough.

543
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,210
By the way, Dal was so tired in the morning.

544
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:15,800
Did you walk about 5 km?

545
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,810
Gosh, that's enough!

546
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:21,210
Think about what to do about Mom and Dad.

547
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,930
You said you're going home today, right?

548
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,960
Go talk it out with Dad.

549
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,570
It's the adults' business. Don't be nosy.

550
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:29,210
It's because they're adults.

551
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,680
They probably can't do a thing because they're mindful of us.

552
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,880
Look at him. The young one does what he needs to do.

553
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,430
I told you to cut it out.

554
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,980
Help me.

555
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,130
- Hey, go easy on her. 
 - Save me...

556
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,090
Why didn't you help?

557
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,650
- You freed yourself. 
 - You still need to help.

558
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:52,870
I'm sorry.

559
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:54,620
You still need to save me!

560
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,840
- Okay, okay. 
 - Gosh, when will they grow up?

561
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,720
- Mercy. 
 - You promised.

562
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,780
- Hey, wait for me! 
 - Hurry up!

563
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,540
Do you still have things to take from here?

564
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:18,220
I was reminded of a book I used to read.

565
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:25,260
Hey... you heard Mom is going to England, right?

566
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,800
Yes.

567
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:33,180
She comes and goes, all as she pleases.

568
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,310
But I don't think that's the case this time.

569
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,940
Yes, I know.

570
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:42,370
I should've told you every time

571
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:46,480
why she was going and coming all those years.

572
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,390
My goodness.

573
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,010
I wasn't able to...

574
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:55,560
You stayed here, Dad.

575
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:00,170
You didn't go anywhere and stayed here.

576
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:03,690
Whether I go away or come back,

577
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,190
you're always here.

578
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:09,630
And that's why I was okay.

579
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:16,370
You're late. Hurry up and go now.

580
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:17,800
Go now.

581
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:26,540
By the way, Dad, aren't you interested in seeing anyone?

582
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:30,490
Aigoo, I'm fine. O-Once is enough for me.

583
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:33,140
Gosh, did I tell you to get married?

584
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,650
You could just have a girlfriend.

585
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,820
Come on...

586
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:45,720
What? You're telling me to meet someone to watch movies and have coffee together?

587
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:49,420
Yes. Do what you want to do.

588
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:53,910
Besides the police station, home, and family.

589
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,920
Think about those things.

590
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,830
How can there be such things? I don't have the time.

591
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:02,400
It's late. Hurry up and go now! Go on.

592
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,400
- I'll go now. See you next time. 
 - Okay.

593
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:12,820
Yes! It's so nice.

594
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:20,410
Aigoo, it's so nice!

595
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,990
 Why are you telling me to do nothing? 

596
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:28,250
Does Ahjusshi have feelings for Ahjumma or not?

597
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:32,280
- He does. 
 - Would Ahjumma not know when we know?

598
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,780
She probably does.

599
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,480
It shows quite a lot.

600
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,110
But if there hasn't been any progress so far, it means Ahjumma isn't ready.

601
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:47,250
But if we rush Ahjusshi altogether, how will he feel?

602
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:49,140
Will he be in a tough spot?

603
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:50,870
Embarrassed?

604
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:53,010
I know this because I experienced it.

605
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:55,500
The most frustrated one isn't us.

606
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,310
It's Ahjusshi.

607
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,590
I feel so sorry for my dad.

608
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,920
I was a pitiful one, too,

609
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,970
when you didn't accept me.

610
00:40:08,530 --> 00:40:11,500
When did I ever say I wouldn't accept you?

611
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,620
You said you wouldn't give me a chance.

612
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,720
Don't you recall?

613
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,790
Gosh, you even hold grudges?

614
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:27,570
♫  Why am I like this?  ♫

615
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,730
 Are you inside? 

616
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,490
Yes, I'm here, too!

617
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,760
- Hey. 
 - Why are you here?

618
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,230
We were talking about Dad.

619
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,360
You can talk in the living room.

620
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,660
I'm going. I was about to go.

621
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,260
Bye.

622
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:54,260
What?

623
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:00,270
Gosh, do I really have to find a new place?

624
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,440
Hello.

625
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,790
Did you come because of your dad?

626
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,310
Yes.

627
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:37,230
You don't need to be mistaken.

628
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:41,000
I went to see him a few times because of Hae Joon.

629
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,070
Your dad and I don't have any other intention.

630
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,220
Back then...

631
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:51,280
when I said, I didn't need a mom.

632
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,700
I think I said that because you were pretty.

633
00:41:56,590 --> 00:42:01,220
I have no memory of my mom, so I only know her from her pictures.

634
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:05,140
But my mom in her pictures is really pretty.

635
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:10,460
And when you showed up that day, Ahjumma,

636
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:13,150
you were really pretty.

637
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:19,540
I don't quite remember because I was too young.

638
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,650
But I remember I was mad because you were pretty...

639
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,950
and...

640
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:32,860
I remember I was mad because of the way Dad looked at you.

641
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,520
Reflecting on it after I grew up,

642
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,260
I don't think Dad ever looked at anyone the same way.

643
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,370
I probably won't ever get to have

644
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:53,430
a mom again in my life if it isn't you.

645
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,190
Could you be my mom, please?

646
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,500
I'll be a good daughter.

647
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:19,100
You'll ruin your shoulder like that.

648
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,860
Tiring your body out

649
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:24,250
just because your mind is cluttered is for when you're young.

650
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:28,770
You need to be wary of your age now, Mr. Yoon.

651
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,190
I think I'll do radish noodles this summer, too.

652
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:35,570
Last year, quite a lot of people were asking about it.

653
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,400
I won't do it.

654
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,270
You can hire someone,

655
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:44,640
or you can get married and make your wife do it.

656
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,610
But I won't do it.

657
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,900
Well, should I go on a blind date

658
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,360
and say that I need to get married because I need someone

659
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,700
to make summer radish kimchi for me?

660
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,070
What? Should I?

661
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,990
My goodness.

662
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:13,000
Madam, as I was saying, go to the marketplace

663
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,700
and check out the summer radish.

664
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,300
O-Oh, yes. Aigoo.

665
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:22,050
I'm not going.

666
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:25,800
I'm just going to go home.

667
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:31,030
Summer radish noodles?

668
00:44:32,430 --> 00:44:34,330
Why don't you try?

669
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,330
- Take a seat. 
 - Yes.

670
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:52,410
What brings you here today?

671
00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:56,420
Did Hae Joon say something again?

672
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:00,180
I don't know how to make summer radish kimchi.

673
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,370
Sorry?

674
00:45:02,370 --> 00:45:03,970
But...

675
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:06,520
I'll still try to learn how.

676
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,970
What do you mean?

677
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:12,810
I'll try to learn

678
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,370
how to keep a home,

679
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:20,040
make noodles, and raise a daughter, too.

680
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,200
I asked you not to make things uncomfortable for me.

681
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:45,360
But I'm being too shameless, right?

682
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:52,380
I was always wayward with you, Jeong Jae.

683
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:55,250
I shouldn't have done that.

684
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:56,650
I'm sorry.

685
00:45:56,650 --> 00:45:59,070
Y-You see...

686
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:11,040
You see, I had feelings for you from the first day you came here.

687
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:20,100
A single father having feelings isn't a big deal.

688
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:24,070
So I just put it aside and went on with life.

689
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:27,080
But those feelings returned after I saw you again.

690
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:39,510
I doubted my heart would race again at this age,

691
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:41,530
but it does indeed race.

692
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:48,820
Gosh, you know...

693
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,110
You don't need to learn how to make kimchi or do house chores.

694
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,110
Let's just...

695
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,260
laugh and cry together.

696
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,810
Let's just live like that.

697
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,810
Hey, let's turn it this way.

698
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:44,990
Lift it. One, two, three!

699
00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:48,330
I mean, let's just put it back where it was.

700
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:51,290
Still, we should switch up the new sofa and the bed placement to

701
00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:53,790
make it feel like a newlywed's home.

702
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:57,510
That's why we should redo the walls and get them new furniture.

703
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:00,780
Hey, I'll take care of it.

704
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,610
You should stop coming over!

705
00:48:02,610 --> 00:48:05,710
Dad, just getting a new sofa won't make it feel like a newlywed's home.

706
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,020
That one.

707
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:10,010
That one lived in Haedong longer than Kim San Ha.

708
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:12,900
Reminds me of the old days. I like it.

709
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,940
Where did Ahjusshi go? Isn't it his day off?

710
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:19,130
♪ I love you ♪

711
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:23,220
   

712
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:29,550
♪ I love you so much ♪

713
00:48:33,130 --> 00:48:34,800
Mr. Kim.

714
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,130
How is your singing so full of emotion?

715
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:40,270
It's Chief Kim, not Mr. Kim.

716
00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:43,100
- He's the senior inspector of our town. 
 - Yes.

717
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,890
My gosh, how do you sing so well?

718
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,180
A-Aigoo, not at all.

719
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,990
- Please excuse me– 
 - Hold on.

720
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:52,130
We are getting some iced coffee right here. Join us.

721
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:55,210
Oh, my kids are waiting for me at home.

722
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:58,280
Aigoo, I'm sorry. Next time.

723
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:02,370
So he doesn't even go to singing classes anymore?

724
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:07,800
I mean, it's weird enough for me that Dad is singing in front of people.

725
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:12,920
You only went to the hiking club twice and stopped going.

726
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:21,620
Back then, I went because they said the makgeolli (rice wine) tasted great after hiking.

727
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:25,590
But the mountain was quite high.

728
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:32,100
Of course, a mountain is high. What will it be otherwise?

729
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,120
So, is your wedding all ready to go?

730
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,320
Gosh, don't call it a wedding.

731
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:40,090
We are just gathering for a meal.

732
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:42,430
He's just embarrassed.

733
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:46,190
Dad, so... what will you...

734
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,670
what will you do now? Hurry up and decide.

735
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:50,330
J-Just say the final verdict here.

736
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:52,040
How about aerobics? It's right around the corner.

737
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,050
Yes, that sounds great.

738
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:56,440
- I thought about it... 
 - Yes.

739
00:49:56,440 --> 00:49:58,030
How does cooking sound?

740
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,910
- No way. Not at all. 
 - What?

741
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,470
- I-I can teach you. 
 - Don't you dare.

742
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:03,450
- I'm not doing it. 
 - You should stick to baking cakes.

743
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:04,720
I'm really good, though.

744
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,680
I'm not doing it.

745
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,210
- The cake store there disappeared? 
 - Yes.

746
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,930
I told you last time.

747
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:16,520
When?

748
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,290
Right after you came back to Haedong.

749
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:20,990
We were eating ice cream together.

750
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:25,130
You don't remember that?

751
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,310
You really must not listen to what I say.

752
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:35,450
Back then, I was a bit bewitched by someone.

753
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:37,350
Forget it.

754
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:40,360
- Let's go. 
 - Where?

755
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:45,120
I wanted to try this.

756
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,470
Do you even know how to do it?

757
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:48,380
It's my first time.

758
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:49,680
You don't even know how to do it. 
    

759
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,190
- There you go. 
 - Yes.

760
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:53,170
- All right. 
 - Wh-Where?

761
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:55,920
No, it's not this. It's there.

762
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,940
Oh, it's there.

763
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,840
One, two, three.

764
00:51:03,330 --> 00:51:04,960
Growl.

765
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:12,880
♫  In the breeze, in the moonlight, a softly whispered prayer is carried  ♫

766
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:15,920
- This one came out well. 
 - It did.

767
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:18,290
You look good with a crown.

768
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:22,030
You look too natural, though, Yoon Joo Won.

769
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:24,410
Because it's with you, Oppa.

770
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:27,020
It's pretty.

771
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:28,360
   

772
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,750
-  Oppa.  
 - Yes.

773
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,560
 Did you think about it? 

774
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,340
 Is it really impossible? 

775
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:38,180
I'm sorry. I'll be there in the fall.

776
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:41,970
Your school and accommodation are ready, so don't worry about them.

777
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:45,090
Yes. I'll see you at the airport.

778
00:51:47,870 --> 00:51:50,320
When is she leaving?

779
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,850
Next week.

780
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:53,980
Will you be okay?

781
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,690
With what?

782
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:59,010
Are you really okay with not dropping her off?

783
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,530
So Hui's still young

784
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:05,710
and Ahjumma still has difficulty walking.

785
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,360
We need to prepare for the wedding, too.

786
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,400
I'm not okay with this.

787
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,300
It's obvious when you're worried, Oppa.

788
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,440
Take the trip. Okay?

789
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:21,400
If it bothers you, you can buy a gift on the way back.

790
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,970
"A gift"?

791
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:26,420
What will you buy?

792
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:28,440
- A toy. 
 - "A toy"?

793
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,910
Am I a baby?

794
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:31,850
A doll, then?

795
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:33,560
- "A doll"? 
 - Yes.

796
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:36,760
   

797
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:45,320
 I arrived safely in one piece. 

798
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,850
 So Hui's really happy. 

799
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:58,070
   

800
00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:03,970
♫  I was filled with hopes about my dream  ♫

801
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:11,930
♫  That dream made me feel like I owned the world  ♫

802
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:14,460
Can you reach?

803
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:21,170
♫  My empty heart was filled with promises we made  ♫

804
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:25,290
♫  I didn’t even know it was cold  ♫

805
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:30,160
♫  I had nothing to envy  ♫

806
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:31,730
   

807
00:53:31,730 --> 00:53:35,870
♫  Back then, we were the world  ♫

808
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,290
It's coffee.

809
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:45,360
♫  Like the sun in the clearest summer sky  ♫

810
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,340
♫  Those shattering days  ♫

811
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:52,100
    
 ♫  when we lived for each other  ♫

812
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:56,990
 Gosh, I can't bear it anymore. Hurry up and come home. 

813
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:05,510
 Just hold on for 48 hours. 

814
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,990
 I mean... 

815
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:22,390
why can't I reach him for the entire day?

816
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:25,270
There's still time until his flight.

817
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:27,680
Did something happen to him?

818
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,480
Gosh, he must be busy.

819
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,060
He said he'd arrive before the wedding, so I'm sure he will come.

820
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,880
He's not a kid. Stop worrying about him.

821
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,130
When are you going to be here?

822
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:38,650
I have to spend some more time here today.

823
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:42,310
When you come, can you bring the blue bag from my room?

824
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:44,230
I forgot to bring it with me.

825
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:45,640
What's in it?

826
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,840
The wedding ring.

827
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:48,630
What?

828
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:26,230
Why won't he answer his phone?

829
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,360
What are you doing?

830
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,620
Oppa.

831
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,840
Why are you here? Shouldn't you be at the bakery?

832
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:41,830
And why are you here? Shouldn't you be mid-flight?

833
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:45,940
I was going to surprise you, but it failed.

834
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:49,210
Surprise... "Surprise"?

835
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:51,300
I couldn't even reach you!

836
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,980
"Did something happen? What if he can't make it to the wedding?"

837
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,080
All sorts of things went through my head.

838
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:59,500
You should be glad to see me sooner than expected.

839
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,790
I was really worried, though.

840
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:03,290
I'm sorry.

841
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:08,450
I missed you.

842
00:56:08,450 --> 00:56:09,870
Forget it.

843
00:56:09,870 --> 00:56:12,980
Don't think you can win me over–

844
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:18,340
Don't think this can win me over–

845
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:44,680
I missed you so much.

846
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:47,130
Me, too.

847
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,520
 You didn't really buy a doll, did you? 

848
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,310
 It's jelly, I think. 

849
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:19,750
 Am I still seven years old? 

850
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,190
 It was my wish. 

851
00:57:21,190 --> 00:57:22,720
 "Your wish"? 

852
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:24,630
 Just like back then, 

853
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:27,450
 I wished you would smile all the time. 

854
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:40,600
 I wanted to see you smile all the time. 

855
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,990
 That was my wish. 

856
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:59,600
Wow, you look really handsome, Dad.

857
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:03,770
Why isn't she coming, though?

858
00:58:03,770 --> 00:58:07,450
Is she still sleeping because she was tired from prepping the store yesterday?

859
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,620
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

860
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:21,550
Hey, is Joo Won still sleeping?

861
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:23,970
 Joo Won didn't come home last night. 

862
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:26,800
- What? 
  - She wasn't at the store, either. 

863
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:28,860
 Didn't she come home? 

864
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,470
What?

865
00:58:31,990 --> 00:58:34,090
Why? What happened?

866
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:36,730
She said Joo Won wasn't home or at the store.

867
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:38,290
What?

868
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:41,080
When did you last talk to her?

869
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,070
I told her to go get the ring from my place.

870
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:44,290
"The ring"?

871
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:47,140
I told her to get the wedding ring.

872

What?

886

It's nothing.

What is it?

01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:06,390
Hyungnim.

Please have mercy.

You just arrived in Haedong,

Show me your teeth.

All right, here we go. One, two, three!

Yes, that's great. All right.

917
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:45,650
Please get closer.

918
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:49,470
All right. One, two, three.

♫  This cold, distant, indifferent star   ♫
