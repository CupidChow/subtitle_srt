1
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:11,900


2
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:14,830
   

3
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,100
   

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,540
   

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,900
   

6
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,800
   

7
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,030
   

8
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,880
 - Oppa? 
 - Hello. I'm your second-floor neighbor. 

9
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,550
 Children shouldn't be hungry. Okay? 

10
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,300
 Is San Ha your oppa? You can have him. 

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,340
 I'll bring your favorite hamburgers when I come back, Hae Joon. 

12
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,150
 I wish you were my dad. 

13
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,870
 What an interesting bunch you are. 
   

14
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,400
 My goodness, you're all so unfortunate. 

15
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,990
 We aren't unfortunate at all. 

16
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,400
 We are all special in our own way. 

17
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,860
 The crazy one? She should go to a disciplinary hearing. 

18
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,680
 So you won't apologize, right? 

19
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,990
 Sorry for what? 

20
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,800
 He was taking pictures of you. Maybe your mom sent him. 

21
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,570
 - Mom! I was mistaken. 
 - What? 

22
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,100
 Are you Kang Hae Joon? 

23
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,900
 I'm... 

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,770
 your father. 

25
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,720
 I'm your dad! 

26
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,890
 Father! 

27
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,040
   

28
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,140
You resemble me so much.

29
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,360
H-How so?

30
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,040
Can't you tell? Large, monolid eyes are the Namwon Yang family's signature.

31
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,340
And eyes that crinkle when we smile.

32
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,590
Don't everyone's eyes crinkle when they smile?

33
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:13,210
Many don't have attractive monolid eyes like you do.

34
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,700
Wait, did Seo Hyeon never mention me?

35
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:22,740
Did she say I died or...

36
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,840
She said I had no father to begin with.

37
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,690
Is she Mary* or something? 
  (TN: Reference to biblical Mary) 

38
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:28,710
How could a child be born without a dad?

39
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,840
No, no. That wasn't directed at you. I said that because I was upset.

40
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,560
If only she had told me she was pregnant with you,

41
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,600
you and I wouldn't have been separated.

42
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,170
Nor would we have to reunite after nineteen years!

43
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,740
Gosh!

44
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,150
So you had no idea.

45
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,310
Then how did you find out about me and come all this way?

46
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,770
What?

47
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,710
How did you find out about me?

48
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,970
Give me a second.

49
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,990
Hello?

50
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,950
Mr. Kim, I'm in the countryside right now.

51
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,360
Yes, I know. Of course, I know it's urgent.

52
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,770
All right, fine. Okay. I said, all right!

53
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,790
I'm sorry, but something urgent came up.

54
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,410
This is the hotel I'm staying at.

55
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:29,190
You can reach me here if anything happens.

56
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,310
See you again. See you soon.

57
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,530
 I did as you said. 
   

58
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,400
 I said I had no idea he was born. 

59
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,900
He asked me how I found out about him to come looking for him.

60
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,980
Oh, you're right.

61
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:03,070
How could he not be suspicious when I showed up out of the blue?

62
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,550
I guess he's a bright one, isn't he?

63
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,510
He must take after me, right?

64
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,250
All right, all right. Bye.

65
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,270
Goodness. Goodness gracious!

66
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,580
Who was that?

67
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,920
Is it true? Is he really your dad?

68
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,130
Earlier, I noticed he was dressed in designer brands.

69
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,450
Hey, is he rich?

70
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,010
Yes. Yes, he is.

71
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,590
Are you okay?

72
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,370
Do you need a break?

73
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,130
It isn't okay. Who said we could skip practice?

74
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,400
Let's go.

75
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,030
Why are there more?

76
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,710
Why?

77
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,360
Why?

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,590
Mine, too.

79
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:04,390
Okay. He might not even read it.

80
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,350
- I know. 
 - I can't confirm if he reads it or not.

81
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,650
I know that, too.

82
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,080
I'll be happy if he reads it, and nothing can be done if he doesn't.

83
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,120
Then why do you bother?

84
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,890
When you have feelings for someone, you want to express them.

85
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,070
I'm leaving it to you.

86
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,950
Grab your report cards according to your assigned number.

87
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,390
And don't look at someone else's.

88
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,920
   

89
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,440
Did you do well?

90
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,490
That isn't important.

91
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,740
What? Why did they write my name? 
    

92
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,940
Isn't that for you?

93
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,460
What is?

94
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,250
The letter.

95
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,990
For me?

96
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:21,120
   

97
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,120
   

98
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,590
For me?

99
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,830
My name.

100
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,570
So it is written to you.

101
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:44,420
- What does it say? 
 - Hold on.

102
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,990
 Hi, Joo Won. 

103
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:49,440
 The moment I saw you on campus during one lunch break, 

104
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,300
 my heart suddenly started beating at 200 bpm (Beats per minute). 

105
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,600
What is "bpm"?

106
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,320
- He said it was 200. 
 - What?

107
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,270
He should be dead if it's 200.

108
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,110
So that means his heart was beating so fast he could die.

109
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,380
 It was suddenly spring in my heart. 

110
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,930
 I've decided to devote my body and soul to this unfamiliar emotion 

111
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:20,180
 and deliver my feelings to you through this letter. 

112
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,410
 With fond feelings, X. 

113
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,870
What is it?

114
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,670
What does it say?

115
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:30,110
He said he devoted his body and soul.

116
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,130
- To you? 
 - No.

117
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:34,540
To an unfamiliar emotion.

118
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,070
Really?

119
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,150
What about his name? Is it written there?

120
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,860
He wrote "X."

121
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,940
Is he in our grade?

122
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,700
- Is there no name? 
 - Yes.

123
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,740
Oh, it's Kim San Ha.

124
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,470
I'm going to brag about the letter.

125
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,780
- I'll get going. 
 - Okay.

126
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,070
San Ha!

127
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,120
 Report cards came out today, right? 

128
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,380
 I'll come pick you up after your academy. 

129
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:33,840
Do you want to eat tteokbokki?

130
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,990
I need to watch a video lecture before dinner.

131
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:40,690
Did something good happen?

132
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,580
- Are you curious? 
 - Sure.

133
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,490
Actually...

134
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,510
I have something to brag about.

135
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,940
Is it brag-worthy?

136
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,190
- Do you know what it's about? 
 - I do.

137
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,800
How?

138
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,720
Report cards came out today.

139
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,090
Go home.

140
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,940
Your birth father, whom you didn't know existed, just showed up.

141
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,840
You'd be a psycho if you could focus on practice.

142
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,010
But you really do resemble him.

143
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,370
You both have monolid eyes.

144
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,280
Tell Coach I went home because I felt unwell.

145
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:00,450
 The birth father he never knew existed? 

146
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,950
   

147
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,840
   

148
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,560
Were you going to brag about this?

149
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,100
This is someone's official document.

150
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,100
You can't look at it so freely, don't you think?

151
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,830
If it's out of five choices, shouldn't you at least get 20% correct?

152
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:27,450
If there's a first place, there's also a last place.

153
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:32,730
In this harsh, competitive society, not everyone can be first.

154
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:36,940
I still did better than two people.

155
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,440
Put it away.

156
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,340
The girls asked me to give you this.

157
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:50,470
Instead of delivering this–

158
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,690
If you reviewed the textbook once, instead of delivering this, you'd be in the middle.

159
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,890
When they develop feelings, they want to express them.

160
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,270
They're that earnest.

161
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,220
How could I reject that? Am I a psycho?

162
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,450
How does it feel to receive letters?

163
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,390
Is it nothing special because you get so many?

164
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,640
It's readable as long as they spell the words correctly.

165
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,000
You're too cruel.

166
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,070
You're so cold-hearted. So frigid.

167
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:24,470
Do you have the nerve to check spelling while reading a heartfelt letter?

168
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:26,290
Why are you getting angry?

169
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,460
Did you receive a letter or something?

170
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,340
Someone might write me a letter, too.

171
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,080
Who would?

172
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,300
I told you I had something to brag about.

173
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:44,410
I'm surprised you can get sidetracked with those grades.

174
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:47,710
Am I not allowed to do anything if I can't get good grades?

175
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:51,010
Kang Hae Joon didn't get good grades and still had a girlfriend.

176
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,760
Kang Hae Joon is good at basketball.

177
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,440
Good for you, Know-it-all!

178
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,130
Student! You'll split your skull open.

179
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,230
I'm sorry.

180
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:15,350
I stuck it out only a bit.

181
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,950
Just a tiny bit.

182
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,100
Be more careful.

183
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,080
So does San Ha not know you got a love letter?

184
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,120
I didn't show it to him.

185
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,370
It's obvious he would nag about it.

186
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,770
But, my daughter, San Ha isn't exactly wrong if you think about it.

187
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:52,550
I'm not exactly impressed that there's one person behind you, either.

188
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,600
- There are two people. 
 - You said one of them is an athlete.

189
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,590
You said I was a good daughter as long as I didn't drink, smoke, or gamble.

190
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:05,400
Well, yes. That's true, but...

191
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:10,110
Dad, don't you think I've reached a level of mastery in doing the dishes?

192
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,650
Once I graduate, should I do the dishes at your store?

193
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:16,260
What? Why? Won't you go to college?

194
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,110
What use is college with my grades?

195
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,940
I'm not interested in learning anything, either.

196
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,790
What do you think? My help will make things easier for you, too.

197
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,650
You said you've mastered washing dishes.

198
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,200
It's no fun if you keep doing something you've mastered.

199
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,070
You just don't know it yet,

200
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:41,880
but there are many things more fun than washing dishes.

201
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,900
If I'm not good at it, it doesn't matter if it's fun.

202
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,470
Don't you remember? I cooked chicken soup in the summer,

203
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,960
but Kim San Ha didn't eat it saying it might give him a stomachache,

204
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,260
and Kang Hae Joon said it tasted funny.

205
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:58,050
Is it so hard to eat something your younger sister made and act like it is delicious?

206
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,220
But there are many other fun things.

207
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,210
To not gamble, drink, or smoke is...

208
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,340
How should I put this? A form of passive filial piety.

209
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:13,400
But finding something you love to do and enjoying life is active filial piety.

210
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,120
Really? Enjoying my life is fulfilling filial piety?

211
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,830
Of course. And being healthy, that's the best.

212
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,660
Then why did you give them gorosoe* and not me? 
  (TN: Mineral water that's good for health) 

213
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,070
I only had this much. Only two bottles.

214
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,880
They are in twelfth grade.

215
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,220
I didn't drink any.

216
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,260
And I didn't give any to Ahjusshi. He has no idea.

217
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,290
- Really? 
 - Of course.

218
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,870
Is San Ha studying at home?

219
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,740
He said not to disturb him because he had to watch a lecture.

220
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,940
Then ask Hae Joon what he wants for dinner.

221
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,570
I'll go home and make dinner after I sterilize these dishcloths.

222
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:54,370
I'm the one who did the dishes.

223
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,510
Why are you making what Kang Hae Joon wants for dinner?

224
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,210
Three fried eggs... Special.

225
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,770
He will probably say he wants crab soybean paste stew.

226
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,050
Is he still at practice?

227
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,900
 I'm... 

228
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,740
 your father. 

229
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,710
 I'm your dad! 

230
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:44,330
 If only she had told me she was pregnant with you, you and I  wouldn't have been separated. 

231
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:49,160
 Nor would we have to reunite after nineteen years! 

232
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,170
   

233
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:30,330
   

234
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,020
   

235
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,150
Practice is over?

236
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,720
Why aren't you going home?

237
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,040
No reason.

238
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,960
It's okay. You'll dirty your hands.

239
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,850
What?

240
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:30,330
- Actually, today– 
 - Aigoo. So diligent.

241
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:35,050
What use will he be if you raise him without even letting him touch the garbage?

242
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:36,870
I'll be right out after hanging the dishcloths.

243
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,270
Okay.

244
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:52,190
Now that I look at you like this, you guys do look alike.

245
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,120
We aren't blood-related, how could we look alike?

246
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,030
Even married couples start resembling each other after living together for a long time.

247
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,270
You and Mr. Yoon have lived together for ten years now.

248
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:09,670
Aigoo, now that it ended up like this,

249
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:14,710
I wonder if I made too much fuss telling him to send you back.

250
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,150
Good for you that you realize that now.

251
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,980
Look at you talk!

252
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,980
You just need to say "all right" when an adult says something.

253
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,830
All right.

254
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,720
- I said, all right. 
 - Madam!

255
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,150
It doesn't hurt at all.

256
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,630
You're going to trip.

257
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,910
Slow down.

258
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,880
Anyway, what about today?

259
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,340
- What? 
 - You were about to say something earlier.

260
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:57,130
Did something happen?

261
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:02,030
Joo Won said you didn't even reply when she asked you what you wanted for dinner.

262
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,890
Just that today's practice was a bit rough.

263
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:11,170
All right. How anticlimactic.

264
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,690
I forgot the fried eggs.

265
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,960
- Three for me. 
 - How could I forget?

266
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,680
- Be quiet. 
 - I didn't say anything.

267
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,960
- You spoke with your eyes. 
 - What did I say?

268
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,630
"You dare to ask for three eggs with those grades?"

269
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,180
Can you read minds now?

270
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,040
It is nothing new.

271
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,200
She can just do better on her next exam after eating three eggs.

272
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,190
Why aren't you saying anything?

273
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,170
- What? 
 - An opportunity presented itself.

274
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:50,830
Aren't you excited?

275
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,330
My grades aren't anything to brag about, either.

276
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,910
That's true.

277
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,010
Spill it.

278
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,040
What?

279
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,640
Spill what?

280
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,370
I don't know.

281
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:37,610
How would I know unless you tell me?

282
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,650
Things will escalate if I call Joo Won.

283
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,980
Didn't he pass away?

284
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,630
Mom never said that.

285
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:58,070
It was just...

286
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,450
How should I put this?

287
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,550
He was happy to see me, his son.

288
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,230
And I think I was a bit glad, too.

289
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,040
But if I'm too happy,

290
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,940
I'd feel bad for Dad.

291
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,150
I've been calling him "Dad" for so many years.

292
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:29,620
To tell him, "I actually had a real dad" at this point...

293
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,280
Would you be able to do that?

294
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,620
One thing gives me peace of mind, though.

295
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:50,250
You know how Mom cut off contact with me not long after I came here, right?

296
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,190
I didn't let it show,

297
00:21:54,190 --> 00:22:00,260
but I thought hard about what I did so wrong for her to abandon me like that.

298
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,340
 Mom. Mom! 

299
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,450
 Mom! 

300
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:10,790
But he said he never knew I was born.

301
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:13,870
At least he didn't abandon me out of hate.

302
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,800
That's a bit...

303
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,440
reassuring...

304
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,550
or comforting, I guess.

305
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,880
That's true.

306
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:36,440
Wait, no! I-I wasn't talking about you.

307
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,270
I wasn't implying your mom left you because she hated you.

308
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,250
Stop overreacting.

309
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,230
You're making it seem true.

310
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:48,040
I really didn't mean it like that.

311
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,180
Are you sure he's your real dad?

312
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,810
Didn't he ask for a DNA (genetics) test or something?

313
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,880
Come on. What for?

314
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,030
I resemble him so much that you'd go, "Wow, that's Hae Joon's dad,"

315
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,760
if you saw him.

316
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,790
Our monolid eyes are the same.

317
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,180
- "Monolid eyes"? 
 - Yes.

318
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:11,160
He said large, monolid eyes

319
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,190
are the Namwon Yang family's signature.

320
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,440
I never knew that.

321
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,800
How could you be so certain with just monolids?

322
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:22,200
Hey, I'm certain. Why would he lie about that?

323
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,320
Did he look healthy?

324
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,260
"Healthy"?

325
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:36,250
Maybe he might need compatible organs...

326
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,100
Are you crazy?

327
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,190
What did your aunt say?

328
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,680
As if I had the time to tell her.

329
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,720
Aunt doesn't know anything, anyway.

330
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,620
Are you sure she didn't hear a single thing?

331
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,430
Even from her sister?

332
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:58,680
Why are you so suspicious about everything?

333
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,990
Let's go inside.

334
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,640
   

335
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,240
He is over 180 cm tall.

336
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,260
So what, unless he plays basketball?

337
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,420
He is a Math Olympiad alumni.

338
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:32,580
No way. We are way too different. 
    

339
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:37,310
Him. Doesn't he come by our class often these days?

340
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,590
He is dating Jae In.

341
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,810
I didn't see you there. Sorry.

342
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:47,240
You always drink strawberry milk.

343
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,350
That I only drink strawberry milk...

344
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:52,260
How does he know?

345
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,150
What class is he in?

346
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,720
Class Four.

347
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,250
Should I ask him?

348
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,500
Can you do it?

349
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,810
Why not?

350
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:03,420
Gosh, strawberry milk is always sold out.

351
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,250
I need that to stay awake.

352
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,280
What if I had asked?

353
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,890
You have to devote body and soul.

354
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,900
Boldly.

355
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,710
You don't invest any funds into the game. That's the least you could do.

356
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,690
 Is there no one who comes to mind? 

357
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:25,310
 No. 

358
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:28,280
 All I need is someone who has a pretty smile. 

359
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,480
This is like, "Where's Waldo?"

360
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,340
Judging by how he didn't write his name, he is an introvert.

361
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,040
I guess we searched for him in vain.

362
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:43,130
I give up.

363
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,800
Instead...

364
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,150
I'm going to brag about this to Kang Hae Joon.

365
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,580
Do you want to come with me?

366
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,140
- Yes. 
 - Let's go.

367
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,680
   

368
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:09,430
Hey.

369
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:13,440
Aunt is probably busy. Must we...

370
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,230
Follow me.

371
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,390
 Hae Joon isn't here. 

372
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:24,380
   

373
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,560
What the heck? Where did he go without a word?

374
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:32,150
Just tell him about it at home.

375
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:34,480
I need to tell him when Kim San Ha isn't around.

376
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,270
That's why I couldn't tell him this morning, either.

377
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,170
Do you want to come to my house tomorrow?

378
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:45,060
Kim San Ha will probably stay in his room studying.

379
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,980
The three of us could hang out.

380
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,780
   

381
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,310
 I'm here to meet my aunt. 

382
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,560
Can you tell me her name and department?

383
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,340
Manager Kang Yi Yeon from the Marketing Department.

384
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,460
Please wait a moment.

385
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,970
Wow, Aunt works at a really nice place.

386
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,710
Aunt.

387
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,430
Hello.

388
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,050
What brings you all the way here?

389
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,930
I wanted to ask you something.

390
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,820
What is it?

391
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,630
Seeing how San Ha came with you, it must be a big deal, right?

392
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:21,510
   

393
00:27:34,530 --> 00:27:36,950
You've never heard of him, either, right?

394
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:45,670
To be honest, he came by yesterday

395
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:48,270
and gave me his business card saying he was my dad.

396
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:52,630
I resemble him a lot.

397
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:54,970
I think he is telling the truth.

398
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,840
Did you hear anything from Mom?

399
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,950
Did he come looking for you?

400
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,060
Yes.

401
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,860
Why?

402
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,850
Do you know him?

403
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,910
How do you know him?

404
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:25,420
Can you... not meet him again?

405
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,720
Aunt...

406
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,170
If you must see him, I can't see you anymore.

407
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,390
Why can't I see him?

408
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,000
Did Mom tell you something?

409
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:59,880
 I saw them together when Unni was pregnant. 

410
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,090
 Gosh, that's enough. 

411
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:04,230
 What can I do by myself? 

412
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:07,350
 My goodness, I don't feel comfortable... 

413
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:10,990
 Just... Just give it a rest. 

414
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,680
 Unni. 

415
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,110
 Did you bring it? 

416
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,440
   

417
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,150
 That can't be. 

418
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,680
He said he didn't know I was born.

419
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:30,530
He said Mom never told him she was pregnant.

420
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:33,020
He never knew I existed.

421
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:38,730
He is someone who would say something like that.

422
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:02,850
 Unni and I also found out much later. 

423
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:11,640
By then, we heard he had married the youngest daughter of a very wealthy family.

424
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,240
Why hide something so insignificant from me?

425
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,030
What?

426
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,280
It's fine now that I know.

427
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,700
Let's go.

428
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,950
Don't worry about it. I won't meet him.

429
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,810
So will you still see me?

430
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,910
I don't want any.

431
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:00,320
You should eat something sweet when you're feeling down.

432
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,780
My arm is going to fall off.

433
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:14,030
Let's go home after you feel better.

434
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:16,930
If anyone saw your face, they would think something bad happened,

435
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,460
even if it wasn't Ahjusshi or Joo Won.

436
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,170
Did you know this would happen?

437
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,350
I should've known as soon as you suggested meeting Aunt.

438
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,290
How unnecessarily smart of you.

439
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,430
Thanks for the compliment.

440
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,760
Forget it. I won't meet him from now on.

441
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,940
Let's just pretend it never happened.

442
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,450
What?

443
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:48,260
Will ripping that erase everything that happened?

444
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,870
So what, then?

445
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,320
We need to find out.

446
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,750
The reason he disregarded you back then

447
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:58,560
but came looking for you after all this time.

448
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,030
Where are they? I'm bored.

449
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,800
Darn it.

450
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,050
Where did they go?

451
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:42,700
I'm not curious. I'm chill.

452
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,600
I'm not obsessing over their affairs.

453
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,750
I'm not curious.

454
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,000
I'm curious...

455
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:54,750
 Darn it. 

456
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,330
 Hey. 

457
00:33:57,750 --> 00:33:59,520
My goodness.

458
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:01,600
   

459
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:05,470
Seriously.

460
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,520
Hey, come on.

461
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,700
Give it a rest. We are almost home.

462
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,700
I feel weak. I feel so weak.

463
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,940
What's with him?

464
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,720
Take him.

465
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,970
Where is Dad?

466
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:22,560
At karaoke with the apartment ahjusshis and ahjummas.

467
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:26,950
Where did you go?

468
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,200
We visited Hae Joon's aunt.

469
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:33,330
He could've said he went to visit her. He didn't even pick up my call.

470
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,500
Why did he go so discreetly?

471
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,170
I don't know.

472
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,130
Dal is coming over tomorrow!

473
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,130
Hae Joon and I are going out tomorrow again.

474
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,870
What? Where to this time?

475
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:45,500
Don't try to know everything.

476
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,170
Where are you guys going?

477
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:53,480
Where are you going tomorrow?

478
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,070
Tomorrow is Saturday.

479
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,000
Dal is coming over tomorrow.

480
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,660
 That's good. Have fun with Dal. 

481
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,850
 It's even better if no one is home. 

482
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:05,950
She is coming to see you.

483
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,370
What?

484
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,830
It'll be fun with just the two of us.

485
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:14,600
Imagine how much more fun it'll be with everyone.

486
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,880
 He was happy to see me, his son. 

487
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,810
 And I think I was a bit glad, too. 

488
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,150
 I thought hard about what I did so wrong for her 

489
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,910
 to abandon me like that. 

490
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:45,060
 I wasn't implying your mom left you because she hated you. 

491
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:53,170
 The problem is I'm so sane that this thought doesn't leave me! 

492
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,990
 - Okay, Honey– 
 - I wish I was crazy... 

493
00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:00,490
 I wish I was crazy and didn't think about any of this! 

494
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:46,390
 I can't check my phone because I have makeup classes at the academy all day. 

495
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,950
 I'll let you know when I'm done. 
   

496
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,650
Let's go.

497
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:05,380
Dad told us to eat lunch at the store.

498
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,910
He doesn't have to do that.

499
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,910
Class President, my dad's kalguksu is amazing.

500
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:13,140
You better not beg for another bowl after you try it.

501
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,400
I look forward to it.

502
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,700
Sorry. I invited you today thinking Kang Hae Joon would be home.

503
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,900
It's fine. I told you I came to hang out with you.

504
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,380
Those two disappeared again first thing in the morning.

505
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,120
They should tell me where they are going.

506
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,150
They left me out.

507
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,690
I know.

508
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,130
But don't be too sulky.

509
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:35,420
Why?

510
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:40,390
Even if you're family, it can be suffocating if you're like that.

511
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:46,920
Oh, I mean... not suffocating.

512
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,450
It can be a bit...

513
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:53,380
stifling at times.

514
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,680
- You think so? 
 - Yes.

515
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,510
Privacy.

516
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,070
"Privacy", my foot.

517
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,910
Kim San Ha looks at my report card without my permission, too.

518
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,680
Dal...

519
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,820
you really know how to pick your snacks.

520
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,270
- Right? 
 - Yes.

521
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,690
Do you want to take a look at Kang Hae Joon's room? It's right there.

522
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:23,220
No, you shouldn't enter someone's room when they aren't around.

523
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,720
Nothing much, right? 
    

524
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,320
What do you say?

525
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,000
Should I give you some alone time?

526
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,620
It's okay.

527
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,880
Why did he leave this here?

528
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,330
He's usually not this messy.

529
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:50,110
He's neat in his own way.

530
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,380
He probably left in a hurry.

531
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,750
It's probably not a big deal, right?

532
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:59,840
"Big deal"? About what?

533
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,180
   

534
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:04,020
Wow.

535
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,990
Don't places like this cost several hundred thousand won a night?

536
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:11,140
Is this the right place?

537
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,470
It is.

538
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,870
He told me to meet him at the Heaven Hotel lounge.

539
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,270
Don't let this intimidate you.

540
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:25,270
If you're going to take a swing at him, I'll cover you.

541
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:27,370
What are you saying?

542
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,790
I'm going to ask him nicely.

543
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,920
Is it my organs?

544
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,120
What? What about your organs?

545
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,900
Oh my goodness, I'm healthy.

546
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:53,010
I take herbal tonics all four seasons and don't even touch processed foods.

547
00:39:53,010 --> 00:39:56,360
Don't you believe me? Do I have to show you my medical records?

548
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,470
The doctor said my physical age was in the thirties.

549
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:02,570
That isn't an easy feat, even if you're rich.

550
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,150
Then why did you come looking for me?

551
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,190
Obviously, because you're my son.

552
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,340
You're my blood.

553
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,270
But you disregarded me nineteen years ago.

554
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,210
I heard you cut Mom off when she was due to give birth.

555
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,130
Says who?

556
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:33,450
Seo Hyeon isn't the type to say that kind of thing.

557
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,110
- Aunt. 
 - Aunt...

558
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,810
Oh, her?

559
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,310
Is that why you brought your friend along to argue?

560
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,100
To fight two against one?

561
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,400
You've grown up more petty than I thought.

562
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:53,100
I think it's more petty for an adult to call minors petty for "fighting two against one."

563
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,380
If it isn't for organs, then fine.

564
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,430
Please don't contact me again.

565
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:04,070
You already cut off our ties back then.

566
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,330
I came here to tell you that.

567
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:12,280
Wait. As you can clearly see...

568
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,690
Sit down.

569
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,550
Well,

570
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:22,410
I have some money and property.

571
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,300
I have everything.

572
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:29,120
But I don't have a child.

573
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,160
So what?

574
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,840
"So what"?

575
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,240
Oh, so...

576
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,120
My wife's family is... How should I say this?

577
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,990
Do they want your money?

578
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,040
They used to only joke about it before.

579
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,550
But nowadays, they're more blatant about it.

580
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:52,260
They're dividing my property amongst themselves.

581
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,800
Isn't that ridiculous?

582
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,760
Coveting my assets while I'm still alive just because I don't have an heir?

583
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,720
If you're looking for an heir, adoption is a better method.

584
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,800
This isn't a bad deal for you, either.

585
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,870
You can do anything you want if you come with me to America.

586
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:13,710
- "America"? 
 - Yes, America.

587
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:16,230
You know, don't you? America is known for basketball.

588
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:19,300
NBA. Michael Jordan.

589
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:23,440
What are you saying?

590
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,010
Basketball is fun in Korea, too.

591
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,720
What?

592
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,420
Are we beggars?

593
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,850
Hey.

594
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:44,110
That...

595
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,930
Darn it! Seriously.

596
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:56,740
Stop that. Sand is flying everywhere.

597
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,170
He's the worst.

598
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,040
He's worse than I expected.

599
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,110
I'd rather he asked for my organs!

600
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:04,010
- Would you give them to him? 
 - Why would I?

601
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,530
They're my precious organs.

602
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:07,420
Seriously.

603
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:13,160
How long will you keep this up? People are staring.

604
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,250
Let's say your mom had her reasons.

605
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:21,280
Why did your aunt stay quiet and create this situation?

606
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,390
Aunt probably concealed it for my sake.

607
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:28,270
There are things better left unknown in this world.

608
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:31,590
You should know about it since it concerns you.

609
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:33,200
Anyway, she had good intentions–

610
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,390
How can you be so sure good intentions lead to a good result?

611
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:43,240
Your aunt felt you wouldn't be able to handle the truth.

612
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:49,150
You aren't entirely wrong.

613
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,020
Don't tell Dad and Joo Won about this.

614
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,160
How much of it?

615
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,280
The fact that your birth dad appeared or that he's rich?

616
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,650
Everything.

617
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:00,800
Why shouldn't we?

618
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,410
They don't have to know.

619
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:04,640
Didn't you hear a thing I said?

620
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,450
- Okay? 
 - I don't know.

621
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:08,450
Don't tell them.

622
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,150
Okay? Okay?

623
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,990
Don't tell them.

624
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:15,230
- Thanks for the food. 
 - Sure. Thank you. Take care!

625
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,280
Kalguksu.

626
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,360
Is that what you're here for?

627
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,410
Oh, yes. Come in.

628
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:03,470
Have I met you before?

629
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,790
Oh, I haven't, right?

630
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:11,350
I thought you were staring at me because we are acquainted.

631
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:14,110
We are more than just acquaintances.

632
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:21,400
Since you raised my son for ten years.

633
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,320
"Son"?

634
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,840
I'm...

635
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:32,180
Hae Joon's dad.

636
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:47,370
Oh, hold on.

637
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:15,660
I prepared a lot more than expected.

638
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:20,740
Whose expectations do you speak of?

639
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:22,470
My goodness.

640
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:26,800
This is something I'll never be able to comprehend.

641
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,610
Raising someone else's child.

642
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:32,650
That isn't as easy as you'd think...

643
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,670
Right?

644
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,930
I never thought of him as someone else's child.

645
00:46:42,030 --> 00:46:45,640
I prepared exactly double the amount my attorney came up with.

646
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:51,730
I tried convincing him when I spoke to him, but I couldn't get through to the child.

647
00:46:51,730 --> 00:46:55,280
He's making me go this far. Gosh.

648
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,230
Did you meet Hae Joon?

649
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:01,180
Yes, I did.

650
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:02,960
He will be a legal adult next year,

651
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,440
so I thought it would be quicker to talk to him directly.

652
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,190
I want to leave the country by the end of this year at the latest.

653
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:12,420
But I need to change his last name and make him a passport.

654
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,060
These things take several months.

655
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:16,850
Wait a minute.

656
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:20,780
We just met.

657
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:23,450
What's this about leaving the country and changing his name?

658
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:26,150
He's using his mom's surname right now.

659
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:29,170
He should use his dad's surname now that we've met.

660
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:32,030
And his passport should show my surname,

661
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:35,210
so we can get an immigration visa together, right?

662
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:37,270
Immigration...

663
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:39,160
"Immigration"?

664
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,970
Are you planning to emigrate together with Hae Joon?

665
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:47,040
Yes.

666
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,590
What did Hae Joon say?

667
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:52,620
A minor's affairs are the guardian's responsibility.

668
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:57,700
Even so, he's in twelfth grade, which is an important period.

669
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,410
He has his own opinion. You can't just suddenly...

670
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:01,910
Oh my.

671
00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:04,690
I said I put more than enough in there for you.

672
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,840
You're quite greedy.

673
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:13,130
All right, fine. I'll consider adding a bit more compensation.

674
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:15,950
What do you mean by "compensation"?

675
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:20,250
W-Wait, that isn't what I meant.

676
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,890
Yes.

677
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:33,010
A minor's affairs are the guardian's responsibility.

678
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,870
I'm his guardian right now.

679
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,550
So is this how you're going to be?

680
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:54,170
Yes, well, for now.

681
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:57,760
Seriously. Are you joking with me?

682
00:49:02,680 --> 00:49:05,830
Isn't it preparation hours right now?

683
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:09,040
I'm in the middle of a conversation with a customer right now.

684
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,710
Come back in a bit.

685
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,600
I'm sorry, Dal.

686
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,620
Hello.

687
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,610
Let's go.

688
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:18,900
Okay.

689
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:28,810
Wasn't the atmosphere weird?

690
00:49:28,810 --> 00:49:32,360
Yes. Have you never seen that ahjusshi before?

691
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,740
Yes.

692
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:39,030
Oppa.

693
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,260
Hey.

694
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:45,340
Dal, are you visiting?

695
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,430
Hello.

696
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,830
You two should stop by the store.

697
00:49:50,450 --> 00:49:52,720
- Why? 
 - There's a strange ahjusshi there.

698
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,900
- You should stop by. 
 - Who?

699
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,810
I said I didn't know. But...

700
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:00,550
Anyway, the atmosphere was weird.

701
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:02,180
I'm tired.

702
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:05,660
Me, too.

703
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:11,030
 Your birth father, who you didn't know existed, just showed up. 

704
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,400
Oh, monolid eyes.

705
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,840
He has large, monolid eyes.

706
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,390
You kind of resemble him.

707
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,530
Darn it.

708
00:50:28,530 --> 00:50:30,330
Seriously.

709
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:35,240
What is it? What about monolid eyes?

710
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,170
Dad!

711
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:51,420
Hey.

712
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,240
He left.

713
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,520
Just now.

714
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:33,170
Hey. Did Dal leave?

715
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,790
Do you want some ice cream?

716
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:38,560
I bought the one you like.

717
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:49,160
I heard you met him.

718
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:58,050
Why didn't you tell me?

719
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:03,020
I'm not scolding you.

720
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,190
If you had told me, I would've had time to...

721
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,180
Never mind.

722
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:14,750
I'm not blaming you, nor is it your fault.

723
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:19,950
Your dad...

724
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,920
I mean, not me.

725
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,380
Your real, biological dad...

726
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:37,790
Your biological dad...

727
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:42,350
wants to take you with him.

728
00:52:45,610 --> 00:52:47,510
And?

729
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:53,790
You're his biological son. Of course, he'd want to take you.

730
00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:57,070
It isn't like I don't understand him.

731
00:52:57,070 --> 00:53:02,210
And he's your biological dad, so you must also...

732
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:05,850
If you want to go with him...

733
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,410
And if you're asking for my opinion...

734
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,760
I wish you wouldn't go with him.

735
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:39,430
You're still...

736
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:44,260
You're still in high school.

737
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:49,090
At least until you graduate high school,

738
00:53:49,890 --> 00:53:55,830
I could cook for you and...

739
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:02,060
iron your school uniform and...

740
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:09,140
Never mind. You can do what you want.

741
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:14,060
But I...

742
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:20,620
I just want to do those things a little longer.

743
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,680
I didn't tell you.

744
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:37,570
I-I didn't tell you...

745
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,720
because I thought you'd tell me to go.

746
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:50,390
You were planning to keep me...

747
00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:53,160
only until my mom returned.

748
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:58,890
But now that my biological dad

749
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:02,010
appeared instead of Mom...

750
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:07,060
I thought you'd tell me to go.

751
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:16,870
I was afraid.

752
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,460
I was afraid.

753
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:29,790
N-No...

754
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,880
It isn't like that, Hae Joon.

755
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:40,350
Don't go...

756
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,840
I'm sorry.

757
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,120
 It's okay. 

758
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,920
   

759
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,620
His biological dad?

760
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,170
Yes.

761
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,160
Wow. So he had a dad.

762
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,500
Good for him.

763
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,430
Is that good?

764
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:17,580
Even if that ahjusshi takes Hae Joon with him?

765
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,840
Is he going to take him?

766
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,910
Isn't that obvious?

767
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:23,080
I guess so.

768
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,750
Are you okay with him leaving?

769
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,910
He won't go anyway. Right?

770
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:31,280
He might go since it's his biological dad.

771
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,470
What about our dad? What will our dad do?

772
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:37,840
Even now, he's always worried Hae Joon might skip a meal.

773
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:40,400
How could he leave our dad?

774
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,850
We can tell him to see his biological dad occasionally.

775
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:47,160
Just like his aunt.

776
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:56,840
So he can't leave?

777
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,820
He can't.

778
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:05,480
- Never? 
 - Never.

779
00:57:11,610 --> 00:57:14,020
Why are you crying?

780
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:24,250
Stay away. Stay away.

781
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:45,060
Darn it.

782
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:49,950
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

783
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:52,360
Why would you leave that there?

784
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:57,990
- I'm sorry. 
 - It's fine.

785
00:57:57,990 --> 00:57:59,580
Difficult people exist everywhere.

786
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,840
Mom, when are we going to see Oppa?

787
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,010
Soon.

788
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:05,700
- Let's play a bit. 
 - Hey, careful. You'll fall.

789
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:08,020
Wait for Mommy.

790
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:25,590
What will you do now?

791
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:32,330
If he insists on taking him, I'll hire an attorney if I have to.

792
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:37,040
Fortunately, the store is under my name.

793
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:52,150
19-year-old Kang Hae Joon, who is more of a coward than anyone.

794
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:57,280
Kang Hae Joon, who is always looking for his dad and crab soybean paste stew.

795
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,710
To Hae Joon, his dad is the best chef.

796
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:05,120
19-year-old Kang Hae Joon bursts into tears as he considers the possibility

797
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,850
of losing such a good chef.

798
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:11,240
That's enough.

799
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,670
19-year-old Hae Joon...

800
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:14,310
That's enough.

801
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:15,910
He said he's sorry.

802
00:59:15,910 --> 00:59:19,780
I'm upset that I went around cluelessly looking for Kang Hae Joon.

803
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:22,460
Why were you looking for me?

804
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:25,610
I know. Why was I looking for you?

805
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:29,610
It was definitely something

806
00:59:29,610 --> 00:59:34,110
more important than this situation.

807
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:38,100
Out of the way.

808
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:44,280
You know Yoon Joo Won is the smartest one out of us, right?

809
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,480
That's what I'm saying. We should've told Joo Won from the start.

810
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,260
Going to the hotel and meeting with Aunt...

811
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:51,990
We didn't have to go through the trouble.

812
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:54,530
You're the one who said I was sharp.

813
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:56,900
Sharp for no good reason.

814
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:03,210
I told you to stop delivering letters.

815
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:05,900
It isn't yours. It's mine.

816
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,900
Yoon Joo Won. You see that, right? 
    

817
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,560
Yoon Joo Won.

818
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:12,380
Hey, is that more important than my situation?

819
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,580
Who gave you that?

820
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,550
I don't know.

821
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:20,010
I'm going to start dating now, too.

822
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:21,830
Dating.

823
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:25,430
Let me see that. Are you sure it isn't a chain letter?

824
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:27,620
Let me take a look.

825
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:31,150
Give it.

826
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:56,020


827
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:58,950
   

828
01:00:59,570 --> 01:01:05,960
♫  There was a time when I was filled with hopes about my dream  ♫

829
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:14,260
♫  That dream made me feel like I owned the world  ♫

830
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:22,660
♫  My empty heart was filled with promises we made  ♫

831
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:26,720
♫  I didn’t even know it was cold  ♫

832
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:32,410
♫  I had nothing to envy  ♫
