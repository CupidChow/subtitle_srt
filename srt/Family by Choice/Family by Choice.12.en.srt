If it's involuntary manslaughter,

147
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,950
there must have been either self-defense or a justifiable reason.

148
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,720
So what did you say?

149
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,530
Did you agree?

150
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,280
Not to tell Haejun?

151
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,970
She said she'd leave if I told him.

152
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,840
Then, Haejun also loses his chance to see his mom.

153
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,620
Even so!

154
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:49,680
She should tell him the reason for cutting ties so he can come to terms with it.

155
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,650
Consider the pain she must feel to say she doesn't want to see her own child.

Why wouldn't he?

166
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,190
I'm not saying he would,

167
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:34,750
but he couldn't come to us right away, even when he first arrived in Haedong.

168
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,690
How worried must he feel about meeting his mom after 20 years?

169
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:45,140
I think we ought to open a store for him or find him a job.

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,690
- Why would she leave someone like him?
- Babe.

183
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,830
Do you want to see me lose it?

184
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,130
Um...

185
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:43,140
Hey, Attorney Park. Do you know this guy? Huh?

186
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,510
Am I just a guy you know?

187
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,880
He's not just a guy I know.

188
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,150
He's the person I like.

189
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,690
Lucky her!

190
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:19,050
What kind of situation is this?

191
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:23,240
What a joke. Whoa!

192
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,400
It'll be hard for you to go on another blind date in the future.

193
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:37,960
My acting was pretty good, but yours was off the charts, too!

194
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,800
I really thought you were confessing your feelings to me.

195
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,040
I wasn't! I really wasn't.

196
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,030
Sir!

197
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,250
Mr. Yang!

198
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,850
- Mr. Yang!
- What are you doing here?

199
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,370
Oh, I was on my way to see a property

200
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:57,120
when I saw you standing here.

201
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,920
The property you saw last time was sold this morning.

202
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,680
Man, already?

203
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,300
Aigoo, I told you the good ones sell within hours!

204
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,460
It's really rare to find a building like this for 800 million won.

205
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,990
Eight hundred million won?

206
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,790
I'll reach out to you again.

207
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,930
Yes, take care

208
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,370
Eight hundred million won?

209
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,170
Why?

210
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:35,880
Do you think it's a bad idea, too?

211
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,640
No, I'd love to receive a building, of course.

212
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,630
Right? You'd love to, right?

213
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:46,510
But Kim Sanha keeps telling me to ask Dad first.

214
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:49,380
Then, it wouldn't be a surprise.

215
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,120
Sunbae, do you like apples?

216
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,610
I do.

217
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,470
After winning cases, my clients sometimes bring me apples.

218
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,790
But I like strawberries.

219
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,040
It's ultimately up to the giver,

220
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,840
but wouldn't it be better to ask the person for whom the gift is intended?

221
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,970
All right.

222
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,980
Whoa, you really know how to tailor your explanation.

223
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,560
Attorneys really are different.

224
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,120
I should talk to Dad while I'm at it.

225
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,900
Let's eat-

226
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,120
I should've just stayed put.

227
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,880
Hey, Park Dal!

228
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,600
I'm in your debt!

229
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,910
I'll buy you dinner next time!

230
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,080
Okay!

231
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,070
Madam.

232
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,270
Do you know the market price for commercial properties in the city these days?

233
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:03,710
Yeah, Jinju's daughter-in-law works in real estate downtown.

234
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,270
I occasionally visit to eat rice cakes.

235
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:13,270
How much would a store of this size cost?

236
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,950
Why? You want to move stores?

237
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,200
No, not me. For Haejun.

238
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,740
Good thinking!

239
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:24,470
What good can come from leaving him idle?

240
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,900
But even a small property would still cost

241
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,720
at least a hundred million with the deposit and

242
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,900
key money, even with a loan.

243
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,620
- A hundred million?
- Yes.

244
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:41,020
Okay, please give me her contact number for now.

245
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:45,420
Madam!

246
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,230
Going home?

247
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:50,730
Who are you?

248
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,730
You look so handsome!

249
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,640
You should dress like this all the time.

250
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,370
Gosh, I can't every day. Too many women will bother me.

251
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:02,240
Why don't you talk after you find one?

252
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,400
You should be good to Mr. Yoon.

253
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,790
Sorry?

254
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,360
All right!

255
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,560
Dad!

256
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:19,200
Yes, I'll reach out to you again.

257
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,360
Yes, thank you.

258
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,670
Hey, you're here.

259
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:28,160
Whoa, why does my son look so blinding handsome today?

260
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,790
Did you land a job interview?

261
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,910
Nothing like that.

262
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,820
I came to eat.

263
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:38,930
You did? Good, let's go. I'll whip something up.

264
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,600
There's more. Slow down.

265
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,030
So, why did you move out?

266
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,190
You could eat home-cooked meals every day.

267
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,510
That's actually the reason why I came.

268
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,400
I was originally planning to move in after securing a property.

269
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,060
Property?

270
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,960
"This is yours, Dad!"

271
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,390
I was going to surprise you,

272
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,360
but everyone keeps telling me to ask you first.

273
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,290
What are you talking about?

274
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,580
What is-

275
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,710
Eight hundred million?

276
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,760
- Is this right?
- Yes.

277
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,400
Is this your birth father's money?

278
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,970
Gosh, no way!

279
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:03,170
Where did you get this much money, then?

280
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,910
I washed dishes and served tables.

281
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,760
Dishes and serving? What do you mean?

282
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,160
It's what I did at the store back then.

283
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,100
I got a lot of tips for my quick hands.

284
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,040
I caught a customer's eye and did some modeling, too.

285
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,950
The investments I made before serving in the military also did well.

286
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,570
I worked really hard to pay you back-

287
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,330
Worked hard...

288
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,480
to pay you back.

289
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:46,570
Did someone tell you to pay me back?

290
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,520
Did I send you to America to do those things?

291
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,040
What did I tell you before you left?

292
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,860
I told you to come back when you've had your fun.

293
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,770
Dishes and serving? Quick hands?

294
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:05,180
Did I ever tell you to do those things at the store?

295
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,060
No, that's not what I meant.

296
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,340
Still, you raised me for 10 years-

297
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,270
What parent doesn't? It comes naturally!

298
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,780
We raise you to eat well, sleep well, and live a joyful life.

299
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:18,660
Did I raise you to give me money?

300
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:21,230
Did I raise you to pay me back?

301
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:24,920
No.

302
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,310
- Take it back.
- Dad...

303
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,730
You...

304
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:38,370
Is it because I'm not your real father?

305
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:42,130
Is that why you keep insisting on paying me back?

306
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,880
It's not!

307
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,860
It's not like that! I don't ever think that way, Dad!

308
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:50,400
Leave.

309
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,520
Dad!

310
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,230
Leave!

311
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,020
[Myungju University Hospital]

312
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:11,510
Will you be home this weekend?

313
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,970
I have something to tell you.

314
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,940
What is it?

315
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:21,070
I'll tell you in person.

316
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,650
I'm fine.

317
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,860
I'm fine.

318
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,580
Hyungnim, do you have a fever?

319
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,120
A fever?

320
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,110
I don't. I'm fine.

321
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,130
I think you have a cold.

322
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,220
Thanks.

323
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,110
You need to rehydrate after crying.

324
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:28,750
I'm sorry. I spoke out carelessly.

325
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,280
It's not your fault.

326
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:40,860
He's this angry right now.

327
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,340
If I told him after signing the contract,

328
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,750
he might've said he'd never see me again.

329
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:54,330
No way. He's just saying that.

330
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,870
In my opinion,

331
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:06,120
I think he's heartbroken, not angry.

332
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,430
He didn't want you to suffer,

333
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:14,440
but you did suffer, which breaks his heart.

334
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:21,020
Isn't that proof that you're so loved?

335
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,120
I'm aware, too.

336
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,830
I'm the problem.

337
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,250
In the end, I'm not his biological son.

338
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:38,830
So, I keep thinking

339
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,960
I have to do something more

340
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,420
and that I have to pay him back.

341
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,300
Since you're aware, can't you just tell him you're sorry?

342
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,340
Should I go right now?

343
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,050
No.

344
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:06,190
Ahjussi might need some time,

345
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,360
so how about you go tomorrow?

346
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:13,570
All right. I'll go tomorrow.

347
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,680
What would I have done without you?

348
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,750
Thank you. Sincerely!

349
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,240
No problem.

350
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,780
Even if it were someone else, they would've told you the same.

351
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,630
Regardless.

352
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:38,910
So? You just let him leave like that?

353
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:42,850
I already gave him an earful.

354
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,870
I'm not saying I did a good thing...

355
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:48,570
Grab all the biological dads in the country and ask them.

356
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,590
If their child gave them money to buy a building,

357
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:58,030
100 out of 100 would be dancing barefoot with pure joy!

358
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,370
Would your dad do that, too, Officer Kim?

359
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:04,520
Sorry? Oh, my dad?

360
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,900
Yes, I think my dad would've danced in pure joy, too.

361
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,450
See? I speak the truth.

362
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,760
The reason Mr. Yoon got mad is because of his guilty conscience.

363
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,380
Since you're not his birth dad.

364
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,830
That's just my opinion.

365
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:31,180
Just take it as one opinion.

366
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,600
Anyway, what kind of modeling did Haejun do to make that much money?

367
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,660
Should I look into it?

368
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:42,050
Let's see.

369
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,480
Still, you raised me for 10 years-

370
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,400
What parent doesn't? It comes naturally!

371
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,920
We raise you to eat well, sleep well, and live a joyful life.

372
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,630
Did I raise you to give me money?

373
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:24,000
The reason Mr. Yoon got mad is because of his guilty conscience.

374
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,110
Since you're not his birth dad.

375
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,710
She's right.

376
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,150
I was shortsighted.

377
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,280
I acted foolishly.

378
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,490
- A cold?
- Yeah.

379
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:57,320
But he still made all his orders before going home.

380
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:01,530
- Do you need candles?
- Yeah.

- What's your door lock passcode?
- What?

388
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,480
What's your door lock passcode?

389
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,800
Kim Sanha has a cold.

390
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,180
I think he's inside, but he's not picking up.

391
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,840

Look at this sweat.

398
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,480
You have a fever.

399
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,940
Were you that worried?

400
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,730

Is it here?

406
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,380
I'll do it.

407

408
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,480
Oh, please.

409
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,730

It feels cool.

416
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:20,420

You still have the picture we took together in high school.

Yeah.

432
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:39,600
- You kept it this whole time?
- Yes.

00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,540
- Me, too.
- Huh?

434
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,820
I missed you, too.

435

439
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,420
I totally forgot to show you.

440
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:12,020
What?

441
00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:14,220
Take a look.

442
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,600
Young people are so good at finding these things.

443
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,230
Look at him. He's something else.

444
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,630
Look.

445
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:31,710
Is this really Haejun?

446
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:36,070
We were worried for no reason, calling him a bum when he was doing just fine.

447
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,660
It's all good.

448
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,340
- Are you awake?
- Yes.

449
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:00,530

- Yes.

- Yes.

457
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,840
What's this?

458
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,130
Is this Kang Haejun?

459
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:43,050
What's this? Is he a celebrity?

460
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,580
I was wondering where he got his money.

461
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:49,940
Where did Haejun go, by the way?

462
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,350
He said he'll sleep over at Seokhun's so he won't catch your cold.

463
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,540
He should be here by now.

Goodness. How is he so handsome?

467
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:30,400
- I'm smitten.
- He's really a model.

468
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,950
Aigoo, your son's so handsome.

469
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,780
Wow, he's something else.

470
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:38,320
They said it's different than being a model in Korea.

471
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,160
Because he did it at a big global show.

472
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,670
- Of course!
- Yes, it's different.

473
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:44,070
- It can't be the same.
- Yes, isn't that right, Unni?

- Yes.

- Yes, we'll take two.

- Yes, coming up.
- Why isn't there scallion pancakes here?

487
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,630
- Didn't he give you one?
- No, he didn't.

488
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,320
Mr. Yoon!

489
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,200
Yes, coming right up!

490
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,810
Hurry it up, will you?

491
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,460
Aigoo, let us look at the celeb up close, too!

492
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,460
You really can't hide where you come from.

493
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,160
Whoa, his face is just like his father's.

494
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,200
You're right. I guess you don't take after your mother at all.

495
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,090
Gosh, the thing is, he's-

496
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:01,370
Mr. Yoon also used to be quite handsome in his prime, wasn't he?

497
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:04,220
You're right. I remember.

498
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,310
Did you wait long?

499
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:26,200
No, I just got here, too.

500
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,970
- Let me.
- I'll do it.

501
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:37,240
I was just trying to help.

502
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,550
Did I ask you for help? Are you pitying me right now?

503
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,040
No, it's not pity.

504
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,640
Anyway, let's sit.

505
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,530
Have you been well?

506
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,620
Ask anyone here if I look like I'm doing well.

507
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:11,080
Or are you making fun of me?

508
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,780
- Why would I?
- Why wouldn't you?

509
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:18,840
Your ex-wife who left you for a better life

510
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:22,200
lost her new husband and showed up limping.

511
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,900
So, it must be either laughable or pitiable, right?

512
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:30,050
I've never once thought that way.

513
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,410
Try to be honest.

514
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:39,160
Who knows if you prayed secretly for my doom for 100 days?

515
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,500
So, why didn't you live a good life?

516
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,190
I let you go for a better life.

517
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:49,130
Is it my fault your husband died?

518
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:51,550
Is it my fault your legs ended up that way?

519
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,600
I even let Sanha go because he wanted to save his mom.

520
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,800
What more can I do from here-

521
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,640
Watch what you say!

522
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,690
I've never asked for anything from you.

523
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,400
Sanha came to me on his own 10 years ago.

524
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,230
He might say he won't, but...

525
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:08,580
I'm sure he'll come to Seoul in a month.

526
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:12,680
He can't defy me.

527
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,570
He can't abandon me.

528
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:18,040
For crying out loud.

529
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,480
How can you be so self-centered?

530
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,600
People are all self-centered.

531
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,070
Are you any different?

532
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:27,100
Gosh...

533
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:30,840
I'm the idiot for coming here, thinking we'd be able to communicate.

534
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,510
Shit!

535
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:45,060
You came to meet that ahjussi? Who is he?

536
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,910
Sohui, should we see Oppa before we go?

537
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:50,200
Mom!

538
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,450
We came all the way here. Wouldn't Oppa be sad if we left without seeing him?

539
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:58,090
We came because you said you'll feel better if you see the ocean.

540
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:01,670
Is this why you wanted to come to Busan from the get-go?

541
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:03,680
No, that's not it.

542
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,480
I always liked the ocean.

543
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:10,380
I'd like to live by the ocean if I can.

544
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,350
Don't you?

545
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,270
Dad, Dad!

546
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,510
Dad, give me a marker!

547
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,000
What are you doing?

548
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,270
Even if it was for commercial use,

549
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:39,390
this is way too flashy.

550
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,400
Hey, this much is fine.

551
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,200
- Dal, eat some scallion pancake inside.
- Sorry?

552
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,780
[Mom]

553
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,320
I need to take a call.

554
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,370
How is his pose so cool?

555
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:59,910
He exudes a bright light.

556
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,340
Did Sanha go to work?

557
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,120
Yes, he wants some scallion pancakes, too.

558
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,920
All right. I got it.

559
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,480
Why isn't Dal coming? Let me go get her.

560
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,460
No, you eat. I'll go get her.

561
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,120
That's not it.

562
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,230
What can you do on your own?

563
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,830
Even if you have a man, you should pretend not to in those meetings.

564
00:43:23,830 --> 00:43:25,470
Do I have to teach you that, too?

565
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:27,900
I said I'm sorry about that.

566
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,640
He behaved wrongly, too!

567
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,210
Stop blaming others.

568
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:35,220
If you won't work in a law firm in Seoul, you should marry well for me to feel relieved.

569
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,440
I'm doing just fine here. You can feel relieved.

570
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,820
You can be relieved.

571
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,580
I need to see you live a good life like others to feel relieved!

572
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,760
I'm sorry.

573
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:53,530
Mom, I sent you some money to buy Spring clothes.

574
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:55,600
Did you get it?

575
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:58,990
Yes.

576
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:03,690
[Mom]

577
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:33,340
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

578
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:37,570
It's because of me, right?

579
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:41,140
Should I have said something else?

580
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:44,940
The call dragged on.

581
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,230
I'm hungry.

582
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,160
Let's go inside.

583
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,530
- Juwon.
- Yes?

584
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,900
Take a bite.

585
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:08,640
Is it okay?

586
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:12,130
It's the best. It's awesome.

587
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:14,540
- Juwon.
- Yes!

588
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:17,030
Hurry up and come eat.

589
00:45:17,030 --> 00:45:19,100
- Scallion pancake.
- Is it good?

590
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,150
The fresh kimchi is great.

591
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:23,410
Let's take a ton home.

592
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:27,350
I'll pack you scallion pancakes and fresh kimchi later. Take them.

593
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,420
Oh, yes!

594
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:35,940
Everyone, the model is here!

595
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:39,330
Line up here if you want an autograph.

596
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:42,350
- I want one!
- Me, too!

597
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:44,520
- One for me, too!
- Make a line!

598
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,650
How nice!

599
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:51,670
My goodness. Even your autograph is amazing.

600
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:54,110
Sign my handkerchief here.

601
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,230
Was it from Ahjumma?

602
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,980
Yes.

603
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,630
Don't force yourself if you don't have an appetite, and give it to me.

604
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:08,150
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

605
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:12,330
What should we have with fresh kimchi for dinner?

606
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:13,890
Parboiled octopus? Half-dried saury?

607
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:16,820
Or should I boil some pork belly? A drink?

608
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:19,840
It's not like this is the first time.

609
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,970
I think I'll be late because I was away from the office this morning.

610
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:28,480
All right. Let's eat something delicious tomorrow, then.

611
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:31,080
Take care.

612
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:44,650
[Kim Sanha]

613
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,860
Yes. Hello?

614
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,090
Haejun's excited, right?

615
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:53,840
You know Kang Haejun's fine as long as Dad's happy.

616
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:59,870
I think I'll get off early today, at about seven o'clock.

617
00:46:59,870 --> 00:47:02,140
Do you want to have dinner with me?

618
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,580
Dinner?

619
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:05,890
What are we going to have?

620
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:07,970
I'll look into it.

621
00:47:07,970 --> 00:47:11,060
Well, shall we, then?

622
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,630
Yes.

623
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,310
What's this?

624
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:20,800
Why are you suddenly smiling? Is something good going on?

625
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,560
Do you know any place for dinner nearby?

626
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,560
Dinner? What's the occasion?

627
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,950
A date.

628
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:33,100
You have a girlfriend? Huh? Daebak.

629
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,750
Hey, who is it?

630
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:37,520
- Gosh, stop it.
- Hey, who is it? Tell me.

631
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,350
There are tons of models in the U.S.

632
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:44,080
It's not like I was that famous. I only took a few and stopped.

633
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:47,100
You should've done some more if you had fun.

634
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:50,000
I would've if I knew you'd be this happy.

635
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:56,540
I'm happy you're healthy.

636
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,570
You must be hungry. Eat at home before you go if you have time.

637
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:00,980
Okay.

638
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,510
Seokhun wants to see me. I'll come to eat next time.

639
00:48:22,510 --> 00:48:25,320
Why? Eat if it's not urgent.

640
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:28,590
He said the entire basketball team was there to eat together.

641
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:31,010
All right. Come tomorrow, then.

642
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:33,760
Yes. I'll get going.

643
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,940
I gave this a lot of thought.

644
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:46,400
But I just can't forget your face that day.

645
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,760
So, I told her you're back here.

646
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,100
It's up to you if you want to go see her or not.

647
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,780
Taxi!

648
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,060
Take care.

649
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,040
- Boss.
- Yes?

650
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,700
Why are you in such a good mood these days?

651
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,570
Really? Do I look happy?

652
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,030
Yes.

653
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,380
I'll bring your favorite hamburgers when I come back, Haejun.

654
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,390
So frustrating. Aigoo.

655
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:46,260
You should've at least said something for your kid's sake.

656
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,630
I'll take care of it. Mind your own business.

657
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:50,730
And if I do?

658
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:58,910
I mean, I'll make sure to try talking to her again.

659
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,420
What about you? What will you tell Haejun's mom?

660
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:05,680
What do you think?

661
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,310
I'll tell her to come see Haejun, who is all nicely grown up.

662
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,190
I'm different from you-know-who. I keep my word.

663
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:16,100
Aigoo...

664
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,300
We'll see about that!

665
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:56,400
Did you wait?

666
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:57,850
No.

667
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:08,790
What?

668
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:11,070
Someone might see.

669
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:14,990
I'll see Dad this weekend and tell him everything.

670
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:22,260
About that... Should we tell Kang Haejun first?

671
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:24,060
What does he know?

672
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:27,860
Not that he'd know anything. I just don't want him to be upset later.

673
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:36,190
Isn't that Kang Haejun?

674
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,310
As expected of model Kang.

675
00:52:44,310 --> 00:52:46,130
You're just sitting, and it's still a photoshoot.

676
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,270
Hey, extend your leg-

677
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,640
What is it?

678
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:04,550
Is something wrong?

679
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,820
I saw Mom.

680
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:15,530
Where?

681
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,930
Auntie told me she opened

682
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,170
a hair salon in Busan.

683
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:27,610
And?

684
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:30,860
What did she say when she met you?

685
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:36,690
I didn't meet her.

686
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:39,140
I only saw her from afar.

687
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:49,300
She smiles brightly

688
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,650
and seemed to be doing well.

689
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,720
Get up.

690
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:04,730
Huh?

691
00:54:05,730 --> 00:54:09,180
Go and ask her why she never contacted you.

692
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,270
If you can't do it alone, I'll do it with you.

693
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:13,070
No, I'll do it for you. Get up!

694
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:15,870
Stop acting so pitiful, and get up!

695
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:19,340
Hey, I can't ask her that.

696
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:21,420
Why can't you?

697
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,740
I'm not prepared to hear her answer.

698
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:30,920
I'm too scared to ask her.

699
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,650
Let's head inside.

700
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:45,750
Are you hungry? Should we order delivery?

701
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,450
You two can eat.

702
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:50,650
I'm a bit tired today.

703
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:58,970
I feel better with both of you, though.

704
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,750
What?

705
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,920
Did you find it?

706
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:32,830
Yeah, the address was in a text from Auntie.

707
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,550
Haejun has been-

708
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:55,600
Dad!

709
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,190
How did you know about this place?

710
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,880
How did you two...

711
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:36,170
Where did they go?

712
00:56:43,950 --> 00:56:45,840
Did I leave this here?

713
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,070
Who is it?

714
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:59,280
So, that's why you never contacted Haejun?

715
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,150
And you don't plan to in the future?

716
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,640
Yes.

717
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:07,620
If Haejun finds out,

718
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:10,420
you're willing to go wherever?

719
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:17,060
Then, why did you have to open this store in Busan?

720
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:22,870
It just turned out like this.

721
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:24,840
That's not it.

722
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,350
Because it's close to Haejun.

723
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:33,060
So, does Haejun...

724
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:36,830
Does Haejun also know that I'm here?

725
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:41,220
He doesn't.

726
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:47,930
Kang Haejun doesn't know.

727
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:51,920
We came after hearing about it by coincidence.

728
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:55,780
We didn't tell him about coming here

729
00:57:56,850 --> 00:58:00,630
in case he'd be disappointed.

730
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:14,360
Is it okay as long as you feel at ease?

731
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,390
What about Kang Haejun?

732
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:21,780
Kang Haejun lived his entire life in the dark, believing he was just baggage.

733
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:26,580
Ever since you cut him off,

734
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:29,400
he thought he was dead weight to you.

735
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:34,400
People kept saying my dad took in a charity case!

736
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,550
So, he thought of himself as an outsider for his entire life!

737
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:40,630
Do you even know?

738
00:58:58,430 --> 00:59:00,370
Thank you.

739
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:17,290
Where are you? Are you at the hospital?

740
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:20,780
Hurry home! Or call me when you see this.

741
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,780
Gosh, what are you doing, Seohyeon?

742
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:50,270
I just want him to...

743
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,620
live an ordinary life.

744
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:33,700
♫ One day, a precious memory ♫

745
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:41,370
♫ The day you entered my small heart and smiled brightly ♫

746
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:43,260
[Family by Choice]

747
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,980
You abandoned me, lived happily, and even met a man.

748
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:47,790
Should I not have shown up in your great life?

749
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:49,600
How did you find this place?

750
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,980
- Pretend you never saw me today.
- I'm sorry.

751
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:55,520
I've made up my mind, and I'm never coming back.

752
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,520
You even changed the hospital?

753
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:02,750
So, you'll be selfish until the end and do what you want?

754
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:05,590
Must you see me die?

755
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:08,700
Take Sohui and go back to Seoul.

756
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:09,860
I'm not going.

757
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:13,400
Sanha's mom seemed determined to take Sanha with her.

758
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:16,380
If you're staying here because of me, it's okay.

759
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:19,860
I won't say stay by my side or stay here.
