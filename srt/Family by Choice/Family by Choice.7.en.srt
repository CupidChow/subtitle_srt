What could be so special that she couldn't even see her child's face?

She said she paid her debt before leaving.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,400
So, she said not to worry about the money.

Wasn't that enough for most people to catch on?

Was he always so dense?

[Episode 7]
Can you use herb salt to banish a ghost?

66
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,640
Is this what you talk about with your friends?

67
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,420
Yeah! It's the hottest topic in our class.

68
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,280
You need to prove if ghosts exist first.

69
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,090
This could be asked after you prove if salt can even banish ghosts.

70
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:19,500
No, this isn't a matter of proving anything.

71
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,550
It's for pure fun.

72
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:25,160
Then, I think herb salt will work since it still has salt in it.

73
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,690
Since the main ingredient in herb salt is the salt. Not the herb.

74
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,710
Okay then. A hamster's feet sweat. Yes or no?

75
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,620
A hamster is a mammal! They regulate their body temperature.

76
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,290
Of course, their feet sweat.

77
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,900
I'm an idiot for asking you. Geez...

78
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,870
Oh, my gosh!

79
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,870

What are you doing here instead of going home?

82
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,960
Didn't you visit Auntie?

83
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,740
Did something happen at the hospital?

84
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:07,150
Why? What happened?

85
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,930
Nothing. Auntie is fine.

86
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,550
Then, who isn't fine?

87
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,120
Is it you?

88
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,450
Tell us what's wrong while I'm speaking nicely.

89
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,560
How much was it?

90
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,220
Twenty million won.

91
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,390
I knew because Auntie told me, but...

92
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:39,330
When did you find out she had borrowed money?

93
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,060
A long time ago.

94
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,930
When I first came here.

95
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,680
I wondered why she always made you walk on eggshells.

96
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,580
Auntie wasn't trying to be mean.

97
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,310
She just felt pressured, too.

98
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,360
She felt bad, too.

99
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,990
It's not Haejun's fault.

100
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,780
That's what I'm saying!

101
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,090
Why is he being cautious when it's not his fault?

102
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,830
Why feel sorry?

103
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,460
Well, she paid everything back, so it's settled.

104
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,600
You no longer have to feel pressured.

105
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,340
That's right.

106
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,120
I was going to pay it back.

107
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,960
If the money was the reason she couldn't contact me,

108
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,420
I could just pay it back.

109
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,120
But since she paid him back and just left,

110
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:30,060
I guess money wasn't the reason she couldn't contact me.

111
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,400
It would've been nice if it was because of the money.

112
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:47,060
It would've been nice if she saw you before leaving.

113
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,460
Take it.

114
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:11,310
Here.

115
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,050
Eat it. I gave you one first.

116
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:18,140
Eat this, too.

117
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,160
I'm home!

118
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,680
Great. And Juwon?

119
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,550
She needs something from Kim Sanha.

120
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,860
Okay...

121
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,900
I'm almost done. Go do what you need to do.

122
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,000
You should run the washing machine. Why do you always wash it by hand?

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,090
You see this? These areas must be washed by hand.

124
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,790
It's not even visible.

125
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,770
Even so!

126
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,090
It feels nice to go out in clean clothes in the morning.

129
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,130
If we use that for my tuition next year,

130
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:38,460
I'll pay it all back by working.

131
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,300
How did you find out?

132
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,070
She visited Auntie.

133
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,150
Why did she see Auntie and not me?

134
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:56,160
Was she too busy?

135
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,960
If she comes back next time and looks for me,

136
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,060
tell her I don't want to see her anymore.

137
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:14,970
She probably won't come back since she paid off her debt.

138
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:25,070

You don't need to pay me back for anything.

00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,760
Don't say anything Juwon wouldn't say.

143

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:43,170
Why are you so happy?

154
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:48,100
Sanha's mom texted me earlier, saying she's going to Seoul.

155
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,280
She won't come here anymore?

156
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,880
It'll be hard to unless she decides to.

157
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,210
Seoul is across the country.

158
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,690
You told Sanha, too?

159
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,800
Yes, as soon as I got the text.

160
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,250
She came out of nowhere and shook up the kids.

161
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,280
But they all found their places in the end.

162

Now that I think about it,

163
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:19,510
the birth father of Haejun has been quiet these days.

164
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,640
It looked like he'd sue right away.

165
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:45,850
Can you please just take one look at this?

166
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:56,610
Hey, I was determined to go to America without you. You know?

167
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,180
But I see you whenever I close my eyes.

168
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,940
And I'm reminded of you when I'm eating something delicious.

169
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,770
Don't you think that's what it means to be bound by blood?

170
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:10,210
You said similar stuff the first time you came, too.

171
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,590
Fool me twice, shame on me.

172
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,910
H-Hey, I'm not trying to fool you.

I'm totally serious right now.

You came to me because you're worried they'll take your assets away!

180
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,070
Should I beg? Should I?

Yes. He's great at passing and just as great at shooting.

If his game management is that good, he can probably go to the pro league, too.

359

I don't know.

360

I couldn't even see her face.

361
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:18,890
She borrowed money from Dad ten years ago.

362
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:22,680
She only paid him back and left without seeing me.

363
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,990
Why?

364
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,020
I guess she didn't want to see me.

365
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,630
But you missed her.

366
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:38,910
You even looked for her in the streets.

367
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,740
Not at all. I hate her now.

368
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,840
She said she won't see me, so w-what can I possibly...

369
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,220
I resent her.

370
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,900
But I also miss her.

371
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,350
But I think I miss her a bit more badly.

372
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,520

00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,610
Hey, why are you crying?

376
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:39,940
I always cry when someone else cries.

377

But I'm not crying.

382

Hey, don't worry. I didn't tell Sanha!

383
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:28,500
A third party shouldn't get involved in such things.

I'll just say you don't.

Hey, all right. I got it.

Let me tell you, just to be safe. Sanha doesn't like Huiju.

397
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,870
I'm certain about that, so don't worry.

398

00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,320
Juwon, did you put ointment on?

401
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,570

Well, he used to go here in 10th grade.

He lost the captain position to Haejun all the time.
