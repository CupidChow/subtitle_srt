1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,350


2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,960
   

3
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:19,120
   

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,520
   

5
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,810
   

6
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,710
   

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,950
   

8
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,200
 They're surely the Kim San Ha and Yang Hae Joon I know. 

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,340
 But they feel like strangers for some odd reason. 

10
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,710
 Ten years passed, you know. 

11
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,660
 Of course, you’d feel awkward and strange. 

12
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,600
 Well, the two of us moved back permanently. 

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,020
 We won’t leave again. 

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,440
 Wow, my daughter's birthday will be a noisy one this year, right? 

15
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,170
 Who said you can? 

16
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,180
 I'm not glad to see either of you. 

17
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,470
 I don't know what brought you here, 

18
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,420
 but leave me out of your plans. 

19
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,830
 She absolutely hates us. 

20
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,320
 Hae Joon hurt his leg. 

21
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,910
 Have you gone crazy? 

22
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:22,560
 Where is it? 

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,230
 Which leg? 

24
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,590
 It's my fault. 

25
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,080
 Wow, they're earrings. 

26
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,040
 Happy birthday. 

27
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,580
 You should wear this to dinner tonight. 

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,300
 He's in my class. A dermatology intern. 

29
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,710
 I couldn't stand the sight of him all excited to have dinner with Joo Won tonight. 

30
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,710
 I had a bad feeling. 

31
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,950
 He must've finally asked her out. 

32
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,790
 Don't go. 

33
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,550
 Don't go, Yoon Joo Won. 

34
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,170
I like you.

35
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:27,170
It took me ten years to tell you that I like you.

36
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,800
So...

37
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,400
♫  Even though I'm right next to you  ♫

38
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,230
Don't go.

39
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:42,710
♫  It’s like you’re on the other side of the earth  ♫

40
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,120
Sure. I like you, too, Oppa.

41
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,940
I like Dad, Ahjusshi, and Kang Hae Joon, too, you know.

42
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,000
I like you guys a lot.

43
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,160
Is it because I was mean to you yesterday?

44
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,010
That was just...

45
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,440
That was...

46
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,630
just...

47
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:08,800
You're not oblivious.

48
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,120
You know what I'm trying to tell you.

49
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,320
I'll get going.

50
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:22,090
♫  My one promise for the rest of my life  ♫

51
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,670
 I like you. 

52
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:37,200
 It took me ten years to tell you that I like you. 

53
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,960
♫  As happy as I am, I am also sad  ♫

54
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:49,240
♫  I wish this dream would never end  ♫

55
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,000
What the heck? Are you already back?

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,170
Weren't you eating dinner?

57
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,750
Why did you buy so many beers? 
    

58
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,930
I don't know.

59
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,200
This is all because of Kim San Ha.

60
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,000
   

61
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,880
Today isn't the day you leave early.

62
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,800
What do you mean? There are days like this, too.

63
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,270
You've been acting strange since last night. Do you know that?

64
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,790
Have I?

65
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,060
I'm going early since I have something to do.

66
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,780
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

67
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,070
   

68
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,910
You're leaving early.

69
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,970
What the heck?

70
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,890
Hey, Yoon Joo Won. Why did you go back in?

71
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:25,190
 I left something behind. You go ahead. 

72
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,670
Hello.

73
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,250
Hey.

74
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,340
Did anything happen with Joo Won yesterday?

75
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,190
“Yesterday”?

76
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,460
Something did happen.

77
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,890
She forgot about her date

78
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:54,770
and came home with a bag of beers.

79
00:05:54,770 --> 00:05:56,180
I see.

80
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,320
 This is all because of Kim San Ha. 

81
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:05,250
Sunbae, you didn't let her go, did you?

82
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,700
Yes.

83
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,030
Why not? He seemed like a good person.

84
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,120
Do you...

85
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,760
like Joo Won, by chance?

86
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,190
Really?

87
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,310
I heard you became an attorney.

88
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,440
Confidentiality is key for attorneys.

89
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,320
Yes, sure.

90
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,680
Okay.

91
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,120
 I like you. 

92
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,420
- Stop thinking about it. 
  - I like you. 

93
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,160
Stop thinking about it!

94
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,520
Who is it?

95
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,160
 It's me. 

96
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:07,970
Did you eat? Let's eat.

97
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,640
Sure.

98
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,780
What do you want to eat?

99
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,890
Do you eat toast and cereal? American style?

100
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,070
Or we can have rice if you want. I have side dishes.

101
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,750
I always eat bread at the store, so Dad told me to eat rice at home.

102
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,290
There's beef broth and pickled perilla leaves.

103
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,380
I like it.

104
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,830
What?

105
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,050
I like it.

106
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,280
 I like you. 

107
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,890
 I like you. 

108
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:39,070
I really like pickled perilla leaves.

109
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,290
Why are you confessing to perilla leaves?

110
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,520
I'm just saying I like it. How else can I say it?

111
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,650
Eat what you want and go.

112
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,540
What is this?

113
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,500
You make us a quick meal because the children aren't here.

114
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,620
And you don't even have an appetite?

115
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,620
No, I just...

116
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,820
think I'm happy these days.

117
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,810
Is this how it feels to be full without eating?

118
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,750
What are you so happy about when they're on their own?

119
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,030
They're nearby, so we can see them every day.

120
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,890
And we can eat together whenever we want.

121
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,820
I'll take a look and buy good-quality beef if I see any.

122
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,730
Sounds good.

123
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:30,940
Stop grinning and eat.

124
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,620
   

125
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,430
Hyungnim!

126
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,850
Yoon Joo Won didn't show up for the date. She stood him up.

127
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,820
I know.

128
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,400
You know?

129
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:59,220
I have a hunch about why she did.

130
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,830
“A hunch”?

131
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:05,730
I gave Joo Won flowers on her birthday.

132
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,470
No wonder she really liked them.

133
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:12,090
I think she has really opened up to me since then.

134
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,280
Really? Do you think so?

135
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,090
Hyungnim.

136
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,360
Can you subtly ask Joo Won for me?

137
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,890
Why she didn't show up for the date.

138
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,450
If it was because of the flowers,

139
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,200
or because of me...

140
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,900
Whatever the reason, I don't think it was because of you.

141
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,130
Why not? Can't you just ask her for me?

142
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,320
Wait. I might've avoided him in the morning,

143
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,470
but how could he not contact me at all after shocking me like that?

144
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,740
Hello.

145
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,830
Welcome.

146
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,900
Madam.

147
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,370
Look who finally showed his face.

148
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:37,840
Wow, are you taking rejuvenation medicine?

149
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,960
You look younger than you did 20 years ago.

150
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,140
You're teasing me.

151
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:46,250
Mr. Yoon, shower me with some salt.

152
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,250
Here.

153
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,930
Mr. Yoon, hurry up and marry Joo Won off.

154
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,370
What are you saying out of the blue?

155
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:02,160
I went to a funeral today, and they only had one daughter.

156
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,530
So I worried for them.

157
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,440
And I noticed that she couldn't think straight after her father died,

158
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,940
so her husband took care of everything.

159
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:16,740
I'm still young, Madam.

160
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:18,210
Death doesn't follow an order.

161
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,790
Do you think tickets are handed out?

162
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,630
Well, that's true, I guess.

163
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,940
Whatever. I'm not implying something grand.

164
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,420
It's better for you to have at least someone to lean on, right?

165
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,730
Well, I have Joo Won, San Ha, and Hae Joon.

166
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,900
What is there to worry about?

167
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,240
He's not family.

168
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,280
Why am I not family?

169
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,410
We're father and son.

170
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:43,990
Right, right. “Son”?

171
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:46,040
Let's say you're his son.

172
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,590
Sons these days are absolutely useless.

173
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:54,350
Once he gets married, his wife's family becomes his family.

174
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,990
I won't get married, then.

175
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,110
Yes, right.

176
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,500
   

177
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,170
Hello?

178
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:10,280
Does he have people calling him up?

179
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:18,050
Madam, you have a tendency to look down on and tease Hae Joon.

180
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,050
Proof of family relations?

181
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:27,440
 Direct family relation must be confirmed for tax deductions to apply. 

182
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,020
All right. I'll call you back after looking into it.

183
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,290
Family relation...

184
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,840
   

185
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,230
One, two, three.

186
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:33,770
What's up?

187
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,920
 Did you eat? 

188
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,940
Yes, I did.

189
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,430
Hello?

190
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,720
 Aren't you going to ask me? 

191
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,050
Look at the time.

192
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,840
You probably already ate.

193
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,570
 You still always asked if I'd eaten. 

194
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,280
 And you'd tell me to eat if I hadn't. 

195
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,920
 Or ask me what I ate if I had. 

196
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:10,880
Ahjusshi wants you to come to eat tomorrow.

197
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,600
No. I'll go separately.

198
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:18,650
I need to do market research tomorrow. Yes.

199
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,050
- I'll see you tomorrow. 
 - Joo–

200
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,850
   

201
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,820
Do you want me to go with you?

202
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,840
You said you're doing market research in the morning.

203
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,770
I'm just going to look around.

204
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,370
It's okay.

205
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,710
Who was that on the phone?

206
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,670
Kim San Ha.

207
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,800
Really?

208
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,280
But why were you so awkward?

209
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,420
Did something happen with Sunbae and you?

210
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,180
 I like you. 

211
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,790
 It took me ten years to tell you that I like you. 

212
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:10,370
Was it obvious?

213
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:13,020
Yes, very.

214
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,980
I have clients who claim they don't know anything,

215
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,570
but I can tell they're lying right away.

216
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,430
You just sounded exactly like them.

217
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,400
 You're not oblivious. 

218
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,680
 You know what I'm trying to tell you. 

219
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,360
I don't know what I should do.

220
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,930
I don't know.

221
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,720
What about the store you looked into?

222
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,440
Just tell Ahjusshi about it.

223
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,540
It's fine. I found a way.

224
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,680
What way?

225
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,840
Give me a heads-up if you'll do something stupid.

226
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,420
You just worry about yourself.

227
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,040
You still have something to tell Ahjusshi, too.

228
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,620
I'll take care of myself.

229
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,990
You escalate small matters.

230
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,200
Your fiery mouth is still the same.

231
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,560
I'm telling you not to make any trouble.

232
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,340
When did I ever make trouble?

233
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,630
Don't you remember when Joo Won fell into the pond?

234
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,200
You call yourself an oppa, yet you called her crazy?

235
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,660
My goodness, that was ages ago.

236
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,630
Oppas!

237
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,430
Where did you come from?

238
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,810
I was waiting for you guys.

239
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,440
Let's go eat meat.

240
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,770
It's been forever since I had meat. Delicious.

241
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,850
I heard it's Korean beef today.

242
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,520
Korean beef. Meat.

243
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,770
Meat.

244
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,240
Meat.

245
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,650
Meat.

246
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,170
Oppa. Pass me the salt.

247
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,890
What? Me?

248
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,410
Yes.

249
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,660
Sure, sure.

250
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:17,680
Oppa, pass me the onion.

251
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,680
How did you live without calling them Oppa all this time?

252
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,340
Exactly. I'll say it all at once to make up for it.

253
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,190
I should call them a lot so I can adjust quickly.

254
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,580
I have something to say.

255
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:12,100
- What is it? 
 - What is it?

256
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,540
Let's...

257
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,740
get married.

258
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,110
Why not?

259
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,650
It's not like it's out of the question.

260
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:45,140
Didn't you also say back then?

261
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,910
That we can't inherit anything, and it's useless even if we win the lottery.

262
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:51,840
Dad and Ahjusshi won’t go through a complicated adoption process.

263
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,540
All of that is possible if you and I get married.

264
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,930
We don't need to inherit the one store Mr. Yoon owns.

265
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,970
And I don't even dream about empty hope like winning the lottery anymore.

266
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,470
If you want to legally become family,

267
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,700
how about one of you think about adoption?

268
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,210
No. Not his son.

269
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:17,670
Madam said a son-in-law is better than a son.

270
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,000
Darn it.

271
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,100
Tell Dad to adopt a daughter if you want to become his son-in-law.

272
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,810
- Why do you keep involving me? 
 - That's enough.

273
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,730
Hae Joon, you shouldn't talk about that, either.

274
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:29,360
And you just laugh it off.

275
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,620
Hey, the idea itself is innovative.

276
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,380
- Not bad, right? 
 - Cut the nonsense and eat.

277
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,500
Hae Joon was...

278
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,860
I know why Kang Hae Joon, I mean, Yang Hae Joon is acting like that.

279
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,600
Anyway, don't take what Hae Joon says seriously.

280
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,340
Okay.

281
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,420
I’m not taking what you said seriously, either.

282
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,510
Don't you remember?

283
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,170
When I was in elementary school, I said I'd marry you.

284
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,420
It's like that.

285
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:38,120
Since I like you, and we are all we have.

286
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,050
Since I can't imagine you not being a part of my life.

287
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,530
So?

288
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,040
So...

289
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,760
I'll pretend you never said anything.

290
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,940
I won't take it seriously.

291
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:05,370
Then let's start over.

292
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,970
As you said, let's pretend this never happened and start over.

293
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,530
Not 7-year-old Yoon Joo Won or 17-year-old Yoon Joo Won.

294
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:20,440
Let me start as a man 27-year-old Yoon Joo Won met for the first time.

295
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,090
Give me a chance.

296
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:29,040
Give me a chance because Yoon Joo Won is my entire world.

297
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,430
I'll head down.

298
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,860
Do you really like Joo Won?

299
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,860
I do.

300
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,920
Not like that, Punk.

301
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,130
You must've dated in America.

302
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,120
Oh, they're different from Joo Won.

303
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,070
"They"?

304
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,070
How many were there?

305
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:50,350
- Just a few. 
 - You, you.

306
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,570
Joo Won is a lot more important than those girls.

307
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:57,070
What are you saying to him?

308
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,470
You're all my children I've fed and raised.

309
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,970
No matter what kind of guy Joo Won brings home,

310
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:06,490
it won't change the fact that you’re both my sons.

311
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,260
Understood?

312
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,420
- You. 
 - All right.

313
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,700
You wouldn't understand me.

314
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,730
You came back without hesitation since your dad was here.

315
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,760
But I really hesitated coming back here.

316
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,600
"Can I go back?"

317
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,680
"Can I really go back?"

318
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,330
But if we are legally bound, I no longer have to worry.

319
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,370
Then what am I to you?

320
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:41,070
You? You're my...

321
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,690
younger brother, and I'm the hyung.

322
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,830
Since my birthday comes first.

323
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,680
Do you need to be legally bound to me?

324
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,940
I don't need those things.

325
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,440
Who is it?

326
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,810
One month?

327
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:30,620
Yes, I told him to rest for just a month. No longer than that.

328
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,000
 You know I need rehabilitation at the hospital. 

329
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,640
Is it going well?

330
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,480
 I'm barely getting through it, 

331
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,440
but each trip to the hospital is difficult without San Ha.

332
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,110
But forget about me. What about So Hui?

333
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:44,280
So Hui is still a minor.

334
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,000
How could he push his responsibility on her just for his comfort?

335
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,400
 He's so selfish. 

336
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,930
San Ha suffered through it all this time.

337
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:54,750
 I know. He must've been stressed, too. 

338
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:57,080
 That's why I sent him. 

339
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,100
He doesn't need to stay exactly one month,

340
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,400
so tell him to come back to Seoul when he's better.

341
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,480
What's one month?

342
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,940
She said she sent San Ha to rest for just one month.

343
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,240
“Rest”? Didn't he transfer his hospital permanently?

344
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,820
He did.

345
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,570
He's currently working there.

346
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,170
I don't know.

347
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,300
What did they both discuss?

348
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,910
Don't concern yourselves.

349
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:37,160
There must be a misunderstanding.

350
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,890
I'll ask San Ha in person.

351
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,720
- What's this? 
 - Jujube tea.

352
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,010
I brewed it last night, but forgot to give it to San Ha earlier.

353
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:53,780
He had insomnia back then. I'm sure he's fine now.

354
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:57,480
You never know. Working at the hospital must be rough, too.

355
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,650
Dad, do you think he lied to Ahjumma

356
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:04,970
about staying for a month when he actually returned permanently?

357
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,300
What will he do after a month?

358
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,570
Ahjusshi said he would ask him, so don't mention it to San Ha.

359
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,180
He shouldn't worry about us when he's busy already. Go.

360
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,970
All right.

361
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,930
Drive safely. Wear your seat belt and pay attention to the traffic lights.

362
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,780
All right.

363
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,020
He says he's fine even when he's not,

364
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,980
so keep an eye on him by his side.

365
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,110
All right.

366
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,400
 What? 

367
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,050
What's the use of keeping an eye on him?

368
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:56,470
Past or present,

369
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:00,640
he still hides his struggles from me.

370
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,330
   

371
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,350
 Mom and I are doing fine. 

372
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:18,840
 Mom is getting well enough that she doesn't need me. 

373
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,050
 Oppa, you're returning to Seoul in a month, right? 

374
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,460
 Help me convince Mom to send me to English camp when you're back. 

375
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,140
 All my friends are going. 

376
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,500
 You made my life like this! 

377
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,820
Good morning.

378
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,320
- What's this? 
 - What?

379
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,180
Hold on a second.

380
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,880
Dad asked me to give you that.

381
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,630
- What is it? 
 - Jujube tea.

382
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,610
Are you sleeping well these days?

383
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,310
Are you worrying about me?

384
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,880
It's because Dad and Ahjusshi are worried.

385
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,070
It's similar for all residents.

386
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,380
Considering that, I sleep well.

387
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,230
You're really okay, right?

388
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:53,180
I could be happier if someone gave me a chance.

389
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,190
Go.

390
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:58,220
Joo Won.

391
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,800
See you later.

392
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,000
No.

393
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,720
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

394
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,720
He saw me in worse states back then.

395
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,060
So, are you and Joo Won getting married?

396
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,050
No.

397
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,030
The thought just crossed my mind.

398
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,970
Just for a moment.

399
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:58,370
Whether it was for a moment or not, what's stopping you?

400
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,530
You two are unrelated.

401
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:04,000
Why not check it now?

402
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,490
Check what?

403
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:09,540
Could you... kiss Joo Won?

404
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,710
Come on. Why would I do that?

405
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,260
Why not?

406
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:18,170
Didn't you think about that when the idea of marrying her crossed your mind?

407
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,570
That's your problem.

408
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:25,110
You have no thought process.

409
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:29,240
What comes before marriage?

410
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,320
- A marriage license? 
 - Dating.

411
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,000
And what do you do while dating?

412
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,740
Goodness, what's with the 20 questions?

413
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,810
You have to hold hands and kiss.

414
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,310
That's a given.

415
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,850
“Hold hands”? “Kiss”?

416
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:51,290
- Close your eyes. 
 - What do you want?

417
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,590
Are you crazy?

418
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:57,010
Not me. Close your eyes and think about Yoon Joo Won.

419
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:03,360
Yoon Joo Won is in front of you.

420
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,610
Her face is approaching yours.

421
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,100
From where?

422
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,750
From here. Again.

423
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:17,470
Yoon Joo Won is in front of you.

424
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:21,840
 Her face is approaching yours. 

425
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:26,750
 You grab her face. 

426
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:34,260
 She slowly approaches you... 

427
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,540
 Very slowly... 

428
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:45,030
I-I hate it!

429
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:47,410
I-I was wrong.

430
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:49,440
This is wrong.

431
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,220
What's gotten into you?

432
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,690
You said we should get married.

433
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:59,050
You said my face is getting closer.

434
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,180
Is your heart fluttering? Do you want to get married?

435
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,770
Don't lay a finger on my body!

436
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:08,320
Everyone can hear you. The store is small.

437
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,630
Sunbae, how can you do this as someone who works as a sacred teacher?

438
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:17,410
I knew from the start that you two can't be.

439
00:33:17,410 --> 00:33:19,070
- What? 
 - What?

440
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:22,440
However, I suggested this method as shock therapy

441
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,110
to help you realize it quickly.

442
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:28,800
- I know that's not true. 
 - Stop lying.

443
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,500
I'll get going first since Jae Eun is waiting for me.

444
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,800
- Thanks for the drink. 
 - Seriously.

445
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:44,230
W-Well, he kind of forced it...

446
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:48,510
This situation and my mood. How will you compensate for it?

447
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:51,430
What should I do? What do you need me to do?

448
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,840
Your hands are getting weak.

449
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:01,050
You're not doing your best. Scrub harder.

450
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,990
Harder.

451
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,630
Do you need me to hold your hands one more time?

452
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:15,940
I let you off the hook with a warning this time.

453
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:19,450
Yes, I know. Thanks.

454
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,950
Where do I throw this out?

455
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,500
Dad won't let you go.

456
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,080
Your room stayed the same even after you went to America.

457
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,430
Dad cleaned the room so often, too.

458
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:39,260
He probably cleaned every time he thought of you.

459
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:43,000
He refused when I said to use it as storage.

460
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,290
Because you need to sleep there once you come back.

461
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:48,410
Because it's your room.

462
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,420
Is that right?

463
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:57,140
Forget that I said we aren’t family.

464
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:02,170
Honestly, can't a sister be angry at her brother for not coming home for ten years?

465
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,770
Everything you said is right.

466
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,710
Instead, I'll call you "oppa" from now on.

467
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,730
Oppa.

468
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,210
I think I'm fine. I don't think I need that.

469
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,600
Oppa Hae Joon–

470
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,290
Gosh, stop that.

471
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,850
- Oppa. 
 - Stop that.

472
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:23,960
- Oppa. Oppa. Oppa. 
 - Stop it.

473
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:28,040
 Stop that. Stop it. Stop. 

474
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,910
 - Don't come. 
 - Oppa Hae Joon. 

475
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,520
 Don't come closer, Yoon Joo Won. 

476
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,020
 Don't leave, Kang Hae Joon. 

477
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:37,020
 Stop it. 

478
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,220
   

479
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:50,480
She knows I moved hospitals.

480
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,030
I told her everything.

481
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:53,420
But why did she say one month?

482
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,860
You know how Mom is.

483
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:01,020
Mom thinks I'll do that just because she said so.

484
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,610
So do you have no interest in returning to Seoul?

485
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:07,030
After everything I did to come back here?

486
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:09,270
I don't.

487
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,800
What will you do after a month?

488
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,280
Well, she can't drag me up there, can she?

489
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,000
I knew something was off.

490
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,920
You couldn't come for a holiday once but suddenly returned here permanently.

491
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,650
It's not because something happened, right?

492
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,970
No.

493
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,650
What did your mom do to you this time?

494
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,410
Will you not talk?

495
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:41,070
That's not it. Nothing happened.

496
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:45,250
- My goodness. 
 - He said nothing happened. He said so.

497
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:47,480
Cut it out now.

498
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:52,800
I've done more than enough, Father.

499
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,180
I mean it.

500
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,160
Do you think I don't know that?

501
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,900
You need to tell me what's going on!

502
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:04,480
There's nothing I didn't tell you.

503
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,140
I'll make sure not to worry you.

504
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,760
You punk. Whether I worry or not is not the problem!

505
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,750
You should tell your dad when something is wrong!

506
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,550
Darn it.

507
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:23,410
F-Forget it. Get going.

508
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,740
Please excuse me.

509
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,070
San Ha.

510
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:40,100
- Aigoo, aigoo. 
 - What?

511
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,000
Great.

512
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,060
San Ha.

513
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,870
Ahjusshi.

514
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,300
It's really true nothing happened, right?

515
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,080
Is it something you can't tell me, either?

516
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:10,830
I see. Well, I'll believe what you said, then.

517
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:14,440
Your dad is just upset.

518
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,500
He thinks you're not telling him because he's unreliable.

519
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,570
What is there to tell him?

520
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:24,550
I made myself clear to Mom.

521
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,950
All right.

522
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,500
Please go inside.

523
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,410
Yes. You go ahead.

524
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,140
Can you come to the hospital tomorrow?

525
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,470
I'll make an appointment for you.

526
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,100
N-No, it's fine.

527
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,940
This much aching is common when you get old.

528
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,350
So you do have an ache.

529
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:04,740
Please come tomorrow. I'll contact you.

530
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,280
Okay.

531
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:17,400
 They said to strike the iron while it's hot. 
   

532
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,730
 Let's get you fixed up completely while we are here. 

533
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,470
You have to be healthy so you're less trouble for me later.

534
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,780
Why say it like that? You're quite mean to me these days.

535
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,500
Come on. I'm here with you at the hospital, aren't I?

536
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,650
I even closed the store for the day.

537
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:34,380
A store owner closed the store for the day?

538
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,240
That's love.

539
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,090
You honestly agree with me, right?

540
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:42,890
I do.

541
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,530
- Mr. Yoon Jeong Jae. 
 - Yes.

542
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,360
Okay...

543
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,110
Does it feel tingly, too?

544
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,060
Yes, a little.

545
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,990
What about the other leg?

546
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:58,000
That leg also feels tingly sometimes, right?

547
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,160
It does happen at night, but it's not severe.

548
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,460
It doesn't seem to simply be muscle pain.

549
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,950
Let's take an x-ray.

550
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,870
   

551
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,510
   

552
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,390
I was not in my right mind last time.

553
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:31,060
I shouldn't have taken it out on you, Doctor.

554
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,660
It's just that when you said my dad might not walk again,

555
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:40,020
I was worried he might really never get to walk again.

556
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:44,830
I was too overwhelmed about what to do.

557
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:50,800
I also felt guilty having those thoughts.

558
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,600
At first...

559
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,250
you don't know why this is happening to you.

560
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:01,830
You'll get angry and frustrated.

561
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,700
You'll be tormented.

562
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,300
But he's still alive.

563
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:15,210
I think that's more than enough.

564
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:18,880
Because that's what you were most desperate for.

565
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,270
Everything will be okay.

566
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,160
Thank you.

567
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,930
You're really a doctor.

568
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,790
I graduated medical school at the top of my class.

569
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:53,120
Does medical school teach how to empathize, too?

570
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,480
Were you also at the top of the class for that?

571
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,950
Your hand.

572
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:16,120
No, your left hand.

573
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:22,640
♫  I keep rattling  ♫

574
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:29,380
♫  Like a broken doll  ♫

575
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:34,980
♫  I'm lost on every step  ♫

576
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:41,440
How did you know my left wrist was hurting?

577
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,970
It's obvious if you care.

578
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:49,480
♫  My day is spent immersed in a dream  ♫

579
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,470
I'll begin.

580
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:57,070
♫  I have a lot to say  ♫

581
00:42:57,070 --> 00:43:00,400
Is it okay? It's not too hot, right?

582
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,730
How is it?

583
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:06,630
Is it bearable?

584
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:14,100
♫  Why am I like this?  ♫

585
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:22,290
♫  Why am I always so excited like it's the first time?  ♫

586
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:26,190
♫  And remorseful like it's the last time?  ♫

587
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:27,900
Are you okay?

588
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,820
♫  Again, I circle around you like I'm praying  ♫

589
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:35,400
♫  When our eyes meet  ♫

590
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,820
This feels nice because it's warm.

591
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:42,630
♫  When you look at me  ♫

592
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:45,750
♫  The freezing winter melts  ♫

593
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:51,470
♫  Even in the dark night, the sun shines  ♫

594
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:55,430
♫  Do you know what this means?  ♫

595
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:59,950
The nurse will come later and wrap it up for you.

596
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,190
Why did you have to whisper that?

597
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:04,280
No reason.

598
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,040
Stay here for a minute.

599
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:32,640
Yes. Is Dad okay?

600
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:36,630
I'm glad. Okay, I'll be in the lobby.

601
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:44,300
Hey, does Kang Hae Joon have a girlfriend or not?

602
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,170
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

603
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:48,850
He doesn't?

604
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:51,620
But I think there's a woman he wants to marry.

605
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,280
“Marry”? Who is it?

606
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,950
What does she do? Did they date for long?

607
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:57,000
You said you lived together. You must know.

608
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,530
Gosh, I really don't know.

609
00:44:58,530 --> 00:44:59,840
Hey, you've seen her, haven't you?

610
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:02,280
- You have. Is she pretty? 
 - I haven't.

611
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,660
- Hey, aren't you being too mean? 
 - What?

612
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,480
I mean...

613
00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:19,800
Why do you look so happy?

614
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,360
Those two look so great together.

615
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,810
I think San Ha will be the first one to get married.

616
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:32,610
Yes, once you start getting married, one by one,

617
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:37,270
I'll see my grandchildren and become a grandpa in no time.

618
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:39,850
Are you happy about becoming a grandpa?

619
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:44,490
- I don't know. 
 - Come on, tell me.

620
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:47,100
Later. Ahjusshi.

621
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,770
Are you all done?

622
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:54,270
My back feels better already.

623
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:58,360
Just a few more treatments, and you'll be okay.

624
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,290
Yes, thanks to you, San Ha.

625
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:06,060
By the way, who's the doctor who greeted me?

626
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,580
You two seem very close.

627
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,690
Oh, it's not like that. We are high school friends.

628
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:12,650
She's also my college alumni.

629
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:14,750
Oh, Joo Won, you know Hui Joo, too, right?

630
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:16,060
I do know her.

631
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:20,610
Really? You even work together. That's no ordinary connection.

632
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:22,570
Of course. That's no ordinary connection.

633
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:24,050
She used to date Kang Hae Joon.

634
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:26,260
I see...

635
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,810
What? “Date Hae Joon”?

636
00:46:27,810 --> 00:46:30,880
She dumped Kang Hae Joon and failed to secure a rebound relationship.

637
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,430
Is that so? With whom?

638
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:36,370
I don't know. I wonder who?

639
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,160
Oh my gosh!

640
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:49,840
Are you home?

641
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,990
What are you doing over there?

642
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:59,110
Did you sleep here?

643
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,100
Is Ahjusshi's condition that bad?

644
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,650
No, he's fine.

645
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,350
That's good to hear.

646
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,050
   

647
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:21,680
My mom is back at it again.

648
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,740
“Again”? A blind date?

649
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,220
Yes, another blind date.

650
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,620
Mom knows I'm no good with strangers.

651
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:36,720
As soon as I sit down, it's like getting interviewed.

652
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,480
We ask about hobbies, specialties, salaries, and retirement plans.

653
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,250
How does she expect my heart to flutter for someone like that?

654
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:46,790
Heart-fluttering?

655
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,090
 It's obvious if you care. 

656
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,880
Heart-fluttering?

657
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:01,140
Heart-fluttering. That's the problem.

658
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:03,300
Why is that a problem?

659
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:08,280
Someone must've made your heart flutter recently.

660
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:11,070
And if they did?

661
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:13,310
Is that such a big deal?

662
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:15,960
My heart flutters when I bake perfect cake sheets,

663
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:18,290
and when a first-time customer says my cake is delicious.

664
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:20,810
My heart is a-always fluttering.

665
00:48:21,610 --> 00:48:23,920
Do you call that heart-fluttering?

666
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:29,870
Did you know? After my clients'

667
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:34,860
“I didn't know anything” phase, the next phase is,

668
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,380
"I must've misunderstood!"

669
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:38,960
It's that.

670
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,530
“Misunderstood”?

671
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:45,410
You're right. I must've misunderstood.

672
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:48,060
You're right. I misunderstood. That's it.

673
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:55,810
How long must I ignore when she's being that obvious?

674
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,430
Of course.

675
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:58,910
Is heart-fluttering such a big deal?

676
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,710
It could be out of worry for Kim San Ha.

677
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:03,770
It could flutter because...

678
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:07,670
he's fine, thanks to me.

679
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:11,740
That's all heart-warming. My heart flutters because it's all heart-warming.

680
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,950
Familial love. It's just familial love.

681
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:17,070
I shouldn't misunderstand that for heart-fluttering.

682
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,420
Yes.

683
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,930
 When do you close from work tomorrow? 

684
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:24,860
 Do you want to grab dinner? 

685
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:36,750
 This is the place where most of the electricity we use is generated 

686
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,680
from hydropower and nuclear power.

687
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:43,730
This yellow ball you see here is called Uranium.

688
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:49,860
Generating electricity with this uranium is called nuclear energy.

689
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:52,360
Isn't that dangerous if there's an earthquake?

690
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:55,220
You might be worried about it collapsing if there's an earthquake,

691
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,910
like our friend over there.

692
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:01,400
That's why it's designed to be earthquake-resistant.

693
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,680
Earthquake-resistant design is building structures

694
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:06,810
to withstand or absorb the earthquake shock.

695
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:11,720
They make it this safe, so there's no reason for our friends to get worried, right?

696
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,520
 Yes. 

697
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,960
See you next time.

698
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,150
 - Goodbye.  
 - Goodbye!

699
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,340
Please follow me.

700
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:22,780
Hold your partner's hand.

701
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:24,420
Auntie.

702
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,170
Are you really Hae Joon?

703
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:44,560
How are you exactly the same?

704
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,310
You've become cooler.

705
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:49,000
How are you so good at those explanations?

706
00:50:51,670 --> 00:50:56,100
Let's go. I'll buy you something delicious.

707
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:11,640
You should eat, too.

708
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,380
One might think I'm acting like a child.

709
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,400
Should I order you another one?

710
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,720
I'll finish this first.

711
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,400
Why? Eat one more.

712
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:24,850
Didn't you always say bulgogi burgers were the tastiest in the world?

713
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:29,960
They don't have bulgogi burgers in America.

714
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:34,650
That really stuck in my head when you went to America.

715
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,970
Auntie.

716
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,510
Yes.

717
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,000
What?

718
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,110
Never mind. Get going.

719
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:03,740
I'm leaving.

720
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,100
She hasn't contacted you, right?

721
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,860
I was just wondering.

722
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,470
I got a new phone number, so not many people know it.

723
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:23,470
There is no one to contact me.

724
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:26,960
Take care.

725
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:30,400
- I'll get going, then. 
 - Okay.

726
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:02,290
Why did Auntie have to bring up Mom?

727
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,210
Of course. Of course.

728
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:37,940
It ended early today since I just got prescriptions.

729
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:40,800
Yes, and I bought everything I needed to.

730
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,800
I have to get going to prepare for dinner hours.

731
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,510
Yes, I'll call you back. It's nothing.

732
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:51,300
- Aigoo, it's fine. 
 - I'm sorry.

733
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,610
There's nothing that can shatter.

734
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:53,790
- But still. 
 - Yes, yes. I'm sorry.

735
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:55,840
Gosh, I'm sorry.

736
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:33,640
Why are you here?

737
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:36,900
I...

738
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,460
What?

739
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,740
What is it?

740
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,870
It's nothing.

741
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:54,720
Will you tell Joo Won?

742
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,980
I have no intention of telling her.

743
00:54:56,980 --> 00:54:58,470
Don't you remember?

744
00:54:58,470 --> 00:55:01,030
I didn't tell her back then, either.

745
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:06,250
That's right. You didn't.

746
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:13,580
But this time, it'll come with a price.

747
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,520
What price?

748
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,470
Can you...

749
00:55:19,970 --> 00:55:22,380
be my boyfriend?

750
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,520
You could just ask me to ruin your blind date.

751
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,480
You surprised me when you asked me to be your boyfriend.

752
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:47,370
Well, you are my boyfriend for a day.

753
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:50,820
But is that really necessary?

754
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:55,640
You can just tell him, "Sorry, but I don't think we are suited for each other."

755
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,640
I tried that a couple of times.

756
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,900
- “A couple of times”? 
 - But Mom keeps arranging another date.

757
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:11,000
So will you help me or not?

758
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:16,360
What kind of boyfriend do you want?

759
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,570
Yi Yeon told me...

760
00:56:26,290 --> 00:56:29,940
Hae Joon came back to Korea.

761
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:34,300
Did you keep in touch with your younger sister?

762
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,050
No.

763
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:38,300
I didn't.

764
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,170
She contacted me recently after a long time.

765
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:45,200
She said I should at least be aware.

766
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:53,070
Let's not delay and call Hae Joon over here.

767
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:54,800
No.

768
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:58,750
I didn't come to meet him.

769
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:03,310
I just came to get a glimpse of his face.

770
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:08,440
You must've come all the way here because you miss Hae Joon.

771
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:12,520
No. It's not like that.

772
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:22,260
Did you know Hae Joon injured his leg in America?

773
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:25,150
- Pardon? 
 - That's why he quit basketball.

774
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:31,430
Can you imagine how much he must've suffered alone in that far and foreign country?

775
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,790
Sure.

776
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:39,050
See him before you go.

777
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:41,980
It's not a hard request.

778
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:45,970
No, please just pretend you never saw me today.

779
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:49,200
Hey, wait. Wait a minute.

780
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,600
Are you scared Hae Joon will be angry at you? He won't.

781
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,540
He will forget you never called him all this time with just one hug from you.

782
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,370
How can you not know your own son?

783
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,390
It doesn't matter.

784
00:58:13,370 --> 00:58:14,560
How could you be so coldhearted?

785
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:16,510
Don't follow me. I said I wouldn't see him.

786
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:18,000
No.

787
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:20,140
I can't do that.

788
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:22,800
I deeply regretted it ten years ago, too.

789
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:27,490
If I had held onto you then, Hae Joon could've seen his mom's face at least once.

790
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:33,210
- I... 
 - Yes?

791
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,990
I killed someone.

792
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:44,330
I killed someone.

793
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:57,970
Is this really enough?

794
00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:00,700
This place is really good.

795
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,050
Good as always.

796
00:59:06,050 --> 00:59:08,480
I told you I'd buy you something delicious.

797
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:14,870
I must be really happy these days.

798
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:20,190
My life was good and uneventful even without Hae Joon and you,

799
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:26,790
but I'm a lot happier now that you guys are back.

800
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,170
It feels like we are back in high school when the three of us were together.

801
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:41,350
But we are no longer 17 and 19 years old.

802
00:59:41,350 --> 00:59:44,520
It feels like back then, but it's not.

803
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:51,340
I don't want things to become awkward between us.

804
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:54,340
So I'm not going to give you…

805
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:57,720
the chance you asked for.

806
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:01,580
- Yoon Joo Won. 
 - Kim San Ha is Yoon Joo Won's oppa.

807
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:04,260
We can't become anything else.

808
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:31,460
What should we do?

809
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:34,940
I'll buy an umbrella from the convenience store.

810
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,680
Let's just run to the parking lot.

811
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,980
It won't take long.

812
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:42,540
It's raining heavily… Joo Won!

813
01:00:49,060 --> 01:00:58,050


814
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:05,200
Gosh, how could you run so recklessly?

815
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,710
I thought it would let up.

816
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:11,630
Let me see. You're drenched.

817
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,420
I'll do it.

818
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:21,950
Joo Won.

819
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:25,850
Joo Won.

820
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:29,050
Yoon Joo Won.

821
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:35,500
Look at me.

822
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:49,820
♫  I want to get closer to you  ♫

823
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:55,470
♫  Even though I'm right next to you  ♫

824
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:03,100
♫  It’s like you’re on the other side of the earth  ♫

825
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:08,600
♫  Even if I shout, you can’t hear me  ♫

826
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:17,600
♫  You're my heart, you're my home  ♫

827
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:22,050
♫  You are my whole world  ♫

828
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:23,850
   

829
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:30,810
♫  I'll be your only one  ♫

830
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:34,860
♫  Just as you are  ♫

831
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:47,800
♫  In the breeze, in the moonlight, a softly whispered prayer is carried  ♫

832
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,560
♫  Even if I give away the world  ♫
