Why did you put more?

25
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,580
It must've cost a lot to raise Haejun.

It'd be nice to see him, even for a moment.

00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,470
Why should I see him when I'm not here to take him with me?

38
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,050
Is it hard to say his mom just paid her debt and left?

00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,000
Just tell him it's great that he doesn't have to pay you back.

That's not the issue. He'd want to see you!

It wasn't easy for me.

"I think I almost got him. I just need a little more time!"

199
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,200
Right.

Don't you feel sorry for him?

That little boy watched his younger sister suffocate to death!

206

Have you ever thought about the emotional state he's in?

207
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,120
He was alone with Sojeong.

I'm going to try to forgive you.

213
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,300
Shouldn't you have begged for forgiveness before I tried to?

214
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
It was your fault. It was all your fault!

She told me to keep him as if he were some object.

She never once held his hand.

00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:20,680
You shouldn't worry.

540
00:47:20,680 --> 00:47:22,430
Really?

541
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,210
But that's only for smart kids like you.

542
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:30,310
Our Dal has to work hard. I'm not sure if she can handle it.

543
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:33,860
Gosh, she just works hard without any strategy.

544
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,230
Eat up! Eat up.

545
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:50,650
Why are you here and not eating with them?

546
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,090
Well...

547
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,510
Mom, I know I can't even choose the menu

548
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,150
and I messed up on math.

549
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:08,680
But I wish you wouldn't treat me like a stupid in front of the kids.

550
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:13,160
It's fine when it's just the two of us at home-

551
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:17,100
Then, should I say you're a big shot?

552
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:19,980
People get annoyed when smart people are praised.

553
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,770
That's just how people are.

554
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:26,310
People will likely help if you seem to lack a bit.

555
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:27,860
You need his notes!

556
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:31,220
I don't need his notes.

557
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:34,830
I'm not saying I want to act like I'm all that.

558
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:40,450
I just don't want to look like a fool in front of my friends.

559
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,480
Why are you crying?

560
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,940
What did I say to make you cry?

561
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:48,160
I look so stupid.

562
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,020
I think she cried.

563
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,470
- She cried.
- Smile.

564
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:03,820
- I can't smile.
- Me, too.

565
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:07,020
Then, should we tell Dal that her mom is too much to her face?

566
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,130
- Take care.
- Thank you for the food.

567
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:51,280
- What?
- Goodness!

568
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,670
Do you have a bad relationship with your mom?

569
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:57,940
Don't mind him.

570
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:01,540
Our relationship is fine.

571
00:50:02,540 --> 00:50:03,990
Let's go to the beach!

572
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:06,170
We just have to walk a bit.

573
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,580
Let's go.

574
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:16,850
Be careful!

575
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:50,950
Is this all you really need?
[Math]

576
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:52,690
Thank you.

577
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,100
It is.

578
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:58,760
I'll show it to my mom and return it right away.

579
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,950
You should join them, too.

580
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:04,010
We came here to make you feel better.

581
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:06,760
I feel fine, though.

582
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:17,570
She was just acting like that in front of you guys.

583
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:20,460
She's not like that when we're alone.

584
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:25,050
And she's not exactly wrong.

585
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,170
Do you remember how you and Juwon became friends?

586
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:37,680
Probably when I called Haejun over when she got dragged to the incinerating facility.

587
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,670
Juwon told me

588
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:43,820
that you ran without even realizing your shoe fell off.

589
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:45,600
That's right.

590
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:51,300
Lawyers aren't people who simply speak well.

591
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:55,840
Shouldn't they be like you, who runs around taking care of

592
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,260
others' business like it's your own?

593
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:06,840
Your mom's words weren't all true.

594
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:11,470
Just think of your mom as human, too.

595
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:14,800
Then, you'll feel more at peace.

596
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:17,870
That's what I do.

597
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,370
Hey, look at this! Seaweed!

598
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:29,290
Do they raise it here?

599
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,870
Why are you laughing?

600
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:40,230
You know I'm sharp, right?

601
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:41,930
Your friend likes Kim Sanha.

602
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:44,540
I'm positive! They look good together.

603
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,060
What the hell?

604
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:49,930
Something came over me.

605
00:52:55,660 --> 00:52:57,540
It's Auntie!

606
00:52:57,540 --> 00:52:59,170
Okay, okay!

607
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:02,460
- Auntie called. She said I can come.
- O-Okay.

608
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,330
I'm going first!

609
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:05,600
Hey!

610
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:09,600
[Mom]
My mom asked me when I'm coming, too.

611
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,730
Thank you.

612
00:53:13,570 --> 00:53:15,000
Bye!

613
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,200
Where should we go now?

614
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,800
Do we just go home?

615
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:29,210
I still haven't digested that steak.

616
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,770
How do you feel?

617
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:32,510
I feel fine.

618
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,840
Auntie!

619
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:36,580
You're here.

620
00:53:37,610 --> 00:53:39,560
He must be your nephew.

621
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:41,310
Yes.

622
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,230
Do you feel okay?

623
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:46,390
Did you see the baby?

624
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:49,010
She looks the same as her photo! She's so cute.

625
00:53:49,010 --> 00:53:51,300
Your nephew must take after his maternal side.

626
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,830
He looks exactly like his mom and aunt.

627
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:55,930
What's the "maternal side"?

628
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:59,550
I'm saying you resemble your mom's family more than your dad's.

629
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:00,800
Mom's family?

630
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,440
What are you saying? He doesn't.

631
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:06,220
Didn't you say the woman from a few days ago was your older sister?

632
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:10,660
They look so similar that I could tell he was her son right away.

633
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:33,050
Mom was here?

634
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:35,200
Who was here?

635
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,200
Haejun's mom.

636
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,600
She came and left without seeing Haejun? Why?

637
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,680
Who knows?

638
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:49,080
To deposit this and forget about it seems like I'm getting rid of evidence.

639
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,360
But I can't exactly hide this large sum anywhere.

640
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:55,220
Gosh, I really don't know what to do.

641
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,950
What do you think?

642
00:54:56,950 --> 00:54:59,500
You can use it for Haejun next year.

643
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,570
Don't say a word about it to Haejun.

644
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:04,540
She might have special circumstances.

645
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:08,000
What could be so special that she couldn't even see her child's face?

646
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:11,450
You don't have to feel guilty. This was your money to start with.

647
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:14,230
What's the problem with getting your money back?

648
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:18,820
Even so.

649
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:20,660
"Your mom paid her debt and left."

650
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,400
"She left without seeing you."

651
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,350
Can you tell him that?

652
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:33,780
She said she paid her debt before leaving.

653
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:41,520
So, she said not to worry about the money.

654
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:09,940
I can pay back the money later when I'm older.

655
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:16,100
I could've paid it back.

656
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,790
Did you give Dal your notes?

657
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:38,530
What do you think? Did she feel better?

658
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:40,020
Yeah.

659
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:44,130
Anyway, how is Kang Haejun so dense?

660
00:56:44,130 --> 00:56:46,960
You're the one Dal's mom wanted to see.

661
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,870
Why does he think I brought him along when he's unrelated?

662
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:53,100
Wasn't that enough for most people to catch on?

663
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:55,950
Huh?

664
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,350
Huh?

665
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,100
You weren't listening.

666
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:01,400
I was.

667
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,750
What did I say?

668
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,750
That Kang Haejun's dense.

669
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,970
Do you know what he said to me earlier?

670
00:57:09,970 --> 00:57:13,730
He said he's positive Dal has feelings for Kim Sanha.

671
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:15,680
He said he's sharp.

672
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:18,920
Yeah, right.

673
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,880
What are you doing? You'll fall.

00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,450

00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,290
Come up!

676
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,830
Grab on. It's dangerous.

677
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:35,760
Am I a kid?

678
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:47,140
Doesn't he think about why Dal and I go to his basketball practice?

679
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:49,430
I don't even know basketball rules.

680
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:51,660
I'm just following Dal.

681
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,160

00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:58,560
She always stops by the gym on her way to the academy.

683
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,550
Isn't that a quite blatant signal?

684
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:03,740
Was he always so dense?

685
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,330
Don't you agree?

686
00:58:09,030 --> 00:58:10,680
You're dense, too.
