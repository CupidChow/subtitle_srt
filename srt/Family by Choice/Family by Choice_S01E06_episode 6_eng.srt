1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:11,050


2
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,010
   

3
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,100
   

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,690
   

5
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:29,850
   

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,760
   

7
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,060
   

8
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:50,760
   
   

9
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,410
You're Mr. Yoon Jeong Jae, right?

10
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,670
Do you remember me?

11
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,730
P-Please give me a minute.

12
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,200
I'll call Hae Joon–

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,540
I hope to keep it a secret from Hae Joon that I'm here.

14
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,050
Sorry?

15
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,940
Have a seat.

16
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,730
Let's talk, just the two of us.

17
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,400
   

18
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,520
   

19
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,190
   

20
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,860
Don't you remember lending me money?

21
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,290
I remember lending it to you,

22
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,120
and I remember the exact amount.

23
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,250
But this is too much.

24
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:47,300
I put some more in there.

25
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,610
Why did you put more?

26
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,180
It must've cost a lot to raise Hae Joon.

27
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,840
It'll cost more for college.

28
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,490
Thank you for the coffee.

29
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,810
You're leaving?

30
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,350
This is so sudden...

31
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,440
Pardon...

32
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,770
Pardon me!

33
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,530
Wait a minute!

34
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:23,870
You came all the way here. Why won't you see Hae Joon?

35
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,840
What would be the point?

36
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,280
What do you mean? Well, of course...

37
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,870
It'd be nice to see him, even for a moment.

38
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,070
Why see him when I'm not here to take him with me?

39
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,650
Is it hard to tell him his mom paid her debt and left?

40
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,700
Just tell him it's great he doesn't have to pay you back.

41
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,510
That's not the issue. Your child would want to see you!

42
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,950
Do you know how long he waited for you?

43
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,940
How can I tell him you just came and left?

44
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,430
Don't be like this and–

45
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,320
Yes, fine.

46
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:13,220
If you insist, I'll accept only the money I lent you.

47
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,360
This leaves no resentment, right?

48
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,300
Take care.

49
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,840
Mr. Yoon Jeong Jae.

50
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,500
Why did you lend me money?

51
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,970
Excuse me?

52
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,650
No matter how I think about it, we were almost strangers.

53
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,400
You lent it too easily.

54
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,880
It wasn't easy for me,

55
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,790
and you must've had your reasons for asking when we were essentially strangers.

56
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,650
You seem to understand everyone's circumstances.

57
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,210
Yes, it's not that hard once you try to understand.

58
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,000
Just take it.

59
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,850
Wait, Ms. Seo Hyeon...

60
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,910
What am I supposed to tell him?

61
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,710
It's melting! Let's run!

62
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,650
H-Hey! Time out!

63
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,010
- Time out! 
 - Gosh.

64
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,970
- What? 
 - Pardon?

65
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,400
- Nothing. Let's go. 
 - Okay.

66
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,380
   

67
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,810
   

68
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,500
He never sleeps at night.

69
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,580
At least let him sleep during the day.

70
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,670
   

71
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,100
This has been ringing for a while.

72
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,130
   

73
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,910
Hello?

74
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,900
 Put So Hui on the phone. 

75
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,940
Why are you asking me for So Hui?

76
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,580
 She told Ahjumma she was going to the restaurant to see you. 

77
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,590
So Hui's gone?

78
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,770
Since when?

79
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,250
Welcome!

80
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,040
Ahjusshi, did So Hui come here?

81
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,630
- So Hui? 
 - Did So Hui not come?

82
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,770
Why? Is she gone?

83
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,900
Yes, I think she left by herself.

84
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,840
She didn't come to the restaurant.

85
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,560
You shouldn't be asking me that!

86
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,470
She might be on her way here. Please let me know if she comes.

87
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,110
Yes, all right. I'll do that.

88
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,430
I'll search nearby.

89
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,100
   

90
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,930
So Hui!

91
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,980
 Aigoo, goodbye! Take care. 

92
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,770
 Take care! Goodbye! 
   

93
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:56,720
If you wait a moment, the police will help find your mom.

94
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,670
I'm not looking for my mom. I'm looking for my oppa.

95
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,240
Over here! Over here!

96
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,540
Hello, we are from the Gangpyeong Police Station.

97
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:09,320
Is that her?

98
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,590
What's your name, Little Girl?

99
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:19,060
Where are your mom and dad?

100
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,980
She rode the taxi here by herself around 2:00 p.m.?

101
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,940
That's right. She said she came looking for her mom.

102
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,950
Where did she get in the taxi?

103
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,340
She didn't say.

104
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,500
Was there a report of a missing child?

105
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:55,070
Please hold.

106
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,330
   

107
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,370
When?

108
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,010
Off to the restaurant by herself?

109
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,930
Are you So Hui?

110
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:22,550
   

111
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,040
Oppa!

112
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,050
Where did you find her?

113
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,830
At a noodle shop in the next town.

114
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:47,520
I responded to a call and found her there.

115
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,250
How could you come here alone?

116
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,320
Thank goodness we found her, so all is good.

117
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,960
What if she does this again?

118
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,950
Do you think we will be lucky to find you again?

119
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,640
Oppa was just really worried about you, So Hui.

120
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,630
Really?

121
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,470
Jeong So Hui!

122
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,590
Who said you could leave home by yourself?

123
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,000
Do you know how worried I was?

124
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,450
Let's go.

125
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,990
Oppa.

126
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,220
Let's go!

127
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,510
You won't even greet me now?

128
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:47,970
Haven't you children learned you should greet your elders?

129
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,410
I did–

130
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,210
They did.

131
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,010
You're the one who didn't see because you ignored them.

132
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,350
They roamed for over an hour looking for So Hui.

133
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,710
So Hui has never left home by herself like this before.

134
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,210
You're the only oppa she has.

135
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,510
This wouldn't happen if you visited your sister first!

136
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,730
How is this San Ha's fault? What were you doing?

137
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,860
Do you expect me to monitor her continuously?

138
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,510
It hasn't been long since San Ha and the child first met.

139
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,000
They're not close enough for sudden visits.

140
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,330
Time is irrelevant. They're family!

141
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,230
Do you know how glad I was to see you after ten years?

142
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,520
"My son has grown so much since I last saw him."

143
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,810
"So Hui would love to live with her oppa."

144
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:33,980
"Fine, I should try."

145
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,660
"I should try to forgive you."

146
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,100
I said I don't need your forgiveness.

147
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,800
You never contacted me when you got remarried or had So Hui. Why now, suddenly?

148
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,500
- That's why I'm doing this at least now– 
 - That's why!

149
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,740
Please...

150
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,530
Please stop trying.

151
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,650
How could you...

152
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:04,160
Shouldn't I be the one saying such words?

153
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,710
Shouldn't you have begged for forgiveness before I tried to forgive you?

154
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,980
Whose fault is this?

155
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,640
- Please stop! 
 - Why should I stop?

156
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,460
Why are you yelling at me when it was your fault?

157
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,040
It was your fault.

158
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,500
- It was all your fault! 
 - Stop!

159
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,800
- She died because of you! 
 - Enough!

160
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,750
Come out.

161
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,670
Come out!

162
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:02,280
It's okay. Don't cry.

163
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,970
It's okay.

164
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,130
Where are you going?

165
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,180
Wait for us.

166
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,380
Give him some time to resolve his thoughts.

167
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,560
He didn't look back once.

168
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,910
He doesn't want to show us his face.

169
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,710
Where are you taking me?

170
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,710
That's right.

171
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:55,800
Before you left ten years ago, I blamed you.

172
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,590
I thought it was all your fault.

173
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,090
What are you saying?

174
00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:01,280
You're a weak person.

175
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,650
I'm well aware you're not strong enough to admit your mistakes,

176
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:10,650
so I didn't want to remind you that it was your fault.

177
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,840
What are you talking about?

178
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:14,910
You're not the one who should be doing the forgiving!

179
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,580
I even gave you a divorce so you hurt less.

180
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,410
I did everything you wanted.

181
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,800
You "gave me a divorce"?

182
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,460
Jeong Hui.

183
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,400
I loved you that much.

184
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,020
How about me? Do you think I didn't?

185
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,680
Do you think I was a cold-blooded person?

186
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,160
Did I go crazy?

187
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,340
Why do you think I married a lowly civil servant with nothing to his name?

188
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,490
What? "Love"?

189
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:52,150
When I said I was depressed after spending my youth having two children,

190
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,680
did you even pretend to hear me?

191
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:57,370
You obsessed over your work performance!

192
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,500
What did you say when you finally came home?

193
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,500
"I think I'll be able to catch him. I just need a little more time."

194
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,090
You didn't care how lonely and miserable I was.

195
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,400
You're right.

196
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,470
- Everything you said is true, but– 
 - That day,

197
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,970
you weren't home either.

198
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,400
Was I the only one not at home?

199
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,030
Were you the only one free to go after criminals?

200
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:23,020
How are you the only one who is always righteous and dignified?

201
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,800
Right.

202
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,370
After my child died,

203
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:33,030
forget justice and dignity. Nothing mattered anymore!

204
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,160
But what about San Ha?

205
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,320
Is San Ha not our child?

206
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,400
Don't you feel sorry for him?

207
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:46,370
That little boy watched his younger sister suffocate to death!

208
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,870
 Have you ever thought about the emotional state he has been in? 

209
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,720
 He was alone with So Jeong. 

210
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,640
 What was he doing then? 

211
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,820
 Didn't you ever think about that? 

212
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,360
 Have you never thought that before? 

213
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,270
 To forgive you. 

214
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:04,880
 I'm going to try to forgive you. 

215
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,900
 Shouldn't you have begged for forgiveness before I tried to forgive you? 

216
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,800
 It was your fault. It was all your fault! 

217
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,080
 She died because of you! 

218
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,210
   

219
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:23,150
 How about an adult? Is there an adult with you? 

220
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,940
 No one's here. No one... 

221
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,940
   

222
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,000
 When Ahjumma left this place, 

223
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,740
do you know how cold she was to Kim San Ha?

224
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,880
She told me to "keep him," as if he were some object.

225
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,700
She never once held his hand.

226
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,120
And now, she wants to "forgive him"?

227
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,880
Why are you silent? Am I wrong?

228
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,460
Not too long ago...

229
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,500
 In this world, toxic families also exist. 

230
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,100
 My mom and I are like that. 

231
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:06,880
At the time, I couldn't understand how he could say something so harsh.

232
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,550
But I think I can understand now.

233
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,050
I've told you all this time how scary Ahjumma is!

234
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,410
How was I supposed to know with just that?

235
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,500
I can only understand if I know more.

236
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,770
He sneaks into his room at the mention of his mom.

237
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,950
It's because he's trying to hold back.

238
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:07,940
 Why? 

239
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,980
When? At what time?

240
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,000
Did he not even eat breakfast?

241
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:17,150
Aigoo, Joo Won is the only one who cares about San Ha.

242
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:19,570
Ahjusshi.

243
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:23,040
I told Ahjumma not to contact San Ha for the time being.

244
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:27,500
His grandmother is in Japan with his uncle, so he'll hear less from her, too.

245
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,820
Don't worry about it.

246
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,550
"For the time being"?

247
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:34,710
From when to when specifically?

248
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:39,630
Well... The soup tastes great.

249
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,820
You're not sure, are you?

250
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:47,840
He probably couldn't sleep before going to school.

251
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,490
Dad, don't you have anything better than jujube tea?

252
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:55,860
Something like king jujube tea or emperor jujube tea?

253
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,140
I'll check in the marketplace.

254
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,460
You both finish your breakfast before going.

255
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,500
I'll pack you some cherry tomatoes and apples.

256
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,190
Take them to San Ha later.

257
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,330
Will cherry tomatoes be enough?

258
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,580
Wait, why won't he eat breakfast?

259
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:13,460
You ought to eat, no matter what,

260
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,260
or you'll suffer all day at school.

261
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,900
Don't wake him up. Let's just go to the snack bar.

262
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,120
Did Oppa leave already?

263
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,260
- I don't know. 
 - He said he was going to the library.

264
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,570
Did he?

265
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,370
- Hey, move aside! 
 - Let's go!

266
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:12,840
We all ate our dinner.

267
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,060
Okay.

268
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,770
How much longer will you keep this up?

269
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,910
Isn't this enough?

270
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,600
As you said, we might just be motherless children in other people's eyes,

271
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,150
but you still live with Ahjusshi.

272
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,700
Look at me.

273
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,520
Whom do I have?

274
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:42,560
See? You pity me more, too.

275
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,100
Who says pity is relative?

276
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,290
My mom said she'd return after making money.

277
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:58,200
I gradually stopped believing it in middle school.

278
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,510
But you had to bring it up and rub salt in my wound. How mean.

279
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,500
But did I ever skip meals because I was embarrassed?

280
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,370
Being embarrassed is one thing; eating is another.

281
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,710
Will you skip tomorrow's breakfast, too?

282
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,740
Yes.

283
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,630
My goodness, when will he grow up?

284
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:21,310
Are you going through puberty?

285
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,310
It's much too late!

286
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,800
What's up with her?

287
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,890
I told you not to greet her.

288
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:01,210
I didn't even realize I was doing it.

289
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,470
But why the lunchbox these past few days?

290
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,820
Is he skipping school lunch?

291
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,610
It's not lunch. It's breakfast.

292
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:10,300
Kim San Ha has been skipping breakfast the last few days.

293
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,000
He must be busy studying.

294
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,120
It's not that.

295
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,190
Are you worried about Kim San Ha right now?

296
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,300
I'm not!

297
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,480
What do you mean?

298
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,920
You!

299
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:30,890
Were your feelings for Kang Hae Joon that fleeting–

300
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,960
I just have a favor to ask of him.

301
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,930
 Why did you pack so much? 

302
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,510
There's so much.

303
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,090
What are you trying to do?

304
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,800
Just this...

305
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,650
   

306
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:08,190
Hey, about that. Your–

307
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,450
I know who brought it.

308
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,390
   
   

309
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:17,080
 Eat! 

310
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,060
 You're eating, right? 

311
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,300
 You can choose any menu item. 

312
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:24,490
 If you're eating, send a sign. 

313
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,860
 Eat and feel better. Fighting! 

314
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:58,830
   

315
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,530
Welcome.

316
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,790
   

317
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:28,590
You don't have umbrellas?

318
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:31,890
 It started pouring suddenly, so we are sold out. 

319
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:46,280
 As it rains harder, there will be more than 120 mm (4.5 in) of strong rain overnight. 

320
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,010
 As it rains, you'll see strong winds in some areas. 

321
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:55,060
 The Southern region, particularly near Jeju, will be issued strong wind advisories... 

322
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,850
   

323
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,310
 The call is not going through– 

324
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:22,280
Dad, did you put tofu in the soybean paste stew?

325
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,500
N-No, not yet.

326
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,070
Don't add the tofu yet and wait.

327
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,840
Sure.

328
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:33,540
   

329
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,690
Did you eat?

330
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,630
What are you doing here?

331
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,890
What do you mean?

332
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,740
It's because you keep skipping meals.

333
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,870
Why did you turn your phone off?

334
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,750
It ran out of battery.

335
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:27,250
Charge your phone more often.

336
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,620
What are you doing? It's soybean paste stew tonight.

337
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,420
I'm not hungry. It's fine.

338
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,180
I didn't ask if you're fine or not.

339
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,260
You clearly don't look fine, so why bother asking?

340
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,870
It's pointless.

341
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:49,500
Don't you know why I'm avoiding you?

342
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,640
Why?

343
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,560
It's because I'm embarrassed.

344
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:56,280
I'm embarrassed I had a fight with my mom in front of you all.

345
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,680
It's considerate to leave me alone at times like this.

346
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,230
I said to come eat. Why the overreaction?

347
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,490
What are you doing? Come on.

348
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,320
Gosh, it's so cold.

349
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,310
So cold.

350
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,440
- Oh, you're back? 
 - Yes.

351
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,430
Your socks. Take your socks off before sitting down.

352
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,260
There we go.

353
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:15,230
She spent more than an hour looking for you.

354
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,650
She went back and forth from home to the bus stop.

355
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,720
Shut it.

356
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,740
Eat first, then wash up.

357
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:35,660
Since you haven't joined us for a while, I'll let you have all the tofu.

358
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:38,020
In return, the fried eggs are mine.

359
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,220
Let's be clear about that.

360
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:43,140
- Is it that good? 
 - You can't handle not getting to eat these, right?

361
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,660
Hey, this is salted mackerel.

362
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,340
Aigoo.

363
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,120
She's the fried egg monster.

364
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,030
Seriously.

365
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:35,440
It's not like you're Humpty Dumpty. Why do you like fried eggs so much?

366
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,460
- You can have mine. 
 - I ate it just in case.

367
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,450
You eat three dozen eggs a month.

368
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:44,370
I'll grow up and...

369
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:50,370
Dad was so relieved to see you eat.

370
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:53,180
Skipping meals is also being unfilial.

371
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:57,000
Sorry.

372
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,630
In that respect, I'm such a great daughter, right?

373
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:03,650
I miss her.

374
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,090
Miss who?

375
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,890
So Jeong.

376
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,010
I was just saying I do. Just saying.

377
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,570
I miss my mom, too.

378
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,820
You don't know what your mom looks like, though.

379
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,710
I saw her pictures, but also want to see her in person.

380
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,530
You never said anything like that.

381
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:39,270
Because if I say I miss her, my dad will be sad.

382
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:43,800
Do you think my dad misses So Jeong, too?

383
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,380
Does he have to point it out for you?

384
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:50,180
Right? It's a given.

385
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,040
I miss my mom, too.

386
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,900
Of course, I do.

387
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:08,380
19-year-old Kang Hae Joon still misses his mother.

388
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:12,000
Why do you always pick on me? Why?

389
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,830
- Whenever he thinks of his mother, Hae Joon gets teary. 
 - I said stop! Stop!

390
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,600
Do you understand Korean–

391
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,250
 Dad! 

392
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:45,610
Kim San Ha has a fever.

393
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,550
Since when?

394
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:52,120
He barely ate anything and got soaked in the rain.

395
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,250
This is no surprise.

396
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,780
Did you give him medicine?

397
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,040
I gave him those.

398
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,270
Let's leave him to rest.

399
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:01,740
Let's all go out now.

400
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:25,330
♫  One day, a precious memory  ♫

401
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:32,750
♫  Entered my small heart the day you smiled brightly  ♫

402
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:38,100
♫  And another day  ♫

403
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:41,330
♫  The memory of you holding me  ♫

404
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:49,400
♫  The day I wept freely, surrendering all my pain and struggles  ♫

405
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:58,210
♫  We loved all those days  ♫

406
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,990
Don't come.

407
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,610
So Jeong, don't come...

408
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,200
You'll catch my cold...

409
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,860
 Why did you come back? 

410
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,400
 I don't care if you believe me or not, 

411
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,920
 but I came back for San Ha's sake. 

412
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,330
 Didn't you realize anything after meeting So Hui? 

413
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:20,200
 What about So Hui? 

414
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,030
 She resembles her. 

415
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:26,890
 To San Ha, So Hui is his second chance. 

416
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:29,730
 He can try to push her away all he wants. 

417
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:32,310
 He can't ignore So Hui forever. 

418
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,710
 I want to see the siblings get along again. 

419
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:40,010
 Is that so wrong? 

420
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,790
♫  We just believed  ♫

421
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:51,360
♫  we didn't want to let go of each other  ♫

422
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:59,110
♫  While carrying the warmth of our memories in our hearts  ♫

423
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,440
   

424
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:46,540
Are you going somewhere?

425
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,390
How do you feel?

426
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,940
I feel better. The fever has come down, too.

427
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:54,070
Get dressed, then. Wear something nice.

428
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,690
   

429
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,680
   

430
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:32,450
It has been a while.

431
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,730
Is that so?

432
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,120
Dad...

433
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,720
I'm okay now.

434
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,530
The things Mom said...

435
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,650
don't bother me anymore.

436
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,680
How can it not bother you?

437
00:39:54,250 --> 00:40:00,540
Even lies can convince you to doubt yourself the more you listen to them.

438
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:04,840
Even more so when it's your mom's words.

439
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,240
That's why...

440
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,160
I'm also...

441
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,840
going to use my words.

442
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,720
So Jeong's death...

443
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,730
isn't your fault.

444
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:28,420
It didn't happen because you two were together.

445
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:32,600
It happened because we left you two alone.

446
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:39,590
So you don't need to feel apologetic to anyone,

447
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:45,190
and you don't need to push So Hui away.

448
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:47,550
Nor must you try harder to be good to her.

449
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,870
She's your younger sister, after all.

450
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:57,350
Just do as your heart leads you.

451
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,680
Yes.

452
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:07,510
When I get my driver's license next year,

453
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,670
let's come here more often.

454
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,650
Don't come here alone, Dad.

455
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,370
Sure, let's do that.

456
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,520
   

457
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,710
Food is ready!

458
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:21,910
- What? 
 - Dad.

459
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,450
This is great news! Finally!

460
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:32,060
- Aigoo! 
 - So cute.

461
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,600
Isn't she a beauty?

462
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,600
She's so small!

463
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,360
Is that tiny thing her ear? When can we visit?

464
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,760
Auntie said she'd call me when she's ready.

465
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,850
You're so lucky.

466
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:47,080
Well, it's not today, right?

467
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,680
What are you doing after school today?

468
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,230
Let's eat steak!

469
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,940
- "Steak"? 
 - Yes.

470
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,900
Dal's mom said she'll treat us to steak.

471
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,790
Why would your friend's mom treat me when she isn't even my friend?

472
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,340
My friend is your friend, Oppa.

473
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:02,520
Not true. Ordinary people don't think that way.

474
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,280
It's a new place downtown,

475
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,140
and it's apparently very famous in Seoul, too.

476
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:13,200
Dal's mom is making a big gesture by treating us.

477
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,360
The students who've been there said there's no need to chew the meat.

478
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,120
When you place it in your mouth, it melts.

479
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,900
It just melts on your tongue.

480
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:26,190
Nothing is free.

481
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:28,280
- You're going, right? 
 - Let's go.

482
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,540
So it's just us two?

483
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,310
Then meet me after school in front of the main entrance.

484
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,740
Why is she treating us, though?

485
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,030
Let's hear that first.

486
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,280
To be honest...

487
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,020
 I just... 

488
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,650
 have... 

489
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,870
 a favor to ask him. 

490
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:01,320
 Your grade in math is three? 
     

491
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:05,940
 Sure, grades drop sometimes. 

492
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,200
 Rather than getting this result in Grade 12, 

493
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,270
 it's better to face it now and be prepared. 

494
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:14,080
 Okay. 

495
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,210
 Didn't you say you got notes from Joo Won's oppa? 

496
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,290
 Did you get them or not? 

497
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:20,970
 Not yet. 

498
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:22,430
 You're too shy. 

499
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:25,690
 Can't you even ask your friend's brother for a simple favor? 

500
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,440
 I was going to ask when we got closer. 

501
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,000
 Should I meet Joo Won's brother? 

502
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,150
 Yes! I'll treat him to something tasty, so tell him to come with Joo Won. 

503
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,510
If that's the case, aren't I the only one invited?

504
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:48,320
You two don't really need to be here, do you?

505
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

506
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,400
Delicious food is even more delicious when you eat it together.

507
00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:58,970
- Welcome. 
 - Welcome!

508
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,330
Have a seat.

509
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,700
CSAT is approaching.

510
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:33,920
I hope I'm not taking too much of your time.

511
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,210
Oh, you're not.

512
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:40,190
We should order the 4-person set.

513
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,540
We have two boys here. Order the 6-person set.

514
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:48,370
Oh, then...

515
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,700
What do you want to eat? Is there anything you want to eat?

516
00:45:57,050 --> 00:45:59,320
We've never been to a place like this, so we don't know.

517
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,030
- Right? 
 - Yes.

518
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:02,670
Have you never tried this in Seoul?

519
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,830
Oh, then the 6-person set–

520
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:08,490
- Excuse me! 
 - Yes?

521
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:13,800
We'd like the steak and rib-eye from the 6-person set cooked well done.

522
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,440
And please add a salad and cream pasta.

523
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,780
All of us will have a Coke.

524
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:21,060
- All right? 
 - Yes.

525
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,540
Pardon me.

526
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,230
Enjoy.

527
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,010
Thank you for the food.

528
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,770
You can't even order from the menu on your own.

529
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:48,630
I don't know how you'll become a lawyer at this rate.

530
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,520
Am I counting my eggs before they hatch?

531
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,970
Dal messed up in math this time.

532
00:46:56,970 --> 00:46:59,960
I'm starting to lose hope.

533
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:04,860
Gosh, there you go again, you clumsy girl.

534
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:09,250
All she does is study, so she's lacking in many ways.

535
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:15,380
It's draining to maintain good math grades from the first year.

536
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,070
If she concentrates on it during the break,

537
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:19,790
she'll improve drastically compared to other subjects.

538
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:21,280
You shouldn't worry.

539
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,030
Really?

540
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,810
But that's only for smart children like you.

541
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:30,910
Our Dal has to work hard. I'm not sure if she can handle it.

542
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:34,460
Gosh, she just works hard without any strategy.

543
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:36,830
Eat. Eat up.

544
00:47:48,470 --> 00:47:51,150
Why are you here and not eating with them?

545
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,790
Well...

546
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:01,110
Mom, I know I can't even choose from the menu

547
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,850
and I messed up on math,

548
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:09,280
but I wish you wouldn't treat me like I'm stupid in front of my peers.

549
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,760
It's fine when it's just the two of us at home–

550
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:17,700
Then, should I say my daughter is a distinguished person?

551
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:20,580
People get annoyed when smart people are praised.

552
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,370
That's just how people sympathize.

553
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:26,910
People are more likely to help if you seem to lack a little.

554
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,460
You need his notes.

555
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,820
I don't need his notes.

556
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:35,430
I'm not saying I want to act like I'm extraordinary.

557
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:41,050
I just don't want to look like a fool in front of my friends.

558
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,080
Why are you crying?

559
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,540
What did I say to make you cry?

560
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,760
I look so stupid.

561
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,620
I think she cried.

562
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,070
- She cried. 
 - Smile.

563
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:04,420
- I can't smile. 
 - Me, either.

564
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,720
Then should we tell Dal to her face that her mom is too much?

565
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,930
- Farewell. 
 - Thank you for the food.

566
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,880
- What? 
 - Goodness!

567
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,270
Do you have a bad relationship with your mom?

568
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:58,440
Ignore him.

569
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:02,240
Our relationship is fine.

570
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,590
Let's go to the beach!

571
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:06,770
We just have to walk a little.

572
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,280
Let's go.

573
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:17,450
Be careful!

574
00:50:49,950 --> 00:50:51,450
Is this all you really need? 
    

575
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:53,290
Thank you.

576
00:50:53,290 --> 00:50:54,700
It is.

577
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:59,360
I'll show it to my mom and return it right away.

578
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,550
You should join them, too.

579
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:04,610
We came here to make you feel better.

580
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:07,360
I feel fine, though.

581
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:18,170
She was just acting like that in front of you guys.

582
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:21,060
She's not like that when we are alone.

583
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:25,650
And she's not exactly wrong.

584
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,770
Do you remember how you and Joo Won became friends?

585
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:38,180
Probably when I called Sunbae Hae Joon over when she got dragged to the incinerating facility.

586
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:44,470
Joo Won told me you ran without even realizing your shoe had fallen off.

587
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:46,200
That's right.

588
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:51,900
Lawyers aren't people who simply speak well.

589
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:56,440
Shouldn't they be like you, who spends time taking care of

590
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,760
others' business like it's your own?

591
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:07,440
Your mom's words weren't all true.

592
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:12,170
Just think of your mom as human, too.

593
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:15,300
Then you'll feel more at peace.

594
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,370
That's what I do.

595
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,970
Hey, look at this! Seaweed!

596
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:29,890
Do they grow it here?

597
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,470
Why are you laughing?

598
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:40,830
You know I'm astute, right?

599
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:42,530
Your friend likes Kim San Ha.

600
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:45,240
I'm positive! They look good together.

601
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,660
What the heck?

602
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,530
Something came over me.

603
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,240
It's Auntie!

604
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,070
Okay, okay!

605
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:02,960
- Auntie called. She said I could visit. 
 - O-Okay.

606
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,930
I'm off!

607
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:06,100
Hey!

608
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:07,070
   

609
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:10,200
My mom asked me when I'm coming, too.

610
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,530
Thank you.

611
00:53:14,170 --> 00:53:15,600
Bye!

612
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,800
Where should we go now?

613
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,400
Should we just go home?

614
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,810
I still haven't digested that steak.

615
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:31,470
How do you feel?

616
00:53:31,470 --> 00:53:33,110
I feel fine.

617
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,540
Auntie.

618
00:53:35,230 --> 00:53:37,180
You're here.

619
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:40,160
He must be your nephew.

620
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,010
Yes.

621
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:44,830
Do you feel okay?

622
00:53:44,830 --> 00:53:46,990
Did you see the baby?

623
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:49,610
She looks the same as her photo. She's so cute.

624
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:51,900
Your nephew must take after his maternal side.

625
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,430
He looks exactly like his mom and aunt.

626
00:53:55,430 --> 00:53:56,530
What's the "maternal side"?

627
00:53:56,530 --> 00:54:00,150
I'm saying you resemble your mom's family more than your dad's.

628
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:01,400
"Mom's family"?

629
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:04,040
What are you saying? He doesn't.

630
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,820
Wasn't the woman from a few days ago your older sister?

631
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:11,060
They look so similar. I could tell he was her son right away.

632
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:33,650
Mom was here?

633
00:54:33,650 --> 00:54:35,800
Who was here?

634
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:37,700
Hae Joon's mom.

635
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:42,200
She came and left without seeing Hae Joon? Why?

636
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,280
Who knows?

637
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:49,680
Depositing this in the bank would feel like I'm getting rid of evidence,

638
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:52,960
but I can't exactly hide this large sum anywhere.

639
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:55,820
Gosh, I really don't know what to do.

640
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:57,550
What do you think?

641
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:00,100
You can use it for Hae Joon's college next year.

642
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,170
Don't say a word about it to Hae Joon.

643
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:05,040
She might have some circumstances.

644
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,600
What dire circumstance would stop her from seeing her child's face?

645
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,050
You don't have to feel guilty; this was your money to start with.

646
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:14,730
What's the problem with getting your money back?

647
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:19,420
Even so.

648
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,260
"Your mom paid her debt and left."

649
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,000
"She left without seeing you."

650
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,950
Can you tell him that?

651
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:34,180
 She said she paid her debt before leaving. 

652
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:42,220
 So she said not to worry about the money. 

653
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:10,440
I can repay the money later when I'm older.

654
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:16,800
I could have repaid it.

655
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,390
Did you give Dal your notes?

656
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:39,130
What do you think? Did she seem better?

657
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:40,620
Yes.

658
00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:44,730
Anyway, why is Kang Hae Joon so dense?

659
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:47,560
You're the one Dal's mom wanted to see.

660
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:50,470
Why does he think I brought him along if he's not involved?

661
00:56:50,470 --> 00:56:53,700
Wasn't that enough for most people to catch on?

662
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,550
Right?

663
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:57,950
Pardon?

664
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,700
You weren't listening.

665
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,000
I was.

666
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,350
What did I say?

667
00:57:04,350 --> 00:57:07,350
That Kang Hae Joon is dense.

668
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:10,570
Do you know what he said to me earlier?

669
00:57:10,570 --> 00:57:14,230
He said he's positive Dal has feelings for Kim San Ha.

670
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,280
He said he's astute.

671
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:19,520
Yeah, right.

672
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:24,480
What are you doing? You'll fall.

673
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,050
Wow, this feels nice.

674
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,890
Come up.

675
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:34,430
Grab on. It's dangerous.

676
00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:36,360
Am I a child?

677
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:47,740
Doesn't he think about why Dal and I go to his basketball practice?

678
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,030
I don't even know basketball rules.

679
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:52,460
I'm just following Dal.

680
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,760
Exactly.

681
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:59,160
She always stops by the gym on her way to the academy.

682
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,150
Isn't that quite a blatant signal?

683
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:04,340
Was he always so dense?

684
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,030
Don't you agree?

685
00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:11,280
You're dense, too.

686
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,530
Why am I–

687
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:30,010


688
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:36,350
♫  I keep rattling  ♫

689
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:43,240
♫  Like a broken doll  ♫

690
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:48,830
♫  I'm lost on every step  ♫

691
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:55,140
♫  I guess I'm locked away inside you  ♫

692
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:59,000
♫  I need an explanation  ♫

693
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,860
♫  My day is spent immersed in a dream  ♫

694
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:11,520
♫  I have a lot to say  ♫

695
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:18,600
♫  but I'm lost for words  ♫

696
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:30,700
♫  Why am I like this?  ♫

697
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:38,730
♫  Why am I always so excited like it's the first time?  ♫

698
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:44,480
♫  And remorseful like it's the last time?  ♫

699
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,330
♫  Again, I circle around you like I'm praying  ♫

700
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:54,190
♫  When our eyes meet  ♫

701
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:55,900
   

702
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:58,390
 Doesn't Kim San Ha seem sensitive these days? 

703
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:01,180
 The CSAT is next week. I need to focus. 

704
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,150
 She should be more careful. 

705
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:05,280
 Boldly skip the questions you don't know. 

706
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,550
 If worst comes to worst, roll your pencil! 

707
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:10,870
 Congrats on finishing the CSAT! 

708
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:14,860
 If she left, she should've lived a good life. Why make him suffer? 

709
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:16,610
 Let go! 

710
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:18,820
 It's only been one day since you went to Seoul. 

711
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:21,770
 - Why does it seem so long ago? 
 - Oppa! 

712
01:00:21,770 --> 01:00:24,410
 The time it takes to wake up from anesthesia varies for everyone, 

713
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:31,350
 but something feels off. 

714
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:33,520
♫  These days...  ♫
