1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,410


2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,960
   

3
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,030
   

4
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:21,610
   

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,910
   

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,730
   

7
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,000
   

8
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,830
No, no! Hand me the keys.

9
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:55,840
You can't drive to Seoul like that.

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,620
Sit in the back.

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,110
I'll take them to the train station, so go to bed first.

12
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,820
- Okay. 
 - Put your seatbelt on.

13
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,080
Message me when you get there.

14
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,800
All right.

15
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,910
It should be fine, right?

16
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,820
It has to be.

17
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,460
   

18
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,810
Brother-in-law.

19
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,470
How did you get here so fast from Japan?

20
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:49,450
There happened to be a flight. I just got here myself.

21
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,960
I didn't tell Mom yet.

22
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,440
Her heart is still weak.

23
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,190
We don't know what might happen.

24
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:59,560
Yes, good thinking.

25
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,430
Uncle.

26
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,620
Yes, it has been ten years.

27
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,920
You look the same, San Ha.

28
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,420
So Hui is with the Ahjumma who helps around the house.

29
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,890
I told her to come in the morning...

30
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,250
but I might have to tell her not to come.

31
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:34,630
   

32
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,450
   

33
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,240
The surgery went well.

34
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,490
We'll have to wait and see how it turns out,

35
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,240
but there's no need to worry for now.

36
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,330
You two have school tomorrow. Go get some sleep.

37
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,910
 The surgery is done. She'll be fine. 

38
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,050
Thank goodness.

39
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,960
Thank goodness.

40
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:45,010
See? I told you she'll be fine.

41
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,230
Good night.

42
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,310
Good night.

43
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,400
I'm relieved.

44
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,630
   

45
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,370
I'm going to Brother-in-law's... I mean...

46
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,970
So Hui's father's funeral.

47
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,040
Please call me right away if anything happens.

48
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,280
Don't worry and just go.

49
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,480
Oppa!

50
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,740
Uncle! This is my Oppa.

51
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,660
Oppa, why did you come to Seoul?

52
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,480
Why are you two together?

53
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,160
Uncle, it's your first time seeing Oppa, right?

54
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,370
Oppa, you too? Are you meeting Uncle for the first time?

55
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,080
So Hui, do you know Mom is hurt?

56
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,900
Yes, Dad is hurt, too.

57
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,460
But they said they'll recover after a few days.

58
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,540
I didn't know the situation, so...

59
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,760
What is it?

60
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,600
So can you stay with Ahjumma for a few days, So Hui?

61
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,280
When Mom and Dad are all better, I'll come get you.

62
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,710
Okay?

63
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,400
I don't want to!

64
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,520
Let's go to Ahjumma's house.

65
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,200
- Let's go. 
 - No!

66
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,730
Come on, let's go...

67
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,240
I want to see Mom.

68
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,550
Mom, Dad!

69
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,780
I don't want to be alone.

70
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,710
Mom and Dad are gone.

71
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,270
I'm scared of being by myself.

72
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,020
So Hui.

73
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,410
Then, will you stay with me instead of with Mom?

74
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:25,190
Oh? Really?

75
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,230
I'll stay with So Hui for the time being.

76
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:32,580
What are you saying?

77
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:38,380
Uncle can't take care of So Hui while going to and from the hospital.

78
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:43,190
That's right. So, can I leave her in your care?

79
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,930
That works for me.

80
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,450
You should head home first.

81
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:53,340
I'll stay for a couple more days.

82
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,850
Follow me.

83
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,180
You can't. How will you care for a child?

84
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,600
- It's just for a few days. 
 - What about school?

85
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,890
It's fine until I have to submit my college admissions.

86
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,090
Dad, you saw yourself how severe Mom's injuries are.

87
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,230
We can't take So Hui to Mom right now.

88
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:22,370
Even I was shocked.

89
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:26,040
We should wait a few days for her to get better.

90
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,370
So Hui is just a child.

91
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,780
Someone should be next to her.

92
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,920
Why must it be you?

93
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,270
Who else is there?

94
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,380
When Mom wakes up, she'll ask for So Hui first.

95
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,250
I'll just make sure they're both okay; then I'll head home.

96
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,650
- You're back? 
 - Yes.

97
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,480
Did you eat anything?

98
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,360
Have a glass of jujube tea.

99
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,620
How long will San Ha stay there?

100
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,550
One or two days at most.

101
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,650
If she left, she should've lived a good life.

102
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:55,930
Why make him suffer? Even getting injured.

103
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,630
Seoul?

104
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,310
Hospital?

105
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,450
Hey, don't worry. The surgery went well.

106
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:11,430
Then, what about school?

107
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,140
He'll stay a few days since he has time before the college applications.

108
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,010
He doesn't eat well when he's alone.

109
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,100
He probably skipped breakfast.

110
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,900
He's not alone.

111
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,710
His mom may be in that state,

112
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:27,140
but he has his uncle and younger sister, So Hui.

113
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,510
Would they know Kim San Ha doesn't have a morning appetite?

114
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,190
They wouldn't.

115
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:37,110
Something could've gone wrong. 
    

116
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:39,240
Can't you do more tests, Doctor?

117
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,820
Doctor!

118
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,510
- What's going on? 
 - I don't know.

119
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,580
Noona still hasn't woken up.

120
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,500
The time it takes to wake up from anesthesia varies for everyone,

121
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,420
but something feels off.

122
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,590
Visiting hours are limited, so see her before you leave.

123
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,390
 The guardians can visit one at a time. 

124
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,020
 You have 30 minutes from now. 

125
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,810
 The time to wake up from anesthesia varies for everyone, 

126
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:13,410
 but something feels off. 

127
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,410
 "Reap what they sow"? 

128
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,860
 Will I be punished if I don't welcome my mom, who abandoned me? 

129
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,210
 In other people's eyes, you and I are just children abandoned by their moms! 

130
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,720
 Why do you keep calling me? 

131
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,710
 If I didn't answer, just take that as an answer! 

132
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:34,320
 I'll have to be on my deathbed to see your face, won't I? 

133
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:52,940
   

134
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,320
   

135
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,060
 What are you doing? 

136
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,100
 Did you eat? 

137
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,700
 What did you eat? 

138
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,600
 Make sure to eat dinner. 

139
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,370
   

140
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,290
You answered! Are you not busy?

141
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,980
I'm not.

142
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,430
I'm leaving the hospital right now.

143
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,190
I was just replying to you.

144
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:18,240
I'm on my way home from buying tofu for Dad.

145
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,810
When are you coming home?

146
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:22,870
Anything you want to eat when you're back? I'll ask Dad to make it.

147
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,240
I can't think of anything yet.

148
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,120
I'll think about it.

149
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,730
Anything new?

150
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,160
"New"? It's the same old.

151
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,770
Tonight's dinner is stir-fried squid.

152
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,740
Ahjusshi was bickering with Dad, asking if he's making drinking snacks instead.

153
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,060
They're practically married now.

154
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:45,580
Dal and I went to the snack bar during lunch today.

155
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,280
We met Kang Hae Joon there,

156
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,020
and he did something out of character.

157
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:53,590
 He gave me his precious Chupa Chups. 

158
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,430
 That's unusual, right? 

159
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:03,330
- Are you listening? 
 - Yes.

160
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:05,060
Anything else?

161
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,470
What?

162
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,860
 Anything else? 

163
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,360
It has only been one day since you went to Seoul,

164
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,400
but it seems there's a lot I have to tell you.

165
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,400
Has it really been only one day?

166
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,160
 - Yes.  
 - Why does it seem so long ago?

167
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,720
So, when are you coming home?

168
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,290
Soon.

169
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,870
Dad.

170
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,240
Tofu.

171
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,750
Why the long face?

172
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,340
- Dad. 
 - Wow, I told you to buy soft tofu for jjigae (stew),

173
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,880
but you bought firm ones for pan-fried tofu.

174
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,710
We should...

175
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,280
go to Seoul, too.

176
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,380
"Seoul"?

177
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,420
What can we do there?

178
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:08,930
Aren't you worried after sending Kim San Ha so far away?

179
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,580
Aren't you worried, Mr. Jeong Jae?

180
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,750
Of course, I'm worried.

181
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,500
How about I close the store for a day?

182
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,340
Aigoo! You would incur a huge loss if your business closed for a day.

183
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,150
I took the day off yesterday, so I'll be on night duty for a while.

184
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,760
- The two of us? 
 - Yes!

185
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,280
But where will we sleep?

186
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,940
- How about a day trip? 
 - A day trip to Seoul is bound to be difficult.

187
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,310
Kim San Ha is struggling by himself right now.

188
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,760
- Should we go? 
 - Yes.

189
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,580
It'll be hard for you both, but it'll be troublesome for San Ha, too.

190
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,910
He has to take care of his sister and make hospital visits.

191
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,800
How can he take care of you two as well?

192
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,870
We can take care of him and bring him back.

193
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,220
As if.

194
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,030
San Ha will be back in two or three days.

195
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,760
Regardless.

196
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,590
Fine. I'll just go alone.

197
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:06,390
"Alone"? How will you go alone when you don't know your way around Seoul?

198
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:09,310
There are signs in subways and such places.

199
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,230
You know, this tofu...

200
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:18,190
On the package, it's written whether it's soft or firm tofu.

201
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:21,030
You couldn't even buy the right one. How will you go to Seoul alone?

202
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,460
As for that,

203
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,030
I was just briefly distracted.

204
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,490
Seoul Station is bigger than you think.

205
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:34,140
Joo Won, you probably won't find your way out of there.

206
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,710
That's more than probable.

207
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:38,290
Look who's talking.

208
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:41,060
You haven't been to Seoul Station, either.

209
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,600
Fine!

210
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,270
I guess I'll just hang out with Dal tomorrow.

211
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,330
I'm hanging out with you today, all right?

212
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,210
I really suck at lying, though.

213
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:39,500
It's fine. They won't contact you unless it’s necessary.

214
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,290
But if they just happen to,

215
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:45,640
tell them I'm in the bathroom and call me.

216
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,290
 I'd come with you if it weren't for my academy. 

217
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,060
Will you be okay by yourself?

218
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,440
Have you ridden the subway before?

219
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,990
 Isn't it all written in Korean? 
   

220
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,190
I got on the opposite direction.

221
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,590
I'll see her alone today.

222
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:22,020
Why can only you see Mom, Oppa?

223
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,130
So Hui can see Mom when she feels a little better.

224
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,430
You might be able to see her tomorrow.

225
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:31,540
You said the same thing yesterday.

226
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,260
Does Mom not want to see So Hui?

227
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,920
Why wouldn't she?

228
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,780
It's not like that.

229
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,470
Is it because Mom is hurt badly?

230
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,470
I heard Uncle and Ahjumma talking on the phone.

231
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,290
Ahjumma asked

232
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:04,390
what would happen if Mom doesn't wake up.

233
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:07,100
Why wouldn't Mom wake up?

234
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,830
After surgeries, you need a lot of sleep for a swift recovery.

235
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,460
Really?

236
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,210
Yes, really.

237
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,860
 Are you at the hospital again? 

238
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,770
 Yes, I'm about to see her now. 

239
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,900
 Should I call you this evening? 

240
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,120
I want water.

241
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,070
You have water.

242
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,290
Then, I want juice.

243
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,880
All right.

244
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,700
I'll be right back, so stay put.

245
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,630
Hanguk Medical Center.

246
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,390
Ms. Kwon Jeong Hui's guardian?

247
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,340
Is her son not present?

248
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,980
Ms. Kwon Jeong Hui's son–

249
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,220
My Oppa?

250
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,630
ICU... 
    

251
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,920
   

252
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,040
ICU.

253
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,080
Intensive Care...

254
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:39,760
I knew Kim San Ha would be like that.

255
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,100
- Op– 
 - Oppa!

256
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,580
I told you to stay put.

257
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,890
Mom's awake!

258
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,060
She can see So Hui now!

259
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,090
 Time is irrelevant. They're family! 

260
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,640
 Oppa! Oppa! 

261
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,710
 We aren't family. 

262
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:22,800
 Are we blood relatives? Why must we share a last name? 

263
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,140
 I'm Kim San Ha. You're Yoon Joo Won. 

264
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,200
 Mom woke up. 

265
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,680
   

266
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,970
Why? Are you looking for a part-time job?

267
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:21,860
Of course. What else would I do during the break?

268
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:25,360
If you listened to the coaches from Seoul, you'd be doing winter training.

269
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,040
Why would you reject the fortune at your door?

270
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,860
Stop bringing up something that's over.

271
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,750
It's just such a waste!

272
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,760
Hey, I'm off. Have fun with the other boys from the team.

273
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,340
Hey!

274
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,110
Oh, my gosh!

275
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,000
You just came out from here, right? 
    

276
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,730
Joo Won left early at dawn to hang out with you.

277
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,700
Why are you coming out of the academy?

278
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,820
Joo Won is in the restroom...

279
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,490
Yoon Joo Won came to your academy?

280
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,720
Yoon Joo Won!

281
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,520
How did you know I was here?

282
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:29,360
I ran into your friend, Park Dal, in town.

283
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,780
- Is that so? 
 - Is that all you've got to say?

284
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,530
Are you crazy?

285
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,260
How dare you go to Seoul alone?

286
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,520
I was just about to go there myself to bring you back.

287
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,600
Why won't you answer your phone?

288
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,830
The battery died.

289
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,910
You went to Seoul without even taking a portable charger.

290
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,370
I guess Ahjumma struggled to wake up from the anesthesia after the surgery.

291
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,100
She's okay now.

292
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,930
I saw the text.

293
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,620
My battery must've died after that.

294
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,870
What's wrong?

295
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,990
What do you mean?

296
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:11,330
This. Why is this protruding so much?

297
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:16,370
 What? 

298
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,140
So you just came back?

299
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:24,180
No, I was just about to call him.

300
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,760
But the nurse and So Hui came right at that moment

301
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,850
to let him know that Ahjumma woke up.

302
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,210
They seemed busy.

303
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:38,270
You went all the way to Seoul but couldn't talk to him because they seemed busy?

304
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,870
With all of this on your back, too?

305
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:43,830
Are you an idiot?

306
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:47,710
Give it back. I'm going to carry it.

307
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,210
I should do this for you, at least.

308
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,900
Just leave it and go home.

309
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:00,590
I'll go after doing this.

310
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,600
Hello.

311
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,350
Oh, yes. We are done for the day.

312
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,170
Oh, hey.

313
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,040
It'll take about ten minutes. Is that okay with you?

314
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,540
Yes. Two kalguksus, please.

315
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,430
- Yes, sit wherever you want. 
 - Sure.

316
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:23,440
Don't tell anyone I went to Seoul.

317
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,390
Why not?

318
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,050
Can't you just do that for me?

319
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:32,660
Are those eyes asking for a favor?

320
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,500
Just go home before they find out you went to Seoul.

321
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,570
You won't tell Dad, right?

322
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:45,450
Gosh, do you think I'm a snitch?

323
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,350
Go return all of San Ha's stuff.

324
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,610
   

325
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,240
Till 10 p.m.?

326
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,490
Is he hungry for money? 
    

327
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,510
Aigoo, you scared me!

328
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:18,650
Why are you standing here and not going inside?

329
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,300
I was about to go in, but you came out.

330
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,850
Doesn't he usually close at 7 p.m.?

331
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,960
I don't know what's suddenly gotten into him.

332
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,050
You ask him.

333
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:07,450
Aigoo, there must be rocks in here.

334
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,270
A-Aigoo, that feels great.

335
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,020
That's great.

336
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:18,790
Madam asked why you suddenly extended working hours.

337
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:22,150
I told her to go home so many times.

338
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:28,850
I've been planning to stay open until 10 p.m. for a while now.

339
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:33,030
A soup business shines only shortly during winter.

340
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,580
I'll make money soon and let you retire early.

341
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,140
I'm happy just hearing that.

342
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,680
But I don't think it'll be early for me, even if I retire now.

343
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:50,870
Also, what would I do if I didn't work?

344
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,980
I'd just be drinking beer with Ahjusshi every day.

345
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,930
 Aigoo, that's great. 

346
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:03,830
 Please take care. 

347
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,990
Dad.

348
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,580
Yes.

349
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:22,170
She was transferred to a general ward, so I'm on my way.

350
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:26,400
The doctor said she'll get better.

351
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,300
Yes, Uncle.

352
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,330
So Hui is on her way with Ahjumma right now.

353
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,500
I'm doing fine.

354
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,950
Well, I'll go home...

355
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,820
tomorrow or the day after.

356
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,310
Yes.

357
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,260
What's wrong, Mom?

358
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,110
Are you okay?

359
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,460
Let go!

360
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,980
Sit for now. I'll call the doctor.

361
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,190
Doctor... What good will a doctor do?

362
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,780
I'll just die now!

363
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:19,460
After losing my young child and getting divorced,

364
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:24,130
I thought I'd finally live properly after meeting someone suitable.

365
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,900
But what is this?

366
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:32,770
What's this? What kind of life is this?

367
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:37,850
What kind of ill-fated life is this?

368
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,850
Mom!

369
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,840
It was a big accident.

370
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,050
The hospital said this is a miracle for you.

371
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,780
"A miracle"?

372
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:52,900
Does this look like a miracle to you?

373
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,920
I won't be able to walk again!

374
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,680
Is this a miracle?

375
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,170
Let go!

376
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,140
You're happy now, right?

377
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,970
You're happy the mom who abandoned you ended up this way, right?

378
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,900
I-If I'm to live...

379
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,480
If I'm to live this way,

380
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,840
I'm better off dead! Way better.

381
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,100
I'm better off dead. I'm better off dead!

382
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,850
Cut it out, seriously!

383
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:23,040
Mom!

384
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,670
How can you say you'll die so easily?

385
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:32,250
So you don't want to live?

386
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,790
Is it over if you just die?

387
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,500
What about me?

388
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,620
What about So Hui?

389
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:44,670
How can you be so selfish right to the end?

390
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,490
What do you know?

391
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:03,930
Did you get hurt?

392
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:07,650
I'm the one hurting more!

393
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:29,150
Oppa!

394
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,950
What about Mom?

395
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:40,410
Mom is doing fine now.

396
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:42,680
Though it's such a shame.

397
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,980
Mom will need to get better to see So Hui.

398
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,950
Again?

399
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,240
I don't want this.

400
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,460
You said I'll get to see Mom!

401
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,490
You said Mom woke up. I want to see her now!

402
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,140
I'm sorry.

403
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,840
So Hui, come with Ahjumma.

404
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,470
- Okay? 
 - I don't want to.

405
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:09,930
I want to see Mom.

406
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:14,930
- Come on. 
 - I'm going to see Mom.

407
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,610
Don't take it to heart.

408
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:34,880
People say things they don't mean when they're in pain.

409
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,350
Yes, I know.

410
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,740
The challenge starts now.

411
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,630
She was transferred to a general ward,

412
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:48,080
so she'll need a caretaker 24/7.

413
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,430
Which brings me to ask.

414
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:58,400
San Ha, how about you attend a university in Seoul?

415
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:00,580
Sorry?

416
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,830
I mean... I need to get back to work, too.

417
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:08,010
I've considered multiple options,

418
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,500
but you're the only one.

419
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,160
Can't you come to Seoul and stay with your mom and So Hui?

420
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,490
I'm sorry.

421
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,670
I came because I thought it'd be for a few days.

422
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,800
- You know that. 
 - Of course, I do.

423
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,690
I do, but she's acting out like that, wanting to die as we speak.

424
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:33,160
I'm afraid she'll snap without anyone next to her.

425
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,280
 Your mom isn't strong enough to be taken care of 

426
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,510
 by a stranger while rehabilitating. 

427
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:47,470
 We can't guarantee she'll be able to walk again. 

428
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,260
 We will do our best, 

429
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:53,410
 but rehabilitation depends on the patient's will. 

430
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:03,410
♫  The day I wept freely, surrendering all my pain and struggles  ♫

431
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:12,750
♫  We loved all those days  ♫

432
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:19,260
♫  Back then, we were too young to know our hearts were racing  ♫

433
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:23,270
   

434
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,300
♫  We just argued and delayed things without knowing why  ♫

435
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,980
   

436
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:39,180
♫  Maybe we didn’t understand the meaning of love  ♫

437
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,930
♫  We just couldn’t say it  ♫

438
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:44,960
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail– 

439
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:55,110
♫  Maybe we didn’t understand the meaning of goodbye either  ♫

440
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:58,760
♫  We just believed  ♫

441
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:05,370
♫  we didn't want to let go of each other  ♫

442
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:13,500
♫  While carrying the warmth of our memories in our hearts  ♫

443
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,870
You're up already?

444
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,540
It's not time to go to school yet.

445
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:30,230
Oppa, I'm sorry for throwing a tantrum at the hospital.

446
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,990
You didn't eat it and held on to it?

447
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,900
This, too.

448
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,960
It's from my birthday.

449
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,800
I'll let you make a wish with this.

450
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,040
Make a wish!

451
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,840
I did.

452
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,850
You have to say it.

453
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:57,920
You must say it out loud so it can come true.

454
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,110
Who will listen?

455
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:02,090
I don't know, but you have to say it.

456
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,800
That's what they taught me at school.

457
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:06,280
On my birthday, I said,

458
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:09,170
"Please give me a Secret Doll!"

459
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:12,450
And I really got a Secret Doll!

460
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:17,160
I guess someone was there to listen to your wish.

461
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,950
No one's here to listen to my wish.

462
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:24,510
Why not?

463
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:33,290
There never was.

464
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:57,110
Dad, Dad. Dad!

465
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:00,810
Dad! Kim San Ha's coming home tomorrow!

466
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,260
"Tomorrow"? He's coming tomorrow?

467
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,750
Yeah.

468
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,100
Why isn't he answering?

469
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:14,010
He should be back by now after preparations.

470
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,700
Where did he go, leaving the door open?

471
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,580
Is he in the bathroom?

472
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,000
- Dad! 
 - Dad!

473
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,210
I'm fine. I'm fine.

474
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:52,020
I was just...

475
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,480
I was just dizzy for a moment.

476
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,100
Dad, what's wrong?

477
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:01,670
I'm fine.

478
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,430
I said I'm fine.

479
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,440
Aigoo, I'm fine.

480
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,850
Dad!

481
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,520
Dad, are you okay?

482
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,430
Do you recognize me?

483
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:28,080
Where am I? The hospital?

484
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,040
You're okay. The doctor said it was fatigue.

485
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,330
You don't have to be admitted.

486
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:35,130
You just have to finish the I.V. and rest at home.

487
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:38,480
What fatigue? I haven't even done anything.

488
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,470
You kept closing the store late.

489
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:45,620
What about school?

490
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,370
Is school important right now?

491
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,410
How could you miss school?

492
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,430
It'll become habitual once you miss a day.

493
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,760
Hey, you can go to school.

494
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,120
I'll stay here.

495
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,930
No, I want to stay, too.

496
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:00,810
I'll text you on the way home after the I.V.

497
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:02,350
You should go.

498
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:04,550
What use will you be here?

499
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,690
Ahjusshi will be here soon, too.

500
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:10,040
Dad has to lie down in the car. There won't be any room.

501
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,660
Then you go, Kang Hae Joon.

502
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,900
I don't need to since I only have academic counseling.

503
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,420
Go. Okay?

504
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,940
You should at least receive the attendance award.

505
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,890
Then go home and rest, okay?

506
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:32,710
I'll come straight home after school.

507
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,320
Step on it. It's time for the lunch crowd.

508
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,110
How can you say that?

509
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,760
The lunch crowd has grown recently.

510
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,630
Some are from the nearby construction site.

511
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,500
What if they come in vain?

512
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,060
Why do you keep overworking these days?

513
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,540
Including your prep time at dawn,

514
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:16,100
you spend almost 20 hours at the store.

515
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:19,250
See? Even he thinks you're overdoing it.

516
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,900
I take a break midway, though.

517
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,880
Then stop by the store for a moment.

518
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:29,620
I should put up a sign saying we're closed for the day, so they'll come tomorrow.

519
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,200
I can do that myself.

520
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,730
Why trouble yourself? I can just go and–

521
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,980
Ahjusshi, please drop me off here.

522
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,150
I can run from here.

523
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,190
 Is he hungry for money? 

524
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,590
He should have enough money.

525
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,930
Why are you exerting yourself these days?

526
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:16,740
You know the schools on the pamphlets?

527
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,060
I think they're good.

528
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,860
Is that why you suddenly extended store hours and caused this mess?

529
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,000
Did you even ask him if he wants to go to America?

530
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,040
Not a chance. How can I afford to send him to America?

531
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,770
Forget 10 p.m. I can't send him even if I work until midnight.

532
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:39,950
Yes, that's why I couldn't even ask if he wanted to go to America.

533
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:43,260
I couldn't ask him because I can't send him.

534
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,640
If you can't send him to America,

535
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,920
then stop working late!

536
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,340
What are you doing, beating your body up?

537
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:58,920
Stop overreacting. The doctor said it's just fatigue.

538
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,280
Quit it! Just quit it! Geez!

539
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,680
The meds cost even more!

540
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,320
Geez, I'm not deaf.

541
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:08,860
You're too harsh on someone who just got back from the hospital.

542
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:16,580
 That's why I need to get it together and save every penny possible. 

543
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:19,060
 Then just send him. 

544
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:21,810
 How will you continue to face Hae Joon? 

545
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:25,070
 Can you face him every day while regretting 
    

546
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:27,550
 not having sent him to America? 

547
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,830
What are you doing here?

548
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:02,700
What about Dad?

549
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:09,600
Why? Did he faint again?

550
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:12,390
He didn't. Go upstairs.

551
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:13,890
Here.

552
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:17,130
I'm going out for a while.

553
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:18,840
Where to?

554
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,250
Seok Hoon asked to see me.

555
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,730
Who's Seok Hoon?

556
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,260
His best friend from the basketball team.

557
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,280
It seemed like they had something to discuss.

558
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,410
Do you feel better?

559
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,500
You have healing hands.

560
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,300
See? I'm fine! Nothing's wrong with me.

561
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:56,290
If you don't go to America,

562
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:59,890
your dad will regret it every time he sees you.

563
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:02,050
Isn't that what you're saying?

564
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,890
When did I ever say that?

565
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:05,680
That's what you just told me.

566
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,590
I'm summarizing what you said.

567
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,210
Geez!

568
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:13,440
Hey, just hit me!

569
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,040
Hit me and go to America.

570
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:25,190
I wasn't going to say this, but...

571
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:29,070
what else would you do here other than spend your dad's money?

572
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:33,270
Tell your birth dad to provide the money.

573
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,920
He hasn't spent a penny until now. Tell him to cough it up.

574
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,590
Use that money to study and make it big.

575
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:41,330
Then, return to fulfill your filial duty.

576
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:44,390
That's like buy one, get one free (BOGO).

577
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:48,890
Gosh, I suck at math!

578
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:52,050
W-Was that considered math?

579
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:54,860
BOGO is arithmetic.

580
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,700
I know that!

581
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,760
I know...

582
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,580
that I'm just baggage.

583
00:45:09,310 --> 00:45:11,880
But I still don't want to go.

584
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,410
I want to stay.

585
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,810
I want to stay.

586
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,280
Are you crying?

587
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,960
I'm not.

588
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,990
Cry in America if you're going to.

589
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:36,220
Do you think you can make money here or pursue academics?

590
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,320
What can you do properly?

591
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:43,910
There's nothing you can do here.

592
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:50,390
We will be 20 years old next year.

593
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:54,940
Just playing basketball every day and going to the snack bar. That's over.

594
00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:00,670
Escape from this rural town while you can.

595
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:03,250
Aren't you staying in this rural town?

596
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:07,830
I'm a country boy down to my bones.

597
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:11,690
I like this rural town.

598
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,090
Whoa...

599
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:36,800
 Oh, good, good! 

600
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,110
 - Enjoy. 
 - Yes. 

601
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,590
 I'll do that. 

602
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,770
 There's nothing for you to do here. 

603
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:48,960
 Tell your birth dad to provide the money. 

604
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,570
 Use that money to study and make it big. 

605
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:53,870
 Then, return to fulfil your filial duty. 

606
00:46:55,470 --> 00:46:58,300
I'll do it. Get some rest.

607
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:00,780
 I said I'll do it. 

608
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,940
Try talking to Dad.

609
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:14,040
I'm telling him to rest, but he insists on running the dinner business.

610
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,680
He won't any longer.

611
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,310
He won't?

612
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:19,690
I'll stay here, so you can go home.

613
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,870
Shall we head home?

614
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,000
What's wrong?

615
00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:04,910
Why is my son...

616
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:09,430
so irritated today?

617
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:15,400
I'll follow that Ahjusshi to America.

618
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,730
What?

619
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:21,430
That Ahjusshi...

620
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:26,820
I'll go with my birth dad.

621
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:32,800
What are you saying all of a sudden?

622
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,690
Why would you follow that Ahjusshi?

623
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:38,950
Did he come by and say something to you again?

624
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:41,790
He spoke to you, too.

625
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:44,580
He said he'd take me to play basketball in America.

626
00:48:45,990 --> 00:48:49,570
You also said the townspeople talked to you...

627
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,430
and brought up America.

628
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:58,040
You met him that day?

629
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:09,250
But I never meant...

630
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:13,510
you had to go with that Ahjusshi.

631
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:15,420
You don't have to.

632
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:22,260
If you choose to go, I'll send you.

633
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:29,810
You said you can't.

634
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:33,730
 Forget 10 p.m. I can't send him even if I work until midnight. 

635
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,440
 Yes, that's why I couldn't even ask if he wanted to go to America. 

636
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,660
 I couldn't ask him because I can't send him. 

637
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,370
Well, that was...

638
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:56,190
So...

639
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:59,800
I just have to go.

640
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,300
No, Hae Joon.

641
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,970
I always whine to Ahjusshi.

642
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:14,360
Those were just empty words.

643
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,850
Ahjusshi listens to me, so I was just whining.

644
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:19,790
Don't worry about it.

645
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,140
After I leave...

646
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:36,210
don't overexert yourself.

647
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,850
I don't want you to suffer.

648
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:47,500
Say you won't overwork, so I won't have to worry in America.

649
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:03,470
Let's go. Joo Won will whine about us being late.

650
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:41,830
Dad, you're up early.

651
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:45,680
I said let's order jjajangmyeon (Black bean sauce noodles).

652
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:48,940
He's coming home after all this time. How can I feed him store-bought food?

653
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,650
Then tell me what to buy. I'll go and get it.

654
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:55,540
It's fine. I need to choose the good ingredients myself.

655
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:59,010
Don't tell San Ha I was in the hospital.

656
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:00,560
He will worry needlessly.

657
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,660
But Dad, there are no secrets in this house.

658
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:06,400
You're right.

659
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:08,210
Get more sleep.

660
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:43,510
 Where are you? 

661
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:45,090
   

662
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:47,200
 Daejeon. 

663
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:49,090
Still?

664
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:16,930
You said you were in Daejeon!

665
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:19,650
- I lied. 
 - Why would you lie?

666
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:22,990
So you would be glad to see me sooner than you expected.

667
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:25,340
Have you been well?

668
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,000
I've been well.

669
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,290
Everyone has been well,

670
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:32,400
but Dad fainted and went to the hospital yesterday.

671
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:35,330
And now? Is he better?

672
00:53:35,330 --> 00:53:37,770
Yeah, he will get better with rest.

673
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:42,000
He even went grocery shopping this morning to make you breakfast.

674
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,280
He shouldn't overdo it.

675
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,740
- What? 
 - It's good to see you after all this time.

676
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:58,410
It has only been a few days.

677
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,570
- Let's go. 
 - Okay.

678
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,210
I can just eat what we have with roasted laver.

679
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,400
There are no secrets here.

680
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,340
I'll be quick. I'm not making much.

681
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:28,230
Wait a minute.

682
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:32,580
Someone has to go buy some eggs.

683
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:33,930
Okay.

684
00:54:33,930 --> 00:54:36,460
Rock, paper, scissors–

685
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,300
- What the heck? 
 - What?

686
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:43,480
Rock, paper, scissors, say shoot!

687
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,580
I always lose these things.

688
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,650
I'll be back!

689
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:50,580
Dad, just a pack of eggs, right?

690
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:53,640
Hey.

691
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,630
What is it?

692
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:20,000
Is it about your birth dad?

693
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:25,230
You're sharp as always.

694
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:27,500
What else could it be?

695
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,950
What is it?

696
00:55:36,950 --> 00:55:39,410
I have something to say, too. Make it quick.

697
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,680
You do? What is it?

698
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,920
You, first.

699
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:54,060
- Well... 
 - What?

700
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,400
Did he ask you to go with him to America again?

701
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,300
Did you become a fortune teller in Seoul?

702
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,570
I don't have to. I can see right through you.

703
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:07,220
Tell him you won't go.

704
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:11,670
Even if he pursues it legally, you'll be an adult next year.

705
00:56:11,670 --> 00:56:13,750
You don't have to go with him.

706
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,190
I decided to go.

707
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,390
Does Ahjusshi know this?

708
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,410
You can't.

709
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,300
I'll return in no time.

710
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,400
- Before you graduate college– 
 - I'm leaving, too.

711
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:54,440
What?

712
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,050
We can't both leave.

713
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:00,660
- Dad, the eggs! 
 - Okay.

714
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:03,630
- Crack a bunch in the bowl. 
 - Okay.

715
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:12,530
Ahjusshi's not coming home until dinner?

716
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:15,240
Yes, what can he do? It's his job.

717
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,940
I have a bitter taste in my mouth.

718
00:57:23,850 --> 00:57:25,150
How is it?

719
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,090
What do you think?

720
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:29,240
It's delicious!

721
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:32,440
It's almost done. Tell them to come down.

722
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:35,800
Okay. It's so tasty.

723
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:42,550
I can't stay here.

724
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:47,140
He'd feel bad he couldn't send me to America whenever he sees me.

725
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:50,130
I can't do that to Dad.

726
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:51,990
I have to go.

727
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,700
Are you confident?

728
00:57:56,700 --> 00:58:00,560
Are you sure you can be happy in America, where you don't know a soul?

729
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:03,290
Why couldn't I?

730
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:06,230
- Do you think you'd be fine away from here? 
 - Yeah.

731
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:08,840
I'll go and live my best life.

732
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:12,350
Anyone can see that you should be the one to stay.

733
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:14,710
Ahjusshi will feel bad?

734
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:16,170
So what?

735
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:17,990
Then, you be good to him.

736
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:20,600
- Don't you think you can? 
 - Hey!

737
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,350
Ahjusshi raised you with such devotion.

738
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:27,070
He raised someone else's child without any blood relation whatsoever.

739
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:31,200
Now what? You're going to follow your birth dad?

740
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,220
Are you even human?

741
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:33,720
That's not why I'm leaving!

742
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,400
That's how it looks to other people!

743
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:45,530
Can you truly deny it?

744
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:48,540
Honestly, when you first met that Ahjusshi,

745
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,960
did you never once think you'd be able to

746
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,290
live off your rich dad?

747
00:58:57,590 --> 00:58:59,490
I dare you to say that again.

748
00:59:00,390 --> 00:59:05,020
Live off your rich dad.

749
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,030
Then, should we both leave?

750
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:20,240
Why are you fighting?

751
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:30,030


752
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,060
What do you mean?

753
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,600
Where are you two going?

754
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:46,540
How much...

755
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,890
How much of it did you hear?

756
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:55,040
When you started saying, "I'll live my best life."

757
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:00,090
And that you'll follow your birth dad.

758
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,360
Did I hear wrong?

759
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:10,820
No.

760
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:12,850
You heard right.

761
01:00:12,850 --> 01:00:15,110
Hey!

762
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:17,020
I'll go to Seoul,

763
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:20,070
and Kang Hae Joon will go to America with his birth dad.

764
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:21,280
I was going to tell you today, anyway.

765
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:23,890
Why must you put it like that?

766
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:27,800
They'll find out sooner or later. What's the point of lying?

767
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,920
Did I tell you to lie? Just don't say it like that!

768
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:34,390
Then how exactly should I say it?

769
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:36,150
That won't change anything.

770
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:39,360
Will you stay here? Will you not leave?

771
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,870
So...

772
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:48,810
both of you are leaving home?

773
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,000
So,

774
01:00:54,780 --> 01:01:00,680
both of you will go to your real families?

775
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:14,800
♫  Even if you don't say where it hurts, I know  ♫

776
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:28,700
♫  Like a wildflower growing on its own, the love I've kept hidden hurts  ♫

777
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:31,300
   

778
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:32,820
 Distance makes the heart grow fonder. 

779
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:35,540
 When I return, I'll never leave again. 

780
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:37,240
 Don't try too hard over there. 

781
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,600
 Come back once you think you've done enough. 

782
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:44,360
 Who'd return to this rural town with a college degree? 

783
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,750
 Some weirdo keeps loitering around your store. 

784
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:49,570
 He sounds suspicious, so be careful. 

785
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:52,990
 Yoon Joo Won. Are you okay? Are you hurt? 

786
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:55,150
 How could they act like nothing happened? 

787
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:57,890
 She said she'd never date her bakery customers. 

788
01:01:57,890 --> 01:02:00,370
 What will I do if Joo Won ends up meeting that Hyungnim? 

789
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:02,710
 Can we talk for a moment?
