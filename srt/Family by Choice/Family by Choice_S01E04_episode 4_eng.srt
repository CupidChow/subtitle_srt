1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:12,190


2
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,990
   

3
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,110
   

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,610
   

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,800
   

6
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,720
   

7
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,110
   

8
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,950
 Food is ready! 

9
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,890
I'll be right there!

10
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,890
Let's eat breakfast.

11
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,300
You didn't sleep, did you?

12
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,500
- Your eyes are swollen. 
 - They're also red.

13
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,720
Considering how I maintain top grades, this much is expected.

14
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,270
You can't lose any more weight. You should eat well.

15
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,690
Okay.

16
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,970
Hey! Five minutes left! Five minutes!

17
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:02,500
- The bus. The bus! 
 - Hey, hey.

18
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,980
- Slowly. 
 - Hurry, hurry.

19
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,460
Have one more. One more. One more!

20
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,470
Wait for me.

21
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,450
- Hurry up. 
 - Thanks for the food! We are off!

22
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,000
- Aigoo, all right. Have a good day! 
 - Okay!

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,350
We are leaving now!

24
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:18,880
   

25
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,840
Dating, my foot. You don't even know who it is.

26
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,400
- I can find out. 
 - You should decide after you find out.

27
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,450
What if he's 160 cm tall and weighs 100 kg?

28
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:31,860
Judging someone by their looks makes you look bad.

29
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,530
Come on. Say something to her.

30
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,070
- Let her be. 
 - What?

31
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,240
What a beautiful day.

32
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,580
It's the perfect weather to start a romance.

33
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,700
- Hello. 
 - Hi.

34
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,330
- What? 
 - I found out!

35
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,380
What?

36
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,580
"X."

37
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,140
Who is it?

38
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,810
What do we do if it's a weirdo?

39
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:24,700
Do you know why Romeo and Juliet were ready to die for their love?

40
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:28,160
- Why? 
 - Because everyone around them...

41
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,030
tried to tear them apart.

42
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,150
Wait for me!

43
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:39,260
 Who is it? How did you find out? 

44
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,480
 Jae In and Ki Woon saw him on their morning date. 

45
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,460
 Wow! A date at school, first thing in the morning? 

46
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,110
 They came super early to be alone, but someone was already there. 

47
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,200
 At the time, they just thought of him as a nuisance, but... 
   

48
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,070
 - But? 
 - Oh, sorry. 

49
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:59,050
 They got another good look at him and realized who he was. 

50
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,570
You know Hae Joon's younger sister, Joo Won?

51
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,270
I found out who left the letter on her desk.

52
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,870
Really? Who is it?

53
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,400
What's up?

54
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,020
Oh, my!

55
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,080
It's Kang Hae Joon!

56
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,830
He's the class president, he's intelligent, and I heard he's even handsome and tall.

57
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,730
He even gave a speech at the entrance ceremony as the top student.

58
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,480
We don't need to separate them.

59
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,490
Good for her.

60
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,010
What?

61
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,690
We must see him with our own eyes to feel at ease.

62
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,150
He's in Grade 10, Class 2.

63
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,510
His smiling face...

64
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,810
is more than pretty.

65
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,950
You're certain, right? Can I ask him now?

66
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,810
There are witnesses.

67
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,400
This might be impulsive,

68
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,590
but I won't back out.

69
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,660
You found out it was me?

70
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:46,780
I was going to tell you after I prepared myself.

71
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:51,660
We saved time, so it worked out.

72
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,470
Are you free to go out to eat today?

73
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,030
- With you? 
 - Yes.

74
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,810
Sure.

75
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,500
Shall we?

76
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,580
Not bad.

77
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,630
Not bad at all.

78
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,930
Here you go. Enjoy.

79
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,900
- Spicy? 
 - What?

80
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,360
- Is it spicy? 
 - Yes.

81
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,870
- It's spicy. 
 - It is.

82
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,350
How spicy.

83
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:54,010
So spicy.

84
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,260
I'm full, though.

85
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,380
Eat up.

86
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,250
- Joo Won! 
 - Yes.

87
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,740
Drink up.

88
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,780
How can people eat cake?

89
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,060
It's too sweet for me.

90
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,410
I thought your bus station was on the other side.

91
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:46,630
I can go after seeing you off.

92
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,990
I think you grew up so bright and cheerful.

93
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,660
I get that a lot.

94
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,230
My mom said a person's family environment is really important.

95
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,140
However, that feels like a stereotype when applied to you.

96
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,410
Why? I have an incredible family environment.

97
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,650
Aren't you from a single-parent household?

98
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,910
Is having a single parent considered a bad family environment?

99
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,640
- Do you have both a mom and a dad? 
 - What?

100
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,400
I do. Most people do.

101
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,750
Do you have an oppa?

102
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,690
Do you mean a "hyung"?

103
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,760
No, I'm an only child.

104
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,960
I have two oppas.

105
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,400
So, don't I have a better family environment?

106
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,420
I have a higher headcount.

107
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:39,420
"H-Headcount"?

108
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,110
What's wrong with not having a mom? Is that my sole identity?

109
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:47,700
Would you like if I said, "Wow! Being an only child, you must be extremely lonely."

110
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:53,490
"You must've grown up to be self-centered with a bad personality, but you turned out quite well."

111
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,990
No.

112
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,820
No need to see me off.

113
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,340
From now on, act like you don't know me.

114
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:28,750
 So, haven't you heard from your mom yet? 

115
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,930
 - No. 
 - What an interesting bunch you are. 

116
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:33,420
 I know. 

117
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,560
 My goodness, you're all so unfortunate. 

118
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,270
 My mom said a person's family environment is really important. 

119
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,640
 Aren't you from a single-parent household? 

120
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,660
It isn't that we don't have a good family environment.

121
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,920
Each of us...

122
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:57,320
is special.

123
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:22,000
He has a good personality, so he has tons of friends.

124
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,150
He's good-looking and he's as tall as I am!

125
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,180
- Oh. 
 - I see.

126
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,040
Where did such a nice kid come from?

127
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,360
One would think you're the one with a boyfriend.

128
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,730
What? Don't you like him?

129
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,640
Don't judge a book by its cover.

130
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,240
It must be going well since it's late and she isn't home.

131
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,300
Yoon Joo Won hit the jackpot!

132
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,160
Call Joo Won and ask if she's almost home.

133
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,650
All right.

134
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,400
I'm home!

135
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,980
Wow...

136
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,950
Thank you for the food!

137
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,270
I thought you ate out.

138
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,320
We had tteokbokki. I have more room for rice.

139
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,120
Why are you home already?

140
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,430
I guess you didn't really like him.

141
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,600
What's there not to like? What happened?

142
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,380
- We decided to pretend it never happened. 
 - Why?

143
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,550
Why would you do that?

144
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,200
Did...

145
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,640
Did you stuff your face with food in front of him?

146
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:30,480
Then what?

147
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:33,680
He doesn't like sweet things.

148
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,240
Tteokbokki?

149
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,040
 Sure, you can rinse it in water. 

150
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,410
Carrots in kimbap?

151
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:41,970
 You can pick them out. But... 

152
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,520
he doesn't eat cake.

153
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:52,080
There was cake right in front of us!

154
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,610
That place is known for its cakes.

155
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:57,250
Can you believe it? Well, can you?

156
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:00,290
Right? Unbelievable, isn't it?

157
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,250
- What? 
 - Do you call that a valid reason?

158
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,550
Seeing how picky you are, you're far from being ready for a relationship.

159
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:14,730
Why? That kid lacks sense.

160
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,820
- Right? 
 - Yes.

161
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,500
Are you serious?

162
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,210
You can date him if you like him so much.

163
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,970
- Is that it? 
 - Yes.

164
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,740
That's all.

165
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:38,040
 - You said you'd be satisfied with a pretty smile.  
 - Yes.

166
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:42,640
- You said he was more than pretty! 
 - Yes.

167
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,610
- I heard you rejected Joon Ho. 
 - What high standards.

168
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:49,390
It's because she hangs out with her oppas.

169
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,130
I can't believe someone like Joo Won dumped him.

170
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,920
Lee Joon Ho isn't like he used to be.

171
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,360
What's so bad about someone like Joo Won?

172
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,760
One would think each of you is in a relationship.

173
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,280
Hey, what's wrong with Joo Won?

174
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,130
It's fine. Don't.

175
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,630
Hey, it's Lee Joon Ho.

176
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,640
- Lee Joon Ho is here. 
 - Why? Why did he come?

177
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,020
- Didn't she reject him? 
 - What's happening?

178
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,110
It's Lee Joon Ho.

179
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,830
It was my fault.

180
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,210
We can start by being friends.

181
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,160
Please reconsider.

182
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,410
Did you tell anyone about what you said at the bus stop?

183
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,390
If you didn't tell anyone, I'll think about it.

184
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,250
"Bus stop"?

185
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,200
What happened?

186
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,890
Nothing much.

187
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,650
What happened?

188
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,670
Friends, my foot.

189
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,900
Don't give him false hope and just make it clear to him.

190
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,890
I'll take care of it. Mind your own business.

191
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:33,870
You told me to tell you everything. You should do the same.

192
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:38,010
I meant, let's talk about it, not meddle in each other's business.

193
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,680
You didn't answer your phone.

194
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,660
Go ahead.

195
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,760
You look the same. I recognized you right away.

196
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,350
You must be surprised that I showed up unexpectedly.

197
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,330
You called ahead, so I'm not surprised.

198
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,250
You're as sharp as ever.

199
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,840
If I didn't pick up,

200
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,180
you should be sharp enough to know it was intentional.

201
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,830
I've been quite distant all this time. I understand if you're disappointed.

202
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,250
"Disappointed"?

203
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,490
You haven't contacted me in ten years.

204
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:17,900
You didn't answer my calls, either.

205
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,250
I'm staying in Busan until winter.

206
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,950
I'm nearby, so I'll bring So Hui for a visit.

207
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,700
Oh, right. You've never met So Hui, right?

208
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,660
She's seven years old.

209
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,220
How can two siblings not have seen each other at all? That's absurd.

210
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,380
- Right? 
 - Don't say it like it isn't your fault.

211
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,570
You had no intention of introducing us.

212
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,990
Wow, they look exactly the same.

213
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:52,580
How? They don't look alike at all.

214
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,570
Why did you bring me here?

215
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,230
So we can save him if we need to.

216
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,460
Save him from what?

217
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,890
Let's get out of here and not interfere.

218
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,920
You can leave by yourself. I'll stay!

219
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,420
Do what you want!

220
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,860
What's his problem?

221
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,360
Must you treat me like this even after ten years?

222
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,470
Exactly.

223
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,120
Why did you suddenly appear after ten years?

224
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,210
To forgive you.

225
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,830
I want to try to forgive you.

226
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,700
Forgive me for what?

227
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,660
 Don't say anything you'll regret later. 

228
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,190
Kids who mistreat their parents reap what they sow.

229
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,740
Say what to whom? Why?

230
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,400
"Reap what they sow"?

231
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,780
Will I be punished if I don't welcome my mom, who abandoned me?

232
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,480
"Forgive"?

233
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,470
- What sin did I commit against you? 
 - Will you continue to feign ignorance?

234
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,070
You and So Jeong...

235
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:31,280
It was just the two of you.

236
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,110
 You know that San Ha was there, too. 

237
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,180
 He was alone with So Jeong. 

238
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,280
 What was he doing then? 

239
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,930
How dare you...

240
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,830
talk about So Jeong?

241
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,010
Why did you make me?

242
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,330
If you're done talking, I'll get to the point.

243
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:06,810
Grandma calls me too often.

244
00:20:06,810 --> 00:20:10,350
I want her to call less. That's what I came here to say.

245
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,790
Do you think she'll listen to me?

246
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:18,840
I hope you...

247
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,600
live a happy and good life.

248
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,930
Are you okay?

249
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,330
I'm okay.

250
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,030
I wish...

251
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,800
I could live a happy and good life.

252
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:43,650
 No one is here. No one is here! 

253
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:13,200
I didn't see it coming.

254
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,600
Is that all you have to say? Do you want to die?

255
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,920
You just saved me, so why would you kill me?

256
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:25,270
Don't smile. How can you smile right now?

257
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,880
Look.

258
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,760
Look at me tearing up from the shock.

259
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,930
- How old are you, crying in the street? 
 - Whose fault is that?

260
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:42,940
Even a kindergartener knows you don't cross at a red light.

261
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,210
You couldn't even tell it was a red light.

262
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:50,130
You recklessly tried to cross the street! You're the one!

263
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,310
You're going to tear my uniform.

264
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:58,600
What did Ahjumma say?

265
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:03,330
We agreed to tell each other everything.

266
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:05,610
We agreed not to keep secrets.

267
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,940
She scolded me.

268
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,610
What did she scold you about?

269
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:18,040
She said I'll be punished.

270
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,530
“Punished”?

271
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:25,970
Well, she's right. You always tease me and Kang Hae Joon.

272
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,550
You even teased me about my report card.

273
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,980
If you tease people like that, you'll be punished.

274
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,640
Forget that. I hope you get punished!

275
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,700
I used up all my calories saving your life.

276
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,710
Shall we go eat some cake?

277
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,920
Hamburgers first.

278
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,050
- Is it good? 
 - Yes.

279
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,160
Have one at a time.

280
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:17,780
♫  There was a time when I was filled with hopes about my dream  ♫

281
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,300
Should we get this one?

282
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,760
This one?

283
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,950
That one?

284
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,530
- Let's get this one. 
 - Yes, that one.

285
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,030
- Is it good? 
 - This place is super famous.

286
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,960
People come from far away to eat here. This is crazy.

287
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,940
♫  Back then, we were the world  ♫

288
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,980
What do you think?

289
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,090
I like it.

290
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:57,020
Not "I like it."

291
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,000
"It's delicious!"

292
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,980
Yes, it's delicious.

293
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,350
♫  We were dazzling and were so united  ♫

294
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,090
It's delicious.

295
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,950
I told him to leave because he was getting sand everywhere!

296
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,120
Yes, of course.

297
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,470
- I didn't know! I shook the sand off before I stepped in! 
 - Exactly.

298
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:22,450
I'm sick of this! He made a mess!

299
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,700
- I can't stand her! 
 - Take care.

300
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,710
Aigoo, he left.

301
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,310
- Thank you. Bye. 
 - No problem.

302
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,920
Go inside now.

303
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,440
Why do their feelings get hurt so easily?

304
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,040
I'm glad it didn't escalate any further.

305
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:48,370
It's odd. Just having someone listen calms them down.

306
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,980
Someone's standing over there.

307
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:01,960
Hello!

308
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,900
How can I help you?

309
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,430
Well...

310
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,580
Did you eat?

311
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,540
I'm hungry.

312
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:44,500
This is the best restaurant around here.

313
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,850
Everything is produced locally.

314
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:50,610
See that? It's all produced locally.

315
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,500
What brings you all the way here?

316
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,740
My husband opened a hospital branch in Busan.

317
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,760
We decided to move down here until it gets settled.

318
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,520
Really?

319
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,770
Yes. Since So Hui is in kindergarten,

320
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:16,690
she and I were going to stay in Seoul, but my husband said the family shouldn't live apart.

321
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,740
If possible, a family should indeed live together.

322
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,570
You did well.

323
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,420
I just met San Ha.

324
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,960
I told him I wanted to see him from now on.

325
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,130
What did he say?

326
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:52,500
Did you think he would be happy to see you?

327
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:55,300
I'm doing this for San Ha's sake.

328
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,180
Think about his future, too. He's in Grade 12 now. Will you do nothing?

329
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,380
If I take San Ha with me to Seoul, I can get him admissions consultations–

330
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:06,100
How can you say that after abandoning him like that?

331
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,880
San Ha can understand me now at his age.

332
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,930
Did you get older and suddenly understand everything about life?

333
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:14,980
Did you suddenly understand people you couldn't before?

334
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,180
What? "A family shouldn't live apart"?

335
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:26,020
Married couples become strangers once they divorce.

336
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,210
But what about their children?

337
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:32,260
When you left to save yourself, did you think of San Ha as your child?

338
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,840
He might not say it, but he waited...

339
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,900
- waited for your call— 
 - He has become so brash, unlike before.

340
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,230
Should he be an angel and wait on your every word?

341
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:46,180
Why? Why must only San Ha understand you?

342
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,060
Can't you try to understand San Ha?

343
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:53,840
If you're his mom, can't you say, "He has a good reason for acting that way"?

344
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,380
Be it love or hate, we are parent and child!

345
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,910
- Why not say so ten years ago? 
 - What can I do about something in the past?

346
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:05,400
Aigoo, how convenient for you. I wish I was like you in that regard!

347
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:43,500
Won't you just leave San Ha alone?

348
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,720
He still wakes up in the middle of the night.

349
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,550
Crap!

350
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,870
 The child's opinion is important, 
   

351
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:02,410
 but the biological father is at a legal advantage. 

352
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,530
This isn't easy.

353
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,120
Would you like some jujubes?

354
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,870
What do you do with jujubes?

355
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,280
It's 3,000 won. I'll give you plenty.

356
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,730
Okay.

357
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,300
Yes.

358
00:30:56,590 --> 00:31:00,110
I have a date today.

359
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,980
Go on. I'll take care of him.

360
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,080
Mr. Yoon.

361
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:19,320
His ex-wife came by today.

362
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,250
Okay.

363
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,250
Jujubes.

364
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,500
San Ha can't sleep these days.

365
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,840
She said you can sleep through the night after a glass of brewed jujubes.

366
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,160
Aigoo, thank you.

367
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,260
Both Hae Joon and San Ha will be adults in college next year.

368
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,610
Why all the fuss now?

369
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,710
Did she meet San Ha, too?

370
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,540
Is he okay?

371
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,460
I didn't ask him.

372
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,820
Why didn't you?

373
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:30,350
He and I have an unspoken rule.

374
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,960
We don't needlessly mention his mom.

375
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,500
Well, now's the time.

376
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,980
Why don't you talk to each other about important things?

377
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,260
How can he rely on his dad

378
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,930
when you keep avoiding things?

379
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,100
Avoiding what?

380
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:02,460
Whose fault is it that he's forced to be an adult before he's 20?

381
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,680
Sit down with San Ha and have a proper conversation.

382
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:10,010
Talk about what? I have nothing to ask him.

383
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,420
Are you interrogating a criminal?

384
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,930
Or conducting an interview?

385
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:17,310
Just ask him how he feels and if he's okay.

386
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:21,290
Simply asking the child will probably ease his mind.

387
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,620
Your job is to listen to the entire town's woes.

388
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,680
Why can't you listen to your own child?

389
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,430
Do you understand?

390
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,620
Geez, I understand.

391
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,430
Don't embarrass yourself and get up. Let's go.

392
00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:48,530
- Take care. 
 - Thank you.

393
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,370
Aren't you coming?

394
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,160
I'll assume you'll follow.

395
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,100
Mom!

396
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,790
So Hui!

397
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,650
How was your first day at kindergarten?

398
00:34:24,650 --> 00:34:26,030
Did you have fun?

399
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,540
What did Oppa say?

400
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,610
Did he say I can visit him?

401
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,880
Oppa will be surprised if you visit him so suddenly.

402
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:36,210
I gave Oppa a heads-up that So Hui wants to see him.

403
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,590
Does Oppa want to see So Hui, too?

404
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,010
Of course!

405
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:52,260
If it's too bitter, you can add some water.

406
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:55,240
But if you add too much, you'll go to the bathroom often at night.

407
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,880
What about Ahjusshi? Doesn't he get any?

408
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,140
Forget him.

409
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,140
He will stop drinking once he gets a sour stomach.

410
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:07,100
This won't do. Have a glass right now.

411
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:22,390
Why did he drink all of a sudden?

412
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:24,920
She also visited him, didn't she?

413
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,550
Ahjumma?

414
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,660
What did she say to Ahjusshi?

415
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,070
What did she say that he drank so much?

416
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,350
That isn't your business.

417
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,740
That's for Ahjusshi and San Ha to discuss.

418
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,640
It's better if everyone discusses it together.

419
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,720
Is it that bad for a mom to visit her son?

420
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,070
Why are you mad?

421
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:46,120
Me? I'm not mad.

422
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:51,110
I told Mom not to look for me anymore.

423
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:54,020
I'll tell Dad that, too.

424
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,300
Well, even so...

425
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,880
Happy, now?

426
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:19,100
Let them talk it out.

427
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,110
Hae Joon just misses his mom. That's why.

428
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,380
Happy with what?

429
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,340
Tell me! Well?

430
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,260
What should I be happy about?

431
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:33,310
There's no need to be jealous.

432
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:35,600
Why would I be jealous of you?

433
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,900
Exactly. I said there's no need to be jealous.

434
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,150
Mom still blames me for So Jeong's death,

435
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,220
and I want her to keep believing that.

436
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,530
So she can continue to blame me.

437
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,870
I'm sure she had her reason for not being home for two days.

438
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:01,950
And she doesn't care that we didn't have anything to eat. I just...

439
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:08,240
I just want her to keep believing what she believes.

440
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,420
What if I continue to see her?

441
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:19,680
What if I break down and tell her everything?

442
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,720
Even so, she's your mom.

443
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,270
- And you're her son. 
 - In this world,

444
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:33,060
toxic families also exist.

445
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:35,750
My mom and I are like that.

446
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:39,840
Sorry.

447
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:43,460
Were you happy your dad found you?

448
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,310
Did you think, "We are still father and son"?

449
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,630
There's nothing to be jealous about.

450
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:57,140
You always erase the tiniest bit of apology I feel by acting distant.

451
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,570
Leave.

452
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,640
Give me a break.

453
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,470
Saying that in front of someone who can't even remember her mom's face.

454
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,510
Let's get some ice cream.

455
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,190
What?

456
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,290
You two have a blast.

457
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,260
Leave him be.

458
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,140
Eating ice cream together won't change anything.

459
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,720
Then what will?

460
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,430
Sugar when you're down.

461
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:46,920
It's therapy for everybody.

462
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,220
How do you feel now? Better?

463
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,650
Yes.

464
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:58,110
Dad said Hae Joon just misses his mom.

465
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,900
I know.

466
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,410
You do?

467
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:05,370
That's why he answers every spam call.

468
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,830
Just in case.

469
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,490
That's true.

470
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:12,870
How does he plan to survive in this harsh world?

471
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:16,270
You're worried about him.

472
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:19,260
Just a heads up. You don't have to worry about me.

473
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,930
Even if people call us unfortunate and such,

474
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,120
it doesn't affect me one bit.

475
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,140
"Cheerful for someone who doesn't have a mom"?

476
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:29,200
That doesn't bother me at all.

477
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:34,180
Should I remember I don't have a mom and cry when I see something funny?

478
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,220
That's ridiculous.

479
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,650
- What? 
 - Who said you're cheerful for someone without a mom?

480
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,330
That was just an example.

481
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,340
You know that I naturally smile often.

482
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,610
That's good stuff.

483
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,810
Ahjusshi made that just for me.

484
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,530
Really?

485
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:12,620
There's more at Joo Won's house.

486
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,530
- I can get more. 
 - Okay.

487
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,500
Good night.

488
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,590
Well...

489
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:22,880
is there anything that's bothering you?

490
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,230
I heard you met Mom.

491
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:33,880
I told her not to come back anymore.

492
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,550
Did she agree?

493
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:47,240
I'll talk to Mom again and make sure she understands.

494
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,950
Don't worry

495
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,850
and go to sleep.

496
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,710
Good night.

497
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,150
 Have some ice cream. 

498
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:08,200
Now's your only chance.

499
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:13,330
Are you crying? Is that why you won't open the door?

500
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:20,320
If you open the door now, I'll fold laundry for a week.

501
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:27,800
Reconcile. Why fight when you don't even want to?

502
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:34,060
Come out and eat. Don't eat while crying alone.

503
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:36,430
You have to brush your teeth, too.

504
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:41,090
I'm sick and tired of you.

505
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:49,040
Do you form a bond only when you raise a child?

506
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,520
DNA! What about my DNA?

507
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,270
Could he have existed if it weren't for me?

508
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:57,510
Whom does he need to thank for being so tall?

509
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:00,840
But Boss, if you can't convince him with money,

510
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,770
why not use a different approach?

511
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:05,580
"A different approach"?

512
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,850
Well, like...

513
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:11,130
embracing him. Embrace?

514
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:14,620
Sunlight! Like the sunlight.

515
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:16,330
"Sunlight"?

516
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,010
Sunlight?

517
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,710
   

518
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,890
Hello.

519
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:37,380
Do you know me?

520
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,870
You're Joo Won's Oppa.

521
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:43,650
She's still young.

522
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:47,270
She isn't mentally prepared to be in a relationship.

523
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,520
Just stay friends, okay? Friends.

524
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,100
Got it?

525
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:58,520
What do you like about Yoon Joo Won?

526
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,570
You know nothing about each other.

527
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:03,450
She's a very cheerful person.

528
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,860
Wait a minute.

529
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,200
Did you tell her that, too?

530
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,970
Tell her what?

531
00:43:19,170 --> 00:43:22,780
Did you tell her she's cheerful for someone without a mom?

532
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,040
Joo Won said not to tell anyone.

533
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,120
What's the special occasion? Is the coach treating us?

534
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,110
Your father treated us.

535
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:46,340
He said something about sunlight.

536
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,390
"Sunlight"?

537
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:50,910
 - Thanks for the food!  
 - Sure, sure.

538
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,900
Thanks, Hyungnim.

539
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:56,130
- But Dad should be at the store right now. 
 - No.

540
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:58,610
Your wealthy father.

541
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,170
What?

542
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:04,810
Hey, I was eating that.

543
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,670
Crap, are you showing off that you have a rich dad?

544
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,680
He's just hungry.

545
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,300
You said that ahjusshi isn't your dad.

546
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:19,370
You guys better not accept a crumb from that ahjusshi from now on.

547
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,480
Okay.

548
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,520
I guess the son of a wealthy family isn't satisfied with mere hamburgers?

549
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,820
Eat as much as you want.

550
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,030
You scumbag.

551
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:34,020
What did you say?

552
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,710
How could you call me a scumbag?

553
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,540
What, you prick! Am I wrong?

554
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,970
- You prick! 
 - Hey, that's enough.

555
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,820
Get lost!

556
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,790
Kang Hae Joon.

557
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,290
What?

558
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,700
Come with me if you're done.

559
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,410
I don't want to.

560
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:03,210
It's about Joo Won.

561
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,970
This better be serious.

562
00:45:12,090 --> 00:45:16,120
Joo Won's brothers dragged Joon Ho into the gym storage.

563
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,120
Hey!

564
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:23,260
Your oppas are ganging up on Joon Ho!

565
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:26,100
- What are you saying? 
 - I heard they dragged him to the gym storage.

566
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,300
 Who said you're cheerful for someone without a mom? 

567
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,440
"Ganging up"?

568
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,730
Are they thugs?

569
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,990
Hey, Yoon Joo Won!

570
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,080
Hello, Sunbaenims.

571
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:47,900
Hey.

572
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,590
Tell him.

573
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:55,140
No, Joo Won said not to tell anyone.

574
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,400
What's this about?

575
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,400
What did you say to Joo Won about "Someone without a mom"?

576
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:06,480
Tell him.

577
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,910
You...

578
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,390
What did you spew to Joo Won?

579
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,470
Joo Won...

580
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:29,330
said not to tell anyone...

581
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:35,400
Hey, slow down!

582
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:38,630
They probably won't hit him or anything!

583
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:41,220
Who said I'm worried about him?

584
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,710
She isn't always smiling, is she?

585
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:54,590
- No! I didn't say any–  
 - He didn't!

586
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,600
He never directly said anything about not having a mom! He just...

587
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,650
He just...

588
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:05,470
implied I have a difficult family environment.

589
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:11,640
Did you really say that?

590
00:47:14,570 --> 00:47:18,120
You told me not to tell anyone.

591
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:21,150
Then why was he grabbing your collar?

592
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:29,880
 What did you spew to Joo Won? 

593
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:35,230
 Joo Won said not to tell anyone. 

594
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:04,680
I mean...

595
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,760
It's just...

596
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:10,310
it wasn't a big deal. Not really.

597
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:13,840
And even if.

598
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:17,500
We hear it all the time. The townspeople always say that to us.

599
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,560
It doesn't affect me at all!

600
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:23,970
If it truly didn't, you would've told us.

601
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:55,380
Not even friends, got it?

602
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:58,420
That's up to Joo Won to decide.

603
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,630
How are you and Kang Hae Joon so alike?

604
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:20,390
How?

605
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:24,420
Hae Joon did that when his biological dad appeared.

606
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,150
He said there was no need to tell you and Ahjusshi.

607
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:30,960
He couldn't handle that his biological dad abandoned him

608
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,380
before he was even born.

609
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,450
But he said, "Let's not tell them. What's the use in telling them?"

610
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:39,800
"I'll just shoulder the pain by myself."

611
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,100
But that's not right.

612
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,590
You also want to know if something happens to Hae Joon and I.

613
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:52,760
If something angers us, you'd be angry with us.

614
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,670
If something good happens, you'd want to be happy with us.

615
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,720
Only when you're okay

616
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,850
can Hae Joon and I be okay.

617
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,720
I'll tell you everything from now on.

618
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,420
For real. I swear it.

619
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,320
You swear it, too.

620
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,940
Welcome!

621
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,270
Hello.

622
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:44,550
It has been a while.

623
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,390
Oh, yes. It has been a while.

624
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:53,650
San Ha isn't picking up and I felt uncomfortable entering an empty house.

625
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,180
I can wait here, right?

626
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,410
Yes, of course.

627
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:03,180
Why isn't he coming?

628
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:09,740
You feel better now, right?

629
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,110
Mom. Mom! Isn't that San Ha Oppa?

630
00:51:14,870 --> 00:51:17,610
- I'll be right down. 
 - Okay.

631
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,880
Call Oppa.

632
00:51:32,850 --> 00:51:35,300
O-Oppa.

633
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:39,160
You have to speak up.

634
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:40,940
Oppa!

635
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:02,530
So Hui, say hi.

636
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,270
Oppa?

637
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,650
Why are you in the kitchen?

638
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:54,070
Then should I sit out there?

639
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,100
Why don't you go home?

640
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,960
It'll seem like I'm avoiding her if I go now.

641
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,560
I'll do some dishes while I'm here.

642
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:12,220
Didn't Dad call you?

643
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,970
I'm sure he told you not to come back.

644
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:17,390
He did.

645
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:18,960
Mom...

646
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,460
It's fine.

647
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,960
It's because Oppa is seeing you for the first time.

648
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:28,020
She resembles her, right?

649
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:37,490
So?

650
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:40,360
So what if she does?

651
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,070
Who?

652
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:45,140
- Yoon Joo Won! 
 - Yes?

653
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,020
Take the child outside.

654
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,620
Sure.

655
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,590
Can you buy one for Oppa, too?

656
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,700
Oppa has a lot at home.

657
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:26,200
Do you like Kim San Ha that much?

658
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:31,350
Mom said when she and Dad go to heaven much later,

659
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:33,640
Oppa and I will only have each other.

660
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,790
What are you saying?

661
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:38,640
Whether it's three or four people, we can all live together.

662
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,100
- We can? 
 - Of course.

663
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,810
Do you want to come with us, Unni?

664
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:44,400
Where?

665
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:49,630
This is a secret.

666
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:52,380
I'm not supposed to tell anyone.

667
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,850
What is it?

668
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:55,870
I won't tell anyone.

669
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:59,940
Mom said once it's winter break,

670
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:03,260
we are going to Seoul with Oppa.

671
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,250
"Seoul"?

672
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:10,750
Yeah! Then he will eat and play with So Hui every day!

673
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:14,020
Really?

674
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:24,000
- I'm not going. 
 - Reconsider.

675
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
I told you last time.

676
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,610
That I wish you a happy and good life.

677
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:30,420
A life that doesn't include me.

678
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,280
What about college?

679
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,720
I'll attend one here.

680
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,520
Reconsider that as well.

681
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,450
You, me, and So Hui...

682
00:55:40,450 --> 00:55:41,840
   
   

683
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,870
It makes sense for a family to live together.

684
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,180
I already am.

685
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:10,780
 I just want to live with you. 

686
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:22,040
 Just take care of him for a short while. 

687
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:27,640
 I'll bring your favourite hamburgers when I come back, Hae Joon. 

688
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,140
 I don't need them! 

689
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:32,660
 Don't buy anything. Just come back quickly! 

690
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:42,060
   

691
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:50,220
Why don't you ask for my opinion even once?

692
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:53,390
Does my opinion not matter?

693
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:01,170
Please leave.

694
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:03,580
We need to open for dinner hours.

695
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:08,780
And don't come back, if possible.

696
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:20,880
Pardon...

697
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:25,710
You don't have to talk to her like that.

698
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:26,970
Let's talk later.

699
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:28,720
Are you upset right now?

700
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,960
Should I tell her to come back another time?

701
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,410
Do I need to repeat myself?

702
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:37,580
- Are you that stupid? 
 - What?

703
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:40,200
Mom and I don't have that kind of relationship.

704
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,700
No, what I meant was—

705
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:46,480
At least your mom had the decency to lie that she'll return for you.

706
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,110
What?

707
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:56,670
When your mom returns, you can do as you wish.

708
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:00,280
I won't interfere, either.

709
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,790
She wasn't lying!

710
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:06,950
She said she'd return once...

711
00:58:11,410 --> 00:58:13,320
once she saved up enough.

712
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:24,940
Do you still believe that?

713
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:31,460
See?

714
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:50,390
Why do you get angry with me when there are other kids with their moms?

715
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:56,950
In other people's eyes, you and I are...

716
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,860
just children abandoned by their moms!

717
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:10,110


718
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:18,500
♫  One day  ♫

719
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,640
♫  A precious memory  ♫

720
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:29,220
♫  Entered my small heart the day you smiled brightly  ♫

721
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:34,300
♫  And another day  ♫

722
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:37,640
♫  The memory of you holding me  ♫

723
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:45,730
♫  The day I wept freely, surrendering all my pain and struggles  ♫

724
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:55,030
♫  We loved all those days  ♫

725
00:59:55,030 --> 01:00:01,980
♫  Back then, we were too young to know our hearts were racing  ♫

726
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,980
♫  We just argued and delayed things  ♫

727
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:07,050
   

728
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:08,630
 Hey! You go to Haedong High, right? 

729
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:09,850
 Hang out with us! 

730
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:11,450
 Some group of thugs! 

731
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:12,890
 - Do you like her? 
 - What if I do? 

732
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:13,850
 I'll harass her. 

733
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:16,250
 I'll buy you something prettier next time. 

734
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:18,870
 Isn't this a pretty blatant sign? 

735
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:21,520
 Don't you know why I'm avoiding you? 

736
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:26,050
 You should help if you see San Ha setting the table. 

737
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:29,420
 I wonder if it would be better for you to go with your biological dad. 

738
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,700
 I'll be more mindful from now on. 

739
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,600
 You should forget your mom, too. 

740
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,650
 You're Mr. Yoon Jeong Jae, right? 

741
01:00:34,650 --> 01:00:36,690
 Do you remember me? 

742
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:42,610
♫  We just believed  ♫
