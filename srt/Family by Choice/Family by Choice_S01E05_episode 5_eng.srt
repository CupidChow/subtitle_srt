1
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:11,040


2
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,880
   

3
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,160
   

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,570
   

5
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,910
   

6
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,680
   

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,160
   

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,500
 Hi, Joo Won. 

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,750
 It was suddenly spring in my heart. 

10
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,350
 I've decided to deliver my feelings to you through this letter. 

11
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,020
 With fond feelings, X. 

12
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,650
 He wrote "X." Is he in our grade? 

13
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,260
 - Did something good happen? 
 - Actually... 

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,000
 I have something to brag about. Yoon Joo Won. You see that, right? 

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,290
 I'm going to start dating now, too. 

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,060
 He's the class president, he's intelligent, 

17
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,780
 and I heard he's even handsome and tall. 

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,470
 My mom said a person's family environment is really important. 

19
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,930
 However, that feels like a stereotype when applied to you. 

20
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,750
 It isn't that we don't have a good family environment. 

21
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:20,510
 Each of us is special. 

22
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,980
 Is it true? Is he really your dad? 

23
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,000
 The birth father he never knew existed? 

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,800
 Didn't he pass away? Are you sure he's your real dad? 

25
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,570
 You can do anything you want if you come with me to America. 

26
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:34,960
 Please don't contact me again. 

27
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,030
 I'm Hae Joon's dad. 

28
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:42,200
 I prepared exactly double the amount my attorney came up with. 

29
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,440
 Dad! 

30
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,410
 Your biological dad... 

31
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,830
 wants to take you with him. 

32
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,630
 I wish you wouldn't go with him. 

33
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:59,270
 I didn't tell you... 

34
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:02,170
 I-I didn't tell you... 

35
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,550
 because I thought you'd tell me to go. 

36
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,950
 I was afraid. 

37
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,370
 You must be surprised that I showed up unexpectedly. 

38
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,660
 Why did you suddenly appear after ten years? 

39
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,540
 To forgive you. 

40
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,210
 - Forgive me for what? 
 - You and So Jeong... 

41
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,350
 It was just the two of you. 

42
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:24,710
 What did Ahjumma say? 

43
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,910
 I told him I wanted to see him from now on. 

44
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,160
 If I take San Ha with me to Seoul, I can get him admissions consultations– 

45
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,160
 How can you say that after abandoning him like that? 

46
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,650
 Won't you just leave San Ha alone? 

47
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,450
 Oppa! 

48
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,340
 She resembles her, right? 

49
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,640
 So? 

50
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,780
 I just want to live with you. 

51
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,820
 Why don't you ask for my opinion even once? 

52
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,610
 Please leave. 

53
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,110
 And don't come back, if possible. 

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,020
 Pardon... 

55
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,750
Shouldn't you ask your brother if he wants to go to Seoul?

56
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,930
Why?

57
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:20,060
He might not want to go.

58
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,530
I don't think so.

59
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,680
Mom said he would go.

60
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,410
Sure.

61
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,470
 What is it? 

62
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:37,370
He must be stressed enough with the CSAT* exam around the corner. 
  (TN: College Scholastic Ability Test) 

63
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,430
Maybe there was no need to talk about the past.

64
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,240
I'm his mom.

65
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,940
I worry about him more than anyone.

66
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,150
Oh, yes. Of course, you are.

67
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,080
Then...

68
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:54,870
why not discuss his younger sister after he's done with the CSAT?

69
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,380
Or bring it up after he enters college next year–

70
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:00,740
He ended up that way because you're too soft on him.

71
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,810
- Excuse me? 
 - He used to be such an obedient child.

72
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,320
I was wondering how he became so brazen.

73
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:15,200
Well, you suddenly showed up acting friendly after ten years of no contact.

74
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,280
He never said a thing about wanting to go to Seoul.

75
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,140
Did you think he'd gladly go to Seoul with you so abruptly?

76
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,500
If you had first asked him if he wanted to go,

77
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,810
he wouldn't have spoken so harshly.

78
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,510
- Look here! 
 - Here.

79
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,740
You hurt him here first.

80
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,090
Then you ask why he put up his guard.

81
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,830
That's what I'm saying.

82
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,870
Why do you get angry with me when there are other kids with their moms?

83
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,910
In other people's eyes,

84
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,670
you and I are just children abandoned by their moms!

85
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,990
How many times do you need me to say it?

86
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,110
Should I repeat myself?

87
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,930
You and I are just–

88
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,980
Why are you acting like children?

89
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,050
He is a child asking for his mom.

90
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,590
- Kang Hae Joon! 
 - Don't hit my oppa.

91
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,430
Don't hit him!

92
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,110
What are you guys doing?

93
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,980
You raised them without self-control.

94
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,640
   

95
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:19,750
What's with the atmosphere?

96
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,580
The two of them fought.

97
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,470
And Mr. Yoon?

98
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,270
After the two of them fought,

99
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,370
Ahjumma said something about his parenting style.

100
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,520
I told her not to come back.

101
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,850
Why are you whispering?

102
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,580
Do you want some gim (roasted seaweed)?

103
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,990
What terrible table manners.

104
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,520
Thank you for the food.

105
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,930
Thank you for the food.

106
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:40,640
Did you have to yell while they were eating?

107
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,040
They should hear it from family. If they act like that outside,

108
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,300
people will say it's because they grew up without a mom.

109
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,440
Well, do they act like that outside?

110
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,880
Becoming an adult is all about holding back.

111
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,390
- What about the gim? 
 - There's no need since the children left.

112
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:00,020
What am I? Chopped liver?

113
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,740
Gim is gold these days.

114
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,380
 It's been like this for a week. 

115
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,460
I haven't had a comfortable meal all week!

116
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,370
Just give them some time.

117
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,400
Reconciliation takes time, you know.

118
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,550
I'll be stressed to death before that.

119
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,390
 Do you know what happened yesterday? 

120
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:23,200
Ahjusshi gave me money for some chicken.

121
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,130
Fried or sweet and spicy?

122
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,330
Sweet and spicy.

123
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:29,930
Okay, I'll ask Kim San Ha, too.

124
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,740
Fried or sweet and spicy?

125
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,190
- What? 
 - Fried or sweet and spicy?

126
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:42,350
- Fried. 
 - Not sweet and spicy?

127
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:46,160
Why? Does Kang Hae Joon want sweet and spicy?

128
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,090
Fried.

129
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:52,410
Hold on! I'll ask him one more time.

130
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:55,230
Fried?

131
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,400
Sweet

132
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,990
and spicy.

133
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,370
Fried.

134
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,960
Then how about half and half?

135
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,670
Sweet and spicy.

136
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,870
Fried.

137
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,530
   

138
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:12,550
Is half and half out of the question?

139
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,400
   

140
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,680
Sweet and spicy.

141
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,680
Fried.

142
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,810
Forget it. I'm not eating.

143
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,310
I don't want to eat!

144
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,020
But I'll somehow make them reconcile before Kang Hae Joon's birthday.

145
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,350
Why? Is his birthday special?

146
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,270
Imagine if they argue during his birthday dinner.

147
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,270
It's awkward enough with Auntie there.

148
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,260
"Auntie"? Whose aunt?

149
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,430
Hae Joon's aunt. She visits on his birthdays.

150
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,280
I thought he had lost contact with his mom...

151
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,790
- He stays in touch with his aunt. She lives nearby, too. 
 - Really?

152
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,040
It's good to know he has an aunt at least.

153
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,530
Right? I'm glad, too.

154
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,820
What?

155
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,390
I heard you had a cold, so I got some medicine from the nurse's office.

156
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,980
Thanks.

157
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,880
Are you free this weekend?

158
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,910
Are you asking her on a date?

159
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,600
I didn't say anything. You're the one who let it slip.

160
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,330
I kept my promise, so give me a chance to redeem myself.

161
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:41,200
I know how great your family environment is now.

162
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,660
Really?

163
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,520
So where are we going?

164
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,170
Look at this.

165
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:52,930
There's a new aerial bike at this park.

166
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:58,210
"2 km SkyBike." 
    

167
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,610
"One lap of SkyBike will bring your love to fruition."

168
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,940
I'm not intereste...

169
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,600
   

170
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,650
Is this true?

171
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,610
Yes.

172
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,620
So this is true! 
    

173
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,950
Hey, where are you going?

174
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,840
I'm asking them to join.

175
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,030
You have a bike at home. Ride that.

176
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,280
This is completely different.

177
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,810
"Heal while smelling the pine tree leaves."

178
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,820
You have a bike at home.

179
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,160
"Phytoncide and healing!"

180
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,130
- Really? They agreed? 
 - Yes.

181
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:39,370
No, thanks. Forget it.

182
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,670
I can't help it, then.

183
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,240
I'll just go with Kim San Ha.

184
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,700
I can't help it, then.

185
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,260
I'll have to go with Kang Hae Joon.

186
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:52,000
Anyway, they hate being left out.

187
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,210
But will riding that make them reconcile?

188
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,460
It says it right here.

189
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,380
"Just us friends! One lap and friendship will blossom!"

190
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,480
Doing things together naturally develops friendship.

191
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,950
It's very logical.

192
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,370
Is it that simple?

193
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,990
How is Sunday at 2 p.m.?

194
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,080
- Me, too? 
 - Yes.

195
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,700
The bike is a four-seater.

196
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,370
Why? Are you busy?

197
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,100
N-No, I'm not.

198
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,930
What should I wear?

199
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,560
I can just ride the bus.

200
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,500
You said the weekend lecture lasts all day.

201
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,350
You should save your energy.

202
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,110
Should I pick you up at night?

203
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,540
Sure.

204
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,460
Why is there so much traffic?

205
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,540
We are here.

206
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,300
- I'll get going. 
 - Okay.

207
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,370
- Bye. 
 - Okay, have a good day!

208
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,440
   

209
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,080
 And there was... 

210
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,600
 Oh! He's so handsome! 

211
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,660
- I'm going crazy! 
 - So handsome!

212
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,100
How are we supposed to heal with this crowd?

213
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,150
That's odd. I heard demand was low because it just opened.

214
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,680
Hey. You're here.

215
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,140
Hey, why is it so packed?

216
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,070
If your brothers are here, then this is a hot place.

217
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,580
How did they know my brothers would come?

218
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:35,260
You said you'd come with them.

219
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,820
I did?

220
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,800
 I'm asking them to join! 

221
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,910
 They're here! They're here! Come this way! 

222
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,300
   

223
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,310
 Hey, Hae Joon is going to ride the SkyBike! 

224
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,660
   
   

225
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,460
   
   

226
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,530
   

227
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,790
I think that's why he came, too.

228
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:01,100
- We will get going. 
 - Sorry. Passing through.

229
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,750
Sorry, please let me pass.

230
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,730
This was my idea.

231
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,410
I would've been fine if you said hyungnims would be joining.

232
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,230
Who are you calling "hyungnim"?

233
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,700
Didn't I tell you not to talk to Joo Won anymore?

234
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,830
It's okay because I was remorseful.

235
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,720
 Next person! 

236
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,490
- Come with me. 
  - As if! 

237
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,240
Dal will be here soon.

238
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,930
She better be here soon.

239
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,200
Next person, please.

240
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,400
We should just pair up.

241
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,830
Sure, we have no choice.

242
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,670
Let's just ride, three of us.

243
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,890
That sounds like a better idea.

244
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:57,720
Let's go! Let's go.

245
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,450
No, no!

246
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,220
What?

247
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:03,250
- I'm going to ride this one. 
 - No!

248
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,700
There are people waiting.

249
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:07,710
- What? 
 - Here.

250
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,010
Go ahead.

251
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,560
Seriously!

252
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:16,410
Ride the one behind us.

253
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,060
I can't hear anything,

254
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,480
so you can talk all you want, okay?

255
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,860
Don't worry about pedaling.

256
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,950
♫  Back then, we were the world  ♫

257
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,640
♫  Everything existed for us  ♫

258
00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:01,950
♫  Like the sun in the clearest summer sky  ♫

259
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,940
A-Are you not done yet?

260
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:10,110
Okay, then. Just keep talking.

261
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,990
She must be tired.

262
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,570
I know, right? She's making so much effort.

263
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,160
My goodness, I said we should play pool. Why come to the park?

264
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,980
- Seriously. 
 - All the girls from our school are here today.

265
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,230
- Is that right? 
 - I'm looking at the bigger–

266
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,330
- I'm sorry. 
 - Hey.

267
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:50,850
Who knows? We might meet "the one" here.

268
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,140
- Let's go. 
  - Let's go! 

269
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,250
Look at this.

270
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,240
Nature is so magnificent.

271
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,970
People would think you're on top of the Jirisan Cheonwangbong Peak.

272
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,500
- Sorry. 
 - For what?

273
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,540
I'm sorry for hitting you.

274
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,110
Only for hitting me?

275
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,760
What about before that?

276
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,350
Before that?

277
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,430
What did I do wrong?

278
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,030
Of course, you don't know.

279
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,090
You're the one who started it!

280
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:26,460
You hit me with your words first!

281
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:27,860
You started it.

282
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,670
No. No, I didn't.

283
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:34,670
If you don't know why you're apologizing, then don't apologize.

284
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,660
Hey, just hit me.

285
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,220
Just hit me once and forget– Ouch.

286
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,470
Darn it!

287
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,400
You said to hit you.

288
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,420
- Darn it. 
 - What!

289
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,350
I knew this would happen.

290
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:52,950
- Apologize? 
 - Let go!

291
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:55,210
I said, let go!

292
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,460
- Let go! 
 - Hey!

293
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,020
I said to make up. Why are you fighting again?

294
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,270
Hey, just don't. Don't make up!

295
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:04,740
You're dead if you make up!

296
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,420
Stop it! Honestly!

297
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,110
I said stop it!

298
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,160
My goodness.

299
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,800
Go home by yourselves!

300
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:17,060
I'm going to meet Dal.

301
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,600
Hey!

302
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,900
You go to Haedong High, right?

303
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,150
- I don't. 
 - Come on.

304
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,190
I saw you at our basketball practice.

305
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:40,660
That must be your friend. Is it a girl?

306
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,200
Tell her to join us.

307
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,470
Let's hang out together. 
    

308
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,240
Is there no water?

309
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,840
I'm all out of beverages and cold water.

310
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,190
Aigoo, I ordered some. When is it arriving?

311
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,840
This is good.

312
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,890
- Who are those thugs? 
 - Let's just go.

313
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,020
- That's our class president. 
 - Come on!

314
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,860
Min Soo's friends are scary people. Let's go.

315
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,460
- Let's go. 
 - What?

316
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,070
What? I'm just going home, too.

317
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,370
One of us should wait for her.

318
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:18,670
Is she a child?

319
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:22,100
Does she need us to accompany her in broad daylight?

320
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,560
You should go get her if you're so worried.

321
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,000
Who said I was worried?

322
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,460
Don't lie. Hang out with us.

323
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,750
- Hae Joon! 
 - Oppa!

324
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,440
- What? 
 - Some thugs are bothering Dal–

325
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,550
- Where are they? 
 - Over there!

326
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,940
They ran to her right away.

327
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,910
Do they like the class president?

328
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,830
What the heck?

329
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,330
Aren't you Kang Hae Joon's younger sister?

330
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:00,170
 - Why are you coming? 
 - Joo Won. 

331
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,120
- She said she was meeting Dal. 
 - Darn it!

332
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,850
Joo Won.

333
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,430
Joo Won, are you okay?

334
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,920
What should we do? Is it heatstroke?

335
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,000
Should we call an ambulance?

336
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,990
- One... one... 
 - 119 (Korean Emergency Number).

337
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:17,300
Are you okay? What's wrong?

338
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:22,560
- Medicine, medicine! 
 - Here. Here, here!

339
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,990
Water...

340
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,560
- Water. Water. 
 - Water! Water for the medicine.

341
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,810
- Hey, let's go. 
 - We will be right back.

342
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,010
- It's this way! 
 - Where?

343
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,290
Over here. Over here!

344
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,980
Over here...

345
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,190
Yoon Joo Won, wake up.

346
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,370
What's wrong with her?

347
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,890
- Well– 
 - Where are they?

348
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,800
How dare they hit a girl!

349
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,420
"Hit"?

350
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,820
What about you? Are you okay?

351
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,640
I just have a cold–

352
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,230
You!

353
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,290
- What? 
 - Cha Min Soo!

354
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,190
Dal, take care of her for a moment.

355
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,740
Come here.

356
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:18,980
- What's with him? 
 - It isn't what you think...

357
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,530
Are you crazy?

358
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,200
Let go!

359
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,330
Let go of me! Let go.

360
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:54,470
   

361
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,430
Are you okay?

362
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,770
What do you think? My goodness.

363
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:06,820
So all they did was buy you water, right?

364
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:07,860
Yes.

365
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,140
Starting from the left, give me your guardian's phone number.

366
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,850
Is something off?

367
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,970
Shouldn't we at least get them a used car when they go to college next year?

368
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,710
A car, my foot.

369
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:32,330
Maintenance and insurance cost an arm and a leg.

370
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,440
They'll probably both go to Myungju University.

371
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,020
Riding together will be convenient.

372
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,250
Should I open another savings account?

373
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,520
Buying beer...

374
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,410
once a week seems too often.

375
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:57,440
We agreed not to touch my beer! Oh my.

376
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,640
Hello?

377
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:18,750
Sorry for misunderstanding you.

378
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,780
I thought you guys made her pass out.

379
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,380
Sorry.

380
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,180
It's hard to stay angry when he's that sincere.

381
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,650
What should we do?

382
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,140
Should we just let it slide?

383
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,430
My goodness, but that seems too unfair.

384
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,190
Ahjusshi.

385
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,440
Lieutenant, what brings you here?

386
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,980
- Son. 
 - "Son"?

387
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:50,670
- A moment? 
 - Oh, yes.

388
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:56,180
We almost fell for it.

389
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,530
Fell for what?

390
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:00,640
- That was all fake, wasn't it? 
 - You laid out the groundwork.

391
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,150
Yes. To apologize and leave.

392
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,500
- I-I didn't. 
 - As if!

393
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,300
Boys, we can't back down. All right?

394
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,880
We are the victims!

395
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,520
We got beaten up!

396
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,920
- That's right. 
 - Fall back.

397
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,860
It hurts.

398
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,940
You guys go home.

399
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:25,580
It's late. Your family must be worried.

400
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:29,130
How dare you hit someone?

401
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:31,420
Give them a severe punishment.

402
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,690
"Punishment"?

403
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:40,100
That's a bit too much...

404
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:44,740
- I'd also lose it if my sister was unconscious. 
  - That's right. 

405
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,500
- Don't you agree? 
 - I get it.

406
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,900
And to think about it, we aren't that beaten up.

407
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,700
- You got hit the most. 
 - Are you okay?

408
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,780
- You should change the tissue. 
 - No, I'm fine.

409
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,320
- Your nose looks bent. 
 - He just grazed me. I'm fine.

410
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,950
   

411
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,720
But Ahjusshi, as the victims stated,

412
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,270
there was plenty of room for misunderstanding.

413
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,640
They let it slide because they're kind.

414
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,940
Do you guys know how lucky you were today?

415
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,030
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

416
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,320
You're Joo Won's friend, right?

417
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,740
- Yes. 
 - I'm sorry you got caught up in this mess.

418
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,410
Oh, no. I'm fine.

419
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:29,220
I'll take you home. Get in.

420
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,700
No, it's fine.

421
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,450
- Get in. Joo Won, you, too. 
 - Yes.

422
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:35,650
You two take the bus.

423
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,450
Bye.

424
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,560
Hey, get in.

425
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,180
   

426
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,590
Are you sure this is fine?

427
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:07,010
My house is nearby, so it's fine.

428
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,670
Thank you for the ride.

429
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:11,720
Sure.

430
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:14,260
   

431
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,510
Park Dal!

432
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,080
- Mom. 
 - Who are those people?

433
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,950
Why are you getting out of their car?

434
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,600
Do you know how many times I called you?

435
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:29,000
Something urgent came up. I didn't realize you called me.

436
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,030
You should've answered your phone, no matter what!

437
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,740
I was worried sick!

438
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,960
I was just about to call the police!

439
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,240
I'm sorry.

440
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,720
I was scared something happened.

441
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,090
I told you, didn't I?

442
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,730
You're my only hope.

443
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,920
You're the only one I have left!

444
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,640
If something were to happen to you...

445
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,260
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for worrying you.

446
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,540
This won't happen again.

447
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,680
So whose car was that?

448
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,650
Joo Won and her oppa.

449
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:07,230
I've mentioned them before.

450
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:11,320
Joo Won's oppa only got one question wrong on the previous mock exam.

451
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,940
Reading his notes is a hundred times better than an academy class.

452
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,780
Really?

453
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,030
Ahjusshi...

454
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,490
Don't worry.

455
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:28,430
I didn't say anything to Mr. Yoon before coming.

456
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:31,270
He would just worry for no reason.

457
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:34,190
Why beat people up if you're worried about that?

458
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,230
If I catch you one more time,

459
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:40,730
I'll make an example out of you before college. Okay?

460
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,980
Did you make up?

461
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:15,970
You didn't?

462
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,590
We did.

463
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,740
We are going now. Go to sleep.

464
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,270
Good night.

465
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:34,650
I knew they'd make up in no time.

466
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,820
I never made up with you.

467
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,170
According to Dal, she has been sick for a few days.

468
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:49,040
We didn't realize it since we were too busy fighting.

469
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,260
Let's just pretend we made up.

470
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:54,220
- Why should I? 
 - We are making everyone worry.

471
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,070
Joo Won and Ahjusshi, too.

472
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:59,150
Why do you think Dad said not to tell Ahjusshi?

473
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,470
If you make that face in front of your aunt on your birthday,

474
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,780
everyone will feel uncomfortable.

475
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,180
It's only pretend, okay?

476
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:16,640
You lay a finger on me, and it's over. Got it?

477
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:19,270
Likewise.

478
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,830
Come on.

479
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,380
Go.

480
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,930
Bye.

481
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,000
- Okay. 
 - Sure.

482
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:55,260
The SkyBike was effective.

483
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,460
- Already? 
 - Yes.

484
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,410
They didn't fight over food this morning.

485
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:04,630
Breakfast went down smoothly, thanks to the peaceful atmosphere.

486
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,390
What about your cold? Is it better?

487
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,790
Yes.

488
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,190
Thank goodness.

489
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,480
Is something wrong? You look like you couldn't sleep.

490
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,660
No, I slept fine.

491
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:23,010
You went home too late, right?

492
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,820
Did you get in trouble?

493
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,080
No, I'm fine.

494
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,330
Wasn't she on a date?

495
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,600
What if they really end up together?

496
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,950
Oh my. Is that her?

497
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,800
Hae Joon likes Park Dal, our class president.

498
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,470
- Really? 
 - Are you sure?

499
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,880
I clearly saw it with my two eyes.

500
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:51,840
His eyes got big when he heard Dal was in danger, and he ran to her rescue.

501
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,290
- Wow. 
 - This is love.

502
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,710
- What do I do? 
 - It's true love!

503
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,530
Hey, isn't that Kang Hae Joon's girlfriend?

504
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:01,850
- It's Kang Hae Joon's girlfriend. 
 - Hae Joon's girlfriend.

505
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:06,690
-  Hey!  
 - Unni! What's this?

506
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:08,680
What is this?

507
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,710
What?

508
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,620
Since a rumor has started already, let's try asking him out.

509
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:17,150
How can I just ask him out because of the timing?

510
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,270
Kang Jae Eun said she saw it with her eyes.

511
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:24,310
She might exaggerate, but she isn't creative enough to come up with a lie.

512
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:28,450
Would he refuse you when you like him?

513
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:30,940
Kang Hae Joon is weak against fastballs.

514
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,900
Do you really like her?

515
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,240
Why are you always throwing fastballs?

516
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,900
- What if I do? 
 - Don't like her.

517
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:46,050
Do you know you look lame right now?

518
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:49,140
You look like you're obsessing over me.

519
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,660
I am obsessing over you.

520
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:51,890
What if I like her?

521
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:53,930
I'll harass her.

522
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,200
I guess you've got nothing to lose now.

523
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,360
Don't harass her for no reason. She's my sister's friend, okay?

524
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:03,500
My sister's friend is like a sister, too.

525
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,100
Is that so?

526
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,000
Being your sister's friend, she's like a sister, so she has no chance at all.

527
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,680
- Not at all, right? 
 - What chance?

528
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,930
Cut the nonsense.

529
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,840
What's the matter with them both?

530
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,480
Ignorance is bliss. You charming idiot.

531
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,450
Why are you cursing me out?

532
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,390
Do you want to stop by for snacks?

533
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,210
Don't mind me.

534
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:53,790
It was a ridiculous rumor anyway.

535
00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:56,400
It's not like he said it to your face.

536
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:01,300
- If you ask him directly– 
 - You call that a "confirmed kill."

537
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,600
Dating as a student?

538
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,360
Dating is for college.

539
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:18,790
Come on, what the heck?

540
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,560
It's all right.

541
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,970
   
   

542
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,680
Should we have a look over there?

543
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,420
What about there?

544
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,340
Didn't Kang Hae Joon say he needed something?

545
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:46,980
Sneakers? What do you think?

546
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,740
"Sneakers"?

547
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:54,000
This one. It's the last one.

548
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,830
- Which one? 
 - This one.

549
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,660
What do you think?

550
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,000
Take it off.

551
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,450
Just keep going this way.

552
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,080
I want it.

553
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:11,580
A confirmed kill?

554
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,570
Just get it off your chest.

555
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,230
"I like you."

556
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:19,500
Is that so hard to do?

557
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,990
She can't say it because she likes him.

558
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:25,130
And it might ruin their current relationship.

559
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,260
Dal is so kind and smart, though.

560
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,990
Hui Joo is smart, too.

561
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,030
Don't do it.

562
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:36,760
Don't do it.

563
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,920
This one.

564
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,350
This one?

565
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,780
Let's get this.

566
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,950
Do you have this in 275 mm (Size 9.5)?

567
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:57,220
One moment, please.

568
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,120
Kang Hae Joon wears 270 mm (Size 9).

569
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,270
He grew. He has trouble putting on his current pair.

570
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,030
As expected.

571
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:07,920
"One lap that brings your love to fruition."

572
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,010
Do you have this in 240 mm (Size 7)?

573
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:16,550
It's that one.

574
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,220
Try it on.

575
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,430
It isn't my birthday, though.

576
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:24,600
I know. Just try it on.

577
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,110
I'll buy you...

578
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:47,200
prettier ones later.

579
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,650
The price doesn't look right.

580
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:00,010
I gave you an employee discount.

581
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,500
Why?

582
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,330
Because you're such a cute couple.

583
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,240
- We aren't a– 
 - Thank you.

584
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,450
Be quiet. She's giving us a discount.

585
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:16,400
Hope you enjoy them.

586
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:19,120
Thank you.

587
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,100
So Hui wants to go see Oppa.

588
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,130
Not today.

589
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,450
Why?

590
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,360
So Hui misses Oppa.

591
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,330
I know we can go right now.

592
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,680
We can go after we eat!

593
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,260
I don't want to see Oppa.

594
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,710
So Hui wants to see him.

595
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,970
Do you want to go to the bathroom?

596
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,000
I need to use it, so be nice and keep eating.

597
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,260
- Okay? 
 - Okay.

598
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,330
Oppa!

599
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,780
You'll be late for the academy, right? I guess we can't eat.

600
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,770
We can eat quickly. Hamburger?

601
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,710
A large set.

602
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,850
Oppa.

603
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,330
Oppa.

604
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:31,210
Oppa! Oppa!

605
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,370
So Hui, are you okay?

606
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,040
Can you stand up?

607
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:44,340
Where does it hurt?

608
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,360
Here? Does it hurt here?

609
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,260
Is it the only place that hurts?

610
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:54,550
If it only hurts here, it'll get better in no time.

611
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,310
Really?

612
00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:58,730
Jeong So Hui!

613
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,760
So Hui.

614
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,090
I told you to stay seated and eat, didn't I?

615
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:18,960
I saw Oppa and...

616
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,840
I said I didn't want to see Oppa.

617
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,110
Come here.

618
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,050
Look at this. You got hurt.

619
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,800
This happens whenever you're involved.

620
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,850
So Hui, weren't you a good girl?

621
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:42,170
Why do accidents happen whenever your oppa is involved?

622
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,700
That's not true.

623
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,530
Only good things happen when Kim San Ha is involved.

624
00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:53,060
My dad won fourth place lottery recently when he rarely even wins fifth place.

625
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:55,550
My dad's store has more customers because it's the valedictorian's family.

626
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,370
You didn't know, right?

627
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,190
No one in our apartment building ever got in a car accident.

628
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:03,710
Even the jopop* tree in the courtyard looked dead 
  (TN: Sounds like an insult in Korean) 

629
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,550
but it is in full bloom.

630
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:09,040
Everyone was saying, "What in the world?"

631
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,350
Let's go.

632
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,840
Let's listen to that before we go.

633
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,180
 That's not true. 

634
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,620
 Only good things happen when Kim San Ha is involved. 

635
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,580
 Hey! There's nothing wrong with my oppa. 

636
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,090
 You're the one with a problem! 

637
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,620
 If you get hungry, knock on our door. 

638
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:59,250
 Children shouldn't be hungry. Okay? 

639
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:01,040
 Oppa! 
   

640
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,380
 Are you okay? 

641
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,550
Did I go too far with jopop?

642
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:24,800
- What? 
 - I mean, she's still an elder.

643
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,650
I went too far with the jopop comment, right?

644
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,610
What?

645
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,540
I was wondering if you still had a fever.

646
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,050
"Fever"?

647
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,740
I got better ages ago.

648
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:46,640
You're fine.

649
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:54,430
♫  Now it's time to move forward, beyond the sunrise  ♫

650
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,540
­♫  Beyond the sunrise  ♫

651
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:22,440
   
   

652
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,750
- Hey, Joo Won. Set the plates in advance. 
 - Okay.

653
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,610
- Where's your aunt? 
 - She's almost here.

654
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,110
All right.

655
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,900
Cook the rest of the jeon* (Korean pancake).

656
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,810
Where are you going?

657
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:56,180
I'll go bring Kim San Ha.

658
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:04,430
San Ha.

659
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:09,750
Don't you know how to knock?

660
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:13,000
The sound of the front door opening is the knock.

661
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,490
Get out. I need to get changed.

662
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,360
Get changed.

663
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,940
- Get out. 
 - What–

664
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,240
Get out, I said.

665
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,570
You're being so petty.

666
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:24,200
- Just get out. 
 - I never knocked, to begin with...

667
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,440
You should lock your door before changing from now on, too.

668
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,960
For what?

669
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:37,630
 I mean, if Kang Hae Joon or I open the door by mistake... 

670
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,690
 Forget it. 

671
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:43,790
- Where is Dad? 
 - He went to buy a cake.

672
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:46,080
Again.

673
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,210
Again, with that expression.

674
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,270
I mean...

675
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:54,300
Auntie is a good person.

676
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,590
I know.

677
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:59,560
Kang Hae Joon breaks down when Auntie is here.

678
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,820
He forces laughs and starts getting loud.

679
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,670
Don't show it.

680
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:11,040
- If you want to say something to Auntie, 
 - Yes.

681
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,680
- but you're not sure if you should say it or not. 
 - Yes.

682
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:16,990
Then don't say anything.

683
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,940
Let's go.

684
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,340
I'm always trying my best.

685
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,040
Smile.

686
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,920
Auntie.

687
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,870
Have you been well?

688
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:41,790
Are you here? Welcome.

689
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:42,960
Should I help you out?

690
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,580
No, we are all done.

691
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:48,300
Aigoo, it must've been a long trip. Go sit and relax.

692
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:51,480
- Come here. 
 - Yes.

693
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,390
Are you here?

694
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:00,140
Yes.

695
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,940
Have you been well, Joo Won?

696
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,630
Yes.

697
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,770
It's next month, right?

698
00:44:08,770 --> 00:44:10,400
Yes.

699
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,510
Hey, clean up the clothes in your room.

700
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:14,470
Oh, that's right.

701
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,640
What about your biological dad?

702
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,790
Hasn't he contacted you yet?

703
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,150
I think he went to Seoul.

704
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:06,170
Is that so? I guess it must be so.

705
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,720
Why?

706
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:11,070
I gave it some thought,

707
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:15,460
and I wonder if it'd be better for you to go with your biological dad.

708
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:16,590
Come on, Auntie.

709
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,170
Am I wrong here?

710
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:20,850
We already owe this family for the past ten years now.

711
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,580
A person should know better.

712
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,510
I behave well.

713
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:29,040
Behave well, my foot!

714
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,570
Just look at what happened earlier.

715
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,690
You can clean up Joo Won's room for her,

716
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:39,350
and you should help out if you see San Ha setting the table.

717
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:42,200
We need to pay for your college next year, too.

718
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,750
And it's not like it costs a penny or two.

719
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,690
 I'll be mindful from now on. 

720
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:51,710
 I'm doing whatever I can, but this happens sometimes. 

721
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:53,900
 Don't worry about it. 

722
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:58,750
 Don't worry about me. 

723
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:03,030
What are you doing there?

724
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,510
You came.

725
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:10,140
- Give it to me. 
 - Oh, here.

726
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:12,980
It's fresh cream.

727
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,880
Hello.

728
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,470
- It's fresh cream. 
 - What kind of cake is it?

729
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,550
It's fresh cream.

730
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:22,830
You can't open it yet.

731
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:25,130
It has so many fruits.

732
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:27,620
Calm down now.

733
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,140
- We will do it. 
 - Why?

734
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:35,140
♪  Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you  ♪

735
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:38,610
♪  Happy birthday, dear Kang Hae Joon  ♪

736
00:46:38,610 --> 00:46:42,720
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

737
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,600
Make a wish.

738
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,600
- Here. 
 - Wow, what is this?

739
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,360
This is from Kim San Ha and me.

740
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:03,040
Basketball shoes?

741
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,470
Hurry up and eat before the galbi (short ribs) gets cold.

742
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:07,870
Yes.

743
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:10,030
Thank you for the food.

744
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:12,250
They say people run away when you gift shoes.

745
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:14,530
Will you be okay?

746
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:16,140
How dare he run away?

747
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:20,740
Once Hae Joon goes to college, he must repay Joo Won's dad.

748
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:23,160
- Right? 
 - Yes.

749
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,250
To be honest,

750
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,930
the first time you took him in,

751
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:36,460
I thought you'd send him back soon after.

752
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,640
Back then, I was thankful if you could take him

753
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:45,120
even for a moment because I was busy with my life.

754
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,220
You even had a child of your own,

755
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,940
but you still came forward to take in a stranger's child.

756
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,580
I thought you were so innocent.

757
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:59,890
You say such silly things.

758
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:03,920
Not at all. I'm really thankful to you.

759
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,900
Hae Joon received everything in this house

760
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,250
that my sister and I couldn't provide.

761
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:13,820
So Hae Joon will be good to you.

762
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:19,070
He's the type to give back tenfold once he grows up.

763
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:23,180
Be good to me for what?

764
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,600
There is no need.

765
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,910
What parent asks his child for compensation for raising him?

766
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,380
Is the galbi not good?

767
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:47,230
- It's delicious. 
 - Oh, yes.

768
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:55,200
Oh my, that's refreshing.

769
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,570
- Delicious, right? 
 - Yes.

770
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:58,590
Eat up.

771
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,600
Should I call you a taxi?

772
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:16,150
No need. I can get one by the main street.

773
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:23,930
I should've brought him... when he was much younger.

774
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:37,220
If so, he wouldn't have known I brought him from elsewhere to raise him.

775
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:41,250
Had I done so...

776
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:46,760
he wouldn't have had to hear that he needed to be good to me.

777
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,690
What is your problem?

778
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,430
H-Hey, take your father to his room.

779
00:49:55,430 --> 00:49:56,730
Yes.

780
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,240
No, I'm fine.

781
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,160
Let's go inside, Ahjusshi.

782
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:06,950
No, but...

783
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:13,310
Why can't you understand where I'm coming from when you'll soon have your own child?

784
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:20,640
Feeding, clothing, and providing for them

785
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:25,220
are all my sources of joy, not theirs.

786
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,030
I do it for my own good, so why...

787
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:33,560
Why must Hae Joon walk on eggshells?

788
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,280
I wasn't saying he needed to walk on eggshells.

789
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,570
It's because I'm so thankful.

790
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:40,500
"Thankful..."

791
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:47,010
I can't even spit on the streets because of the children.

792
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:51,070
God forbid if something were to happen to the children in the future,

793
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:55,070
I'm afraid I might regret even those little things.

794
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:01,410
Thanks to the children, I'm living my life properly.

795
00:51:01,410 --> 00:51:03,940
So I should be thanking them!

796
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:07,370
What did they do so wrong?

797
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:10,780
One gets pushed around by his mom,

798
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:14,140
and the other gets shoved around by his aunt.

799
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,160
Hae Joon, that child?

800
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:21,480
He does his absolute best to help me with whatever I'm doing.

801
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,300
He does all he has to, including basketball, cleaning, and laundry.

802
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:28,100
He's such a nice boy.

803
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:32,560
Wh-What on earth did he do so wrong that

804
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:35,410
he has to be good to me?

805
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:37,540
Be good...

806
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:41,850
J-Just how much more does he have to do?

807
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:47,090
Th-That's not what I meant...

808
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,590
He knows.

809
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,890
He knows that's not what you meant.

810
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:55,930
He's just drunk, you know.

811
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:57,350
You understand, right?

812
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:59,410
I'm sorry.

813
00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:01,810
I'm so sorry.

814
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:28,280
Aigoo, seriously.

815
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:36,230
He went all out today.

816
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:39,950
What a memorable birthday today will be.

817
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:45,180
- His socks. 
 - Yes.

818
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:55,780
This is a clean one.

819
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:01,300
- I'm a fool, aren't I? 
 - Not at all.

820
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,270
Just leave it.

821
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:08,490
I'll clean up with Hae Joon once he comes out.

822
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:10,960
I can just clean up quickly.

823
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,560
You and Hae Joon aren't the same.

824
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:19,090
Even if you ate and grew up together, your dad pays for everything.

825
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:23,200
I'll clean up before leaving. Go up and get some rest.

826
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,510
We are the same.

827
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:26,780
What?

828
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:29,240
Hae Joon and I are the same.

829
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:32,930
My dad doesn't just pay for everything.

830
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:37,080
And Ahjusshi doesn't think of Hae Joon and me that way, either.

831
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:40,710
You don't need to worry.

832
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:47,730
Come and take the plates.

833
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,030
Okay.

834
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:51,990
You should see your aunt off.

835
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:53,570
Yes.

836
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,400
Let's go.

837
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,970
We should've just called a taxi to Ohryun Mansion.

838
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,110
It's fine.

839
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:09,470
I think it would feel suffocating if I got in a car right now.

840
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:13,440
I haven't cried in a long time.

841
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,730
Crying feels a bit refreshing, too.

842
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,350
Is that so?

843
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:28,890
I'm sorry, Hae Joon.

844
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,460
What is it this time?

845
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:35,800
I don't know. I don't know,

846
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,350
but I know I'm at fault.

847
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:39,920
You didn't do anything wrong, Auntie.

848
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,200
Dad was just a bit upset today.

849
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,830
I understand how you feel.

850
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,030
Hae Joon.

851
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,500
Yes.

852
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,980
You should forget your mom, too.

853
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:01,420
Just think she was never there to begin with.

854
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:06,200
You just need to be good to Joo Won's dad.

855
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:10,330
Just forget...

856
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,570
about your mom.

857
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:23,720
I mean, should I not say this, either?

858
00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:27,190
I don't think about Mom.

859
00:55:27,190 --> 00:55:29,690
I can't even remember her face now.

860
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:35,440
I see.

861
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,960
I'll be good to Dad and to you, too, Auntie.

862
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:45,650
I'm going to repay everyone.

863
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:49,630
You don't need to worry about a thing.

864
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:51,070
Auntie.

865
00:55:53,410 --> 00:55:55,130
You trust me, right?

866
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,650
Come on. Don't cry, okay?

867
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:05,310
I'll be good.

868
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:32,000
What time is it?

869
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,300
It's not midnight yet.

870
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:46,620
What about Auntie?

871
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,610
She got home safe.

872
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:52,710
She said to tell you she was sorry.

873
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:56,040
I brought you water and medicine for a hangover.

874
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:58,270
Auntie bought them for you.

875
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:01,700
Make sure to brush your teeth.

876
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:05,080
Underwear for tomorrow... in the drawer...

877
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,280
I know.

878
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:11,070
Have a good night, Father.

879
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:13,950
There.

880
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:34,820
What about Auntie? Is she okay?

881
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,780
Yes. Well...

882
00:57:37,780 --> 00:57:42,610
I guess Auntie was relieved to hear what you said.

883
00:57:47,290 --> 00:57:49,650
Cut it out.

884
00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:51,960
Yes, stop it.

885
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:55,550
19-year-old Kang Hae Joon

886
00:57:55,550 --> 00:58:00,160
starts to feel lonely in the corner of his heart after his aunt leaves.

887
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,490
Come on.

888
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:04,860
All yours.

889
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:18,980
   

890
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:29,000


891
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:53,400
We are still preparing. I'm sorry.

892
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:05,270
You'll have to wait a little bit.

893
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:07,690
If you're okay with that...

894
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:12,970
You're Mr. Yoon Jeong Jae, right?

895
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:24,650
Do you remember me?

896
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,980
   

897
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:37,800
♫  Everything existed for us  ♫

898
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:43,280
♫  Like the sun in the clearest summer sky  ♫

899
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:55,140
♫  We were dazzling and were united as one  ♫
