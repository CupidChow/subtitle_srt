It also said whether it's soft or firm tofu on the package.

I heard Uncle and Ahjumma talking on the phone.

Ahjumma asked what would happen if Mom didn't wake up.

359
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,960
Let go!

360
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,480
Sit for now. I'll call the doctor.

361
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,790
Doctor... What good will a doctor do?

362
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,180
I'll just die now!

363
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,960
I thought I'd finally get to live properly after

364
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,630
losing a young child and getting divorced.

365
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,400
But what's this?

366
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:32,370
What's this? What kind of life is this?

367
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:37,250
What kind of shitty life is this?

368
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,250
Mom!

369
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:41,440
It was a big accident.

370
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,550
The hospital said this is a miracle for you.

371
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,180
A miracle?

372
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:52,400
Does this look like a miracle to you?

373
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,420
I won't be able to walk again!

374
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,180
Is this a miracle?

375
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,670
Let go!

376
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,640
You're happy now, huh?

377
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,370
You're happy the mom who abandoned you ended up this way, right?

378
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,500
I-If I'm to live...

379
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,080
If I'm to live this way,

380
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:16,340
I'm better off dead! Way better.

381
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,700
I'm better off dead. I'm better off dead!

382
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,350
Cut it out, seriously!

383
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,440
Mom!

384
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,070
How can you say you'll die so easily?

385
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,650
You don't want to live?

386
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:35,290
Is it over if you just die?

387
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,000
What about me?

388
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,920
What about Sohui?

389
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:44,070
How could you be so selfish to the end?

390
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:00,990
What do you know?

391
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:03,430
Did you get hurt?

392
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:07,150
I'm the one hurting more!

393
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,650
Oppa!

394
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,350
What about Mom?

395
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,910
Mom's doing fine now.

396
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:42,180
But it's such a shame.

397
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:46,480
Mom will need to get better to see Sohui.

398
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,350
Again?

399
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,640
I don't want this.

400
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,960
You said I'll get to see Mom!

401
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,990
You said Mom woke up. I want to see her now!

402
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,540
I'm sorry.

403
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,240
Sohui, come with Ahjumma.

404
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,270
- Okay?
- I don't want to.

405
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,530
I want to see Mom.

406
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:14,430
- Come on.
- I'm going to see Mom.

407
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,110
Don't take it to heart.

408
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:34,380
People say things they don't mean when they're hurting.

409
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,850
Yes, I know.

410
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,240
The problem starts from here.

411
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,130
She transferred to a general ward,

412
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:47,580
so she'll need a caretaker 24/7.

413
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,830
Which brings me to ask.

414
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:57,800
Sanha, how about you attend university in Seoul?

415
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,080
- Sorry?
- I mean...

416
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:04,330
I need to get back to work, too.

417
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:07,510
I've considered multiple options,

418
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,900
but you're the only one.

419
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,560
Can't you come to Seoul and stay with your mom and Sohui?

420
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,990
I'm sorry.

421
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,170
I came because I thought it'd be only for a few days.

422
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,300
- You know that.
- Of course, I do.

423
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,190
I do, but she's acting out like that, wanting to die as we speak.

424
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,560
I'm afraid she'll snap without anyone next to her.

425
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,780
Your mom isn't strong enough to be taken care of

426
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:43,010
by a stranger while rehabilitating.

427
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:46,970
We can't guarantee she'll be able to walk again.

428
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:48,760
We'll do our best,

429
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,710
but rehabilitation depends on the patient's will.

430
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:02,910
♫ The day I wept freely, surrendering all my pain and struggles ♫

431
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:12,250
♫ We loved all those days ♫

432
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:19,260
♫ We were just young with our hearts racing back then ♫

433
00:34:20,390 --> 00:34:22,800
[Yoon Juwon]

434
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,800
♫ We were consoling each other as if arguing without knowing why ♫

435
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,480
[Yoon Juwon]

436
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:38,680
♫ We probably didn't know what love meant ♫

437
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,530
♫ So we couldn't tell each other ♫

438
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,760
The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail-

439
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:54,710
♫ We probably didn't know what farewell meant ♫

440
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,360
♫ I just believed it all this time ♫

441
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:04,770
♫ Trying not to let go of your hand ♫

442
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:13,000
♫ Holding onto the memories of our journey ♫

443
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,370
You're up already?

444
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:24,040
It's not time to go to school yet.

445
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,730
Oppa, I'm sorry for throwing a tantrum at the hospital.

446
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,490
You didn't eat it and held on to it?

447
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,400
This, too.

448
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,460
It's from my birthday.

449
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,300
I'll let you make a wish with this.

450
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,540
Make a wish!

451
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,350
- I did.
- You have to speak it.

452
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:57,420
You have to speak it so it can come true.

453
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,710
Who'll listen?

454
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,590
I don't know, but you have to speak it.

455
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:03,300
That's what they taught me at school.

456
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,780
On my birthday, I said,

457
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,670
"Please give me a Secret Doll!"

458
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,530
And I really got a Secret Doll!

459
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:16,560
I guess someone was there to listen to your wish.

460
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,450
No one's there to listen to my wish.

461
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,010
Why not?

462
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,790
There never was.

463
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:56,610
Dad. Dad! Dad!

464
00:36:56,610 --> 00:37:00,310
Dad! Kim Sanha's coming home tomorrow!

465
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,760
Tomorrow? He's coming tomorrow?

466
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,250
Yeah.

467
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,600
Why isn't he answering?

468
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,510
He should be back by now after preparations.

469
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,200
Where did he go, leaving the door open?

470
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,080
Is he in the bathroom?

471
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,500
- Dad!
- Dad!

472
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,920
I'm fine. I'm fine.

473
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,420
I was just...

474
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,980
I was just dizzy for a moment.

475
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,600
Dad, what's wrong?

476
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,170
I'm fine.

477
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,030
I said I'm fine.

478
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,740
Aigoo, I'm fine.

479
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,350
Dad!

480
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,020
Dad, are you okay?

481
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,930
Do you recognize me?

482
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,750
Where am I? The hospital?

483
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:30,540
You're okay. The doctor said it was fatigue.

484
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,830
You don't have to be admitted.

485
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:34,530
You just have to finish the I.V. and rest at home.

486
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:37,980
What fatigue? I haven't even done anything.

487
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,870
You kept closing the store late.

488
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,120
What about school?

489
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,870
Is school important right now?

490
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,910
How could you miss school?

491
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:51,930
It'll become habitual once you miss a day.

492
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,260
Hey, you can go to school.

493
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,620
I'll stay here.

494
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,430
No, I want to stay, too.

495
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,310
I'll text you on the way home after the I.V.

496
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,850
You should go.

497
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:04,050
What use will you be here?

498
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,190
Ahjussi will be here soon, too.

499
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,540
Dad has to lie down in the car. There won't be any room.

500
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,160
Then, you go, Kang Haejun.

501
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:14,400
I don't need to since I only have academic counseling.

502
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,720
Go. Okay?

503
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:27,440
You should at least receive the attendance award.

504
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,390
Then, go home and rest, okay?

505
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:32,210
I'll go straight home after school.

506
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:58,820
Step on it. It's time for the lunch crowd.

507
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,710
How can you say that?

508
00:40:00,710 --> 00:40:03,260
The lunch crowd has grown recently.

509
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,230
Some are from the nearby construction site.

510
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:08,100
What if they come in vain?

511
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,560
Why do you keep overworking these days?

512
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,040
Including your prep time at dawn,

513
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,600
you spend almost 20 hours at the store.

514
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,750
See? Even he thinks you're overdoing it.

515
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,300
I take a break midway, though.

516
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,380
Then, stop by the store for a moment.

517
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,120
I should put up a sign saying we're closed for the day, so they'll come tomorrow.

518
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,800
I can do that myself.

519
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,330
Why trouble yourself? I can just go and-

520
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,480
Ahjussi, please drop me off here.

521
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,550
I can run from here.

522
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:57,590
Is he hungry for money?

523
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,890
He should have enough money.

524
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,430
Why are you exerting yourself these days?

525
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:16,240
You know the schools on the pamphlets?

526
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,560
I think they're good.

527
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,360
Is that why you suddenly extended store hours and caused this mess?

528
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,500
Did you even ask him if he wants to go to America?

529
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,540
Not a chance. How can I afford to send him to America?

530
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,270
Forget 10:00 p.m. I can't send him even if I work until midnight.

531
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:39,450
Yeah, that's why I couldn't even ask if he wanted to go to America.

532
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:42,760
I couldn't ask him because I can't send him.

533
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:48,940
If you can't send him to America,

534
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,420
then stop working late!

535
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,940
What are you doing? Beating your body up.

536
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:58,420
Stop overreacting. The doctor said it's just fatigue.

537
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,880
Quit it! Just quit it! Geez!

538
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,380
The meds cost even more!

539
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,920
Geez, I'm not deaf.

540
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,360
You're too harsh on someone who just got back from the hospital.

541
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:16,080
That's why I'm saying I need to get it together and save a penny more.

542
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,560
Then just send him.

543
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,310
How will you continue to face Haejun?

544
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:24,550
[Andam Pain Relief Patches]
Can you face him every day while regretting

545
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:27,030
not having sent him to America?

546
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,430
What are you doing here?

547
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:02,300
What about Dad?

548
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,750
Huh?

549
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:09,000
Why? Did he faint again?

550
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,890
He didn't. Go on up.

551
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:13,290
Here.

552
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:16,630
I'm going out for a while.

553
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,340
Where?

554
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,650
Seokhun asked to see me.

555
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,230
Who's Seokhun?

556
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:27,860
His best friend from the basketball team.

557
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,780
It looks like they have something to discuss.

558
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,910
Do you feel better?

559
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,020
You have medicinal hands.

560
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,900
See? I'm fine! Nothing's wrong with me.

561
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,790
If you don't go to America,

562
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:59,590
your dad will regret not sending you every time he sees you.

563
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,550
Isn't that what you're saying?

564
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:03,490
When did I ever say that?

565
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:05,180
That's what you just told me.

566
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:07,890
I'm summarizing what you said.

567
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:09,610
Shit!

568
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:10,930
Aigoo...

569
00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:12,940
Hey, just hit me!

570
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,440
Hit me and go to America!

571
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:24,690
I wasn't going to say this, but...

572
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:28,670
what else would you do here other than spend your dad's money?

573
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:32,770
Tell your birth dad to provide the money.

574
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:36,420
He hasn't spent a penny until now. Tell him to cough it up.

575
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,090
Use that money to study and make it big.

576
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,830
Then, return to fulfill your filial duty.

577
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:43,790
That's like buy one and get one free.*
(BOGO)

578
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:48,390
Gosh, I suck at math!

579
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:51,450
W-Was that considered math?

580
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,360
BOGO is arithmetic.

581
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:57,100
I know that!

582
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,060
I know...

583
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:05,080
that I'm just baggage.

584
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,280
But I still don't want to go.

585
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,810
I want to stay.

586
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:20,210
I want to stay.

587
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,780
Are you crying?

588
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,560
I'm not!

589
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:30,390
Cry in America if you're going to.

590
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:35,720
You think you can make money here or pursue academics?

591
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,820
What can you do properly?

592
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:43,310
There's nothing you can do here.

593
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,890
We'll be 20 years old next year.

594
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:54,540
Just playing basketball every day and going to the snack bar. That's over.

595
00:45:56,430 --> 00:45:59,300
Escape this hick town while you can.

596
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:02,650
Aren't you staying in this hick town?

597
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:07,230
I'm a hick down to my bones.

598
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:11,190
I like this hick town.

599
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,990
Whoa...

600
00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:36,200
Oh, good, good!

601
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,410
- Enjoy!
- Yes.

602
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,190
I'll do that!

603
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:45,070
There's nothing for you to do here.

604
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:48,460
Tell your birth dad to provide the money.

605
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:51,070
Use that money to study and make it big.

606
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:53,370
Then, return to fulfill your filial duty.

607
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:57,900
I'll do it. Get some rest.

608
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,980
I said I'll do it.

609
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:10,440
Try talking to Dad.

610
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:13,540
I tell him to rest, but he insists on running the dinner business.

611
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,180
He won't any longer.

612
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:16,810
He won't?

613
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:19,290
I'll stay here, so you can go home.

614
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:40,270
Shall we head home?

615
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,400
What's wrong?

616
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:04,410
Why is my son...

617
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:08,830
so irritated today?

618
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,700
I'll follow that Ahjussi to America.

619
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,130
What?

620
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,830
That Ahjussi...

621
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:26,220
I'll go with my birth dad.

622
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:32,910
What are you saying all of a sudden?

623
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,290
Why would you follow that Ahjussi?

624
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:38,450
Did he come by and say something to you again?

625
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:41,290
He spoke to you, too.

626
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:44,080
He said he'd have me play basketball in America.

627
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:48,970
You also said the townspeople talked to you

628
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,830
and brought up America.

629
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:57,340
You met him that day?

630
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:08,650
But I never meant...

631
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:13,010
you had to go with that Ahjussi.

632
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:14,820
You don't have to.

633
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:21,560
If you choose to go, I was going to send you.

634
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:29,310
You said you can't.

635
00:49:29,310 --> 00:49:33,030
Forget 10:00 p.m. I can't send him even if I work until midnight.

636
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,940
Yeah, that's why I couldn't even ask if he wanted to go to America.

637
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,060
I couldn't ask him because I can't send him.

638
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,770
Well, that was...

639
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,690
So,

640
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:59,200
I just have to go.

641
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,800
No, Haejun.

642
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,470
I always whine to Ahjussi.

643
00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:13,960
Those were just empty words.

644
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,350
Ahjussi listens to me, so I was just whining.

645
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:19,190
Don't worry about it.

646
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,540
After I leave,

647
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,610
don't overexert yourself.

648
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:40,250
I don't want you to suffer.

649
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:46,900
Say you won't overwork, so I won't have to worry in America.

650
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:02,870
Let's go. Juwon will whine about us being late.

651
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:41,230
Dad, you're up early.

652
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:45,180
I said let's order jjajangmyeon.

653
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,440
He's coming home after all this time. How can I feed him store-bought food?

654
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:51,150
Then, tell me what to buy. I'll go get it.

655
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:55,040
It's fine. I need to choose the good ingredients myself.

656
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:58,610
Don't tell Sanha I was in the hospital.

657
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:00,060
He'll worry needlessly.

658
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:04,160
But Dad, there are no secrets in this house.

659
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,910
You're right.

660
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,580
Get more sleep.

661
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:43,110
Where are you?

662
00:52:43,110 --> 00:52:44,590
[To Kim Sanha: Where are you?]

663
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:46,700
Daejeon.

664
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,590
Still?

665
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,430
You said you were in Daejeon!

666
00:53:16,430 --> 00:53:19,150
- I lied.
- Why would you lie?

667
00:53:19,150 --> 00:53:22,490
So you can be glad to see me sooner than you expected.

668
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:24,840
Have you been well?

669
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,600
I've been well.

670
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:28,890
Everyone's been well,

671
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:32,530
but Dad fainted and went to the hospital yesterday.

672
00:53:32,530 --> 00:53:34,930
And now? Is he better?

673
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:37,270
Yeah, he'll get better with rest.

674
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:41,500
He even went grocery shopping this morning to make you breakfast.

675
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:43,580
He shouldn't overdo it.

676
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:54,140
- What?
- It's good to see you after all this time.

677
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:57,910
It's only been a few days.

678
00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:00,070
- Let's go.
- Okay.

679
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:18,610
I can just eat what we have with roasted laver.

680
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,900
There are no secrets here.

681
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,840
I'll be quick. I'm not making much.

682
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:27,630
Wait a minute.

683
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:32,080
Someone go and buy some eggs.

684
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:33,430
Okay.

685
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:35,760
Rock, paper, scissors-

686
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,470
- What the heck?
- Huh?

687
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:42,980
Rock, paper, scissors, say shoot!

688
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:45,080
I always lose these things.

689
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,150
I'll be back!

690
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:49,980
Dad, just a pack of eggs, right?

691
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:53,040
Hey.

692
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,130
What is it?

693
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:19,500
Is it about your birth dad?

694
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,730
You're sharp as ever.

695
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:26,900
What else could it be?

696
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,450
What is it?

697
00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:38,910
I have something to say, too. Make it quick.

698
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:42,180
You do? What is it?

699
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:44,320
You, first.

700
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:53,560
- Well...
- What?

701
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,900
Did he ask you to go with him to America again?

702
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:59,800
Did you become a fortune teller in Seoul?

703
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,070
I don't have to. I can see right through you.

704
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:06,620
Tell him you won't go.

705
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:11,170
Even if he pursues it legally, you'll be an adult next year.

706
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,250
You don't have to go with him.

707
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,790
I decided to go.

708
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:33,090
Does Ahjussi know this?

709
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,810
You can't.

710
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:47,790
I'll return in no time.

711
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,700
- Before you graduate college-
- I'm leaving, too.

712
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:53,840
What?

713
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,450
We can't both leave.

714
00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:00,160
- Dad, the eggs!
- Okay.

715
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,930
- Crack a bunch in the bowl.
- Okay.

716
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:12,030
Ahjussi's not coming home until dinner?

717
00:57:12,030 --> 00:57:14,840
Yeah, what can he do? It's his job.

718
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:21,540
I have a bitter taste in my mouth.

719
00:57:23,350 --> 00:57:24,550
How is it?

720
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:26,590
What do you think?

721
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:28,640
It's delicious!

722
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:32,040
It's almost done. Tell them to come down.

723
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,000
Okay. It's so tasty.

724
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:42,050
I can't stay here.

725
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:46,640
He'd feel bad he couldn't send me to America whenever he saw me.

726
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:49,630
I can't do that to Dad.

727
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:51,390
I have to go.

728
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:56,200
Are you confident?

729
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:00,060
Are you sure you can be happy in America, where you don't know a soul?

730
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,790
Why couldn't I?

731
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:05,730
- Do you think you'd be fine away from here?
- Yeah.

732
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:08,340
I'll go and live my best life.

733
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:11,850
Anyone can see that you should be the one to stay here.

734
00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:14,210
Ahjussi will feel bad?

735
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:15,670
So what?

736
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:17,490
Then, you be good to him.

737
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:20,000
- You don't think you can?
- Hey!

738
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,850
Ahjussi raised you with such devotion.

739
00:58:23,850 --> 00:58:26,570
He raised someone else's kid without a drop of blood relation.

740
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:30,700
Now what? You're going to follow your birth dad?

741
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:31,820
Are you even human?

742
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,320
That's not why I'm leaving!

743
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,900
That's how it looks to other people!

744
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:45,130
Can you truly deny it?

745
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:48,040
Honestly, when you first met that Ahjussi,

746
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,460
you never once thought you'd be able to

747
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:53,790
live off your rich dad?

748
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:58,990
I dare you to say that again.

749
00:58:59,990 --> 00:59:04,220
Live off your rich dad.

750
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,330
Then, should we both leave? Huh?

751
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,740
Why are you fighting?

752
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,460
What do you mean?

753
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,000
Where are you two going?

754
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:45,940
How much...

755
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:49,490
How much of it did you hear?

756
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:54,440
When you started saying, "I'll live my best life."

757
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:59,490
And that you'll follow your birth dad.

758
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,760
Did I hear wrong?

759
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:10,940
No.

760
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,450
You heard right.

761
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:14,610
Hey!

762
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:16,520
I'll go to Seoul

763
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,570
and Kang Haejun will go to America with his birth dad.

764
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:20,880
I was going to tell you today, anyway.

765
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,190
Why do you have to put it like that?

766
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:27,320
They'll find out sooner or later. What's the point of lying?

767
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:30,400
Did I tell you to lie? Just don't say it like that!

768
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:33,890
Then how exactly should I say it?

769
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:35,650
That won't change anything.

770
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:38,760
Will you stay here? You won't leave?

771
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,370
So,

772
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:48,210
both of you are leaving home?

773
01:00:51,680 --> 01:00:53,400
So,

774
01:00:54,380 --> 01:01:00,180
both of you will go to your real family?

775
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:14,300
♫ I know you're in pain even if you don't tell me ♫

776
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:28,890
♫ That these hidden feelings that grew on their own like wildflowers are painful ♫

777
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:30,800
[Family by Choice]

778
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,420
When you're apart, you grow more affectionate.

779
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:35,140
When I return, I'll never leave again.

780
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:36,840
Don't try too hard over there.

781
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:40,100
Come back once you think you've done enough.

782
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:43,860
Who'd return to this hick town with a college degree?

783
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:46,350
Someone weird keeps loitering around your store.

784
01:01:46,350 --> 01:01:49,070
He sounds suspicious, so be careful.

785
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:52,490
Yoon Juwon. Are you okay? Are you hurt?

786
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:54,650
How can you act as if nothing happened?

787
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:57,390
I thought you never dated bakery customers.

788
01:01:57,390 --> 01:01:59,870
What will I do if Juwon ends up meeting that Hyungnim?

789
01:01:59,870 --> 01:02:02,130
Can we talk for a moment?
