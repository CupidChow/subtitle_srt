00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,190
[Kim Sanha]

185
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,680
One, two, three!

186
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:33,220
What's up?

187
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,370
Did you eat?

188
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,290
Yeah, I did.

189
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,880
Hello?

190
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,070
Aren't you going to ask me?

191
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:51,500
Look at the time!

192
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,290
You probably already ate.

193
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,720
You still always asked if I'd eaten.

194
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,730
And you'd tell me to eat if I hadn't.

195
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,270
Or ask me what I ate if I had.

196
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,330
Ahjussi wants you to come to eat tomorrow.

197
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,050
No! I'll go separately!

198
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:18,100
I need to do market research tomorrow. Yeah.

199
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,300
- I'll see you tomorrow!
- Ju-

200
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,300
[Juwon]

201
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,170
You want me to go with you?

202
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,410
Huh?

203
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,290
You said you're doing market research in the morning.

204
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,220
I'm just going to look around.

205
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,620
It's okay.

206
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,160
Who was that on the phone?

207
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,020
Kim Sanha.

208
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,250
Yeah?

209
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,630
But why were you so awkward?

210
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,970
Did something happen with you and Sunbae?

211
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,630
I like you.

212
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:07,140
It took me ten years to tell you that I like you.

213
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,820
Was it obvious?

214
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,370
Yeah, very.

215
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,430
I have clients who claim they don't know anything,

216
00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:21,020
but I can tell that they're lying right away.

217
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:26,490
You just sounded exactly like them.

218
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,850
You're not oblivious.

219
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,030
You know what I'm trying to tell you.

220
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,920
I don't know what I should do!

221
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:40,280
I don't know!

222
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,070
What about the store you looked into?

223
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:06,890
Just tell Ahjussi about it.

224
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:09,990
It's fine. I found a way.

225
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:12,130
What way?

226
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,290
Give me a heads-up if you'll do something stupid.

227
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,870
You just worry about yourself.

228
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,590
You still have something to tell Ahjussi, too.

229
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:20,070
I'll take care of myself.

230
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,440
You escalate small matters!

231
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,550
Your fiery mouth is still the same.

232
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,010
I'm telling you not to make any trouble!

233
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,890
When did I ever make trouble?

234
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,080
Don't you remember when Juwon fell into the pond?

235
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,650
You call yourself an oppa and call her crazy?

236
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:37,110
Geez, that was ages ago!

237
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,180
Oppas!

238
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,880
Where did you come from?

239
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,160
I was waiting for you guys.

240
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,890
Let's go eat meat.

241
00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:47,220
It's been forever since I had meat! Delicious!

242
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,400
I heard it's Korean beef today!

243
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,770
Korean beef! Meat!

244
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,120
Meat!

245
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,590
Meat!

246
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,100
Meat!

247
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:08,620
Oppa! Pass me the salt.

248
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,240
What? Me?

249
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,860
Yeah!

250
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,380
Sure, sure.

251
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,030
Oppa, pass me the onion.

252
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:33,130
How did you live without calling them Oppa all this time?

253
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,790
Exactly. I'll say it all at once to make up for it.

254
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,540
I should call them a lot so I can adjust quickly.

255
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,230
I have something to say.

256
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:09,850
What is it?

257
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,520
What is it?

258
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,990
Let's...

259
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,090
get married.

260
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,560
Why not?

261
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,100
It's not like it's out of the question!

262
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,590
Didn't you also say back then?

263
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,360
That we can't inherit anything, and it's useless even if we win the lottery.

264
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,290
Dad and Ahjussi don't have to go through a complicated adoption process.

265
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,890
All of that is possible if you and I get married!

266
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,380
We don't need to inherit the one store Mr. Yoon owns.

267
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,420
And I don't even dream about empty hope like winning the lottery anymore.

268
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,920
If you want to legally become family,

269
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,150
how about one of you think about adoption?

270
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:14,660
No! Not his son.

271
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,120
Madam said a son-in-law is better than a son.

272
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,550
Dang it.

273
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,620
Tell Dad to adopt a daughter if you want to become his son-in-law!

274
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:24,250
- Why do you keep involving me?
- That's enough!

275
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,180
Haejun, you shouldn't talk about that, either.

276
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,710
And you just laugh it off!

277
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,170
Hey, the idea itself is innovative.

278
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,730
- Not bad, right?
- Cut the nonsense and eat.

279
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,050
Haejun was...

280
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:13,110
I know why Kang Haejun- I mean, Yang Haejun is acting like that.

281
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,050
Anyway, don't take what Haejun says seriously.

282
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,790
Okay.

283
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,870
I don't take what you said seriously, either.

284
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,060
Don't you remember?

285
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,720
When I was in elementary school, I said I'd marry you.

286
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,970
It's like that.

287
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,570
Since I like you, and we're all we have.

288
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:40,600
Since I can't imagine you missing from my life.

289
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,980
So?

290
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,390
So...

291
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:56,210
I'll pretend you never said anything.

292
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:58,390
I won't take it seriously.

293
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,400
Then, let's start over.

294
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,420
As you said, let's pretend this never happened and start over.

295
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,980
Not 7-year-old Yoon Juwon or 17-year-old Yoon Juwon.

296
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,790
Let me start as a man 27-year-old Yoon Juwon met for the first time.

297
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,440
Give me a chance.

298
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,390
Give me a chance because Yoon Juwon is my entire world.

299
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,780
I'll go down first.

300
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:33,110
Do you really like Juwon?

301
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,410
I do!

302
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,370
Not like that, punk.

303
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,580
You must've dated in America.

304
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,570
Oh, they're different from Juwon.

305
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,420
"They"?

306
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,520
How many were there?

307
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,900
- Just a few.
- You, you!

308
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,120
Juwon is a lot more important than those girls!

309
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,720
What are you saying to him?

310
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:00,020
You're all my kids I've fed and raised.

311
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,520
No matter what kind of guy Juwon brings home,

312
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,940
it won't change the fact that both of you are my sons.

313
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,610
Understood?

314
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:17,870
- You!
- All right.

315
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,150
You wouldn't understand me.

316
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:23,280
You came back without hesitation since your dad was here.

317
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,210
But I really hesitated coming back here.

318
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,050
"Can I go back?"

319
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,130
"Can I really go back?"

320
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,780
But if we're legally bound, I no longer have to worry!

321
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,920
Then, what am I to you?

322
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,520
You? You're my...

323
00:23:42,090 --> 00:23:44,140
younger brother, and I'm the hyung.

324
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,280
Since my birthday comes first.

325
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,030
Do you need to be legally bound to me?

326
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:54,390
I don't need those things.

327
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:23,790
Who is it?

328
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,360
One month?

329
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,070
Yeah, I told him to rest for just a month. No longer than that.

330
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:33,450
You know I need rehabilitation at the hospital.

331
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,090
Is it going well?

332
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,930
I'm barely getting through it,

333
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,890
but each trip to the hospital is difficult without Sanha.

334
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,660
But forget about me. What about Sohui?

335
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:43,730
Sohui is still a minor.

336
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:46,550
How could he push his responsibility on her for his comfort?

337
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,650
He's so selfish!

338
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,380
Sanha suffered through it all this time.

339
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,300
I know. He must've been stressed, too.

340
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,430
That's why I sent him!

341
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,550
He doesn't need to stay exactly one month,

342
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,750
so tell him to come back to Seoul when he's better.

343
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,030
What's one month?

344
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:20,290
She said she sent Sanha to rest for just one month.

345
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:24,690
Rest? Didn't he transfer his hospital for good?

346
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,370
He did.

347
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,020
He's currently working there.

348
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,620
I don't know.

349
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:32,750
What did the two of them discuss?

350
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,360
Don't concern yourselves.

351
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,710
There must be a misunderstanding.

352
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,240
I'll ask Sanha in person.

353
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,170
- What's this?
- Jujube tea.

354
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:50,560
I brewed it last night, but I forgot to give it to Sanha earlier.

355
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,330
He had insomnia back then. I'm sure he's fine now.

356
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:56,930
You never know. Working at the hospital must be rough, too.

357
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,400
Dad.

358
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,820
Do you think he lied to Ahjumma about staying for a month

359
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,350
when he actually returned for good?

360
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,750
What will he do after a month?

361
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,020
Ahjussi said he'll ask him, so don't mention it to Sanha.

362
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,630
He shouldn't worry about us when he's busy already. Go!

363
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,420
All right.

364
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:25,380
Drive safely. Wear your seat belt and pay attention to the traffic lights.

365
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,130
All right!

366
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,470
He says he's fine even when he's not,

367
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,530
so you keep an eye on him from his side.

368
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,460
All right.

369
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,850
What?

370
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,600
What's the use of keeping an eye on him?

371
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,820
Past or present,

372
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,890
he still hides his struggles from me.

373
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,880
[Sohui: Mom and I are doing fine!]

374
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,800
Mom and I are doing fine!

375
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,290
Mom is getting well enough that she doesn't need me.

376
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,600
Oppa, you're coming back to Seoul in a month, right?

377
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,910
Help me convince Mom to send me to English camp when you're back.

378
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,590
All my friends are going!

379
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,850
You made my life like this!

380
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,270
Good morning.

381
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,670
- What's this?
- Huh?

382
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,530
Hold on a second.

383
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,330
Dad asked me to give you that.

384
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,080
- What is it?
- Jujube tea.

385
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,060
Are you sleeping well these days?

386
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,860
Are you worrying about me?

387
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,430
It's because Dad and Ahjussi are worried.

388
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,620
It's similar for all residents.

389
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,830
I sleep well, considering.

390
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,680
You're really okay, right?

391
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:52,530
I could be happier if someone gave me a chance.

392
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,640
Go!

393
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,570
Juwon!

394
00:29:57,570 --> 00:29:59,250
See you later.

395
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,450
No.

396
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,170
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

397
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:32,170
He saw me in worse states back then.

398
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:45,270
So, you and Juwon getting married?

399
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:48,400
No!

400
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:52,480
The thought just crossed my mind.

401
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,420
Just for a moment!

402
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,480
Whether it was for a moment or not,

403
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,920
what's stopping you?

404
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,880
You two are unrelated.

405
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,450
Why not check it now?

406
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,940
Check what?

407
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:07,020
Could you...

408
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,990
kiss Juwon?

409
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,160
Come on! Why would I do that?

410
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,710
Why not?

411
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:17,620
Didn't you think about that when the idea of marrying her crossed your mind?

412
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,020
That's your problem.

413
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:24,560
You have no thought process.

414
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:28,690
What comes before marriage?

415
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,870
- Marriage license?
- Dating!

416
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:37,550
And what do you do while dating?

417
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:40,190
Geez, what's with the 20 questions?

418
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:44,360
You have to hold hands and kiss!

419
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,860
That's a given!

420
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:48,300
Hold hands? Kiss?

421
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,740
- Close your eyes.
- What do you want?

422
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,140
You crazy?

423
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:56,460
Not me! Close your eyes and think about Yoon Juwon.

424
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,810
Yoon Juwon is in front of you.

425
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:06,060
Her face is approaching yours.

426
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,550
From where?

427
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,100
From here! Again.

428
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:17,020
Yoon Juwon is in front of you.

429
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:21,390
Her face is approaching yours.

430
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:26,100
You grab Yoon Juwon's face.

431
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:33,610
She slowly approaches you...

432
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:39,690
Very slowly...

433
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,480
I-I hate it!

434
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,860
I-I was wrong.

435
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,890
This is wrong.

436
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:54,770
What's gotten into you?

437
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:56,140
You said we should get married.

438
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,500
You said my face is getting closer.

439
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,430
Is your heart fluttering? Do you want to get married?

440
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:04,320
Don't lay a finger on my body!

441
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,770
Everyone can hear you. The store's small.

442
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:12,080
Sunbae, how can you do this as someone who works as a sacred teacher?

443
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,860
I knew from the start that you two can't be.

444
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,520
- What?
- Huh?

445
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,890
However, I suggested this method as a shock therapy

446
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,560
to help you realize it quickly.

447
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,250
- I know that's not true.
- Stop lying.

448
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,950
I'll get going first since Jaeeun's waiting for me.

449
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:33,550
- Thanks for the drink.
- Seriously.

450
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,680
W-Well, he kind of forced it...

451
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,960
This situation and my mood. How will you compensate for it?

452
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,980
What should I do? What do you need me to do?

453
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,290
Your hands are getting weak.

454
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,500
You're not doing your best. Scrub harder!

455
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,340
Harder!

456
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,380
Need me to hold your hands one more time?

457
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,390
I let you off the hook with a warning this time.

458
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:18,800
Yes, I know. Thanks.

459
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:23,400
Where do I throw this out?

460
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,850
Dad won't let you go.

461
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:33,530
Your room stayed the same even after you went to the U.S.

462
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,880
Dad cleaned the room so often, too.

463
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,610
He probably cleaned every time he thought of you.

464
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:42,450
He refused it when I said to use it as storage.

465
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:45,840
Because you need to sleep there once you come back.

466
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,860
Because it's your room.

467
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,870
Is that right?

468
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:56,590
Forget I said we're not family.

469
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:01,620
Honestly, can't a sister be mad at her brother for not coming home for 10 years?

470
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,320
Everything you said is right.

471
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,160
Instead, I'll call you "oppa" from now on.

472
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,080
Oppa.

473
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:16,660
I think I'm fine. I don't think I need that.

474
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,050
Haejun oppa-

475
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,840
Gosh, stop that!

476
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,300
- Oppa.
- Stop that.

477
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,410
- Oppa. Oppa. Oppa.
- Stop that.

478
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:27,390
Stop that. Stop it. Stop!

479
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:29,360
- Don't come!
- Haejun oppa!

480
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,970
Don't come closer, Yoon Juwon!

481
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:33,270
Don't leave, Kang Haejun!

482
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,470
Stop it!

[Mr. Yoon's Kalguksu]

484
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,930
She knows I moved hospitals.

485
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:51,480
I told her everything.

486
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,870
But why did she say one month?

487
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:55,310
You know how Mom is.

488
00:35:55,310 --> 00:36:00,470
Mom thinks I'd do that just because she said so.

489
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:04,060
So, you have no interest in going back to Seoul?

490
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:06,480
After all I did to come back here?

491
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,920
I don't.

492
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:11,350
What will you do after a month?

493
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:15,730
Well, she can't drag me up there, can she?

494
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:18,450
I knew something was off.

495
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:23,370
You couldn't come for a holiday once but were suddenly here for good.

496
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:26,000
It's not because something happened?

497
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,420
No.

498
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,000
What did your mom do to you this time?

499
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,760
You won't talk?

500
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,520
That's not it. Nothing happened.

501
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:44,700
- My goodness!
- He said nothing happened. He said so.

502
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,930
Cut it out now.

503
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,350
I've done more than enough, Father.

504
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,730
I mean it.

505
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:56,710
Do you think I don't know that?

506
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,350
You need to tell me what's going on!

507
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,030
There's nothing I didn't tell you.

508
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:05,690
I'll make sure not to worry you.

509
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,210
You punk! Whether I worry or not is not the problem.

510
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:14,300
You need to tell your dad what's going on if something's wrong!

511
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,000
Damn it.

512
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,860

519
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:59,750
It's really true nothing happened, right?

520
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,530
Is it something you can't tell me, either?

521
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,180
I see. Well, I'll believe what you said, then.

00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,890
Your dad's just upset.

523
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:18,050
He thinks you're not telling him because he's unreliable.

524
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:20,020
What's there to tell him?

525
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,900
I made myself clear to Mom.

Yeah. You go ahead.

N-No, it's fine.

00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,390
This much aching is common when you get old.

533

So, you do have an ache.

Please come tomorrow. I'll contact you.

They said to strike the iron while it's hot.

Come on. I'm here with you at the hospital, aren't I?

00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:31,100
I even closed the store for the day.

542
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,830
A store owner closed the store for the day?

543
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,690
That's love.

544
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,540
You honestly agree with me, right?

545
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,340
I do.

546
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,880
- Mr. Yoon Jeongjae.
- Yes.

547
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,810
Okay...

548
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,560
It feels tingly, too?

549
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,510
Yes, a little.

550
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,440
What about the other leg?

551
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,450
That leg also feels tingly sometimes, right?

552
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,610
It does happen at night, but it's not severe.

553
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,910
It doesn't seem to be a simple muscle pain.

554
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,300
Let's take an x-ray.

555
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:09,720
[Department of Radiology]

556
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,960
[The bathroom is currently under repair maintenance.]

557
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:27,940
I was not in my right mind last time.

558
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:30,510
I shouldn't have taken it out on you, Doctor.

559
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:34,210
It's just that when you said my dad might not walk again,

560
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:39,570
I was worried he might really never get to walk again.

561
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:44,380
I was too overwhelmed about what to do.

562
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:50,250
I also felt guilty having those thoughts.

563
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:55,150
At first...

564
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:58,700
you don't know why this is happening to you.

565
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,280
You'll get angry and frustrated.

566
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,150
You'll be tormented.

567
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:08,750
But he's still alive.

568
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:14,560
I think that's more than enough.

569
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,330
Because that's what you were most desperate for.

570
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,620
Everything will be okay.

571
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,610
Thank you.

572
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,380
You're really a doctor.

573
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,240
I graduated medical school at the top of the class.

574
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:52,570
Does medical school teach how to empathize, too?

575
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:54,930
Were you also at the top of the class for that?

576
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,300
Your hand.

577
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,470
No, your left hand.

578
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,090
♫ I keep clattering ♫

579
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:29,800
♫ Like a broken doll ♫

580
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:35,030
♫ Every star loses its way ♫

581
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:40,890
How did you know my left wrist was in pain?

582
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:43,220
It's obvious if you care.

583
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:48,930
♫ My day is full of hopes about my dream ♫

584
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:50,820
I'll begin.

585
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,620
♫ There's a lot I want to say ♫

586
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:59,670
Is it okay? It's not too hot, right?

587
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:04,180
How is it?

588
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,980
Is it bearable?

589
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,650
♫ How in the world do I? ♫

590
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:21,740

592

♫ I pray and circle around you ♫

♫ When our eyes meet ♫

595
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:37,170

00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,300

♫ Do you understand what this means? ♫

600
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:59,300
The nurse will come later and wrap it up for you.

601
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,640
Why did you have to whisper that?

602
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,830
No reason.

603
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:05,490
Stay here for a minute.

604
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,990
Yes. Is Dad okay?

605
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,980
I'm glad. Okay, I'll be in the lobby.

606
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,850
Hey, does Kang Haejun have a girlfriend or not?

607
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:46,620
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

608
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:48,200
He doesn't?

609
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:51,070
But I think there's a woman he wants to marry.

610
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:52,730
Marry? Who is it?

611
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,500
What does she do? Did they date for long?

612
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,450
You said you live together. You must know.

613
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:57,980
Gosh, I really don't know!

614
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,290
Hey, you've seen her, haven't you?

615
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:01,830
- You have. Is she pretty?
- I haven't.

616
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:04,110
- Hey, aren't you being too mean?
- What?

617
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,930
I mean...

618
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,250
Why do you look so happy?

619
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:22,910
Those two look so great together.

620
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:26,060
I think Sanha will be the first one to get married.

621
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:32,060
Yes, once you start getting married, one by one,

622
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:36,720
I'll be seeing grandkids and become a grandpa in no time.

623
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,200
You're happy about becoming a grandpa?

624
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,940
- I don't know.
- Come on, tell me.

625
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,450
Later. Ahjussi!

626
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,120
You're all done?

627
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,720
My back feels better already.

628
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,910
Just a few more treatments and the aching will be resolved.

629
00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:00,840
Yes, thanks to you, Sanha.

630
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:05,610
By the way, who's the doctor who greeted me?

631
00:46:05,610 --> 00:46:07,130
You two seem very close.

632
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:10,240
Oh, it's not like that. We're high school friends.

633
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,200
She's also my college alumni.

634
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,200
Oh, Juwon, you know Huiju, too, right?

635
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,510
I do know her.

636
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:20,060
Really? You even work together. That's no ordinary connection.

637
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,120
Of course. That's no ordinary connection.

638
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,500
She used to date Kang Haejun.

639
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,910
I see...

640
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,260
What? Date Haejun?

641
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,330
She dumped Kang Haejun and failed to secure a rebound relationship.

642
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:32,880
Is that so? With whom?

643
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,820
I don't know. I wonder who?

644
00:46:44,490 --> 00:46:46,510
Oh, my God!

645
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,290
You're home?

646
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:51,340
What are you doing over there?

647
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,460
You slept here?

648
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,550
Is Ahjussi's condition that bad?

649
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:11,000
No, he's fine.

650
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:13,700
That's good to hear.

651
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:18,600
[Mom]

652
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,230
My mom's back at it again.

653
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:24,290
Again? A blind date?

654
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:27,670
Yeah, another blind date.

655
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:32,970
Mom knows I'm no good with strangers.

656
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:36,270
As soon as I sit down, it's like getting interviewed.

657
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,930
We ask about hobbies, specialties, salaries, and retirement plans.

658
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:43,500
How does she expect my heart to flutter for someone like that?

659
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,140
Heart fluttering?

660
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,440
It's obvious if you care.

661
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:53,230
Heart-fluttering?

662
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,590
Heart-fluttering. That's the problem.

663
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:02,650
Why is that a problem?

664
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,630
Someone must've made your heart flutter recently.

665
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,620
And if they did?

666
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,560
Is that such a big deal?

667
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,410
My heart flutters when I bake perfect cake sheets, and

668
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:17,740
when a first-time customer says my cake is delicious.

669
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:20,060
My heart is a-always fluttering!

670
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,270
You call that heart-fluttering?

671
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,320
Did you know? After my clients'

672
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:34,310
"I didn't know anything!" phase, the next phase is,

673
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:36,930
"I must've misunderstood!"

674
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:38,410
It's that.

675
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:40,880
Misunderstand?

676
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,860
You're right! I must've misunderstood.

677
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,410
You're right! I misunderstood! That's it!

678
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,260
How long must I act oblivious when she's being that obvious?

679
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,880
Of course!

680
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,360
Is heart-fluttering such a big deal?

681
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,260
Could be out of worry for Kim Sanha.

682
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:03,420
It could flutter because...

683
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,220
he's fine, thanks to me.

684
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:11,290
That's all touching! My heart flutters because it's all touching.

685
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:13,500
Familial love. It's just familial love.

686
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,420
I shouldn't misunderstand that for heart-fluttering.

687
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:18,870
Yes.

688
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,380
When do you end work tomorrow?

689
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,410
Do you want to grab dinner?

690
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:36,200
This is the place where most of the electricity we use is generated

691
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:39,130
from hydropower and nuclear power.

692
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:43,180
This yellow ball you see here is called Uranium.

693
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:49,310
Generating electricity with this uranium is called nuclear energy.

694
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:51,910
Isn't that dangerous if there's an earthquake?

695
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:54,670
You might be worried about it collapsing if there's an earthquake

696
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:57,360
like our friend over there.

697
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,850
That's why it's designed to be earthquake-resistant.

698
00:50:00,850 --> 00:50:03,130
Earthquake-resistant design is building

699
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:06,360
structures to withstand or absorb the earthquake shock.

700
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:11,270
They make it this safe, so there's no reason for our friends to get worried, right?

701
00:50:11,270 --> 00:50:13,070
Yes!

702
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:14,510
See you next time!

703
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:16,700
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

704
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,790
Please follow me!

705
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:22,230
Hold your partner's hand!

706
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:23,770
Auntie!

707
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:41,620
Are you really Haejun?

708
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:44,110
How are you exactly the same?

709
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:45,860
You've become more cool.

710
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,550
How are you so good at those explanations?

711
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:55,550
Let's go. I'll buy you something delicious.

712
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:11,090
You should eat, too.

713
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:12,830
One might think I'm acting like a child.

714
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:14,850
Should I order you another one?

715
00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:16,170
I'll finish this first.

716
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:18,850
Why? Eat one more!

717
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:24,200
Didn't you always say bulgogi burgers were the tastiest in the world?

718
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,410
They don't have bulgogi burgers in America.

719
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:34,300
That really stuck in my head when you went to America.

720
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:48,420
Auntie!

721
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:50,960
Yeah.

722
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:54,350
What?

723
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,560
Never mind. Get going!

724
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,190
I'm leaving.

725
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,550
She hasn't contacted you, right?

726
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:15,210
I was just wondering.

727
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:20,920
I got a new phone number, so not many people know it.

728
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,920
There's no one to contact me.

729
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,410
Take care.

730
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,450
- I'll get going then.
- Okay.

731
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:01,640
Why did Auntie have to bring up Mom?

732
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,660
Of course! Of course.

733
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:37,390
It ended early today since I just got prescriptions.

734
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:40,250
Yeah, and I bought everything I needed to.

735
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:44,250
I have to get going to prepare for dinner hours.

736
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,960
Yeah, I'll call you back. It's nothing.

737
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:50,750
- Aigoo, it's fine.
- I'm sorry.

738
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:52,050
There's nothing that can shatter.

739
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,340
- But still.
- Yes, yes. I'm sorry.

740
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,190
Gosh, I'm sorry.

741
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,990
Why are you here?

742
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,350
I...

743
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:37,810
What?

744
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:42,090
Why?

745
00:54:45,230 --> 00:54:47,220
It's nothing.

746
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:54,070
Are you going to tell Juwon?

747
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:56,430
I have no intention of telling her.

748
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:58,020
Don't you remember?

749
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,480
I didn't tell her back then, either.

750
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:05,600
That's right. You didn't.

751
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:12,630
But this time, it'll come with a price.

752
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:16,070
What price?

753
00:55:16,070 --> 00:55:17,820
Can you...

754
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,930
be my boyfriend?

755
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:37,070
You could just ask me to ruin your blind date.

756
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:39,830
You surprised me when you asked me to be your boyfriend.

757
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:46,720
Well, you are my boyfriend for a day.

758
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:50,270
But is that really necessary?

759
00:55:50,270 --> 00:55:55,090
You can just tell him, "Sorry, but I don't think we're suited for each other."

760
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:58,090
I tried that a couple of times.

761
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:02,350
- Couple?
- But Mom keeps arranging another date.

762
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:10,350
So, will you help me or not?

763
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,810
What kind of boyfriend do you want?

764
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:25,740
Ihyeon told me...

765
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:29,390
Haejun came back to Korea.

766
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:33,750
You kept in touch with your younger sister?

767
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:35,600
No.

768
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,750
I didn't.

769
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:41,620
She contacted me recently after a long time.

770
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:44,750
She said I should at least be aware.

771
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:52,520
Let's not wait and call Haejun over here.

772
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,150
No.

773
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,300
I didn't come to meet him.

774
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:02,660
I just came to get a glimpse of his face.

775
00:57:04,050 --> 00:57:07,790
You must've come all the way here because you want to see him.

776
00:57:08,790 --> 00:57:11,970
No. It's not like that.

777
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:21,810
Did you know Haejun injured his leg in America?

778
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:24,700
- Sorry?
- That's why he quit basketball.

779
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:30,780
Can you imagine how much he must've suffered alone in that far and foreign country?

780
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:35,240
Sure.

781
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:38,600
See him before you go.

782
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,430
It's not a hard request.

783
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:45,520
No, please just pretend you never saw me today.

784
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,550
Hey, wait! Wait a minute.

785
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:55,050
Are you scared Haejun will be mad at you? He won't.

786
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:59,090
He'll forget you never called him all this time with just one hug from you.

787
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:01,920
How can you not know your own son?

788
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:05,740
It doesn't matter.

789
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:14,110
How could you be so coldhearted?

790
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:16,060
Don't follow me! I said I won't see him.

791
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,350
No!

792
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,590
I can't do that.

793
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:22,250
I deeply regretted it 10 years ago, too.

794
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:27,040
If I had held onto you then, Haejun could've seen his mom's face at least once.

795
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,560
- I...
- Yes?

796
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:36,340
I killed someone.

797
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,780
I killed someone.

798
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,420
Is this really enough?

799
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:00,050
This place is really good.

800
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:05,600
Good as always.

801
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,930
I told you I'd buy you something delicious.

802
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:14,320
I must be really happy these days.

803
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:19,640
My life was good and uneventful even without you and Haejun,

804
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:26,240
but I'm a lot happier now that you guys are back.

805
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:32,720
It feels like we're back in high school when the three of us are together.

806
00:59:36,570 --> 00:59:40,800
But we're no longer 17 and 19 years old.

807
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,970
It feels like back then, but it's not.

808
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:50,890
I don't want things to become awkward between us.

809
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:53,690
So, I'm not going to give you

810
00:59:55,390 --> 00:59:57,270
the chance you asked for.

811
00:59:57,270 --> 01:00:01,030
- Yoon Juwon.
- Kim Sanha is Yoon Juwon's oppa.

812
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:03,710
We can't become anything else.

813
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:30,910
What should we do?

814
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:34,290
I'll buy an umbrella from the convenience store.

815
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:37,130
Let's just run to the parking lot.

816
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:39,430
It won't take long.

817
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:41,790
It's raining heavily- Juwon!

818
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:04,550
Gosh, how could you run so recklessly?

819
01:01:04,550 --> 01:01:06,960
I thought it would let up.

820
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,980
Let me see. You're drenched.

821
01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:16,970
I'll do it.

822
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,400
Juwon.

823
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:25,200
Juwon.

824
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:28,500
Yoon Juwon.

825
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:34,950
