00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,170
Is Juwon your child?

188
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,110
No, sir.

189
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:35,650
Juwon! Here!

190
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:42,370
You smell like the pond.

191
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,230
I can't help it.

192
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,110
Today was a total success, right?

193
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:49,890
I'm so dirty that they can't touch me.

194
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,560
Must be nice to be dirty.

195
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,440
Are you mad?

196
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,440
I'm not mad. I'm worried.

197
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,840
It's getting colder out.

198
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,710
If you'll be mad, be equally mad.

199
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,140
Why are you only mad at me?

200
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,590
Let's go.

201
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,820
What is the smell?

202
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,110
What?

203
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,740
Did someone fart?

204
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,780
What's wrong with this bus?

205
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,740
It's bad...

206
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,970
- Do you have an umbrella?
- No.

207
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:15,140
The news said it would be clear today.

208
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,320
You two stay here.

209
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,750
I'll go get an umbrella.

210
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,390
It's just a drizzle. Let's just run.

211
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,470
- No, the rain-
- Let's go.

212
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,060
Wait for me!

213
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:54,170
♫ Like the flowery path ♫

214
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,960
♫ Everything existed for us ♫

215
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:03,700
♫ Like the sun in the clearest summer sky ♫

216
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:15,100
♫ We were shining so brightly and so united ♫

217
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,150
Get inside!

218
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,780
Aigoo!

219
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,580
Hello.

220
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,980
Hi, hi.

221
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,880
You're soaked.

222
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,610
Juwon, where's your uniform?

223
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,550
- In here.
- No, no, no.

224
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,750
Let's share an umbrella.

225
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,350
Kids should get rained on to be healthy.

226
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,990
They're not kids. They're all grown up.

227
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,760
Aigoo, time flies.

228
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,040
You used to be this big when I first met you.

229
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:53,770
So, haven't you heard from your mom yet?

230
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,140
Pardon?

231
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,550
No.

232
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,720
What an interesting bunch you are.

233
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,290
I know.

234
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:08,090
My goodness, you are all so unfortunate.

235
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,210
No. We're not unfortunate at all.

236
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:14,580
Who's ordinary in this world? What family doesn't have a story?

237
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,450
Everyone is special in their own way.

238
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,560
Sure, of course.

239
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,250
We are all special.

240
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,020
That's not what I meant.

241
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:30,330
As your neighbor, I was trying to express my interest in your well-being.

242
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:34,140
Stop it. They don't want your interest.

243
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,320
You said you left laundry out to dry. Let's go.

244
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,690
- Let's go.
- Bye.

245
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:44,750
- Are we special?
- Yes!

246
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,930
Are you listening to me?

247
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,700
Sons aren't your only kids, you know.

248
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,900
You always make what Kang Haejun likes. Especially lately.

249
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,380
You like it, too.

250
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,910
Then we don't need that legal adoption thing, right?

251
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,040
Oh, no, no.

252
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,080
Do you think I suggested it just to stop relaying love letters?

253
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:25,940
Considering everything, I think it would be better to do it.

254
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,870
Then, we don't need to hear weird stuff from the neighbors.

255
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,200
Weird stuff?

256
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,610
Like what? Did someone say something?

257
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,630
If one of us gets hurt, who signs the consent form for surgery?

258
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,540
Stop talking about bad stuff. Just eat.

259
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,950
It applies to good stuff, too.

260
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,690
Let's say I won the lottery, hypothetically.

261
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,170
But on my way from depositing money in the bank,

262
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,570
I get into a car accident.

263
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,550
Only my dad will see that money.

264
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:01,100
You guys won't get any of it!

265
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,660
That's an example of a good thing? For me to get your inheritance?

266
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,410
No.

267
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,960
You can't even buy a lottery ticket yet.

268
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,990
I know. That's why I said "hypothetically."

269
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:15,250
Life is about preparations.

270
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,490
Why do we get vaccinated? We don't get it after we get the flu.

271
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,690
Just eat.

272
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,810
If you eat well and sleep well, you won't get the flu.

273
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,000
Of course.

274
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,510
It's not like that.

275
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,720
[Grandma]

276
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,620
[Mother-in-law]

277
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,000
[Mother-in-law]

278
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:45,770
Hello.

279
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,320
Yes.

280
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,440
Oh, we're good.

281
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,350
Yes, we're doing well.

282
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,380
Yes.

283
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,500
My maternal grandma.

284
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:14,740
Eat what I gave you.

285
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,600
You can have mine.

286
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:28,410
Thank you for the meal.

287
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:30,140
Why don't you have a little more?

288
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,310
I had some bread at school.

289
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,450
[Turn off phone]

290
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:03,620
Ahjumma never calls.

291
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,230
Yoon Juwon.

292
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:06,930
Am I wrong?

293
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,070
Why should Kim Sanha hear about her being remarried and happy?

294
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,990
She got a doctor husband and had a baby.

295
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,800
The living room in their new apartment is like a soccer field.

296
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,130
Her kid's English kindergarten costs 2 million won a month.

297
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,200
Why should Kim Sanha know any of that?

298
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,590
Is Sanha's grandma your friend? Stop it.

299
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,460
Yes.

300
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,730
Let me get him.

301
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:29,690
- Where's Sanha?
- He went upstairs.

302
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:33,110
Oh, Sanha's already gone to bed.

303
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:36,600
He's tired these days from all the studying.

304
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,940
Yes. Bye.

305
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:44,380
What's going on?

306
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,180
I'll make some rice balls*. Take it upstairs after dinner.
(Called "fist rice" in Korean)

307
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,940
What are you going to put in them?

308
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,290
My fist.

309
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,520
My raging fist.

310
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:02,730
Okay.

311
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,690
What?

312
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,910
[Ex-mother-in-law]

313
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,350
Does that lady not get along with her rich current son-in-law?

314
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,440
Why does she keep calling her ex-son-in-law?

315
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,980
Sanha won't pick up, so she calls me.

316
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,150
While you listen to her brag,

317
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,140
remind her that he's a senior in high school.

318
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,230
Maybe she'll call him less.

319
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,870
Okay.

320
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,420
I did a good job washing all the dishes. Want to see?

321
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,460
What?

322
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:50,870
How come you never get anything on your way back from work?

323
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,900
Why not bring over some fruit to share?

324
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,370
You didn't like the melons I got last time!

325
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:59,770
You said I can't even pick fruit. You said not to buy anything.

326
00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:01,800
I'm not just talking about food.

327
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,000
I'm asking you to put more care into the family.

328
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,720
Have you ever taken care of any of the kids' birthdays?

329
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,860
Aigoo.

330
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:15,970
What's with the nagging? Being a single dad is hard enough.

331
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,540
I haven't even started.

332
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,230
Want me to really go for it?

333
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:24,460
- No thanks.
- While we're on the subject,

334
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:27,670
- why don't we just air everything out?
- Don't follow me.

335
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,290
- Don't follow me.
- I mean...

336
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,170
Hey, just have some.

337
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:37,800
- Have some.
- I'll eat them later.

338
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,620
I think I'll get a stomachache if I eat them now.

339
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,230
When will you eat them?

340
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:44,020
Before midnight.

341
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,040
I'll check the plate tomorrow morning.

342
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,550
Fine.

343
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,430
What? What's this smell?

344
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,210
- Did you change your shampoo?
- What are you doing?

345
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,730
You use expensive shampoo by yourself?

346
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,480
This is it. What is this?

347
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,550
Why do you use cotton-scented shampoo by yourself, Oppa? Explain.

348
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:30,850
Explain!

349
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,610
Put some of this fierce energy into studying.

350
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,360
- You're changing subject.
- He's changing subject.

351
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,010
Cotton scent, lemon scent.

352
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:46,130
We got them on a 1+1 sale because you said they smelled nice. Remember?

353
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,280
Oh?

354
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,580
Just reminding you that I have less than 100 days until the college entrance exam.

355
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,280
- Hang out at your place.
- "Your place"?

356
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,700
He's so rude.

357
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,410
- I also have less than 100 days left.
- Sure. Go.

358
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:04,060
- Just go!
- Geez!

359
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,480
Go!

360
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,620
I feel better now.

361
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:16,370
Close the door and go.

362
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,930
Go!

363
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,930
Good job!

364
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,620
He'll eat, right?

365
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,940

You sometimes call Sanha "oppa."

I do? When?

"Why do you use cotton-scented shampoo by yourself, Oppa?"

Why am I just "you" when Kim Sanha is "oppa"?

373
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,150
Shouldn't our titles be equal?

00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,330
Aren't you Haejun's aunt?

546
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,060
Hello.

547
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,660
It sure has been a while.

548
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,100
It's still hot out. Long johns?

549
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,410
So, they'll sweat to death?

550
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:14,200
It's chilly in the morning and at night. It'll get colder soon.

551
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,460
It's just that I'm so ashamed.

552
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,900
I shouldn't have tried so hard to marry off Mr. Yoon.

553
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,680
Next to marrying my husband,

554
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,540
it's my biggest regret in life.

555
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,030
- Ma'am.
- What?

556
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,140
I'll be heading out.

557
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,860
Thank you for these. I appreciate them. They'll make good use of them.

558
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,050
Be careful with the steps there.

559
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:50,760
I won't walk you out. Get home safe.

560
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:55,240
Long johns? After dumping the kid on you for 10 years?

561
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,780
Long johns? Aigoo, what a joke.

562
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:07,680
He wasn't dumped on me. I took him in.

563
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,450
Please don't be so harsh.

564
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:14,630
She came to take Haejun many times.

565
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,820
I didn't let him go.

566
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:29,030
Auntie.

567
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,900
It's you! When did you get here?

568
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,600
- Coming home from school?
- Yeah.

569
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,490
You're almost due! Why did you come all the way here?

570
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,470
I could've come to you.

571
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:50,810
The bus is still running.

572
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,530
I have money.

573
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,820
This is Juwon's dad's money.

574
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,600
Yeah.

575
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,180
But I saved up my allowance.

576
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:11,590
Still, it's not money you earned.

577
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,030
You shouldn't waste it.

578
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,880
Even though he gave it to you to spend,

579
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,990
you should pay it all back when you're grown up.

580
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:23,220
I will.

581
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,370
That's right. You should.

582
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:31,280
Don't be a burden. Read the room.

583
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,770
I know.

584
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,490
I'll take this cab.

585
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,410
[Mr. Yoon's Kalguksu]

586
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:34,350
Hey! Are you the kid that Mr. Yoon took in?

587
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:35,590
Yes.

588
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,290
Clean up nicely!

589
00:39:37,290 --> 00:39:42,310
If you don't do it right, Mr. Yoon will send you back home.

590
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:53,550
Hey, hey. I told you not to talk to him like that so many times.

591
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,590
Don't cry.

592
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:05,230
Even if you don't do stuff like this, you can stay here, Haejun.

593
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,670
Don't be a burden. Read the room.

594
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:25,200
Wow, looks delicious!

595
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,240
Dad got the best quality meat for you guys.

596
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,340
I bought it once in a blue moon.

597
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,500
Look at this color.

598
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,360
If it's too well done, the fat's gone, and it's not as tasty.

599
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,850
What's wrong, Haejun? Don't have an appetite?

600
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,380
Should I make you some crab soybean soup?

601
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,510
No, this is good.

602
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,990
Scallion kimchi is perfect with pork belly.

603
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,540
Here.

604
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,120
Put some garlic in the wrap.

605
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:05,010
This garlic isn't your average garlic. It's from the Madam's mother's house.

606
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,690
Juwon, what's going on with you?

607
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,810
Stop picking at your food. It's unlike you.

608
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,040
It's pork belly. Scarf it down like you usually do.

609
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,530
I don't always have an appetite.

610
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:20,880
What? Do you even know what it's like not to have an appetite?

611
00:41:25,130 --> 00:41:27,180
We got into a fight.

612
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,290
What happened?

613
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,690
Fight about what?

614
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,690
Did you throw a fit?

615
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:42,490
Do you think I always throw a fit?

616
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:47,270
I'm sure Sanha didn't get himself into trouble.

617
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:50,440
Yeah. I just scarf down meat,

618
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,800
get in trouble,

619
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,000
and Kim Sanha is a flawless person.

620
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,200
Good for you. Good for you!

621
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,350
But still, eat some meat!

622
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,390
- Dad got it for you!
- I'll talk to her.

623
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:02,140
It's fine. Eat.

624
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,380
She'll be fine tomorrow.

625
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,880
No need to wait until tomorrow.

626
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,250
I can make her feel better quickly.

627
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,360
Sleeping?

628
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,010
Yeah.

629
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,530
I'm sorry.

630
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,830
I was harsh.

631
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:42,840
But there's one thing I feel was unfair.

632
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,420
That is not how you apologize.

633
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,150
How should I do it, then?

634
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,560
Talk about what you did wrong, not what you thought was unfair.

635
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,370
Fine.

636
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:57,040
I'm sorry.

637
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,700
I was harsh.

638
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,740
From now on, tell us everything bad and everything good.

639
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,380
- Share everything.
- I already do.

640
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,930
You're not ready to apologize.

641
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:16,070
As far as I know, I don't have a girlfriend.

642
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,710
The "Huiju" you speak of is probably...

643
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:22,760
Probably?

644
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,590
Kang Haejun's ex-girlfriend.

645
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,020
So, you're not upset with me anymore, right?

646
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:50,920
Eat.

647
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:00,660
It's good, right?

648
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,360
Aigoo. Have plenty. You're just grilling.

649
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:09,470
- I'll go ahead.
- Okay.

650
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,300
What's with her? Did I do something wrong?

651
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,510
- Huiju.
- Hui-

652
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,360
What about H-Huiju?

653
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:27,250
She's sad that you didn't tell her about having a girlfriend.

654
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:33,930
She's realizing she and Kang Haejun have a shallow relationship.

655
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:38,040
It's probably an opportunity for her to learn that.

656
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,820
We've been broken up forever!

657
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:42,220
- You told her we broke up, right?
- Yes.

658
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,170
You told her why we broke up, right?

659
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:46,130
Why would I tell her that? She didn't even ask.

660
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:49,130
You should have! It was because of you!

661
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:50,900
What?

662
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:53,950
What?

663
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:59,800
You called me up here. Start talking.

664
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,000
I think there's been a small misunderstanding.

665
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,890
It hasn't even been three months

666
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:07,500
since you threw me out like an old shoe, saying you like Kim Sanha.

667
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:11,360
I didn't throw you out.

668
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,290
You don't know being with someone for a short time.

669
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:16,150
I guess Sanha could have a cute side...

670
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:19,530
Sure, I guess.

671
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,960
- Let's get back together.
- Hey!

672
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,070
Please?

673
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:25,300
Stop. Don't put me on the spot.

674
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,300
You told me not to tell anyone about us.

675
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:31,070
So, I really didn't tell anyone.

676
00:45:33,150 --> 00:45:37,590
But I just got caught, so I'm in a tricky situation with Juwon.

677
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,770
Why is that tricky?

678
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,910
Are you two involved? I thought she was your sister.

679
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:45,610
It's a problem for me!

680
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:49,280
I don't want to hurt her feelings.

681
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,200
She wasn't dating Kim Sanha. It was Kang Haejun.

682
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:56,630
What? Really? Are you sure?

683
00:45:56,630 --> 00:45:58,590
Why are you so surprised?

684
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,190
Oh, I mean...

685
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:03,330
I just can't see them together.

686
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:05,620
Maybe that's why they broke up.

687
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,060
- So, did they break up?
- Yes.

688
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:13,560
Still, you must've been sad they didn't tell you.

689
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:17,900
I'll just stay mad for today and forgive them tomorrow.

690
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,440
He must've had a reason he couldn't tell me.

691
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,930
True...

692
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:25,110
There's no way he didn't have a girlfriend.

693
00:46:26,830 --> 00:46:28,730
She's pretty.

694
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:31,760
Why would a girl like her ever date Kang Haejun?

695
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,930
Me?

696
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:44,730
Are you looking at me?

697
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:47,480
You.

698
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:12,490
What are you doing?

699
00:47:14,470 --> 00:47:17,030
You're always with Juwon, right?

700
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:19,980
Y-Yes.

701
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,100
What was your name again?

702
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:25,630
It was a really pretty name.

703
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:28,150
[Park Dal]

704
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:31,030
Oh, right! Park Dal.

705
00:47:33,190 --> 00:47:34,740
Where's Juwon?

706
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,720
Well...

707
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:48,750
- What?
- You're so pretty.

708
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:52,670
I get that a lot.

709
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,910
I see it.

710
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:59,280
You know that Haejun and I dated briefly, right?

711
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,110
- Unni. It's fine!
- Huh?

712
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:06,200
You're beautiful enough just as you are,

713
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,620
and deserve to be loved.

714
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,750
Kang Haejun's eyes must be messed up from playing basketball every day.

715
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:18,990
- What?
- Unni, shake it off. Got it?

716
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:21,810
Kang Haejun's muscles are just for show.

717
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:23,290
They're not from basketball.

718
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:26,670
He grew them on purpose by doing push-ups at home.

719
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:28,860
- It's not-
- It's fine.

720
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,230
He looks normal in public.

721
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:32,500
I said it's not like that.

722
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,310
If you waver now and get back with him,

723
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:37,270
it'll be a dark chapter of your life.

724
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:39,430
Trust me and focus on your studies.

725
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:41,920
I dumped him!

726
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,150
- What?
- No.

727
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:47,560
Technically, I didn't even dump him.

728
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,140
We were dating, and then we took a break.

729
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:54,630
Haejun misunderstood and said that I "threw him out."
[Threw him out]

730
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:57,800
You threw him out?

731
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,740
Who are you to throw anyone out?

732
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,670
Why would you throw him out?

733
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:05,550
Why does he have to get dumped?

734
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:08,130
Why do you care?

735
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:11,880
Whether Haejun gets dumped or not, it's his love life.

736
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,590
Honestly, you're not even Haejun's real sister.

737
00:49:15,590 --> 00:49:19,590
What pisses me off the most is you pretending to be his sister.

738
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:20,910
I am his sister.

739
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:25,190
How? Haejun's last name is Kang, and yours...

740
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:27,520
is Yoon.

741
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:33,870
That's a paperwork issue, not a big-

742
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,910
How is it not a big deal that you're not family on paper?

743
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:40,880
Didn't you learn about family units in elementary school?

744
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,870
Who cares who your family is on paper?

745
00:49:42,870 --> 00:49:45,020
If you think you're family, then you are.

746
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:48,710
Do you need a piece of paper to validate that?

747
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:53,560
Our flesh and bones all grew up eating the same rice!

748
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:56,070
If living and eating together makes you family,

749
00:49:56,070 --> 00:50:00,450
is everyone living in the same dorm all one family?

750
00:50:00,450 --> 00:50:03,200
- That's different.
- How so?

751
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,300
Then, how far does a family go?

752
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,060
Your cousins? Because you're blood-related?

753
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:09,770
That's right! Because we're blood-related!

754
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:13,020
How about your step-siblings by re-marriage? Adoptees?

755
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,560
Plenty of families aren't blood-related.

756
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:19,610
Unni, do you really think those people aren't family?

757
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:21,730
Seriously? For real?

758
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:26,670
Don't you know how hurtful that kind of thinking could be to those people?

759
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:30,280
I mean, those instances are different.

760
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,690
Right. Every case is different.

761
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:35,840
I think so, too.

762
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,090
If we're done, I'll get going.

763
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,470
We're not done.

764
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:01,220
Wait!

765
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:05,800
Just wait a second.

766
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:18,410

769
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:26,760
didn't know you hated me that much.

770
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:29,980
That's Yoon Juwon. First year.

771

The crazy one?

772
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:34,260
The one who says she's Kim Sunha and Kang Haejun's sister.

773
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:35,790
I heard that, too.

774
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:38,050
I heard she bullies people if she doesn't like them.

775
00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:39,910
Right, right.

776
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:45,200
No! Juwon isn't like that.

777
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,020
Stop being extra and get up.

778
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:59,920
I'm speaking from experience...

779
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,450
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

780
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:03,970
Get up.

781
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:08,280
Look at your knee!

782
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:09,610
You're bleeding!

783
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:11,970
Look at the blood! It must hurt.

784
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:14,540
No. I didn't do that.

00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:17,690
She tried to push me into the pond last time.

786
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:19,920
She's a repeat offender.

787
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,290
She should go to a disciplinary hearing.

788
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:25,670
You're all witnesses. Got it?

Let's go to the nurse's office first.

790

So, you won't apologize, huh?

791
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:49,970
There's nothing to apologize for.

792
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:51,790
She's not going to apologize.

793
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:53,950
She's worse than I heard.

No. I didn't push her.

You want me to explain how that happened right now?

807

She told me I was a fake sibling.

01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:48,690
I'm sorry!

903
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:09,130
Aren't you Juwon's friend?

904
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:13,300
Yes. H-Hello.

905
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,720
Dal, right?

906
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:18,880
Yes. I'm Dal.

907
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:24,600
- Did you just hear that?
- No.

908
01:01:26,470 --> 01:01:29,510
Okay. Good, then.

909
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:43,810
What?

910
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:48,660
If you didn't hear it, instead of "No,"

911
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:51,210
you would've said, "What," right?

912
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,490
Dal, do you have a minute?

913
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:08,250
Dal, do you have hand tremors?

914
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:11,000
Yes. It's severe.

915
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:20,140
Eat.

916
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:23,190
Thank you.

917
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:31,410
Remember the movie where they go into space,

918
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:35,870
shoot light, and erase people's memories?

919
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,950
If I had that...

920
01:02:41,950 --> 01:02:45,120
I wouldn't have to say all this.

921
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:50,750
Oh, right.

922
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:59,010
You heard, right?

923
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:01,400
The mom thing?

924
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,860
Yeah.

925
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,120
About that...

926
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:08,490
Can you pretend like it didn't happen?

927
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:15,030
If you tell Juwon that I grabbed a passerby

928
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:19,150
and yelled, "Mom"?

929
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:22,060
I would be super pissy.

930
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:25,190
Okay. What?

931
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:26,690
Pissy?

932
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,970
You mean pissed?

933
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:32,670
Yeah. Pissy.

934
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:46,880
Dad, what are you making? It doesn't smell like broth.

935
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,170
Cartilage.

936
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:50,760
The stove at home isn't strong enough.

937
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:53,810
It's tasty if I make it on the restaurant stove.

938
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:56,080
It's Kang Haejun's favorite again.

939
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:59,900
He plays sports! He needs to eat well.

940
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,840
It's not just for Haejun.

941
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,180
Sanha, you should have some, too.

942
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:06,600
Yes.

943
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:12,650
Don't you feel like we're Kang Haejun's parasites sometimes?

944
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:18,610
Last time, he only let Kang Haejun drink the spring water.

945
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:23,670
I drank some of that, too.

946
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:10,260
See? They're done.

947
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:12,220
Just wait.

948
01:05:12,220 --> 01:05:15,370
Let me set something up soon.

949
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:20,050
I don't get it, but...

950
01:05:20,050 --> 01:05:23,060
Class President, if it's what you want.

951
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:27,000
I hope what your heart wants comes true.

952
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,310
Let's go.

953
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:30,690
Lunch is almost over.

954
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:01,340
Who...

955
01:06:05,390 --> 01:06:09,370
Are you Kang Haejun?

956
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:12,010
Yes.

957
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:16,090
What are you doing?

958
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:20,070
I'm your...

959
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:24,050
your...

960
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:25,450
I'm...

961
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:28,050
your father.

962
01:06:28,050 --> 01:06:30,870
I'm your dad!

963
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:33,430
My son!

964
01:06:59,790 --> 01:07:03,850
♫ Don't give up, finish the race ♫

965
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:06,560
♫ Better not get tired ♫

966
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:10,660

968
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:18,010
[Family by Choice]

969
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:20,870
I think this is for you. A letter.

970
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,040
For me?

971
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,690
He has a nice personality. He has many friends.

972
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:26,040
He's good-looking, too.

973
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:27,560
I'll start dating, too.

974
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,680
You can't tell by his appearance.

975
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:32,920
If you follow me to the US, you can do anything you want.

976
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:36,760
How can you be sure that good intentions will lead to good results?

977
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,160
Don't tell Dad or Juwon.

978
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:40,520
I disappointed you all this time, right?

979
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,430
I'll try to forgive you, too.

980
01:07:42,430 --> 01:07:44,820
Sohee, say hello.

981
01:07:45,810 --> 01:07:47,720
Oppa?
