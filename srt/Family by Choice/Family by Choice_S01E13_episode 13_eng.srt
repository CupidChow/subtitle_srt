1
00:00:05,030 --> 00:00:12,230


2
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,060
   

3
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,130
   

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,650
   

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,880
   

6
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,770
   

7
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,150
   

8
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,950
 Is this your birth father's money? 

9
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,850
 Gosh, no way! 

10
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:52,940
 Where did you get this much money, then? 

11
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,740
 I washed dishes and served tables. 

12
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,800
 I caught a customer's eye and did some modeling, too. 

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,810
 I worked really hard to pay you back... 

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,260
 I worked hard. 

15
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,120
 Did someone tell you to pay me back? 

16
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,310
 Still, you raised me for ten years– 

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:10,440
 What parent doesn't? It comes naturally! 

18
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,640
 Is it because I'm not your real father? 

19
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,110
 Leave. 

20
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,770
 The reason Mr. Yoon got angry 

21
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:25,070
 is because of his guilty conscience. Since you're not his birth dad. 

22
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,580
 My handsome son. 

23
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,970
   
   

24
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,130
 Everyone, the model is here! 

25
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:39,240
 It took me ten years to tell you that I like you. 

26
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,570
 Give me a chance. 

27
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,500
 Give me a chance because Yoon Joo Won is my entire world. 

28
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,360
 I don't want things to become awkward between us. 

29
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,390
 So I'm not going to give you the chance you asked for. 

30
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,290
 - Yoon Joo Won. 
 - Kim San Ha is Yoon Joo Won's oppa. 

31
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:55,880
 We can't become anything else. 

32
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,420
 Even after this, 

33
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,410
 we can't become anything else? 

34
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,270
 I gave this a lot of thought. 

35
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,670
 But I just can't forget your face that day. 

36
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,030
 So I told her you're back here. 

37
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,030
 It's up to you if you want to go see her or not. 

38
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,330
 Is something wrong? 

39
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,360
 - I saw Mom. 
 - Where? 

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,990
 Auntie told me she opened a hair salon in Busan. 

41
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,330
 And? What did she say when she met you? 

42
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,390
 I didn't meet her. 

43
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:35,840
 I only saw her from afar. 

44
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,150
 Did you find it? 

45
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:42,210
 Yeah, the address was in a text from Auntie. 

46
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,710
 So, does Hae Joon... 

47
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,330
 Does Hae Joon also know that I'm here? 

48
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,750
 He doesn't. 

49
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:21,080
 Is it okay as long as you feel at ease? 

50
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,900
 What about Kang Hae Joon? 

51
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,000
 Kang Hae Joon lived his entire life in the dark, believing he was just baggage. 

52
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,490
 Ever since you cut him off, 

53
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,370
 he thought he was dead weight to you. 

54
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:42,300
 People kept saying my dad took in a charity case! 

55
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,500
 So he has thought of himself as an outsider for his entire life! 

56
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,590
 Do you even know? 

57
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,940
 Gosh, what are you doing, Seo Hyeon? 

58
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,560
 I just want him to... 

59
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,860
 live an ordinary life. 

60
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,500
I already feel bad that he grew up with people pointing fingers and saying he was fatherless.

61
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,540
But now...

62
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,520
his mom is a murderer, too.

63
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:34,910
Right now, Jeong Jae and you guys are his family.

64
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,950
My Hae Joon can continue to live an ordinary life.

65
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:45,440
How can I become an obstacle to Hae Joon after all this time?

66
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,460
 I wouldn't be like this if it weren't for you. 

67
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,750
 You made my life like this! 

68
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,430
It's because of Kang Hae Joon.

69
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,290
It is thanks to Kang Hae Joon

70
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:22,490
that we are able to live happily like this.

71
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,160
Because Kang Hae Joon is my dad's son,

72
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,780
Kim San Ha's brother,

73
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,610
and my oppa.

74
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:44,210
Because Kang Hae Joon is there to smile for us during tough times

75
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,720
and the first to cry when we are sad.

76
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,990
That's why we can live happily like this.

77
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:01,400
That same Kang Hae Joon...

78
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,590
is waiting for you, Ahjumma.

79
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,820
He wants to smile and cry with you.

80
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,250
He wants to live ordinarily like that.

81
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,450
He continues to wait for you.

82
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,630
 Where are you? Are you at the hospital? 

83
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,300
 Hurry home! Or call me when you see this. 

84
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,170
   

85
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:09,340
What's wrong with everyone?

86
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,480
What do you mean?

87
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,860
They don't talk about their own pain,

88
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:15,340
thinking, "I'm the only one who has to suffer."

89
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,120
You were like that, too.

90
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,350
- Was I? 
 - Don't you remember?

91
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:23,110
You were hurt by the words, "For someone without a mom."

92
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,580
But you didn't tell Hae Joon or me knowing we'd get upset.

93
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,110
That was ages ago.

94
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:34,040
Hae Joon and Ahjumma will be okay.

95
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,800
Exactly.

96
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,970
Why don't they talk it out before they feel hurt?

97
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,830
They'll understand and forgive in the end, anyway.

98
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,360
I'm just frustrated. Really frustrated.

99
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,160
Not everything is understandable.

100
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,690
You're okay, right?

101
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,270
- By chance– 
 - So did you live happily, thanks to Hae Joon?

102
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,780
What?

103
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,490
Did you live happily, thanks to Hae Joon and not me?

104
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,430
No.

105
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:14,050
Did I say that? When did I say that?

106
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:16,080
I don't know.

107
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,080
Are you jealous of Hae Joon in the midst of this?

108
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,870
Mom, can we sleep here tonight?

109
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,090
Why sleep here when we have a perfectly nice hotel?

110
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,140
But Mom, it looks like Oppa lives here.

111
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,390
He should live properly, even if it's just for one month.

112
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,590
Anything less than this will be uncomfortable.

113
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,160
Is Kim San Ha only staying for a month?

114
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,680
I wish you wouldn't butt into our family conversation.

115
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,580
All right.

116
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,050
Please close the door on your way out.

117
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:18,990
But I'm not exactly a total stranger when it comes to Kim San Ha.

118
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,200
 - The call is not going through...  
 - My goodness.

119
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,980
What's he doing that he can't answer the phone?

120
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,430
- Where are you two coming from? 
 - What?

121
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,340
Well, we are coming back from...

122
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,100
Why are you standing out here?

123
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,470
Oh, right! Do you know how many times I called you?

124
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,130
Me?

125
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,910
Your mom is here.

126
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,710
Go home. I'll call you later.

127
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,910
No, you come inside, too.

128
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,450
I'm a little scared.

129
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,080
Then you can stay at Joo Won's for a bit.

130
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,920
No, I want to come, too.

131
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,190
Go home.

132
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,960
Take her home.

133
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:51,500
Let's go inside.

134
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,650
Oppa!

135
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,930
What is this?

136
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,150
What brings you here?

137
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,560
Mom wanted to see the Busan beach.

138
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,330
We came to see you while we were here.

139
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:09,720
- Where is Mom? 
 - In your room.

140
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,330
All right.

141
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,700
 I wouldn't be like this if it weren't for you. 

142
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,380
 Do you think I'm acting like this because I'm drunk? 

143
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,390
 Because I can't walk? 

144
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,030
 It's all your fault. 

145
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:29,360
 You made my life like this! 

146
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,690
 You made my life like this! 

147
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,580
You even changed the hospital, didn't you?

148
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,650
I told you I came back permanently.

149
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,930
And I said you can't.

150
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,740
- Mom– 
 - So, will you be selfish until the end

151
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,380
and do what you want?

152
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,380
Must you see me die?

153
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:15,880
You won't die.

154
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:23,420
You'll be all right, Mom.

155
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,650
Are you saying you don't care if I die?

156
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,060
How could you treat me like this?

157
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,300
I'm saying you won't blink an eye even if I die!

158
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:44,910
I was scared something would happen to you, too.

159
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:49,110
That I would lose you like we lost So Jeong.

160
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,650
I was scared every single day for the last ten years.

161
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,180
But I was the only one.

162
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,140
 Only me. 

163
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,070
 You ruined my life! 

164
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:09,190
 I was the only one who thought I couldn't live without you, Mom. 

165
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,720
 Only me. 

166
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,010
You never cried...

167
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,070
for your children.

168
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,410
How dare you spew nonsense?

169
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,170
What do you know?

170
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,480
You don't know how much I cried for So Jeong!

171
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,290
Did you really cry for So Jeong?

172
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,460
Mom!

173
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,830
Oppa, what's wrong?

174
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,380
Tell her you're sorry.

175
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,440
Take So Hui and go back to Seoul.

176
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:47,170
I'm not going.

177
00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:01,500
♫  Back then, we were too young to know our hearts were racing  ♫

178
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:11,500
♫  We just argued and delayed things without knowing why  ♫

179
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:20,740
♫  Maybe we didn’t understand the meaning of love  ♫

180
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:24,400
♫  We just couldn’t say it  ♫

181
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:30,440
♫  Each day, like that  ♫

182
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:36,700
♫  Maybe we didn’t understand the meaning of goodbye either  ♫

183
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,300
♫  We just believed  ♫

184
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,680
♫  we didn't want to let go of each other  ♫

185
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,140
Please. Please...

186
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:55,050
♫  While carrying the warmth of our memories in our hearts  ♫

187
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,700
   

188
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:29,240
Hey, Daughter.

189
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,990
Of course.

190
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:41,440
Thanks to someone's wise daughter's words, there was nothing left for me to say.

191
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:44,200
Ahjumma will get in touch in no time.

192
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,670
 You have to let me know if she does, okay? 

193
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,470
 Kang Hae Joon is coming. I'll call you later. 

194
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:50,120
Okay.

195
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,210
When did you come?

196
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,460
What Ahjumma?

197
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:09,390
You still have a long way to go until you need hearing aids, Madam.

198
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,880
You have super hearing.

199
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,670
Why are you changing the subject?

200
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,900
What Ahjumma?

201
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,490
I wonder how much lunch traffic we will get today.

202
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:21,810
The weather is so nice.

203
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,990
Something is fishy.

204
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,990
I'm sure of it.

205
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,190
Did he get a girlfriend?

206
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,140
Mr. Yoon, did you get a girlfriend?

207
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,340
Still no word from Kim San Ha?

208
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,820
He must've been at the hospital all night.

209
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,880
I asked Joon Ho, and he said Oppa was in the ER and just fell asleep.

210
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,340
Hey, I mean, listen.

211
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,810
Is it that hard to tell us he's going to the hospital?

212
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,270
Even Ahjumma and the little girl.

213
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,980
I was shocked to discover they all disappeared without a trace.

214
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,140
Anyway,

215
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,150
where did she go?

216
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,980
Who? Dal?

217
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,130
Did she leave early this morning?

218
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,190
Did she not come home?

219
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,350
What if she didn't?

220
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:23,490
What's wrong with a single, 29-year-old woman staying out?

221
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,910
It's a scary world these days.

222
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,290
How could she stay out all night? She has no fear.

223
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,190
Does that mean she already found a boyfriend?

224
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,590
Wow, she just asked me to be her fake partner the other day.

225
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,410
Who is it?

226
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,000
Dal went home yesterday because it was her mom's birthday.

227
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,650
Why did you lie?

228
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:48,100
What's with the overreaction?

229
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,760
Why do you care whether Dal stays out or finds a boyfriend?

230
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,160
You know, my sister's friend is my sister.

231
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,370
She's like you to me.

232
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,210
I'm telling you just in case, but I don't need that kind of attention from you.

233
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,050
This won't do.

234
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:07,030
Pack Kim San Ha's belongings. I'll stop by the hospital.

235
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,420
You can go to work. I'll go.

236
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,390
- I'll go. 
 - There's no need. I'll go.

237
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,920
I said I'll go!

238
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,320
There is something, isn't there?

239
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,820
- What? 
 - Something you're not telling me.

240
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,950
You two...

241
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,830
Us two, what?

242
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:38,910
You got your wrist treated at the hospital last time.

243
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,800
Are you in pain again?

244
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,380
Do you want to see how strong my fist and wrist are?

245
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,250
You have to tell me if it hurts, okay?

246
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,520
I'll pack Kim San Ha's stuff.

247
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,440
He consistently can't read the room.

248
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,350
What is he hiding here?

249
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:12,200
   

250
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,430
 Are you awake? 

251
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,550
 I'm on my way to the hospital. 

252
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:05,200
♫  Why am I like this?  ♫

253
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:13,360
♫  Why am I always so excited like it's the first time?  ♫

254
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:18,240
♫  Even in bright daylight, the stars shine  ♫

255
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,380
Did you eat?

256
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,360
That's a lie.

257
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,220
I'll tell Dad that Kim San Ha skips his breakfast.

258
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,310
I'll keep my mouth shut if you buy me something tasty.

259
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,060
Let's go.

260
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,240
- Dad! 
 - Hey, Son. You're here.

261
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,430
I'll get that.

262
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,760
Wow...

263
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,130
You must be the famous model son.

264
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,310
What a looker.

265
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,350
He looks better in person, right?

266
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,950
You obviously take after your mother.

267
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,950
Be good to your mom for giving you your good looks.

268
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,680
Isn't that right?

269
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,790
Let me know if you need a bowl of rice.

270
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,150
It'll be on the house.

271
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,340
 Thank you. 

272
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,960
Hae Joon.

273
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,180
Hae Joon.

274
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:35,030
It's all right.

275
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:37,970
It's not like I can carry a sign that says I don't have a mom.

276
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,730
It doesn't bother me.

277
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:40,970
"Mom"?

278
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:43,660
Looks like you'll meet your mom soon.

279
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,340
- Sorry? 
 - What are you talking about?

280
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,100
That's what my spidey senses tell me.

281
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:57,000
Mr. Yoon is seeing someone for sure.

282
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,120
Really?

283
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,350
My goodness.

284
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:04,040
Gosh...

285
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,070
No, no. No, Hae Joon.

286
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,160
It's nothing like that, Hae Joon.

287
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,560
What brings you here so early?

288
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,530
Is something wrong?

289
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,520
Do you know the jujube tea?

290
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,610
The one you brew San Ha for insomnia.

291
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,150
Please make another batch.

292
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:26,140
Is San Ha still having trouble falling asleep these days?

293
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:29,090
It's hilarious, isn't it?

294
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,820
How does he not have a clue that Dal likes him?

295
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:38,180
If Dal gets a boyfriend, he looks ready to step in like her older brother.

296
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,130
It's a shame to let it go to waste.

297
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:58,070
A long time ago, Kang Hae Joon did this.

298
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:01,490
I was getting scolded in the office for dozing off in class.

299
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,500
He saw that and...

300
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,060
San Ha's mom seemed determined to take San Ha with her.

301
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,310
Hi.

302
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:15,380
Did you know San Ha's mom visited him yesterday?

303
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,130
 She visited him? 

304
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:19,490
Stop by the restaurant later.

305
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:24,530
It's because the adults couldn't resolve anything.

306
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:27,740
It's not something jujube tea will solve.

307
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,900
I kept in touch with San Ha while I was in America.

308
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,070
Even then, he always said he was fine, and everything was okay.

309
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:37,060
Like father, like son. They both don't say a word.

310
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,990
Do I have to slap them on the back to get them talking?

311
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,680
Thank goodness you guys are by his side now.

312
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:50,260
I'm sure San Ha probably came back to have some peace.

313
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,940
- You're shameless. 
 - What?

314
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:58,750
I kept chattering for an hour. My throat hurts.

315
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:01,140
How could you not say a word?

316
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,900
Can we do this here?

317
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,350
Did Ahjumma come to take you to Seoul?

318
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,180
Yes.

319
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,530
So what will you do?

320
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:15,410
I'm not going.

321
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,440
I told you I was not going anywhere.

322
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,800
Are you all right?

323
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,570
Yes, Mom will be fine.

324
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,950
I'm asking if you're all right.

325
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:33,280
I'm all right.

326
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,210
Ten years ago...

327
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,880
Yes, I begged you not to leave.

328
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,860
That was because I didn't want to part with you.

329
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,310
I really didn't want us to separate.

330
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,910
I know.

331
00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:53,300
If you're staying here because of me, it's okay.

332
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:59,070
If you need to care for your mom and So Hui, I won't make you stay here.

333
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:03,070
Back then, Seoul and America seemed really far away,

334
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:05,730
but if you think about it, Seoul is actually very close–

335
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,660
Joo Won.

336
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:08,990
Yes?

337
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,150
Don't let me go.

338
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:21,600
Tell me you can't live without me.

339
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,370
Are you stupid?

340
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,960
I feel that way, too.

341
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,050
I just tried acting tough.

342
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:31,560
Where do you think you're going? You better not go.

343
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,470
I'll spread rumors to Timbuktu that you're a jerk.

344
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:43,760
You don't think anyone we know will come all the way here, do you?

345
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,130
I wish someone would see us.

346
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,690
So the rumor would spread to Timbuktu.

347
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:53,940
They can't! I can just hide my face.

348
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,470
- You can just hide your face? 
 - Yes.

349
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:11,040
Did you speak with San Ha's mom?

350
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:15,550
Yes, I called her on my way here, but she didn't answer.

351
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,400
What about San Ha?

352
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:23,200
I plan to stop by the hospital later this evening.

353
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:29,580
Why are you sitting down? Go to San Ha if you have the time to sit down.

354
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,270
Let me catch my breath.

355
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,780
I didn't have a single meal today.

356
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,100
It's not like you're defending the Earth.

357
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,940
Are you the only police in Haedong?

358
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,230
Why can't you even eat a meal?

359
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,900
Wait here.

360
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,290
Do you want to go for a blind date?

361
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,310
Do what?

362
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:02,080
If you get married and get a new wife, and San Ha gets a stepmom,

363
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,320
in that case, you both might get closer to each other.

364
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,640
Look at you.

365
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,790
Who would marry me just to do that?

366
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,860
Poor woman. Goodness.

367
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,060
Yes, you're right.

368
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,200
I misspoke.

369
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:21,540
How did it go with Hae Joon's mom?

370
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,190
I feel sorry for her.

371
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:27,570
She got on her knees and cried yesterday.

372
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:29,970
I thought about how sad her life is.

373
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,020
It made me wonder how she lasted 20 years without Hae Joon.

374
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,610
It would've been great if you started living together after the blind date.

375
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:46,280
Didn't you have feelings for Hae Joon's mom?

376
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,600
Listen to this guy. Who had what?

377
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,230
That's what I thought all this time.

378
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:56,300
Isn't that why you took in Hae Joon without a second thought?

379
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,200
Goodness.

380
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,450
Don't say that carelessly in front of the children.

381
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,870
What absolute nonsense.

382
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,910
Finish eating and go to San Ha.

383
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:12,240
If it's not true, just say so. Why get angry?

384
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,920
That's funny. My goodness.

385
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:21,350
So Hui.

386
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:26,050
Oppa.

387
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,770
What brings you all the way here alone?

388
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,340
Sit down.

389
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,770
Where's Mom?

390
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:38,400
Mom is still at the hotel in Busan.

391
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,330
She thinks I'm back in Seoul.

392
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:45,360
She said she'd stay one more day and told me to return first.

393
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,290
By yourself?

394
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:51,560
Mom isn't answering her phone right now.

395
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:01,170
Don't worry. You know she gets like this sometimes.

396
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,810
It's nothing to worry about,

397
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:08,280
so if you return to Seoul, she'll call you in no time.

398
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,600
Mom cried so much at the hotel yesterday.

399
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:21,540
Oppa, can't I just live with you until I graduate high school?

400
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:29,020
Mom is better off without me.

401
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,060
That's not true.

402
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:36,450
Mom was sensitive at times, but that's because she was in pain.

403
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,320
But she was able to rehabilitate

404
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,390
because you and I were by her side.

405
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,380
 Psychogenic? 

406
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,520
 You can see for yourself, but there's no bone, muscle, or nerve damage. 

407
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,580
 With so much effort in rehab, and yet there's no progress? 

408
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,480
 It could be psychogenic. 

409
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,350
 Consider transferring her to psychiatry. 

410
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:07,420
Mom has a harder time when I'm around.

411
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,100
 To Mom, I'm... 

412
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,570
 Mom! Mom! 

413
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,210
 I'm like the scar on her leg. 

414
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,860
 If her scar disappeared... 

415
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,010
all her painful memories would disappear, too.

416
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,580
But she can still see it.

417
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:34,940
And every time she sees it, she feels awful.

418
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,000
- Oppa. 
 - That's why...

419
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,940
Mom is better off...

420
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:45,400
without me there.

421
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:54,140
You know how much Mom loves you, right?

422
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:01,390
Mom will get better because of you.

423
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:12,130
I'm here.

424
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,730
Hey.

425
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:22,160
Kang Hae Joon isn't coming today.

426
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:26,480
Give me a cupcake. The first one.

427
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,380
- Me, too. 
 - Two?

428
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,920
Yes.

429
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:39,650
Did you know Hae Joon's rumors are rampant at the nurses' station?

430
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:43,020
They're going crazy talking about Haedong's celebrity.

431
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,300
I would've also considered that field if my grades weren't good enough for medical school.

432
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,700
- To-go? 
 - Yes.

433
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,580
Was that girl Hyungnim's younger sister?

434
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,910
What?

435
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,530
Yes.

436
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:04,210
I saw her and her mom at the hospital a few times when we were still in school.

437
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,540
She doesn't look anything like Hyungnim.

438
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,990
- That's true. 
 - Who went where?

439
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,830
San Ha.

440
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,490
His younger sister came to the hospital.

441
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:20,600
- Alone? 
 - Yes, alone.

442
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,440
She looked so dejected.

443
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,720
She was looking for her brother so pitifully, so I took her to him.

444
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,690
Hey, it'd be weirder if she didn't look dejected.

445
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:32,790
Their mom must be having another hard time.

446
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,640
Chronic illnesses are hard on the family,

447
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,220
but San Ha's mother is...

448
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,310
Do you know Ahjumma well?

449
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,470
As if I do.

450
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:46,780
I just met her a couple of times at the hospital.

451
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,630
All the girls who liked Kim San Ha back in our department

452
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:52,760
would remain dedicated even when he didn't look at them.

453
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,130
But one visit from his mom to the hospital, and they all dropped away.

454
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,140
Including you.

455
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:02,620
I never liked Kim San Ha from the start.

456
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,340
I know everything.

457
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:08,710
After you broke up with Hae Joon, you went to San Ha like this.

458
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:11,020
Hey, you'd better watch it today.

459
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,700
Kim San Ha seems to be in a bad mood.

460
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,800
- Fooling around will get you in trouble. 
 - Right?

461
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,020
He even worked all night alone even though there wasn't an urgent call.

462
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,430
No wonder he had a dark face all day.

463
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:26,780
I saw him smile once when he saw her earlier.

464
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:30,000
Hey, it was like that in high school, too.

465
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,170
He would be scowling all day but would immediately change when he saw her.

466
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:39,100
I honestly thought they were dating.

467
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,910
Do you still have those misunderstandings?

468
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,760
Isn't that right?

469
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,190
What did you say?

470
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,370
Hey, let's go. We are leaving.

471
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,050
   

472
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:18,410
 There's a patient I need to observe, so I think I'll end late today. 

473
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,520
 Just in case you might wait. 

474
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:26,250
 All right. Let me know when you're done. 

475
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,960
I'll get changed and come out. Give me a moment.

476
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,240
It was tough to get here. Let's just talk here.

477
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:12,260
There's nowhere to sit here.

478
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:19,320
I miss So Jeong so much.

479
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,530
I thought about what you said yesterday.

480
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:27,720
I've been a terrible mother to you, haven't I?

481
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,380
Do you think I was like that to So Jeong, too?

482
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,860
Yes, I was probably the same to So Jeong, too.

483
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,620
She died because of me.

484
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,950
I wonder how much she resents me.

485
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:49,690
I missed So Jeong so much...

486
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,770
I couldn't bear it–

487
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,620
Mom, what I said yesterday–

488
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,360
What you said is all true.

489
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,650
Everything is my fault.

490
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:03,500
How difficult must it be

491
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,960
for you, So Jeong, and So Hui...

492
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,560
because of me?

493
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,550
Right?

494
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,660
I'll take you to the hotel.

495
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,500
Take me to where you live.

496
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:29,310
It's so uncomfortable to stay at the hotel by myself.

497
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:35,560
Wait here for a moment.

498
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:47,440
   

499
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,100
Please give me a moment!

500
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,340
Hello.

501
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,530
Are you drinking alone?

502
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:59,270
Beer is just a beverage.

503
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,210
Beer is alcohol.

504
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,800
Got it?

505
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:09,130
I heard you visited your mom in Seoul.

506
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,130
Did she say anything?

507
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,580
It was because of the blind date.

508
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,170
What?

509
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:19,430
- Did you get in trouble? 
 - It was expected.

510
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:23,120
She asked who it was and to bring him home.

511
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,130
Let...

512
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,100
Let me know if you need me again.

513
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:35,650
It's okay. I don't need you for that.

514
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:39,390
Come to think of it,

515
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:42,690
you've only met with doctors, lawyers, and the likes, right?

516
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:45,390
I don't even come close.

517
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,660
What do you mean, "the likes"?

518
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,690
All those men combined don't stand a chance against you.

519
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:58,600
Out of all 27 years of Park Dal's life,

520
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,920
you're the most handsome.

521
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,830
You...

522
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,380
To be honest, those photos...

523
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:18,700
I'm only telling you, but they've been slightly photoshopped.

524
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,070
Not too much. Just a bit.

525
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,250
Per standard industry practices.

526
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,960
But you look the same in person.

527
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,510
Is that so?

528
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,970
I'm leaving.

529
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,570
Ease up on the beer.

530
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:46,150
T-Take care.

531
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,300
What brings you here?

532
00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:30,200
I'll call you after taking Mom back.

533
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,390
Where is she going?

534
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:39,020
Hae Joon is at home, so it'll be uncomfortable for you.

535
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,460
Let's go to the hotel.

536
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,430
I'll stay at the hotel tonight, too.

537
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:45,270
I'll stay in Haedong for the time being.

538
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:49,080
For how long?

539
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,160
What about So Hui?

540
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:55,630
Now, you worry about So Hui?

541
00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:00,760
Didn't you consider how hard it would be on her when you returned to Haedong?

542
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,350
You abandoned your family and left without regard for us.

543
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:13,750
- Let's go. 
 - Is it so wrong for a mom to want to stay with her son for a few days?

544
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,810
A mere few days?

545
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,070
Why?

546
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:20,400
Because I didn't bat an eye when my child died?

547
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,610
Mom, please!

548
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:24,670
Are you too embarrassed to repeat the words

549
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:28,690
you said to your own mom, your real family, in front of her?

550
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,540
Mom!

551
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:32,730
Kim San Ha can't leave.

552
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,790
Tell Ahjumma to take a taxi, and you come with me.

553
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:46,440
You're the one who handed Kim San Ha to me.

554
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,360
Don't you remember?

555
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,260
Do you still remember that?

556
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,560
 - You can have him. 
 - Can I have him? 

557
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,050
 Really? 

558
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,830
 Then can he just stay at our house? 

559
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:00,940
Yes, I remember every word.

560
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:05,830
It was the happiest day of my entire life.

561
00:42:05,830 --> 00:42:11,280
I was so overjoyed that I remember I couldn't even sleep that night.

562
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:15,330
 How Kim San Ha felt that day... 

563
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:21,000
I couldn't think about how he must've felt crying all night after you abandoned him.

564
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,590
I was just so overjoyed.

565
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:29,630
I've felt so bad whenever I thought about it throughout my entire life.

566
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:35,080
You gave him to me, but I lent him to you for ten years.

567
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,120
Because you're his family.

568
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,810
So that Kim San Ha's heart would be at peace.

569
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:47,420
That's why I lent him to you.

570
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,950
I won't send Kim San Ηa back.

571
00:42:53,950 --> 00:43:01,720
♫  Your back as you looked up to the sky  ♫

572
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:07,640
This is why you made such a big fuss about returning to Haedong.

573
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,920
Yes.

574
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,050
♫  You lit a light in my dark heart  ♫

575
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,210
Let's go home.

576
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:23,180
I'm sorry.

577
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,420
I won't be able to take you back.

578
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:31,690
Take a taxi and get back safely.

579
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:41,480
♫  Today and tomorrow, I will always be with you  ♫

580
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:47,530
♫  I know that when I become sad  ♫

581
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:54,760
♫  You'll be the first to rush and comfort me  ♫

582
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,460
Are you an idiot, Kim San Ηa?

583
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,740
How did you live for the past ten years?

584
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,480
If you hide your feelings and act fine,

585
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,650
should I smile like an idiot, thinking you're fine?

586
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:06,760
Were you going to hide everything from me?

587
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,930
I don't like it when you suffer.

588
00:44:09,930 --> 00:44:12,700
It breaks my heart.

589
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:17,760
♫  And in days of pain  ♫

590
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,470
Yoon Joo Won,

591
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,630
♫  I will always, as I have  ♫

592
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:25,800
I love you.

593
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:33,800
♫  Be with you, like my breath  ♫

594
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,970
   

595
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,880
What the heck? You scared me.

596
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,560
Sit down.

597
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,670
   

598
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:04,910
Why did you touch that without my permission?

599
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,190
I said sit down!

600
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:09,530
It's not a big deal!

601
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:11,910
I just take it when I'm a bit tired.

602
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:14,430
Who says it's not a big deal?

603
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,810
Do you think you look cool, keeping your mouth shut and acting tough?

604
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,550
Do you think I'm you?

605
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:47,240
Then? Are you still embarrassed to be affected by your mom?

606
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,980
You were like that back then, too.

607
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,090
You were embarrassed to be caught fighting with your mom.

608
00:45:55,550 --> 00:45:58,080
I'm past that age.

609
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,980
I still miss my mom.

610
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:08,880
I detest and resent her,

611
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,870
and I try to pretend she doesn't exist,

612
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,500
but I still miss her so much at times.

613
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,070
When my mom hugged me,

614
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:27,870
do you know how tightly she hugged me?

615
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,960
I still think about that every single day.

616
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,120
I may not be smarter than you,

617
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,790
but...

618
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:51,300
don't you think I can understand you?

619
00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:58,080
 I just want to live with you. 

620
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:02,270
 The reason you resent your mom 

621
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:05,270
is because you love her.

622
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:40,250
It's all right.

623
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:43,150
If you can't sleep, you can go for a run with me.

624
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,810
Or have a drink together.

625
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:49,180
Then...

626
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:51,900
Then it really won't be a big deal.

627
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:17,250
   

628
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,650
Yes, I'm leaving soon.

629
00:48:20,650 --> 00:48:23,350
We will stop by the mart. Do you need anything?

630
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:25,710
 I'll text you if I think of anything. 

631
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,770
Okay.

632
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:34,570
Are they still getting ready?

633
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:36,440
   

634
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:45,700
Why isn't he answering?

635
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:51,590
   

636
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:58,350
 The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

637
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:00,290
What's going on?

638
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,880
I'm coming in.

639
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:28,530
Oppa.

640
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,320
How many bottles is that?

641
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,110
Hey. Hey.

642
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:45,680
Why on earth is he holding this?

643
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,210
Hey! Hey, wake up, Kang Hae Joon.

644
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:51,300
We agreed to eat with Dad today.

645
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:00,350
Kim San Ha.

646
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,140
Oppa, wake up.

647
00:50:04,930 --> 00:50:07,380
Wake up.

648
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:38,370
Looks like Hae Joon made a huge breakthrough.

649
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:41,980
Seeing how San Ha is knocked out like that.

650
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:45,040
Judging by the bottles, he might be knocked senseless,

651
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,680
not knocked out.

652
00:50:49,580 --> 00:50:52,800
What about Ahjumma? Still no word?

653
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,350
She wasn't going to see him in the first place.

654
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:59,920
Maybe she's worried she won't know what to say

655
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,560
when they actually meet.

656
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,520
Parents aren't the only ones with feelings. What about the children?

657
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,930
What about Kang Hae Joon's?

658
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:12,360
You keep that in mind, too.

659
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,980
Don't hide anything for your children's sake.

660
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:19,040
If I hide something, would my wise daughter just stay put?

661
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:21,240
She'd blow it up.

662
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,890
Right?

663
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,120
Isn't it about time they arrived?

664
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:30,230
Admit that I'm better than you at everything other than studying.

665
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:34,840
Admit it.

666
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,760
Or else I'll expose your true character from last night.

667
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:44,920
The true crybaby... was you and not me.

668
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,110
You better not tell Yoon Joo Won I cried, or else.

669
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:56,560
- Dad. 
 - You're here?

670
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,390
- I thoroughly washed the utensils. 
 - Good.

671
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,550
- Ahjusshi. 
 - Thanks.

672
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:08,530
Here comes the food.

673
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:13,340
Make some room.

674
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,480
What are you doing? Come sit down.

675
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,690
Yes.

676
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:22,280
All right, let's dig in.

677
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:26,160
- Thank you for the food! 
 - Thank you for the food.

678
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:33,110
It's good, right? I suggested the bean sprout soup.

679
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:36,510
Why did you drink all of a sudden?

680
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:40,030
Kim San Ha suddenly challenged me with drinks.

681
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,880
Really?

682
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:47,660
I went through a bit of a hard time.

683
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:52,810
I wanted to visit and have a meal occasionally, but I couldn't.

684
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,690
To be honest, I often argued with Mom about that.

685
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,850
But I'm fine now.

686
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:04,940
I'm going to live here with everyone like this,

687
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,950
so I won't be going back.

688
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,900
What's the big deal about coming home?

689
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,150
Let's eat! Eat.

690
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:16,770
Yes, the food tastes better when it's lively, and we eat together.

691
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,760
Dig in, everyone.

692
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,690
This is fresh. Have a bite.

693
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:24,460
- Wow, this seasoned dish is great today. 
 - Just today?

694
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:27,500
Everything's delicious. Absolutely everything.

695
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:35,310
Yes, as long as Mom arrived safely.

696
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:37,350
I'll visit sometime next month.

697
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:40,200
 You have to convince Mom about the English camp then. Okay? 

698
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,560
All right.

699
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,940
Call me if anything happens.

700
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:45,890
Or even if nothing happens.

701
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,530
Okay.

702
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,090
Is she okay?

703
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:53,590
She's good to So Hui.

704
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:55,000
Is she her only child?

705
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,170
She should be good to you.

706
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:03,890
Well, who am I to blame anyone's mom?

707
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:06,480
It's no use acting pitiful. Take it elsewhere.

708
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,890
It doesn't work with us.

709
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:13,490
How can I take it elsewhere?

710
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:16,670
Then they'd really pity me.

711
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,760
- Dad. 
 - Hey.

712
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,190
What are you doing outside?

713
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:33,720
Well...

714
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:40,490
I'd be happy if you came home often.

715
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,970
But you're busy, too.

716
00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:48,500
I know you're busy,

717
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:52,370
but I do pass by the hospital quite often.

718
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:55,990
So we can eat in the city, too. Right?

719
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:59,860
You can call me anytime.

720
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,640
Or you can just come by, too.

721
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,320
Sure. Yes, sure.

722
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,040
Sure.

723
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,920
Good job.

724
00:55:21,070 --> 00:55:23,530
Seok Hoon and Jae Eun are coming over later tonight.

725
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:24,950
You should call Dal, too.

726
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:28,010
What time? I'll be at the store, so I might end late.

727
00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:29,930
Just close for the rest of the day and get a good rest.

728
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:32,290
I should open for dinner since I closed in the morning.

729
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:35,700
Demand is skyrocketing these days, so the cakes keep selling out early.

730
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:39,000
I think word is going around on social media.

731
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,340
Then I'll drop Joo Won off at the store and drop you off at home.

732
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,690
Where are you going?

733
00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:47,100
I need to stop by the hospital for a bit.

734
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,750
All of a sudden?

735
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:53,100
We will go ahead and eat. Come when you can.

736
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:09,520
Please spare me a moment.

737
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:12,810
Oh...

738
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,280
sure.

739
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,850
You remember, right?

740
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:25,610
We ate together when you were this small.

741
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,320
Yes.

742
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:32,250
I heard from Hae Joon's aunt that you grew up like brothers since then.

743
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:33,950
Thank you.

744
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:41,730
I know why you came here today.

745
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:46,080
But I'm not ready yet.

746
00:56:46,670 --> 00:56:48,400
I know.

747
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,430
I'm not here to convince you.

748
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:55,900
I think I'll regret it if I don't tell you.

749
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:59,670
You can listen and disregard it if you want.

750
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:08,250
Hae Joon and I did grow up like brothers.

751
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:14,530
But if we hadn't met like that, we would've never been friends.

752
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:17,990
We are really incompatible from A to Z.

753
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:26,240
The reason I liked him...

754
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:30,850
was because we were abandoned by our moms.

755
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,850
That was the only reason.

756
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:37,870
I wasn't the only one.

757
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:40,130
He was like that, too.

758
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:43,530
That comforted me.

759
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,470
I know...

760
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:53,850
that measuring my misfortune with someone else's

761
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:57,200
is terrible.

762
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,150
No.

763
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:01,440
I don't think badly of you.

764
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:05,630
You must've been so desperate to think like that.

765
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:07,900
That's what I believe.

766
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:11,530
Thank you.

767
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:15,670
But I...

768
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:20,890
realized it for sure when you got on your knees.

769
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,260
Hae Joon...

770
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,610
was never abandoned.

771
00:58:34,020 --> 00:58:36,150
I was the only one.

772
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:52,970
Naturally, I should've been jealous,

773
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,900
but I wasn't.

774
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:57,330
Because I was glad.

775
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:59,690
I felt happy for him.

776
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:01,400
That his mom...

777
00:59:02,190 --> 00:59:04,780
His mom didn't abandon him.

778
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:09,890
So...

779
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:13,400
he has to know.

780
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,170
Hae Joon has to know this.

781
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,470
I hope he knows this.

782
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,330
Don't you have hands? Don't you?

783
00:59:45,330 --> 00:59:47,360
Don't you have teeth?

784
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:52,050
Jae Eun likes to eat like this.

785
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,390
Darn it! Honestly.

786
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:23,650
What's wrong with you?

787
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:25,200
It's a dream.

788
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,390
I'm crazy. What kind of dream is that?

789
01:00:34,530 --> 01:00:37,060
Babe, don't look at things like that.

790
01:00:37,060 --> 01:00:38,520
Okay.

791
01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:47,530
Were you really at the hospital?

792
01:00:48,550 --> 01:00:50,780
What would you do if I wasn't?

793
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:56,460
Are you being obsessive right now?

794
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:59,300
I'm certain something is up.

795
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:01,660
As if.

796
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,340
   

797
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:11,350
Beer? You should've told me sooner. We are already here.

798
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:13,300
Okay.

799
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,760
Do we have to go inside so soon?

800
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,400
Dal is already there.

801
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,720
Strangely, there's no end to talking about high school days.

802
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,680
Give me your hand for the last time.

803
01:01:26,580 --> 01:01:28,240
Let's go.

804
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:34,570
You're so lucky, Dal.

805
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:37,680
You get to be neighbors with your first love.

806
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:41,440
And you get to see his face every day.

807
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:46,000
- You're drunk. 
 - What?

808
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,630
She's just drunk.

809
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:51,410
I know.

810
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,400
You do?

811
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:59,780
It's Kim San Ha.

812
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,710
It's not.

813
01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:06,930
It's not Kim San Ha.

814
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:10,760
It hurts. Are you crazy?

815
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:12,690
I'll get some more beer.

816
01:02:12,690 --> 01:02:15,700
I-It's okay. We have a lot at home. I'll go get some.

817
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:18,020
It's fine. I'll go.

818
01:02:23,450 --> 01:02:24,570
Hey, seriously.

819
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:26,710
What? What's wrong with telling him?

820
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:28,870
It's all in the past.

821
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:33,870
No way.

822
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:35,970
That's pure love.

823
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:39,460
Just tell him. Why are you hiding it?

824
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:43,560
Hey, even if I tell him, it won't be in front of you.

825
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,810
Just tell him.

826
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,450
Hold on.

827
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:03,530
Being a few minutes late is fine.

828
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,200
Why?

829
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:47,050


830
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:55,030
   

831
01:03:55,700 --> 01:04:01,100
♫  Resting close to your breath  ♫

832
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,900
♫  I’m dreaming the same dream again  ♫

833
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:14,380
♫  As happy as I am, I am also sad  ♫

834
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:19,940
♫  I wish this dream would never end  ♫
