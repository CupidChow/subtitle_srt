00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,990
Why didn't you tell me Mom paid a visit?

8
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,630
I had things to think about.

9
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,630
Think? About what?

10
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:08,880
About whether you should really break up with me if Mom told you to?

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,460
Nope!

12
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,410
I should've watched more dramas.

14
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:20,470
I thought I could handle those things like they do in dramas,

15
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,230
but I couldn't say a single word to her.

16
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,060
Did Mom speak harshly to you?

17
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,750
Yeah.

18
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,560
She told me that what we have isn't love.

That I love you so much!

23

When I left Haedong ten years ago,

39
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,200
I promised myself that I would come back when I no longer

40
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,820
needed to lean on Juwon,

with my struggles and wounds.

42
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,530
I missed her so much every day,

43
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,400
but I couldn't come back because I didn't have

44
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:40,440
the courage to hide my pain.

Yes.

49

00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,400
Hello.

184
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:56,930
It would be great if you guys had time to play a game.

185
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,740
I'm fine whenever.

186
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,910
Today works, too.

187
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,070
Then, shall we play a round?

188
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,950
Come on, Babe.

189
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,700
Hurry over here!

190
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,340
The game that will decide Kang Haejun's life is about to begin!

191
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,850
Hurry up! Yes!

192
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,080
Oh, thank you.

193
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,570
What's up your sleeve?

194
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,400
The final victory.

195
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,550
Among men, it's over if you lose in a game.

196
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,550
What's this?

197
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,170
Why are you here?

198
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:43,650
Why? Can't I watch Kang Haejun play basketball?

199
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,690
I haven't been rejected yet.

200
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,230
Hang in there.

201
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,140
You should reconsider.

202
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,290
You're too good for him.

203
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,530
She has a good eye.

204
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,070
Come on!

205
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:04,020
I'll be back.

206
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,710
Be careful.

207
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,460
All right, then.

208
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:14,300
The team that loses will pay for pork belly and soju!

209
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,070
- Sounds good!
- Why are you making such a big deal?

210
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,450
Just trust me.

211
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,200
I even got my girlfriend's father's approval.

212
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,350
What nonsense are you spewing?

213
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:25,680
Think about it while you do something you love.

214
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,470
Don't regret it.

215
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,960
Fighting!

216
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,620
Fighting!

217
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,970
You know I only settle for first place, right?

218
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,690
Just tighten your shoelaces.

219
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,730
- Let's go!
- Oppas, fighting!

220
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,600
- Fighting, Babe!
- Fighting, Kang Haejun!

221
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,260
Let's go!

222
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,210
Pass it!

223
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,280
Hey, take him out of here.

224
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,280
I'll get it next time.

225
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,560
- Oh, hey!
- Pass!

226
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,130
- Haejun, let's do this.
- Crab! Crab!

227
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:19,150
- Hey, come on!
- Go, first!

228
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,300
- Go long!
- Is that all you got?

229
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,550
- Come here!
- Okay!

230
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,720
So cool!

231
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,400
Go, go!

232
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,330
♫ When I see your smile ♫

233
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,960
- Kang Haejun!
- Nice!

234
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,420
Okay, I got this!

235
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,890
Nice!

236
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:52,050
♫ Because your smiling eyes are so pretty ♫

237
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:54,940
♫ You keep standing out to me ♫

238
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,160
Babe, fighting!

239
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:00,670
Nice!

240
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:09,890
♫ You're more precious to me than myself ♫

241
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:14,450
♫ In this still sad world ♫

242
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:22,640
♫ You are the reason that makes me smile ♫

243
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,440
I lost today, so I'll treat you to pork belly!

244
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,700
I don't need pork belly,

245
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,940
but let me ask you for a favor.

246
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,470
You can ask me anything.

247
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:54,130
I'll...

248
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,190
take Dal today.

249
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,770
Sorry?

250
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,240
- I-
- You don't have to say anything.

251
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,600
- What?
- Whatever you say,

252
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,210
it doesn't matter to me.

253
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,790
No, I...

254
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,010
Let me talk first.

255
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,440
I like you, Sunbae.

256
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:42,470
No matter how stupid I am, I'm certain of that one thing.

257
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,610
I was told to study, so I did.

258
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,120
I was told to go to law school, so I did.

259
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,070
I was told to become a lawyer, so I did.

260
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:59,700
There's exactly one thing I did on my own accord.

261
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,350
That was coming down to live in Haedong.

262
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:10,550
But that wasn't because I love Haedong.

263
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:16,120
It was because Seoul was too difficult for me.

264
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:23,110
Throughout my life, there weren't many instances

265
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:27,340
where I did something or got something

266
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:31,390
because I wanted to.

267
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,670
In high school, you were the first.

268
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,820
The first time I liked anything.

269
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,670
But after today,

270
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,920
I realized I still like you.

271
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,860
So,

272
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,310
I like you.

273
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:09,080
"I like you, so what?"

274
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,960
That's what I'll tell you.

275
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,830
It was the first time I ever told anyone I liked them.

276
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,630
But if I hide in embarrassment,

277
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:24,240
then I'll feel...

278
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,930
really pathetic.

279
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,600
Can I talk now?

280
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,050
Even in my sleep, I suddenly wake up.

281
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:40,380
And suddenly, while walking the streets.

282
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,460
I worry about you

283
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,740
and think about you.

284
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:50,360
You must not be a sister to me like Juwon.

285
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,840
It will be difficult

286
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:58,040
to call you a sister.

287
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,080
I don't feel as strongly as you do...

288
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,610
yet.

289
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,080
Sorry?

290
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,870
Do you want to date me?

291
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,070
Sorry?

292
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,970
Just say yes.

293
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,990
You're good at that.

294
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:27,840
♫ Beyond the sunrise ♫

295
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,460
Yes.

296
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:51,740
There's a reason you were good at studying.

297
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,790
I did that on purpose to make Kang Haejun stand out.

298
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:59,220
If you were acting, you could've been an actor.

299
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,110
Did you like guys who were good at basketball?

300
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:03,160
It's good to do well at anything.

301
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,060
What about soccer? I'm really good at soccer.

302
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,670
What can I do to make Yoon Juwon fall for me?

303
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,850
How about we go camping since we got Ahjussi's approval?

304
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,180
Should we go camping while we're on the subject?

305
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,990
The breezy beach

306
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:25,040
or the starry mountains?

307
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,030
What?

308
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:33,890
I wonder what kind of person you would've been.

309
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:37,460
If you didn't need to pretend to be okay,

310
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:40,480
I wonder what Kim Sanha would've been like.

311
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,800
If you didn't need to hide your feelings

312
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,100
and could talk about them instead,

313
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,780
I wonder how you would've turned out.

314
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,570
Whatever I may have been,

315
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,400
the fact that I like Yoon Juwon wouldn't change.

316
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:00,230
No, let's not think about it.

317
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,780
I think you would've been thick-faced, talkative,

318
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:06,000
sleazy, and a total playboy.

319
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,650
- A playboy?
- Yeah.

320
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,220
- And cheesy?
- Yes.

321
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,370
- Am I cheesy?
- Maybe?

322
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,050
Maybe a bit.

323
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,390
Shouldn't you renovate the house a bit?

324
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,800
That came out of nowhere. Do we need to fix something?

325
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,790
Isn't Haejun's mom moving in with you?

326
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,130
What the heck are you talking about?

327
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,710
That's what Madam said earlier. That she's moving here.

328
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,170
Not this house.

329
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,260
She asked me to look in this neighborhood.

330
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,510
I didn't suggest it. Haejun did.

331
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,080
Haejun did!

332
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,180
Oh, is that so?

333
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,700
And stop making things awkward like that.

334
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,610
Who said it's awkward?

335
00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:00,020
Haejun asked how I felt about moving to this neighborhood.

336
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:04,360
That's great! It would be convenient for the kids, and I could look out for you, too.

337
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,030
Why would you do that?

338
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:10,110
Why would you look out for someone like me?

339
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,930
Well, you're Haejun's mom and-

340
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:15,420
To a man I went on a blind date with,

341
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,480
I left my child and didn't show up for 20 years.

342
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,080
I'll probably run into you a few times because of Haejun,

343
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,120
but I feel uncomfortable with people looking at us through tinted glasses.

344
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:38,990
She looks like she'd live however she wants,

345
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,350
without caring about what others think.

346
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,680
But when Haejun is involved, she won't allow even a single flaw

347
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,920
and won't do anything for her own comfort.

348
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,060
What kind of person is like that?

349
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:54,200
How long will she live like a sinner?

350
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,560
She's frustrating.

351
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,190
Yes, you're right.

352
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,310
I'm going up.

353
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:06,060
Why, already? We're just getting started.

354
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,570
Young, so young.

355
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,420
You're still in your youth.

356
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,170
Dad's youth!

357
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,300
He's the one who bought the alcohol.

358
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,990
- Going to work out?
- Yeah!

359
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,790
What are you waiting in here for?

360
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,250
Oh, I'm going. I'm going now.

361
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,330
What should I wear?

362
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,670
Hey, Dal!

363
00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:39,690
Going to work?

364
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,990
Hey!

365
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,510
It's Dal.

366
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,690
Dal, are you going to work?

367
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,030
- Did you sleep well?
- Yeah.

368
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,740
How are you getting to work?

369
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,470
The bus.

370
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,470
Can I drop you off?

371
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,760
- Yes.
- Hurry up.

372
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,340
- Okay!
- Hurry up.

373
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:15,690
Did I say you can't buy it?

374
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,980
I asked if you really had to buy it!

375
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,460
That's the same thing!

376
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,350
So, I said just buy it if you want to!

377
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:23,710
How can I buy it when you have a shitty look on your face?

378
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,660
Forget it! I won't buy it.

379
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,870
Just buy it if you'll whine about not buying it! It's all right!

380
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,370
Whine?

381
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:33,140
Whine?

382
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,090
You still complain even if I buy it for you. What do you want from me?

383
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:39,190
You should've bought it happily from the start!

384
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,950
Babe, why should I pay 500,000 won for that tiny little...

385
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,500
Should we go and de-escalate things?

386
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,400
Getting involved is more dangerous.

387
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,830
Geez, you should live alone.

388
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,130
Living alone is the best.

389
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:58,240
You'd get in trouble if my wife heard that.

390
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,800
Do you really not want to get remarried?

391
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,150
Aigoo! Go through that again?

392
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,240
I don't even have the energy anymore.

393
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,720
I'm really sorry.

394
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,360
I'm sorry.

395
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,720
Should we go and buy your gift now? Huh? I'm sorry.

396
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,850
My mother told me everyone lives like that.

397
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,810
What is it?

398
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,880
Well, Sanha is seeing someone.

399
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,870
It's about time you tell me.

400
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,410
You already knew?

401
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:43,370
So, did you call to tell me not to oppose Sanha?

402
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,270
To just leave Sanha alone?

403
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,710
It'd be great if you could since it's Sanha's business.

404
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:51,340
If Sanha gets married,

405
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,860
we'll have things to discuss, too.

406
00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:00,030
Even if they say divorced couples are no better than strangers,

407
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,770
you're still Sanha's mom.

408
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,600
Sohui wants to study in the UK.

409
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,730
What?

410
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,400
I'm going to focus more on Sohui.

411
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,090
I'm going to take her there.

412
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,160
Sanha's mom.

413
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,610
There's still some time before we leave.

414
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,550
I'm going to meet Sanha before we go.

415
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,720
Of course, you should.

416
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,050
There's nothing I can help you with?

417
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,300
Are you happy I'm leaving?

418
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:40,350
I wished you a happy life even when you said you were getting remarried.

419
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,160
Put the past behind you

420
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,610
and live comfortably. Be at peace.

421
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:48,710
Hang up. I'm busy.

422
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,620
Dr. Do Huiju?

423
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,250
Thank you.

424
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,480
Why did you disappear that day? I couldn't find you after the match.

425
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,300
I saw something I shouldn't have.

426
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,040
We really must be old now.

427
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,490
You know how to read the air now.

428
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:26,500
Forget it. Just buy me a drink.

429
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,800
- Should I?
- Really?

430
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,350
Yeah, I'll go with Juwon.

431
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,430
Gosh, so full of it.

432
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:34,970
I'm leaving.

433
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,790
Hey! Hey, hold on!

434
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:40,270
What do you think about Dal's blind date? I can hook you up.

435
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:49,110
Should I just throw a tantrum for Mom and Dad to marry?

436
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:50,710
No!

437
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:55,760
Look. Mr. Yoon needs to simmer for a while, like beef broth

438
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,810
before you can see his pearly feelings.

439
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,820
He hasn't simmered enough yet.

440
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,550
Then, should I just wait?

441
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,470
No!

442
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:12,070
You have to watch the fire and turn it low and high at the right times.

443
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,760
What are you telling me to do?

444
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,330
Madam!

445
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,810
Are you nagging Haejun again?

446
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:19,640
No, no.

447
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,490
You can't find a decent house in the neighborhood?

448
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:27,640
Yeah, the house prices have skyrocketed in this neighborhood.

449
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,230
After taking over the basketball class, I have some money-

450
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,930
shortages!

451
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,910
Yes! I don't have money.

452
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,810
Gosh, I don't have money.

453
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,210
Why? Do you need money?

454
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:43,550
There's some money I saved up.

455
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:47,360
I was going to buy a store for you, but you did well on your own.

456
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,740
I plan to give it to you when you marry.

457
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,190
Then, you shouldn't touch that money.

458
00:29:53,190 --> 00:29:56,090
You shouldn't lay a finger on his wedding fund.

459
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,920
She's right! I need to get married.

460
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,920
Are you seeing someone right now?

461
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,420
You are!

462
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,030
Aigoo...

463
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:17,660
He's acting like this, so you and his mom settle down together!

464
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,630
Aigoo, this is too frustrating.

465
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,850
What are you so focused on?

466
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,440
The rice cake store owner told me this.

467
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,780
[Recruiting for online marketing support]
Haejun's aunt's company is supporting small businesses in the neighborhood.

468
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,320
This is vital to small business owners like me.

469
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:45,050
I'm looking into it so I can apply.

470
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:48,250
Yoon Juwon, you're quite the boss.

471
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,130
You just haven't seen it.

472
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,950
I paid back my loan within five years of opening the store.

473
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,580
Determined to pay back my loan within five years,

474
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:58,970
I never used a part-timer.

475
00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:01,700
And I even baked my own cakes.

476
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,760
And I really paid off my loan on the five-year mark.

477
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:10,990
I cried so much that day.

478
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:16,310
The first few years, I was afraid I'd go bankrupt.

479
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,590
How come you never talked about it?

480
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,920
Never mind.

481
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:30,810
I should've known even if you didn't say anything.

482
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,640
It's okay.

483
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,680
I'm debt-free now, and Daldal Bakery has many regulars.

484
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,520
It's only uphill from here.

485
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,320
It's totally a "plus" life.

486
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,800
So, I need to apply today for that "plus."

487
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:58,050
Juwon insisted she wouldn't go to college after graduating.

488
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,060
All the friends tried hard to change her mind.

489
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,050
- Is that right?
- She said she wanted to bake cakes

490
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,860
and applied to a baking academy during winter break.

491
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:10,040
I was surprised she was actually doing what she set her mind on.

492
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,750
Running a small business isn't easy.

493
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,350
Park Dal.

494
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,000
- Yes?
- Tell me something about yourself.

495
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,090
- Sorry?
- Do you have any struggles?

496
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,880
I don't.

497
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,430
If you're an attorney,

498
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,740
are you ever in any dangerous situations?

499
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,880
I'm not trying to stop you or anything,

500
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,030
but if you ever end up having to defend

501
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:39,160
thugs, loan sharks, serial killers, and the like-

502
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:51,010
Sunbae, you watched too many dramas.

503
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:04,040
Sunbae, did I offend you?

504
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,800
I really asked out of worry.

505
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,690
- Sorry.
- Oh, it's okay!

506
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,590
I didn't mean to make you apologize.

507
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,470
By the way,

508
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:16,790
you laugh out loud like that?

509
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:20,440
It's very nice to hear.

510
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:26,900
Want to come out?

511
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,430
It's hot.

512
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,360
Let's go for a walk.

513
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,710
Okay.

514
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,680
Yoon Juwon.

515
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,260

517
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,360
Juwon.

518
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,680
Yes.

519
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,050
I'm sorry.

520
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:28,260
You couldn't even whine with our dads when you were having a hard time.

521
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,040
You must've worked so hard to grow up so well

522
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,300
on your own all this time.

523
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,990
Just how worried you must've been.

524
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:45,400
As for me, because coming back here was so difficult,

525
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:49,510
I couldn't think about you, who was struggling to protect this place.

526
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:54,920
I'm sorry.

527
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,900
I'm really sorry.

Where did you go so late last night?

535
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,500
A walk.

536
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,320
It was hot, so we took a walk around the town.

537
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,470
Why go out when it's hot? You should stay home.

538
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:58,680
Can I also go on night walks with Juwon?

539
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,580
Can I?

540
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,580
No way.

541
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,970
Why can't we go on walks?

542
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,840
What do you do on your walks?

543
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,780
That's enough.

544
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,710
By the way, Dal was so tired in the morning.

545
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,300
Did you walk about 5 km?

546
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,310
Gosh, that's enough!

547
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,710
Think about what to do about Mom and Dad.

548
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,530
You said you're going home today, right?

549
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,460
Go and talk it out with Dad.

550
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,170
It's the adults' business. Don't be nosy.

551
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,710
It's because they're adults.

552
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,180
They probably can't do a thing because they're mindful of us.

553
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:35,380
Look at him. The young one does what he needs to do.

554
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,930
I told you to cut it out.

555
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40,380
Help me.

556
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,530
- Hey, go easy on her.
- Save me-

557
00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:48,590
Why didn't you help?

558
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:51,250
- You freed yourself.
- You still need to help.

559
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,470
I'm sorry.

560
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,120
You still need to save me!

561
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,440
- Okay, okay.
- Gosh, when will they grow up?

562
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:58,320
- Mercy.
- You promised.

563
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,980
- Hey, wait for me!
- Hurry up!

564
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,060
Aigoo.

565
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,040
You still have things to take from here?

566
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,620
I was reminded of a book I used to read.

567
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,760
Hey...

568
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,820
you heard Mom is going to England, right?

569
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,200
Yes.

570
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:32,680
She comes and goes, all as she pleases.

571
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,710
But I don't think that's the case this time.

572
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,440
Yes, I know.

573
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,870
I should've told you every time

574
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:45,980
why she was going and coming all those years.

575
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,790
My goodness.

576
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,610
I wasn't able to...

577
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:55,060
You stayed here, Dad.

578
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:59,670
You didn't go anywhere and stayed here.

579
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:03,190
Whether I go away or come back,

580
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:05,690
you're always here.

581
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:09,130
And that's why I was okay.

582
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,870
You're late. Hurry up and go now.

583
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:17,300
Go now.

584
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,650
By the way, Dad,

585
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:26,050
aren't you interested in seeing anyone?

586
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,380
Aigoo, I'm fine.

587
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,990
O-Once is enough for me.

588
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,640
Gosh, did I tell you to get married?

589
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,450
You could just have a girlfriend.

590
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:37,920
Come on...

591
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:45,220
What? You're telling me to meet someone to watch movies and have coffee together?

592
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:46,770
Yes.

593
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:48,920
Do what you want to do.

594
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:53,410
Besides the police station, home, and family.

595
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:55,420
Think about those things.

596
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,330
How can there be such things? I don't have the time.

597
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:02,000
It's late. Hurry up and go now! Go on.

598
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,800
- I'll go now. See you next time.
- Okay.

599
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,470
Aigoo.

600
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,220
Yes! It's so nice.

601
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,810
Aigoo, it's so nice!

602
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,490
Why are you telling me to do nothing?

603
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,750
Does Ahjussi have feelings for Ahjumma or not?

604
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,880
- He does.
- Would Ahjumma not know when we know?

605
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,280
She probably does.

606
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,880
It shows quite a lot.

607
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,510
But if there hasn't been any progress so far,

608
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,590
it means Ahjumma isn't ready.

609
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:44,170
But if we rush Ahjussi altogether,

610
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:46,750
how will Ahjussi feel?

611
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,440
Will he be in a spot?

612
00:39:49,290 --> 00:39:50,370
Embarrassed?

613
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,510
I know this because I experienced it.

614
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:55,000
The most frustrated one isn't us.

615
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,610
It's Ahjussi.

616
00:39:57,470 --> 00:40:00,090
I feel so sorry for my dad.

617
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:02,320
I was a sorry one, too.

618
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,570
When you didn't accept me.

619
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,000
When did I ever say I wouldn't accept you?

620
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,120
You said you wouldn't give me a chance.

621
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,320
Don't you recall?

622
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,190
Gosh, you even hold grudges, huh?

623
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:27,270
♫ How in the world do I? ♫

624
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,130
You inside?

625
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,990
Yes, I'm here, too!

626
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,260
- Hey.
- Why are you here?

627
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,630
We were talking about Dad.

628
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,960
You can talk in the living room.

629
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,260
I'm going. I was about to go.

630
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,760
Bye.

631
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,760
What?

632
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:59,670
Gosh, do I really have to find a new place?

633
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,840
Hello.

634
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,290
Did you come because of your dad?

635
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,910
Yes.

636
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,730
You don't need to be mistaken.

637
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:40,500
I went to see him a few times because of Haejun.

638
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,570
Your dad and I don't have any other intention.

639
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,620
Back then...

640
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:50,880
when I said, I didn't need a mom...

641
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,100
I think I said that because you're pretty.

642
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:00,720
I have no memory of my mom, so I only know her from her pictures.

643
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,640
But my mom in her pictures is really pretty.

644
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:10,060
And when you showed up that day, Ahjumma,

645
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,550
you were really pretty.

646
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,040
I don't quite remember because I was too young.

647
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,840
But I remember I was mad because you were pretty...

648
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,450
and...

649
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:32,360
I remember I was mad because of the way Dad looked at you.

650
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,120
Looking at it after I grew up,

651
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,660
I don't think Dad ever looked at anyone the same way.

652
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:47,870
I probably won't ever get to have

653
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:53,700
a mom again if it isn't you in my life.

654
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,690
Could you be my mom, please?

655
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:59,100
I'll be a good daughter.

656
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:18,700
You'll ruin your shoulder like that!

657
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,460
Making your body tire out

658
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:23,750
just because your mind's cluttered is for when you're young.

659
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:28,980
You need to be wary of your age now, Mr. Yoon!

660
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:31,690
I think I'll do radish noodles this summer, too.

661
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:35,070
Last year, quite a lot of people were asking about it.

662
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,000
I won't do it.

663
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,870
You can hire someone or

664
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:44,140
you can get married and make your wife do it.

665
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,210
But I won't do it.

666
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,500
Well, should I go on a blind date

667
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:54,160
and say that I need to get married because I need someone to make

668
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,670
summer radish kimchi for me?

669
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:58,490
My goodness.

670
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,500
Madam, as I was saying, go to the marketplace

671
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,200
and check out the summer radish.

672
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:18,600
O-Oh, yes. Aigoo.

673
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:21,550
I'm not going.

674
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:25,300
I'm just going to go home.

675
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:30,630
Summer radish noodles?

676
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,830
Why don't you try?

677
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,430
- Take a seat.
- Yes.

678
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:52,010
What brings you here today?

679
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:55,920
Did Haejun say something again?

680
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,780
I don't know how to make summer radish kimchi.

681
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,870
Sorry?

682
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:04,110
But...

683
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:06,740
I'll still try to learn how.

684
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,470
What do you mean?

685
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:12,310
I'll try to learn...

686
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,770
how to keep a home,

687
00:45:15,770 --> 00:45:19,540
make noodles, and raise a daughter, too.

688
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:42,130
I asked you not to make things uncomfortable for me.

689
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:45,060
But I was being too shameless, right?

690
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:51,980
I was always wayward with you, Jeongjae.

691
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:54,750
I shouldn't have done that.

692
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,250
I'm sorry.

693
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,570
Y-You see...

694
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:10,540
You see, I had feelings for you from the first day you came here.

695
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:19,600
A single father having feelings isn't a big deal.

696
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,670
So, I just put it aside and went on with life.

697
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:26,980
But those feelings returned after I saw you again.

698
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:39,010
I doubted my heart would race again at this age,

699
00:46:39,010 --> 00:46:41,330
but it does indeed race.

700
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,320
Gosh, you know...

701
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,910
You don't need to learn how to make kimchi or do house chores.

702
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,610
Let's just...

703
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,760
laugh and cry together.

704
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,410
Let's just live like that.

705
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,310
Hey, let's turn it this way.

706
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:44,590
Lift it. One, two, three!

707
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:47,830
I mean, let's just put it back where it was.

708
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:50,890
Still, we should switch up the new sofa and the bed placement to

709
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:53,390
make it feel like a newlywed's home.

710
00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:57,110
That's why we should redo the walls and get them new furniture.

711
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:00,380
Hey, I'll take care of it.

712
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:02,110
You should stop coming over!

713
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:05,310
Dad, just a new sofa won't make it feel like a newlywed's home.

714
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:06,620
That one.

715
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:09,610
That one lived in Haedong longer than Kim Sanha.

716
00:48:09,610 --> 00:48:12,400
