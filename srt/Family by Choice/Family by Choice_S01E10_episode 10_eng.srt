1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,210


2
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,990
   

3
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,010
   

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,670
   

5
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,850
   

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,780
   

7
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,200
   

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,920
Well, the two of us moved back permanently.

9
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,030
We won't leave again.

10
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,480
Wow, my daughter's birthday will be a noisy one this year, right?

11
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:04,410
Who said you can?

12
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,510
Dad, you were at the store last year on my birthday.

13
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,990
And Ahjusshi had work.

14
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,820
I was busy at the store, too.

15
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,750
We spent it quietly all this time.

16
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,080
Why must it be noisy?

17
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:20,300
I have plans I can't cancel that day.

18
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,220
Even so, your oppas are back after a long time.

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,960
It'd be nice to spend your birthday together.

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,960
That's right, all nice and cozy with your family.

21
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,950
We aren't family, though.

22
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,640
Kim, Yang, and I'm Yoon.

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,650
How is that a family?

24
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,660
Whether you eat miyeokguk (seaweed soup) or ramen,

25
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,580
the four of you can enjoy.

26
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:45,280
I'll leave now.

27
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,550
Don't worry.

28
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,280
I'll talk to her.

29
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,000
I'll go with you.

30
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,610
I understand Joo Won.

31
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,960
She's exhausted, too.

32
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:11,700
I'll talk to her, so stay quiet.

33
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,420
Why?

34
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,930
Let's talk for a moment.

35
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:18,250
I have nothing to talk about.

36
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,040
Did you think I'd be grateful that you remembered my birthday?

37
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,410
No, I knew you'd be angry.

38
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,040
Then what?

39
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,610
I missed you.

40
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,500
Now? After all this time?

41
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,220
Ahjusshi, Dad, and I all missed you.

42
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,610
But so what?

43
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:50,480
Who cares? It's all in the past.

44
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,760
What's the point in telling me after all this time?

45
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,820
Kang Hae Joon, come here.

46
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,250
Okay.

47
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,740
I'm not glad to see either of you.

48
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,990
I don't know what brought you here,

49
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:06,630
but leave me out of your plans.

50
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,890
She absolutely hates us.

51
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,450
We knew she would.

52
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,140
We should try a different approach.

53
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,590
We forgot to tell her...

54
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:43,020
   

55
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,610
How was it? Did you act like the in-law's third cousin (distant relative)?

56
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,030
I did my best.

57
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:53,300
Why did they come? What brought them here?

58
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,010
Just because.

59
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,580
How was he?

60
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,250
Do his eyes still sparkle?

61
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,300
Is his nose still sharp?

62
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,940
They were just ten years older Kim San Ha and Kang Hae...

63
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,140
Yang Hae Joon.

64
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,030
Really?

65
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,980
- Are you happy? 
 - No!

66
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:18,370
I was just asking.

67
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,190
So how long are they staying?

68
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,150
- They're not leaving. 
 - What?

69
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:26,190
They both came back permanently,

70
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,790
and want to spend our birthdays together from now on.

71
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,660
How could they act like nothing happened?

72
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,500
They didn't even apologize?

73
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,390
They didn't.

74
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,740
Whatever. They have nothing to do with me now.

75
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,780
You're right. Haedong's a big town.

76
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,320
You probably won't encounter them at all.

77
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,310
- Right? 
 - Yes.

78
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,110
I won't!

79
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,830
Hey.

80
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,170
What's your plan today?

81
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:01,300
What will you tell Joo Won?

82
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,920
I'll take care of it.

83
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,520
It won't be easy.

84
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,610
I should at least try. Who knows?

85
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:11,020
 Put some clothes on. 

86
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,440
 What if someone comes over? 

87
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,370
It's hot.

88
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,190
What the heck? Wh-Why are you coming out from there?

89
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,850
Come out!

90
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,010
 What? Did you forget something? 

91
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,840
Wait...

92
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,450
I need to rush to work.

93
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:51,950
Hey. Hey!

94
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,270
It's not surprising.

95
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,410
I heard someone moved in next door, but only their belongings came.

96
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,820
I thought it was really strange.

97
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,270
Were you aware?

98
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,210
Of course, you were.

99
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,860
This is too much to be a coincidence.

100
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,620
Let's go. We will be late.

101
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,450
You know where the store is, right?

102
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,430
You'd better come later.

103
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,350
   

104
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,410
 A 42-year-old female T.A (Traffic Accident) patient. 

105
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,000
The operation was done three days ago.

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,980
We're monitoring the progress while applying dressings. 
    

107
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,390
Next is a 12-year-old male.

108
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,880
I don't know if he got hurt playing soccer or basketball.

109
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,890
- When I was young, I also– 
 - Hey, hey!

110
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,340
It's a wrist fracture.

111
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,560
- No questions, right? 
  - Right. 

112
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,430
Let's conclude after introducing our new member.

113
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,080
I'm third-year resident Kim San Ha.

114
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,600
Professor Kim recommended me. I look forward to working with you.

115
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,800
Why are you all so listless?

116
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,870
What medication should I prescribe for this patient?

117
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,240
Prescribe blood pressure medication.

118
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,780
What's your problem?

119
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,360
Why did you come suddenly? 
    

120
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,140
There was an opening. I applied, and they asked me to come.

121
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,120
Myungju University Hospital is a regional hub,

122
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,420
so residents have many opportunities to participate in operations.

123
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,430
Anyway, who are you?

124
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,080
Hyungnim, don't you remember me?

125
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,990
He went to our school. Don't you know?

126
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,280
   

127
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,880
You don't still follow Joo Won around, do you?

128
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,490
No man forgets his first love, Hyungnim.

129
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,000
How do I say this? Meeting you feels like destiny calls once more.

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,440
Of all timing, you're here while I'm interning in Orthopedics.

131
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,630
Get out of my way!

132
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,070
What about Hae Joon? What is he doing?

133
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,890
- Why do you ask? 
 - I'm his first love.

134
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,060
Really?

135
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,630
- I am. 
 - Sure.

136
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,410
It's been three years since I saw you, and you're as infuriating as ever.

137
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,980
And it seems you're even more shameless than three years ago.

138
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,460
Well, what about Hae Joon?

139
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:49,130
Hey!

140
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,280
   

141
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,710
Do...

142
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,350
D-Do you need help with anything?

143
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,000
No.

144
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,570
Why did you come out of the unit next door?

145
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,010
I came back to treat you and Dad well.

146
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:20,720
Living near you will give me more opportunities to do so.

147
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,830
There's no need to treat me well.

148
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,520
Move into Dad's house and live with him. Then you can treat him well.

149
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,800
I was going to move in.

150
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,240
I'm just there temporarily because I have something to do.

151
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,620
Do what?

152
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,800
Isn't Kim San Ha the only one with a job?

153
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,730
Even at one glance,

154
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,080
I can tell you're the town loafer.

155
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,410
I have plans, too.

156
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,690
You'll find out soon enough.

157
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:46,120
I don't want to know.

158
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,950
Would you rather hit me if you're going to keep being mean?

159
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,270
Should I really hit you?

160
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:54,570
Absolutely!

161
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,650
I'd rather you do that.

162
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,720
I'm willing to hit you,

163
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,390
but I can't use my bare hands. Are you sure about this?

164
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,130
Wh-What do you want to hit me with?

165
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,890
Why? Should I buy something?

166
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,810
Go to the bathhouse and also get yourself some new sneakers.

167
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,620
- That's for me to use? 
 - Keep it under ₩100,000.

168
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,500
No more than that.

169
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,180
Make sure to buy branded sneakers.

170
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,930
These are branded, too.

171
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:45,670
I said, sneakers, not slippers. Don't you know sneakers?

172
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,650
Make sure to buy some socks as well.

173
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,090
Okay.

174
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,870
Could it be...

175
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,700
you feel bad if I look broke in other people's eyes?

176
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,260
Me?

177
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,480
Why would I?

178
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,190
If you arrive at the store in that outfit,

179
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:18,120
I'm worried you'll drive away even the regulars.

180
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,830
I understand. I'll take a bath and clean..

181
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:32,110
 Mr. Yang, we have a property for you. Can you come right away? 

182
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,620
Hey, I'll take a bath and return all clean! Okay?

183
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,550
Thanks, I'll use it well!

184
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:48,800
They say every family has a troublemaker.

185
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,690
You have one, too.

186
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,090
Gosh, why do you keep saying that?

187
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:56,780
It's great that both sons came down together.

188
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,420
Did San Ha really become a doctor at Myungju University Hospital?

189
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,310
Yes, he did.

190
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:05,300
Will San Ha treat us well if we go to him?

191
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,980
Yes, he will do the best he can.

192
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,890
Aigoo, that's why they say you must have a doctor in your family!

193
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,930
But why are you eating noodles?

194
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:18,990
I'm sure you'd be full even if you don't eat.

195
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,140
What do you mean?

196
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,780
One is a doctor and the other is unemployed.

197
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:30,480
So one looks impressive while the other doesn't.

198
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,950
Does Hae Joon speak some English?

199
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,500
Gosh, I'm sure he does.

200
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,470
He spent years in America.

201
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,300
I guess he can't.

202
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,710
I'm thankful he returned in one piece, all healthy.

203
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,700
Gosh, Mr. Yoon is right about that.

204
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,810
- Health comes first. 
 - Yes.

205
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,630
If being healthy is a young man's best achievement, he has a problem.

206
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,590
There's no problem.

207
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,490
You kept in touch with Joo Won, didn't you?

208
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,830
So what if I did?

209
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:11,360
It's not too far from here, so many of her regulars are in our hospital.

210
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,960
School reunions happen much too often.

211
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,090
Haedong High's graduates are quite active, as you know.

212
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,730
So she has been doing well.

213
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,130
Of course, she's doing great!

214
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:24,640
The teachers worried about what Joo Won would do after graduating.

215
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,850
She's the only one who's really successful.

216
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,330
Daldal is famous on SNS (social media).

217
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:33,650
I only got my mother's birthday cake because I placed the order weeks ago.

218
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,140
Really?

219
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,110
A person needs to excel at one thing, whatever it may be.

220
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,750
Joo Won is probably the only Haedong High graduate who is a business owner.

221
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:46,520
How about a boyfriend?

222
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,130
Does she have one or something?

223
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,110
- I was actually going to tell you– 
 - Hey, Lee Joon Ho!

224
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,720
Did you show Professor Kim the CT scan* you took this morning? 
  (TN: Computed Tomography scan) 

225
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,800
- I-I was going to show him right now! 
 - Wait.

226
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,210
What were you going to say?

227
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,090
Hyungnim, let's talk again later.

228
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:13,510
Mr. Yoon, I'm going to get some fresh air.

229
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:15,060
Yes, thanks for your work.

230
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,740
Aigoo, why do I crave sweets?

231
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:26,720
Madam is only worried about Hae Joon, you know.

232
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,480
It's understandable.

233
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,950
I'm worried about him, too.

234
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,540
Is he interested in getting a steady job?

235
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,920
Mr. Yoon, why don't you move to the town center?

236
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,250
And get some more tables.

237
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,310
Aigoo, I can hardly manage this by myself.

238
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,530
That's why you need to do it with Hae Joon.

239
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,540
You're right.

240
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,830
Hae Joon won't have to suffer elsewhere trying to learn a trade,

241
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,370
and Mr. Yoon will be at ease if Hae Joon is by his side.

242
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:59,490
Money from selling this restaurant won't be nearly enough.

243
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,650
Don't you have any savings?

244
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,670
"Savings"?

245
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,410
He does.

246
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,400
I do.

247
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,670
Mr. Yang!

248
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,010
Dress formally the next time you come.

249
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:26,410
No one will take you seriously in those clothes.

250
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,660
I had to come in a rush.

251
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,640
Will you be running the shop yourself, Mr. Yang?

252
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,020
No, my dad will be running it.

253
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:39,080
It has to be the largest and the best one here!

254
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,420
Aigoo, what a filial son.

255
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,080
"A filial son"?

256
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,880
A filial son.

257
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,700
Let's go.

258
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,390
   

259
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,750
My goodness.

260
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,410
What's this? What are you doing here?

261
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:39,050
You said you'd finish at seven o'clock.

262
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,070
- It's nine o'clock right now. 
 - Those are the store hours.

263
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,380
I need to prep for tomorrow.

264
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,440
Were you here since seven o'clock?

265
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,400
Are you walking home?

266
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:59,350
Should I escort you home?

267
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:02,150
We are going in the same direction. Don't be silly.

268
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,710
Wait a second.

269
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,230
There.

270
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,060
 Sugar when you're down. 

271
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,930
 It's therapy for everybody. 

272
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:54,110
 How do you feel now? Better? 

273
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,570
It's nice.

274
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,910
Aren't there freezies in Seoul?

275
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:03,130
There probably are,

276
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,780
but I never had one.

277
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,930
What were you doing with your life, not having freezies?

278
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:10,260
I know, right?

279
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:14,460
It's really pathetic quitting snacks the moment you become an adult.

280
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,310
Why won't you eat this delicious stuff?

281
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:21,270
Even if you're busy, you must buy a freezie and get going again.

282
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:25,140
Downtown changed a lot, right?

283
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,070
They say even mountains and rivers change over a decade.

284
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,290
The cake store over there was replaced by Life Photos.

285
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:34,050
What do you think? You can really feel it, right?

286
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,830
What?

287
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:40,170
Aren't you going in?

288
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,020
No, I'm going to walk a little more.

289
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,510
Okay.

290
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,700
Joo Won.

291
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,430
Yes?

292
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,240
What do you want to do tomorrow?

293
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,460
Ahjusshi said to come to eat miyeokguk in the morning.

294
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,470
I told you I'm not going. You all can do what you want.

295
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,350
Okay.

296
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,740
Good night.

297
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,350
All right.

298
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,930
Joo Won.

299
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,660
Yoon Joo Won!

300
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,010
What now?

301
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,250
Happy birthday.

302
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,000
It's tomorrow.

303
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,270
It's only a few hours away.

304
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,800
I won't get to see you at midnight.

305
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:44,170
    
 ♫  Even if you don't say where it hurts  ♫

306
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,940
   

307
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,020
Yes, I'm on my way.

308
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,490
Okay.

309
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:54,410
Aren't you working me too hard on my first day?

310
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:57,620
Yes.

311
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,300
I understand.

312
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:16,800
♫  Afraid you'd get caught while secretly following me  ♫

313
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:27,760
♫  Without me knowing. Your back as you looked up to the sky  ♫

314
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,540
♫  Afraid stars might pour down on your cheeks  ♫

315
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:41,300
♫  I know; My wish, as it's smaller than my height  ♫

316
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,080
Do you have to be this shabby?

317
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,410
 Aren't there freezies in Seoul? 

318
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:51,290
 There probably are, but I never had one. 

319
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:55,210
You couldn't even buy yourself a freezie?

320
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:59,410
♫  Like the beautiful moon  ♫

321
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:08,650
♫  I will always, as I have always done, be with you  ♫

322
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,580
   

323
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,530
 Your call cannot be connected– 

324
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,990
Hey, is Joo Won inside?

325
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,430
She won't even answer her phone.

326
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,820
She left early this morning.

327
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,680
She always leaves early when she has to bake.

328
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,560
Is that so?

329
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:54,510
Wh-What is it?

330
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,540
How come you look just like you did ten years ago, Dal?

331
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,350
I'm going, then.

332
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,740
Wow. Gosh.

333
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,390
I'm not the same at all.

334
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:27,630
I'm Attorney Park Dal.

335
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,000
My hairstyle is different, to begin with.

336
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:38,090
I totally look professional.

337
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,670
Yes, apparently, she went to the store early.

338
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,110
Should I go to her store?

339
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,620
We can't force her to come.

340
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:52,330
Just come home. We will just pack her miyeokguk.

341
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:53,920
Yes.

342
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,290
 It's been days since you went there, and you haven't even called. 

343
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,960
 I told So Hui not to call you. 

344
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,830
 So she won't bother you on your rare break. 

345
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,740
 I'll call So Hui. 

346
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,820
   

347
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,960
Are you calling Oppa again?

348
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,850
I'm not.

349
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:44,020
What do you want for breakfast? Do you want toast?

350
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,180
I don't have an appetite.

351
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:49,390
Oppa is on vacation.

352
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,420
We agreed not to contact him.

353
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,590
The caretaker and I will take you to the rehab center,

354
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,200
so don't worry.

355
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,750
Let Oppa get some rest.

356
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,230
Do you think he's actually resting?

357
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,000
He ultimately went back.

358
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,960
What will you do if he says he will live there?

359
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,350
You don't want that either, do you?

360
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:14,450
Anyway, stop contacting Oppa.

361
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,630
Come home early.

362
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,780
 Wow, my daughter's birthday will be a noisy one this year, right? 

363
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,250
 Who said you can? 

364
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:53,340
 We spent it quietly all this time. Why does it have to be noisy? 
   

365
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,460
I'll give him a call.

366
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,230
N-No.

367
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,920
Hey, we didn't even sing.

368
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,700
There's no need to sing. I'm not a child.

369
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,590
Dad, let's not buy a cake for my birthday from now on.

370
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:16,870
I eat it every day.

371
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:20,330
I don't want to eat the cake I made on my birthday, too.

372
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:26,370
Instead, I'll bake the most delicious cakes for your birthdays. All right?

373
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,090
Okay!

374
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,630
Sure!

375
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:33,700
Cheers!

376
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,200
Wow, what is this?

377
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,090
Is it braised chicken?

378
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,910
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

379
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,520
She said she wasn't coming.

380
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,980
Don't wait and just eat. It's getting cold.

381
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,320
The store must be busy.

382
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,630
I'll try one more time.

383
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:31,700
I'm here. Why do you keep calling me?

384
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,480
The birthday girl doesn't even have rice.

385
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,980
I came to eat miyeokguk.

386
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,240
I haven't served it yet in case it gets cold. Wait.

387
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,040
Let's eat.

388
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,850
Let's eat.

389
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,940
Thank you for the food.

390
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:44,120
- All right! One, two, three! 
  - ♪  Happy birthday–  ♪

391
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:49,200
I'm not a child. Skip the song.

392
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,520
I've become another year older.

393
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,550
I'll ask each of you a question as the birthday girl.

394
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,160
Was it five years ago?

395
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,010
I called you, but the number no longer existed.

396
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,370
That's when you quit basketball, right?

397
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,820
- What? 
 - Did anyone else here play basketball?

398
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,590
Quitting basketball is one thing.

399
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,380
Why did you cut off contact?

400
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,010
Thinking something might've happened to you,

401
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:19,810
Dad put aside his pride and called that ahjusshi, did you know?

402
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:22,120
Why are you bringing that up suddenly?

403
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:28,060
Did you know that ahjusshi told Dad to mind his own business since you already cut ties?

404
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:31,090
And Dad was just relieved because it seemed you were okay.

405
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,280
Do you know how upset Ahjusshi and I were?

406
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,440
I had no idea.

407
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,510
How could you not? Are you stupid?

408
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,600
What would we think when we couldn't reach you?

409
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,520
Joo Won, why do you keep talking about the past?

410
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,020
Why can't I? I thought we were family.

411
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:48,160
You wanted me to blow out the candles on my birthday,

412
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,020
but I can't even ask these things?

413
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:52,480
He's here in the end.

414
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,330
All that matters is that he's here and healthy.

415
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,830
Hae Joon...

416
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,820
hurt his leg.

417
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:07,280
He should have known when to stop, but he pushed himself too hard.

418
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,270
Hey!

419
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,740
He called me from America.

420
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,460
He asked if he could walk again.

421
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,450
If what the American doctors said was true.

422
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:20,940
Have you gone crazy?

423
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,120
Where is it?

424
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,980
Which leg?

425
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,050
It's okay. I'm fine now.

426
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,810
It's just the scar that's left.

427
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,070
It doesn't hurt at all.

428
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:00,120
I'm fine!

429
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,310
Okay.

430
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,650
As long as it doesn't hurt.

431
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,510
You guys must be thirsty.

432
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:16,900
Milk... The milk...

433
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,610
The milk...

434
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,300
Why the dramatics in front of the children?

435
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,920
It's my fault.

436
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,080
I shouldn't have told him to go to America.

437
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,830
I told you not to say that!

438
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,760
I can't even talk?

439
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,360
 Why don't you tell Hae Joon that? 

440
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,510
 Lower your voice. 

441
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,210
 Stop shaking your hands. 

442
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,220
 Hand it over! I'll do it. 

443
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,640
 It's fine! 

444
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,420
 Go sit down. 

445
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,440
 Once I calm down– 

446
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,470
 What's the use in calming down now? You made it too obvious. 

447
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,870
 Get away from me! 

448
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,660
See?

449
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,820
The children all left because of us.

450
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,090
Why did you cry in front of the children?

451
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,560
 They left because they wanted to. 

452
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,850
 And I didn't cry in front of them. I came into the kitchen. 

453
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,650
 You should have gone to your room. 

454
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:43,170
 Going into my room is weirder. 

455
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,680
It's fine. They'll forget about it before lunchtime

456
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,090
and debate what to eat for lunch.

457
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,830
I just can't play basketball.

458
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,720
Otherwise, I'm fine. See?

459
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,490
I can still beat you in a 100-meter race.

460
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,960
I can beat that guy, too.

461
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,960
You're not that good.

462
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,950
If you overdo it, your ankle will give out under your weight

463
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,510
and your knee will hurt, too.

464
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,780
That's what he's saying.

465
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,900
Who are you to say otherwise when I'm feeling fine?

466
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:41,560
Why listen to him when I'm telling you I'm fine?

467
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,370
Well, he's the one with a license.

468
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:47,580
Why believe a liar who didn't even tell us he got injured?

469
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:51,220
I used to tell you, didn't I?

470
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,360
We must tell each other everything.

471
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,860
We must live like that.

472
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,540
That held quite a deep meaning for me.

473
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,460
You didn't keep your promise that you'd return after graduating college.

474
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,830
But you didn't even tell me why you didn't return.

475
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,700
I'm innocent!

476
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,390
He's the one who kept quiet about his injury.

477
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,190
If that's the case, I'm at a disadvantage!

478
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:26,300
I couldn't come from America, but he was only in Seoul!

479
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,920
We can't be the same!

480
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,750
That's why it's over.

481
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,660
That's why we can't return to old times.

482
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:54,930
I'm sorry I came later than I had promised.

483
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:57,000
I don't need to hear your apology.

484
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,530
Why couldn't you come?

485
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:02,240
 No. You can't go! 

486
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,080
 If you leave, what about So Hu? 

487
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,040
 What about me? 

488
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,830
I was busy.

489
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,520
Is that so?

490
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,810
I tried to return multiple times–

491
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:28,570
Never mind. I'm not asking you to tell me everything after all this time.

492
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,690
What's the point?

493
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:37,290
Back then, you knew even if I didn't say anything.

494
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:39,270
That's because...

495
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:42,450
we always ate together back then.

496
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,500
That's not the case anymore.

497
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,060
I'm sorry.

498
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,790
Okay.

499
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:04,510
   

500
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,980
Are you finishing late today, too?

501
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,660
Past your store hours?

502
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:12,140
No, I'm going to close at 7:00 p.m. and drink beer with Dal.

503
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:15,500
Should I come by in the evening?

504
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,190
It's your decision.

505
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,140
I'll come by 7:00 p.m.

506
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:23,400
Welcome!

507
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,830
We're open!

508
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,640
Can I take your order?

509
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,600
Three strawberry lattes and...

510
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,220
- a croissant, too.
 - One croissant?

511
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,130
One croissant.

512
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,140
Did it hurt a lot?

513
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,380
I said it doesn't hurt!

514
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,840
Look.

515
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,270
It's totally fine.

516
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:14,260
At the time of the injury, did it hurt a lot?

517
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:21,380
You were new to that family, too.

518
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,100
They probably couldn't tend to you.

519
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,380
You should have returned immediately.

520
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:40,680
I told you

521
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,500
that there's no need to try too hard.

522
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,090
I told you to come back once you thought

523
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:50,550
you had done enough.

524
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:57,200
I didn't try that hard.

525
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,230
I just did as much as I wanted to.

526
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:03,830
But I somehow ended up falling by mistake.

527
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:09,170
I was just having fun seeing my ball make the hoop more times.

528
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:19,630
I... just did that much.

529
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:25,940
It wasn't because I forced myself.

530
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,180
Really.

531
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:35,680
All right.

532
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,500
You've been through a lot.

533
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,000
You did great.

534
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,090
My son has grown so much.

535
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,200
I prescribed an anti-inflammatory medicine.

536
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,220
Please request a cast so they don't strain their ligament.

537
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,050
Yes, please take good care of it.

538
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,980
Isn't today your day off?

539
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,760
Yes. Something happened, so Dr. Lee asked me to cover.

540
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,650
I heard there are no outpatients today.

541
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:54,020
Yes. Professor Kim also has a seminar offsite.

542
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,400
Gosh, it's so quiet.

543
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,560
I hope every day is like today.

544
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:01,110
Hey!

545
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:04,700
Spit, spit! I take that back! Spit!

546
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,990
If we get too many emergency calls, it's your fault.

547
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,600
   

548
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,300
   

549
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,420
- Joo Won! 
 - You came.

550
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,090
Ta da!

551
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,790
I told you to buy beer!

552
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:40,360
We should try something new for your birthday.

553
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,840
Let me take that.

554
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,040
San Ha isn't here yet?

555
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,340
Right.

556
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,880
Hae Joon isn't coming, either?

557
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,890
I told him to come if he had time.

558
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:55,080
Of course, he has time.

559
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,900
I guess Kang Hae Joon is not here yet.

560
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,950
Joo Won! Park Dal, I'm here.

561
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,650
Hello.

562
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,190
Hello.

563
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,950
It's our first time seeing you after our wedding.

564
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,080
What brings you here suddenly?

565
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,320
I heard Hae Joon is coming here today.

566
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,470
We were going to meet tomorrow, but I just came.

567
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,410
I was in a rush, so I couldn't even buy anything for your birthday.

568
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,740
Beer is perfect.

569
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,000
Please, sit.

570
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:24,540
Wow.

571
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,810
Pardon me!

572
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,340
There are more people than I expected.

573
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:38,770
Long time, no see.

574
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,160
Hi.

575
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,360
Where do I sit?

576
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,290
Unni, you're here because of Joo Won's birthday, too?

577
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:52,840
"Birthday"?

578
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:57,390
Oh, it's your birthday? Congrats.

579
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:00,220
So Hae Joon is not here yet?

580
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,030
When is he coming?

581
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:05,560
   

582
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:10,130
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail. 

583
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,520
Is there a gathering?

584
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,300
Why are there so many people?

585
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,200
And why are you here?

586
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:25,160
I always remember your birthday.

587
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,330
Take this.

588
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:33,000
- Thanks. 
 - Wow.

589
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,630
Oh, right. Hyungnim got an emergency call.

590
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:41,260
It'll probably be three or four hours before he can come.

591
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,340
Hello?

592
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,700
I'll head over right now.

593
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,260
The children probably have Joo Won's birthday taken care of, right?

594
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,270
Should I call them?

595
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:16,710
What if you disturb them? Don't.

596
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:21,020
Let me take another look.

597
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,110
At what?

598
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:28,250
Gosh, this guy...

599
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:35,580
Do you get something by just looking at it?

600
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,500
Rice cakes?

601
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:40,360
Money comes out!

602
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,820
Let me see. Let me see.

603
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,460
   

604
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,650
We saved so much!

605
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:56,750
What did I say? Everything has a use.

606
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:00,090
Wow! What can we do for them with this?

607
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:02,390
What should we do?

608
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,940
   

609
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:14,690
We have to take care of the starving one so the rest of them can be assured.

610
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:18,180
Listen to you. How can we take care of only one when we both saved this money?

611
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,730
San Ha is fine.

612
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:21,400
He has a job and a car.

613
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,450
He takes care of himself.

614
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:25,210
Buying himself something is different

615
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,340
from receiving something from his parents.

616
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:31,000
And money is not the issue. It's disheartening.

617
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:36,090
Whatever you want.

618
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:41,250
Anyway, it was worth holding back on drinking beer all this time.

619
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,370
No, we still drank quite a lot.

620
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,860
Another round!

621
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,400
When's Hae Joon coming?

622
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,850
He said he was coming, so he will come.

623
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:22,740
You!

624
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,890
Bro.

625
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:27,550
What are you doing here?

626
00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:29,370
You're busy,

627
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,480
so I should come to meet you. What else can I do?

628
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,500
- Have you been well? 
 - Of course.

629
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,680
I'm sorry I couldn't come to the wedding.

630
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,200
It's already been years.

631
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,280
D-Don't you see me?

632
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,170
I'm here, too.

633
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:45,380
Do Hui Joo?

634
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,460
Why are you here?

635
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:50,100
Haedong is a smaller place than you think.

636
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:52,300
Sit here.

637
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,120
Sure.

638
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,590
You!

639
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,020
I don't have fond memories of you.

640
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:01,160
It's all in the past.

641
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,710
Please sit here.

642
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:04,590
- Should I? 
 - Yes.

643
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,860
I'm late because I bought these.

644
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:14,540
It cost more than ₩150,000 to buy branded ones.

645
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,510
I told you to keep it less than ₩100,000–

646
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,790
This is your gift.

647
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:21,010
I bought it with my own money.

648
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:23,410
This is expensive!

649
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:25,480
You wear size 240, right?

650
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,820
You should have bought your own clothes with that money.

651
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,230
Why did you buy mine?

652
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:31,950
It's a gift. Just take it.

653
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:35,310
Is there anything else to eat?

654
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:37,650
Why are you looking for food here?

655
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:40,330
I'll see if there's anything else.

656
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,740
Sit down. I'll do it.

657
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,210
 Well, it has been a while. Let's have a drink. 

658
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,090
 Hey, you're leaving tomorrow. Will you be okay? 

659
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,980
 I'll be fine! 

660
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:01,930
 Cheers! 

661
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:10,530
Are you okay?

662
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:20,500
 One shot! Okay! 

663
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,820
I told them I was busy since it was your birthday.

664
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,330
I'm sorry.

665
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:28,310
Go sit with them.

666
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:30,190
I'll bring this out.

667
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:33,300
I'm fine.

668
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,750
I'm fine, too!

669
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,990
Please move.

670
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:42,890
It's a simple fracture, so it should heal relatively quickly.

671
00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:44,730
- I see. 
 - Please come this way, Ma'am.

672
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:46,220
Yes.

673
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:59,060
We finished the beer.

674
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,130
I'll go buy some.

675
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:06,240
Let's not do this here and go someplace else.

676
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,050
This is an operating store.

677
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:12,280
There's a craft beer place nearby. Do you want to go there?

678
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,750
Sure. Let's go. Get up!

679
00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:17,690
Yes? Do you want to go?

680
00:47:17,690 --> 00:47:18,980
Let's go. Get up.

681
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:22,570
Get up! Get up.

682
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:24,140
 Let's go. 

683
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,330
- Let's go. 
 - Get up!

684
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:29,660
- When is Kim San Ha coming? 
 - He will get here eventually.

685
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,130
- Bye. Bye. 
 - You don't know that.

686
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:35,430
We don't know if it'll take him eight hours or ten hours.

687
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:37,170
Really?

688
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:40,170
Isn't it tiring to work long hours in the emergency room?

689
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:41,890
Of course, it is.

690
00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:45,620
He's probably very tired since he was on call yesterday, too.

691
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:48,280
Let's go to round two!

692
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,500
 You're probably tired, so you don't have to come. 

693
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,580
 They all went home. 

694
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,120
   

695
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,900
What's this?

696
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:42,990
Wow, they're earrings.

697
00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:50,080
 Happy birthday. 

698
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,780
Who's it from?

699
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,680
Kim San Ha.

700
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:58,470
Couldn't he have written more?

701
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:06,890
He has a good eye.

702
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:07,970
So pretty.

703
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:10,300
- Is it all right? 
 - Yes.

704
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,970
You should wear this to dinner tonight.

705
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,940
So pretty!

706
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:30,400
 Thanks. 

707
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,630
 Sorry I couldn't come yesterday. 

708
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,580
Do you...

709
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,900
   

710
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,970
Try not to shake the box because of the cream.

711
00:50:57,970 --> 00:50:59,880
Okay.

712
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,690
- I hope they like the cake. 
 - Thank you. It's so pretty.

713
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:04,470
- Thank you. Farewell. 
 - Thank you.

714
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:10,380
 Do you want to get dinner tonight? 

715
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:13,180
Welcome.

716
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:16,760
 Next time. I have plans tonight. 

717
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,770
Hyungnim, did you sleep here last night?

718
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:24,240
Yes.

719
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:27,160
I heard you went to Joo Won's store yesterday, too.

720
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,150
Yes.

721
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:33,520
Joo Won was worried you'd be really tired.

722
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,600
Lucky you.

723
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:40,150
I thought I had a chance.

724
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:42,660
 What time do you think you'll be done? 

725
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:46,100
 - Should I pick you up?  
 - Hyungnim.

726
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:50,700
- What? 
 - Can you support me so I can end up with Joo Won?

727
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,430
I'll be really good to you!

728
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:56,960
Says the guy who disappeared after getting an emergency call.

729
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,820
That hyung isn't right for her.

730
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:04,340
He only has his looks. I'm the more charming one!

731
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:07,590
"That hyung"?

732
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:10,640
He's in my class. A dermatology intern.

733
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:13,860
I couldn't stand the sight of him all excited to have dinner with Joo Won tonight.

734
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,860
 No, I think I'll be late tonight. 

735
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:36,310
He has been walking around with Joo Won's coffee every morning for the past few months.

736
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:38,240
I had a bad feeling.

737
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,540
He must've finally asked her out.

738
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:44,550
Oh, I see.

739
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:48,330
So Joo Won accepted him?

740
00:52:49,610 --> 00:52:53,450
She rejected him all this time, I wonder what caught her interest now.

741
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:02,160
Hyungnim, please believe in Lee Joon Ho.

742
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:07,880
Drink.

743
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:17,650
   

744
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,230
 Look at me. 

745
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:43,400
 What's the same? 

746
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,260
 My hairstyle is different, firstly. 

747
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:51,860
 I'm not the Park Dal from the past. 

748
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:55,590
 Guys ask me for my number on the streets of Seoul! 

749
00:53:55,590 --> 00:53:57,370
 Is that right? 

750
00:53:57,370 --> 00:54:00,110
 I didn't know. I had no idea. 

751
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:01,720
 Now you know, right? 

752
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:04,410
 Definitely. 

753
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:08,610
 Then as a token of apology, buy me hangover soup. 

754
00:54:08,610 --> 00:54:12,950
 Feel-Better Hangover Soup at 12 p.m. 

755
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:18,270
Let's go inside.

756
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:29,350
This place is a gem!

757
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:31,640
Do you come here often?

758
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:34,060
From time to time.

759
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:45,380
I didn't make any mistakes last night, did I?

760
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:48,260
No. Not at all.

761
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,780
Right?

762
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,100
Of course.

763
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:54,510
What's wrong with getting flirted with in Seoul?

764
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:57,140
Telling the truth isn't a mistake.

765
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:14,120
 She said she'd never date her bakery customers. 

766
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,840
Hello, Doctor.

767
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:22,390
 Thinking back, the guy she dated last time also came to buy her cake. 

768
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:28,970
 Next time. I have plans tonight. 

769
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:51,780
   

770
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,470
Apply a dressing right now to the baby with the lacerated arm.

771
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:56,870
The patient with a comminuted fracture needs his stitches removed.

772
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:59,110
Educate him while applying his dressing before he goes to rehabilitation.

773
00:55:59,110 --> 00:56:01,190
The open fracture T.A. patient who came in this morning

774
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:03,860
got a sonogram done because she had trouble breathing.

775
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,340
But her symptoms worsened, so I called in C.S.* Repeat what I said. 
  (TN: Cardiovascular surgery) 

776
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:10,110
Arm-baby, dressing, right now. Comminuted fracture, stitches.

777
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:12,830
Open fracture, T.A., sonogram, C.S. before rehabilitation.

778
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:14,320
I'm off.

779
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:22,390
♫  Maybe we didn’t understand the meaning of love  ♫

780
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:26,100
♫  We just couldn’t say it  ♫

781
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:31,090
♫  Each day, like that  ♫

782
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:38,370
♫  Maybe we didn’t understand the meaning of goodbye either  ♫

783
00:56:38,370 --> 00:56:41,960
♫  We just believed  ♫

784
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:47,510
♫  we didn't want to let go of each other  ♫

785
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:50,930
What's this? Why are you here?

786
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,060
Why don't you answer calls?

787
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,030
I left my phone here, so I came to get it.

788
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,880
I'm hungry.

789
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,320
Pardon?

790
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,170
I said, I'm hungry.

791
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:15,870
Go eat at Dad's.

792
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:17,640
I told you I have plans tonight.

793
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,440
Did you forget?

794
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,730
Don't go.

795
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,470
Don't go, Yoon Joo Won.

796
00:57:36,330 --> 00:57:37,700
What...

797
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:40,580
What's wrong?

798
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:50,020


799
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:53,040
I like you.

800
00:57:56,750 --> 00:58:03,030
It took me ten years to tell you that I like you.

801
00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:07,010
So...

802
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:14,510
don't go.

803
00:58:16,650 --> 00:58:22,460
♫  Why am I like this?  ♫

804
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:30,600
♫  Why am I always so excited like it's the first time?  ♫

805
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:36,310
♫  And remorseful like it's the last time?  ♫

806
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:40,250
♫  Again, I circle around you like I'm praying  ♫

810
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:56,490
   

811
00:58:56,490 --> 00:58:58,700
 Kim San Ha is Yoon Joo Won's oppa. 

812
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,490
 We can't become anything else. 

813
00:59:00,490 --> 00:59:02,890
 I'll pretend you never said anything. 

814
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:04,870
 I won't take it seriously. 

815
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:07,460
 Then let's start over. 

816
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:12,830
 Let me start as a man 27-year-old Yoon Joo Won met for the first time. 

817
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:16,090
 Auntie told me she operates a hair salon in Busan. 

818
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:17,340
 I just watched her from afar. 

819
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,700
 You came because you miss Hae Joon. 

820
00:59:19,700 --> 00:59:24,080
 No, please just pretend you never saw me today. 

821
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,890
 How could you be so coldhearted? 

822
00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:29,190
 I killed a person. 

823
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:33,930
♫  My day orbits around you like a star  ♫

824
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:38,290
♫  One step is all I need  ♫
