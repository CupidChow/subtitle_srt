Yes.

00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,270
it may seem like they're angry.

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:17,370
I wondered why a detective in the violent crimes unit in Seoul

200

would move down to somewhere like this.

201
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,320
Then again, what family doesn't have problems?

202
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,880
Still, if you see them, don't act like you know.

203
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,930
If they moved to a place where they know nobody,

204

Aigoo.

208
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,630
You think you could keep it a secret in such a small neighborhood?

209

Everyone knows!

212
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:01,850
Whatever it is, you have to speak it aloud.

213
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:07,450
That way, you realize the difficulties you're going through

214
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:10,460
may not be such a big deal.

215
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:14,330
Still, what happened to their family isn't common.

216
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,820
Since you mention it, I heard that

00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,780
it happened while only the son was present.

I heard that something went wrong while only the son and daughter were home.

220
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:29,770

00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,700
That's what you told me, Mom!

362
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,850
You feel sorry for them, but they're unlucky, so not to be friends with them.

363
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:13,680
Let's talk for a bit separately.

364
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,560
You should apologize before you go.

365
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,120
Pardon?

366
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,030
You should apologize to the child for speaking rashly.

367
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:31,700
Oh, okay. Aigoo, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

368
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,950
You should apologize, too.

369
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,920
Hurry.

370
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,250
I'm sorry.

371
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:42,010
Are we good now?

372
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:44,570
If you see me next time, be sure to say hello.

373
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,540
I'll buy you something tasty.

374
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,640
I'm sorry. Let's go.

375
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,380
Where are you going?

376
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,890
Pardon?

377
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,590
I'm going home.

378
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:14,560
Eat dinner at my house before you go.

379
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,070
I made galbi.

380
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,610
Galbi?

381
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,070
Galbi!

382
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:23,420
Oppa, let's hurry up and go! Our galbi is really tasty!

383
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,160
Let's head inside.

384
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:28,350
- Okay.
- It's really, really good!

385
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:34,300
- Galbi!
- Wow...

386
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,660
Please eat. Eat up!

387
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,470
♫ However, time is still ♫

388
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,160
♫ I've thought ♫

389
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,890
Here.

390
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,130
♫ Everything is perfect prayer ♫

391
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:57,270
♫ Fire 'cause I cry ♫

392
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,940
You too, Sanha.

393
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:06,260
♫ The things that follow ♫

394
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,850
Is it good?

395
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,320
Here.

396
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:23,620
♫ Looking far ahead, I would feel her like that ♫

397
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,120
Eat this.

398
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:39,380
♫ How much I miss this, do you understand? ♫

399
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:52,280
- It's okay.
- It's heavier than I'd thought.

400
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,440
- I'll carry it for you to the bus stop.
- Okay.

401
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,060
Juwon, can you play with Sanha for a moment?

402
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,890
Sanha, could you stay with Juwon for a moment?

403
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,260
- Okay.
- All right.

404
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,990
- Let's go.
- Okay.

405
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,680
You don't like it?

406
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,830
It'd be nice if a pretty ahjumma became your mommy.

407
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:42,640
I have a mommy. And my mommy is prettier.

408
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,990
Sorry.

409
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,150
But why are you digging the ground?

410
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,640
I'll give you a present.

411
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,210
A present?

412
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,520
It's cute, right?

413
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,260
Don't come near me!

414
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,780
Oppa!

415
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,660
Get away!

416
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,080
Do you want me to show you?

417
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,660
I've seen enough.

418
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,400
Not this. My mommy.

419
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,690
What?

420
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,510
What do you think?

421
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:06,340
She looks like you.

422
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:09,610
I can only look at it sometimes when Daddy's not looking.

423
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:14,670
My dad gets sad when I open this and look at it.

424
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:16,000
Why?

425
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,400
Because he can't see her again, even though he misses her.

426
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,850
He told me not to mention your younger sister to you, too.

427
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:30,120
I guess Ahjussi knows everything.

428
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:34,520
Yeah. Because my daddy is a widower, he knows everything.

429
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,650
- Really?
- Yeah.

430
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:41,680
If you ever miss your younger sister, you can secretly look at her photos.

431
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,610
Do you have a photo of her?

432
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,270
Yeah.

433
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,650
I do.

434
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,160
I see.

435
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:54,500
This is me.

436
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,410
I'm cute, right?

437
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,760
Yeah?

438
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,560
This is you?

439
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,660
Goodbye, Haejun.

440
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,240
It hurts, huh?

441
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:23,980
I'm fine.

442
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,240
When we go home, will you make this for me, Mom?

443
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,400
Was it good?

444
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,790
It was the first time eating something tastier than bulgogi burger.

445
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,880
That means it was really good.

446
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,460
Yeah!

447
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,720
Just a moment.

448
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,380
Hello?

449
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,380
Yes, I am Kang Seohyeon.

450
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,050
If you ever miss your younger sister, you can secretly look at her photos.

451
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,300
Should I sing you a lullaby?

452
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,650
I was sleeping...

453
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,640
♫ Sleep tight, my child ♫

454
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,740
♫ My Juwon ♫

455
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:11,100
♫ One, two, sleep tight ♫

456
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,150
Daddy...

457
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,620
You're not getting married, right?

458
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,770
Of course not.

459
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:29,240
I wouldn't do anything my daughter doesn't like.

460
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,440
[Mr. Yoon's Kalguksu / Preparing ingredients]

461
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:42,040
So, she changed her phone number?

462
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:50,480
Yeah. The old lady kept insisting that the guy must have upset her.

463
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:54,890
I said Mr. Yoon isn't like that, and that couldn't be the case,

464
00:37:54,890 --> 00:37:56,560
but she only said whatever she wanted to say.

465
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,530
So, I left that joint fund meeting.

466
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,900
You liked that joint fund meeting because they went to popular restaurants.

467
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:09,140
Don't worry about it. I guess we weren't meant to be.

468
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,380
Who changes their number and cuts off all contact

469
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:19,300
just because a blind date went wrong?

470
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:24,520
There must be some other major issue she's dealing with.

471
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,130
Why could I take care of the child by myself?

472
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,010
Just take care of him for a short while.

473
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:34,660
I'll come get him as soon as I'm settled in Seoul.

474
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:40,780
I'll bring your favorite hamburgers when I come back, Haejun.

475
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,370
I don't need them!

476
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:45,750
Don't buy anything. Just come back quickly!

477
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,180
- Hello!
- Hi, officers.

478
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,870
I guess you've become partners now?

479
00:39:46,870 --> 00:39:48,770
- Yes.
- Welcome.

480
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:52,050
Please sit down. I'll get you some cold barley tea.

481
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,620
- Two, please.
- Okay, two.

482
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,210
Don't fight all the time and be good to her.

483
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,560
Madam.

484
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,130
What?

485
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:16,410
This neighborhood is probably more boring than Seoul.

486
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:21,610
Buy her tasty food, be sensitive, and pay attention to her.

487
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:25,810
No matter how big the issue is, continue to cover it by doing small things.

488
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,960
Yes, I'm trying to do that.

489
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:36,540
Juwon is here!

490
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,790
Daddy, there's a police car outside.

491
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,360
Yeah.

492
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:43,410
It's the third-floor ahjussi.

493
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:47,310
Ahjussi, Ahjussi!

494
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,350
Wow...

495
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,780
Daddy, Ahjussi is a police officer!

496
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,000
You should say hello.

497
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,090
Hello, Ahjussi.

498
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:57,770
Is it okay if Oppa eats at our house today?

499
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:00,240
He ate at our house last time, too.

500
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,770
Sanha did?

501
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:04,360
We invited him since we were eating anyway.

502
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:08,130
I'm sure he's not being fed properly at home.

503
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,470
If it's not too much trouble, please.

504
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,820
Of course. It's not a problem at all.

505
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,830
Ahjussi says Sanha can eat at our house again.

506
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,370
- Really?
- Yeah.

507
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:23,390
Whoa, I'm so excited!

508
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,400
All right.

509
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,810
You're back, Sanha.

510
00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:35,170
- Hello.
- Hi.

511
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,170
Oppa!

512
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,800
- Eat noodles before you go.
- Let's go.

513
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,050
All right, let's go inside.

514
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,250
Hello?

515
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,590
Yes.

516
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,530
Seohyeon?

517
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:17,380
Yes. Have you been well?

518
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,220
Oh, yes, yes. How are you?

519
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:27,700
Who changes their number and cuts off all contact?

520
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:32,840
There must be some other major issue she's dealing with.

521
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:36,270
Everything is okay, right?

522
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:40,460
By chance, well...

523
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:43,010
Yes, go on.

524
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,790
I don't usually say something like this,

525
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:52,310
and I can give it back to you once I sell my hair salon...

526
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:56,560
I just need it temporarily...

527
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,520
Well...

528
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,040
How much do you need?

529
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,340
Yes, just a moment.

530
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,860
1020...

531
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,760
Haejun is fine, right?

532
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,470
Ahjussi!

533
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,010
Why are you outside when it's cold out?

534
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:53,990
Mom called me and said you were coming, Ahjussi.

535
00:43:57,590 --> 00:43:59,290
What about your aunt?

536
00:44:08,390 --> 00:44:12,160
Ahjussi, should I make you some ramen?

537
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,620
All you need to do is add water.

538
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,480
It's the tastiest thing in the world.

539
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,610
Haejun, eat these dumplings

540
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,180
while they're still hot.

541
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:27,200
Here.

542
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,000
Thank you.

543
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:41,280
Aunt!

544
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:43,250
Hello.

545
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,750
Yes, hello.

546
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:47,600
I received a text from Unni that you were coming.

547
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,760
My place is a bit of a mess.

548
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,030
It's all right.

549
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:54,880
I'm sorry for coming in when you weren't home.

550
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,100
As you know, Unni went to Seoul,

551
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,870
and I have no time to babysit since I'm studying for an exam.

552
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:05,210
But still, Haejun eats well by himself and is doing okay.

553
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:08,730
That's right. I'm doing fine by myself.

554
00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:13,510
Mom said she would come back quickly when she makes some money.

555
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,520
Yeah?

556
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:29,240
Then...

557
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:36,690
Then, would you like to stay at my house for a bit?

558
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,660
Until your mom comes back.

559
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,150
That's okay, right?

560
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,460
My mom...

561
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,210
She's not angry.

562
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:39,840
She's not?

563
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:43,610
Yeah. She's just...

564
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:46,550
very sad.

565
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:51,050
When people are really sad, it may seem like they're angry.

566
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:52,440
Okay.

567
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:55,190
Yeah.

568
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:07,540
Buy her tasty food, be sensitive, and pay attention to her.

569
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,190
Honey, what's wrong?

570
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:24,970
What happened?

571
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,170
Look at this.

572
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:35,250
Sanha had this?

573
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,440
You know, Honey,

574
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,980
I...

575
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:43,920
can't stop thinking about one thing.

576
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:49,530
You know how Sanha was there, too.

577
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:57,480
He was alone with Choseok.

578
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,540
What was he doing then?

579
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:06,370
Didn't you ever think about that?

580
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:08,310
How can you say that?

581
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:10,720
You never have? Really?

582
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:12,870
You've never thought that before?

583
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:15,230
- Come to your senses!
- Me?

584
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:18,810
The problem is that I'm too sane!

585
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:21,480
The problem is I'm so sane that

586
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:23,800
this thought doesn't leave me!

587
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,610
- Okay, Honey-
- I wish I was crazy...

588
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:28,190
I wish I was crazy

589
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:31,130
and didn't think about any of this!

590
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:32,770
Sanha was just eight years old!

591
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:35,740
How could an eight-year-old watch a kid?

592
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,550
How could it be Sanha's fault?

593
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:39,430
Then, whose fault is it?

594
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,570
It's not anyone's fault.

595
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:46,330
Do you know what's driving me mad?

596
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:50,350
Ever since we moved here,

597
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:53,340
Sanha is always smiling.

598
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:58,270
I can't even bring myself to swallow any food,

599
00:48:58,270 --> 00:49:01,880
but Sanha is stuffing himself with hot food

600
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,540

601
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:10,210

Please let me go, Honey.

604
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,610
Please let me go, Honey.

Mom, Mom, I'm sorry.

608
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:32,110
I'll never go to the downstairs neighbor's

609
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,740
or smile, and I won't eat, either.

610
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,230
I'm sorry, Mom.

611
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:40,780
Please forgive me...

612
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,210
I'll talk to her. Go to your room.

613

I'll never do that again, please...

614

Everyone, have you thought about the

727
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:37,060
adoption contract I mentioned last time?

728
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:40,430
Hey, you still haven't given up on that?

729
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,820
Do you even know what an adoption contract is?

730
01:00:46,820 --> 01:00:48,850
Of course. If you sign an adoption contract,

731
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:52,230
you're legally a biological parent and child, even if you aren't blood-related.

732
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:55,160
What do you think? Great, right? Nothing's bad about it.

733
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,060
Who will become whose adopted son?

734
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,620
[46 years old, 47 years old]

735
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,620
Since Ahjussi is older,

736
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:05,200
how about you become Ahjussi's adopted son, Dad?

737
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:08,530
Adopted son, she says.

738
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:11,660
I've heard of quantum physics.

739
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:13,760
Then, Ahjussi will be my hyung,

740
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,910
and I'll become your uncle.

741
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:19,780
Hey, call me uncle.

742
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:26,190
What? What's wrong with calling him uncle...

743
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:35,740
The soup is pretty good today. Eat up.

744
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,900
In any case!

745
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:42,610
We need to unify our last names!

746
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,710
That's the only way I can survive!
