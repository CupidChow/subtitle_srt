1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,290


2
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,930
   

3
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,100
   

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,610
   

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:29,850
   

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,750
   

7
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,010
   

8
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,470
What's going on?

9
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,300
Well, you see...

10
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,100
It's as you see.

11
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,850
We are dating.

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,270
What?

13
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,320
So...

14
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,230
what happened was...

15
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,310
Never! You're tricking me, right?

16
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,960
Don't joke around like that.

17
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,730
We aren't joking.

18
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,360
Have you gone crazy? Get away from her!

19
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,620
It's Yoon Joo Won.

20
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,710
She's our sister.

21
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,630
I said she's our sister!

22
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,480
Kim San Ha lost his sanity for a moment.

23
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,510
He will be fine tomorrow morning.

24
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:20,160
I'll scold him tomorrow, so just forget this whole thing.

25
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,680
Sorry...

26
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,430
for not telling you sooner.

27
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,890
We weren't trying to deceive you.

28
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,920
Our dads don't know yet

29
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,690
and...

30
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,530
it hasn't been long since we started dating.

31
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,630
"We"?

32
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,720
Kang Hae Joon.

33
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:55,140
You said you and I couldn't.

34
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,670
Because I'm your oppa.

35
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,760
You are!

36
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,450
Then Kim San Ha is your oppa, too.

37
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,990
He's your oppa, just like I am.

38
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:09,620
We have different surnames and are not blood-related, but we are still your brothers!

39
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,220
Hae Joon, Joo Won and I really like each other.

40
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,730
What about me?

41
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,640
Why am I always getting abandoned?

42
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,420
Who's abandoning–

43
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,060
I'll go.

44
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,600
- Nice catch. 
 - Yes.

45
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,980
Where is Sunbae Hae Joon?

46
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,100
He went to get beer from our house.

47
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,270
Kim San Ha and Kang Hae Joon won't be coming any time soon.

48
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,910
Why not?

49
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,020
Later.

50
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,420
We can't drink anymore anyway.

51
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,920
Get up! Let's go home.

52
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,140
Yes, let's go.

53
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,730
Do you really like Hae Joon?

54
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,510
- Pardon? 
 - Gosh.

55
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,210
Hui Joo also still pines for Hae Joon.

56
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,390
Why is everyone head over heels for Hae Joon?

57
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,300
Sunbae is drunk.

58
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,860
- Hurry and take him home. 
 - Yes.

59
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,110
I'm not.

60
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:31,220
I'm a hundred times more handsome.

61
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,290
That's right. My baby is a thousand times more handsome.

62
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,340
We are leaving.

63
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,450
Okay, take care.

64
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,020
Why? What happened?

65
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,730
Go away.

66
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,730
I have nothing to say to you.

67
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,110
You told me to open up just yesterday.

68
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,450
Can't you think of how worried Joo Won will be if you leave like this?

69
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,590
Did you follow me to ease your girlfriend's mind?

70
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,250
Get lost.

71
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,000
Joo Won and I said we were dating.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,370
Why do you say you're being abandoned?

73
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,600
You're Ahjusshi's son, and Joo Won is Dad's daughter.

74
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,580
If you two get married, you all become family.

75
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,690
As the outsider, I'm nothing now.

76
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,700
How smart.

77
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,400
You thought that far in such a short time.

78
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,890
Get lost.

79
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,600
You annoy me.

80
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,150
So do you think we'd discard you, saying we no longer need you?

81
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,670
Yes. That's right.

82
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,070
My dad abandoned me before I was even born.

83
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,040
 My mom abandoned me. 

84
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,160
 My dad took me, then abandoned me again. 

85
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,630
That's just how my life is, isn't it?

86
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:24,120
Go, then.

87
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,360
If you think that's the sort of people we are, then go.

88
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,950
I have no intention of begging you to trust us.

89
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,480
   

90
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,500
I can understand how Hae Joon feels.

91
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,020
I knew he was sad because of Ahjumma, but I didn't know it was this bad.

92
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,090
That's because he didn't want you to know.

93
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,980
What?

94
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,590
It's nothing.

95
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,860
San Ha will comfort him and bring him back, right?

96
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,050
What happened? Where's Kang Hae Joon?

97
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,420
Why are you alone?

98
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,370
It's not like he's a teenager. He will return eventually.

99
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,560
You should've consoled him and brought him back.

100
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,120
Where did he go?

101
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,150
There's nowhere to go alone at this hour.

102
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,320
Did he go to Dad?

103
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,800
He wouldn't have, afraid he'd worry him.

104
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,810
Don't worry.

105
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,470
He probably wants to be alone right now.

106
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:42,670
He will be okay, right?

107
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,060
Of course.

108
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,520
I'll go.

109
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,970
By the way, since when did you find out we were dating?

110
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,800
There's probably nothing Dal doesn't know.

111
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,200
Bye.

112
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:34,160
♫  Even if you don't say where it hurts  ♫

113
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,400
♫  I know  ♫

114
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:43,160
♫  Like a wildflower growing on its own  ♫

115
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:51,300
♫  The love I've kept hidden hurts  ♫

116
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:02,410
♫  My wish, as it's smaller than my height  ♫

117
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:09,350
♫  I can't be the tree that you can take shelter under  ♫

118
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,800
♫  But like the warm sun  ♫

119
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,070
♫  Like the beautiful moon  ♫

120
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:30,240
♫  I will always, as I have always done, be with you  ♫

121
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,840
   

122
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,140
 Kang Hae Joon went to exercise. 

123
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,210
 Don't worry. 

124
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,880
Hey, are you okay?

125
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,440
Oh, I'm fine... Ouch!

126
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,850
Hey, nonsense! Let me take a look.

127
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:21,350
Here?

128
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,840
What happened?

129
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,940
Did you tell her to follow me?

130
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,520
How could you tell someone who can't even run to follow me?

131
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,700
When did I ever...

132
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,930
 Is Sunbae okay? 

133
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,740
 I don't know. He went to exercise. 

134
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,310
 I'll follow him and discuss things. 

135
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,090
 Yes. 

136
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:57,360
 How am I supposed to run my store if you suddenly do this today? 

137
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,780
 What about the tomatoes? 

138
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,620
 Never mind, I'll go right now and check the fruit. 

139
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,490
 - What is it? 
 - The grapes might not be in good condition. 

140
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,170
 I was going to see Kang Hae Joon before I went. 

141
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:14,780
Right. Why did I do that?

142
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,960
Dal is fragile as is.

143
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,390
Keep the ankle brace on for two to three weeks.

144
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:20,930
Try not to move it if you can.

145
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,920
You'll get better soon with physical therapy.

146
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,660
- Yes. 
 - Are you okay?

147
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,020
Does it hurt a lot?

148
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,180
What about your office? Don't you need to go to work?

149
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,250
I'll go home, change, and head out.

150
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,770
How will you go to work in this state?

151
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,650
It'll become chronic if you don't treat a stretched ligament properly.

152
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,200
Yoon Joo Won, come here for a second.

153
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,040
Your boyfriend is calling.

154
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,740
You can go. I'll take her home.

155
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,500
No, it's okay–

156
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,740
Let's go.

157
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,690
You should console Kang Hae Joon and appease him. Why make it worse?

158
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,530
He called me from the U.S. less than a year after his surgery.

159
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,500
 - Hey. 
 - How are you doing? 

160
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,400
 The same as usual. 

161
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,340
 I have a younger sister. 

162
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:24,580
 She's really pretty. 

163
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,800
 But now that I have a sister, 

164
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,640
 I've become more of a fake family member again. 

165
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:37,990
 Where should I go now? 

166
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,150
 I have nowhere to go. 

167
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,740
 Why do people... 

168
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,060
 keep throwing me away? 

169
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,440
 And so I told him. 

170
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,640
"What do you mean you don't have a place to go?"

171
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,480
"When you have people waiting for you here?"

172
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,890
"Dad, Joo Won, and I are all here."

173
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,150
"So how are you alone?"

174
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,590
He's such a fool.

175
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,500
Why did he put himself through that all the way there?

176
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,440
He should have returned sooner. He should've come back right away.

177
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,580
We waited for him for so long.

178
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,490
Exactly.

179
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,050
I don't think he comprehends it, even after everything I said.

180
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:17,310
That's why I also got angry.

181
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:35,020
By the way...

182
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:38,060
I followed you today because I was worried–

183
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,490
It's okay.

184
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,470
I know Joo Won asked you to because she was worried about me.

185
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:46,630
I see.

186
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,660
Did you hear what happened?

187
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,220
Yes.

188
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,390
But the two of them were worried sick about you all night.

189
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:04,600
They both cherish you dearly

190
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,470
and didn't want to upset you in the slightest.

191
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,120
I know.

192
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,500
I also know I'm being unreasonable.

193
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,520
But they don't know.

194
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,600
They don't know anything.

195
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,200
Even if you're being unreasonable,

196
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,960
I'll be on your side unconditionally.

197
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:35,380
Please don't be too upset.

198
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,120
You know, you always say the sweetest things.

199
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,120
Crab stew? Did Hae Joon say he wanted to eat some?

200
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,500
Then come home and eat.

201
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,940
 No, I'm going to make it. Hurry and tell me. 

202
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,220
Add green onions and chili pepper. 
    

203
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,290
I understand. I'll make it as good as yours, Dad.

204
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,660
 Dinner is at our place. Please make sure to come. 

205
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,270
Here we go.

206
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,430
Ta-da.

207
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:30,470
I chose the biggest crab at the market to feed you and made it nice and spicy...

208
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,990
- It's good. 
 - Right? It's delicious, right?

209
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,100
I put lots of love and effort into it.

210
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,010
Lighten up, please?

211
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,270
Think about it.

212
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:48,150
If Kim San Ha messes up from now on, you can scold him.

213
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:53,350
Also, Kang Hae Joon is Yoon Joo Won's oppa, so you're his hyungnim.

214
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,410
If Kim San Ha and I fight, whose side would you be on?

215
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,770
Gosh, you two shouldn't fight.

216
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,470
Of course, I'll be on your side. I'm on your side, no matter what!

217
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,810
You eat, too.

218
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,340
Should we go get some ice cream after? Some freezies?

219
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,040
If you want.

220
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,180
I'm here.

221
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,860
I'm almost done cheering him up.

222
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,160
I'm done eating.

223
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,050
Let's go get ice cream.

224
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,020
- Already? 
 - Let's go.

225
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,070
- Okay. 
 - You can stay and eat.

226
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:59,840
Gosh, Kang Hae Joon, you tough guy.

227
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,830
He could eat this?

228
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,230
Why haven't you told the dads?

229
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:09,710
What if you get caught?

230
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:13,220
We were going to, but the timing was a little...

231
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,130
The timing for what?

232
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:18,030
Why?

233
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,750
Are you hiding something else from me?

234
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,850
No, there's none.

235
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,020
I'm still against it.

236
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,960
I'm sure the dads will feel the same.

237
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:34,820
People break up even after marriage, get divorced, and so on.

238
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,200
What if you break up while dating?

239
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,100
Will you cut ties?

240
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,060
I won't do that.

241
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,910
Can you do that as you please?

242
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,890
I can't do that as I please...

243
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,100
but what can I do when I like him?

244
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,560
Gosh, what do you like about that rude brat?

245
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,820
You know you like him, too.

246
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,840
- I don't. 
 - You do.

247
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,370
Why would I like that punk?

248
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,710
You know you like him.

249
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:03,690
- I don't. 
 - You do.

250
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:08,010
- I don't. 
 - You do. You know you do. Right?

251
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,760
   

252
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,280
Answer it.

253
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,320
Oh, okay.

254
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,310
Yes, I'm on patrol.

255
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,260
Oh, really?

256
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,360
Okay, understood. All right.

257
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,690
She told me to buy a cake on the way home.

258
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,090
I couldn't do anything for her last week since I was on the night shift.

259
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:40,560
I'll have to do my best to survive this week.

260
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,380
You know what happens if you don't treat her well at times like that, right?

261
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,100
Yes.

262
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,230
I was ignorant about such things.

263
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,080
 I do pass by the hospital quite often, 

264
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,150
 so we can eat in the city, too. Right? 

265
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:01,720
 You can call me anytime. 

266
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,110
 Or you can just come by, too. 

267
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,560
Drop me off at the hospital.

268
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,740
I'll eat lunch and get home on my own.

269
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,170
So suddenly? Where are you going?

270
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:15,210
I'll have lunch with San Ha before going home.

271
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,560
I guess I'll buy a cake from Joo Won's store, then.

272
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,520
Joo Won's cake gets me double the points, you see.

273
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,300
 Joo Won's doing an important job, isn't she? 

274
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,130
Just give up on Kang Hae Joon. Do you still not get it?

275
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:30,710
He won't ever go back on his no.

276
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,150
You said he doesn't even answer your texts.

277
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,630
That's why I'm seeking your cooperation.

278
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,400
I can't cooperate anymore,

279
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,420
and I don't even talk to Hae Joon these days.

280
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,360
Why? Did you two fight?

281
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,240
Gosh, we didn't.

282
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,930
- Dad. 
 - Yes, I was just passing by.

283
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,580
Did you eat lunch?

284
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,880
I figured you wouldn't know. There's a great Jjajangmyeon* place nearby, 
  (TN: Black bean noodles) 

285
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,110
so I dropped by.

286
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,290
I was trying to decide what to eat. Let's go together.

287
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:02,030
Shall we?

288
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,260
Hello.

289
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:09,280
She's my high school friend. We work at the same hospital.

290
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,410
Oh, really? I see.

291
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:13,280
Please enjoy your lunch.

292
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,430
Why don't you join us?

293
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:18,520
Gosh, she'll be uncomfortable. See you later.

294
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,990
Oh, okay, then.

295
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,320
What about Hae Joon?

296
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,370
- Excuse me, Father. 
 - Yes?

297
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,530
If you don't mind, could I join you for lunch?

298
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,110
Aigoo, what's there to mind? You can come along.

299
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,180
All right. Let's go. I'd love to.

300
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,340
I'll buy you Tangsuyuk*, too. 
  (TN: Sweet and sour pork) 

301
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,080
Thank you, Father!

302
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,680
Aigoo, okay. Let's go now.

303
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,100
Hey, hurry.

304
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,420
- Hurry along! 
 - Seriously.

305
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,240
I heard it's really famous.

306
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,220
People line up for it in America, and they're a big success in Seoul, too.

307
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,270
They opened a second Busan branch this time and–

308
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,660
Does it make sense to ask a cafe owner to go to a rival cafe?

309
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,180
It's for market research–

310
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:56,440
So why would I go there with you?

311
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,780
You and I can just–

312
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,350
Oh, you're here.

313
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,950
Yes. Do you have a mango cake?

314
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:05,630
Of course. Do you want a slice or a whole cake?

315
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,150
Hey, I'm busy. Get going now.

316
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,490
Let's go. It'll be a nice drive, too.

317
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:12,680
I'm busy. Get going.

318
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,680
I'll be back in the evening, okay?

319
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,130
Hae Joon said he couldn't come.

320
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,300
- Really? 
 - Yes.

321
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,470
Why? Where did he say he is?

322
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,720
I don't know.

323
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,510
Did you tell him you're with your dad?

324
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,410
I'll have Jjajangmyeon.

325
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,490
It'd be nice to eat together on days like this, right?

326
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,610
She's right about that.

327
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,250
By the way...

328
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,820
how should I address you?

329
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,320
You can just call me Hui Joo.

330
00:21:57,410 --> 00:21:59,830
You can call her Dr. Do.

331
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:04,490
I-Is it okay for me to skip the honorifics?

332
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,680
Of course, Father.

333
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,310
There you go.

334
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:24,510
It seems she saw San Ha's mom in Seoul.

335
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:29,180
San Ha was acting prickly, but she wasn't even that fazed.

336
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,940
I saw her at the hospital once, too.

337
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,450
They looked good together.

338
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:34,950
Right?

339
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:39,870
I was worried he might take after me and only care about looks,

340
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:43,780
but she's pretty, and she's very well-mannered, too.

341
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,800
Going after looks is nothing to brag about.

342
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:53,720
Anyway, what's more important

343
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,130
is that Joo Won seems to have someone, too.

344
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:59,000
"Someone"? Whom?

345
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,770
Inspector Kim went to Joo Won's store

346
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,560
and judging by the atmosphere,

347
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,210
it seemed like they go on dates and such.

348
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,740
Really?

349
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,390
What was he like? Did he look okay?

350
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,710
He's handsome and apparently pays attention to Joo Won's every word.

351
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,660
Madam warned me that the three would never find anyone at this rate.

352
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,340
I was worried because of her negative comments, but I worried in vain.

353
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,600
Don't even listen to that old granny.

354
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,910
Of course. Everyone has their own match.

355
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:41,250
None of our children are lacking in any way.

356
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,130
 He's not lacking in any way, so why? 

357
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,690
Then are you saying Dal is lacking?

358
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,820
I'm not.

359
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,370
If my honey says it's Dal, then it's dal ("moon" in Korean).

360
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,820
If you say it's the sun, then it's the sun.

361
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:00,650
My baby's sense of humor is superb.

362
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:02,820
Gosh, you're so cute.

363
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,080
Why don't you go since you've picked up your cake?

364
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,990
By the way, why can't I reach Hae Joon?

365
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,730
He must be busy, I guess.

366
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:18,670
For some time now, I've been unsure what he does during the day,

367
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:21,450
and at times, I can't contact him.

368
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,420
It's suspicious.

369
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,970
Why?

370
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:31,540
It seems Kang Hae Joon has other things going on besides us.

371
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,620
He must have something to do.

372
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,910
Exactly. What would that be?

373
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:38,350
Is he looking for a new store? That can't be.

374
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,840
Dad isn't planning to move stores.

375
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,950
What if he has fallen for a pyramid scheme?

376
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:46,060
Is it me or Kang Hae Joon?

377
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,280
- What? 
 - I mean...

378
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,410
while we walked around the neighborhood three times,

379
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:53,800
you spoke only about Hae Joon for the past 48 minutes.

380
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,540
I'm worried about him.

381
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,340
Kang Hae Joon isn't a little child.

382
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,940
He's someone who earned that much money at 29.

383
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,130
You don't need to worry about him.

384
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,000
I guess...

385
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,190
So can you look at your boyfriend who's next to you now?

386
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,630
Oppa! (Using Busan dialect)

387
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,190
Are you being jealous?

388
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,930
Are you being jealous?

389
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:21,790
Babe.

390
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,020
It's not working.

391
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,650
You're so lucky, Oppa.

392
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:29,760
Your girlfriend acts cute like this to appease your jealousy.

393
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,330
I wasn't jealous, though.

394
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,320
You're quite blessed, Oppa.

395
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,830
Am I?

396
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,040
Am I right or wrong? Well?

397
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,010
Am I right or wrong?

398
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,970
You're right.

399
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,130
You two, follow me inside.

400
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,400
Go.

401
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,650
They're rules.

402
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,510
As Yoon Joo Won's oppa, 
     

403
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:14,300
these are rules for you to obey while you're dating her.

404
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:17,570
Darn, are you joking with me?

405
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:20,220
I would've done the same even if it were some other guy!

406
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:24,140
That's right. This much is acceptable as an oppa.

407
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:34,030
What's this? 
     

408
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,990
"Returns home by 12 a.m., no matter what"?

409
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,930
Hey, that's too much!

410
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:42,010
What are you planning to do out past 12 a.m.?

411
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,400
Well, it's just...

412
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,980
time flies when you're having fun...

413
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,690
You can't.

414
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,780
You can't.

415
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,200
Understand?

416
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,920
Yes, Hae Joon Oppa.

417
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,990
   

418
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,520
"Hyungnim"?

419
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,240
Hyungnim?

420
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:05,780
I'm clearly the elder here.

421
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,730
You must call me "Hyungnim."

422
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,250
Hyungnim, my foot.

423
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,200
Did you... Did you just rip that?

424
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,370
Geez! This is unacceptable!

425
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:25,800
Joo Won, he's no good.

426
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,150
I'm totally against him!

427
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,100
Hyungnim.

428
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,800
Hey, Hyungnim. (Busan dialect)

429
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,380
Please take it easy on me.

430
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,250
Come on.

431
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,660
I'll be good.

432
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,360
I'll be good.

433
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,970
I'll be good, too.

434
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:11,160
Gosh, get off me!

435
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,890
Why, Hyungnim?

436
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,350
I'll be good.

437
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,600
All right. All right.

438
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,680
- Just be home by 12 a.m. 
 - "12 a.m."?

439
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:22,560
I won't ask for much, Hyungnim. Let's agree to 1 a.m.

440
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,000
Fine. 12:30 a.m.

441
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,940
 Give it some good thought. 

442
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,200
 Who else in Haedong has played basketball in America other than you? 

443
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,860
What kind of teacher could I be when I can't even beat a middle school student?

444
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,130
 Just meet them first. 

445
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,440
Forget about it. I'm hanging up. I'm busy.

446
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,030
 What on earth are you doing these days– 

447
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,260
Hello!

448
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,060
Would you like the same thing today, too?

449
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,540
Yes.

450
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:02,890
You must live around here.

451
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,460
Yes.

452
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:22,680
It's good to see you doing well.

453
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,060
It's all thanks to you, Attorney.

454
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:31,860
If it weren't for you, I might still be in prison.

455
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,430
No.

456
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:36,230
You were my first case as a lawyer.

457
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:42,330
I'm just thankful to see my client doing this well.

458
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,250
Have you met your son?

459
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,370
No.

460
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:55,210
I just saw his face in secret.

461
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,560
Even if it was just an accident,

462
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:05,910
I don't want him to know that someone died because of me.

463
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:12,080
Furthermore, I don't want him to know how I've been living after I left him.

464
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:18,330
Seo Hyeon, you led a diligent life.

465
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:27,120
After the ruling, I was undoubtedly innocent by law,

466
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,410
but I remained guilty in people's eyes.

467
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,160
I must have seemed like an easy woman.

468
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:47,830
A woman who left her child behind to make money. How easy must I have looked?

469
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:53,900
A wealthy man who tried to make a move on an easy woman

470
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,020
had died.

471
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,390
People felt bad for the dead man.

472
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:03,920
They said I'm an unlucky woman.

473
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,730
It was an accident.

474
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:12,810
Things like that usually happen to people who are born unlucky.

475
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:34,200
- I'll stop by again. 
 - Yes.

476
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,790
Please don't hesitate to call me if anything happens.

477
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,210
Yes.

478
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,320
I pray you meet your son.

479
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,150
Yes.

480
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,530
Hae Joon.

481
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,670
Hae Joon.

482
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:48,990
How... How did you find this place?

483
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,250
Why?

484
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,300
Am I not allowed to come here?

485
00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:01,610
You abandoned me, lived happily,

486
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:02,980
and even met a man.

487
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:06,000
Should I not have shown up in your great life?

488
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:09,170
You...

489
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,310
So you knew I was here?

490
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,460
Yes.

491
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,810
It would've been better if I didn't.

492
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,080
I would've just pretended you didn't exist.

493
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,290
What can I do since I know?

494
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,510
If I come and see you smile,

495
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,970
anger erupts inside me!

496
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,710
But I know...

497
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,760
I'll find you if I come here.

498
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,540
And I missed you! How can I not come?

499
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,380
 When I see your smiling face, 

500
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,480
 It's okay. 

501
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,430
 I'm relieved to see you're doing well. 

502
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:04,010
 But then why won't you come find me? 

503
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,680
 I couldn't understand, no matter how much I thought about it. 

504
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:14,560
 But I came here every single day, 

505
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,640
thinking you might still miss me.

506
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,560
I'm sorry.

507
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,890
Don't be sorry.

508
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:28,590
You weren't planning to see me anyway.

509
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,420
Pretend you didn't see me today.

510
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,520
I won't return, either.

511
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:41,920
I'll toughen up and never return.

512
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,410
 Hae Joon, 

513
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:30,720
 I'm sorry. 

514
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,020
Hae Joon did?

515
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,350
 I was worried because he left like that. 

516
00:35:57,350 --> 00:36:01,470
Yes, I'll look for him.

517
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,110
Yes, yes.

518
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:09,830
   

519
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:18,120
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to voicemail. 

520
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:24,330
I see. All right.

521
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,990
Okay.

522
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,840
He didn't go to Seok Hoon's, either.

523
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,800
So...

524
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,240
if we had just told him the truth, this wouldn't have happened.

525
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,000
You two go home for now.

526
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,380
I think he will come home after getting some air.

527
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:02,120
Hey, I'll get going first.

528
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,500
Okay. Sure, you're probably tired. You go ahead.

529
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:07,320
Should I come with you?

530
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,860
No, no.

531
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,810
I'm going.

532
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,420
I'll get going.

533
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,120
I'm sorry I called you with your leg in that state.

534
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,520
It's fine.

535
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:40,700
I was waiting for you with Joo Won and San Ha anyway.

536
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,570
Everyone knows I met my mom, right?

537
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,640
Yes.

538
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:56,080
I keep thinking the same thoughts,

539
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,950
but I can't find an answer,

540
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,110
and I feel pathetic.

541
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,600
I can't tell anyone,

542
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:09,150
and Joo Won and Kim San Ha will feel really sorry for me if I see them right now.

543
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:15,220
You're the smartest person I know.

544
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:20,840
Yes, feel free to talk to me.

545
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,590
What should I do?

546
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,940
Pardon?

547
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,220
How can I pretend

548
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,110
my mom doesn't exist when I have one?

549
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,780
Did you ask Ahjumma why she did that?

550
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,630
I didn't ask her.

551
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:51,210
What good comes from asking?

552
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:54,760
 Ahjumma got into an accident when she went to Seoul to pay her debt. 

553
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,750
 She was in prison. 

554
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,250
 She said she couldn't come, afraid that she'd hurt Kang Hae Joon's future. 

555
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:08,670
There was a case when I was an intern.

556
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:12,020
A man's high school son got into a huge car accident.

557
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:17,980
After undergoing major surgery, it became difficult to live a normal life.

558
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:23,450
The son begged for the perpetrator to be severely punished,

559
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:28,270
but the father settled with the perpetrator without any punishment.

560
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:32,340
His wife and son asked how he could do that.

561
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:36,050
They got angry, asking if he only cared about the money.

562
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,980
He got a divorce and was alone after that.

563
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,830
Some parents care only about the money.

564
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:50,480
The father passed away from cancer not long after.

565
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,960
All alone by himself.

566
00:39:55,230 --> 00:40:00,690
He knew his wife and son would need money after he died.

567
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,730
He didn't even receive any treatment

568
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:07,130
and even though his family abandoned him,

569
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:11,430
he believed that was a way to protect his family.

570
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,450
Are you saying...

571
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:22,460
my mom could also have a reason she couldn't tell me?

572
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:29,380
I'm saying she might not have made that choice for her own sake.

573
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:02,460
Did you not come for me, or couldn't come for me?

574
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:09,430
 The call is not going through... 

575
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:11,340
   

576
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,690
   

577
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,520
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to... 

578
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,000
It took almost six months

579
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,660
undergoing trials and such while I was in prison.

580
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,610
I think that was when you got into middle school.

581
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:44,010
I secretly watched you from an alley having fun with your friends.

582
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:51,320
Then Jeong Jae came and was so happy to find you.

583
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,920
When I saw him take you home with the biggest smile,

584
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,360
I couldn't...

585
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,270
bring myself to appear in front of you

586
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:07,740
saying I came back to take you...

587
00:42:09,290 --> 00:42:12,130
or just to see your face.

588
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,910
I couldn't do anything for you.

589
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:23,010
I felt so bad that someone like me was your mom.

590
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,670
Do you think that makes sense?

591
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,920
I'm sorry.

592
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,500
I'm really sorry.

593
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,920
Why do you keep saying you're sorry?

594
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,020
While you were living like that,

595
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,600
all I did was resent you.

596
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:44,900
You don't know

597
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,070
how hard I tried to hate you!

598
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:54,080
It would have been better if you left me to pursue a better life.

599
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,800
What is this?

600
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:58,700
Why did you live like that?

601
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:05,160
Are you happy now that you made me seem like an ungrateful child?

602
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,750
Tell me!

603
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,090
 Are you satisfied? 

604
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:22,630
Dad.

605
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:25,590
Hae Joon, calm down

606
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:27,640
and listen to me.

607
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,550
Your mom had her circumstances.

608
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:34,960
You were aware, too?

609
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:43,550
Did everyone know?

610
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:50,480
What happened was–

611
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,780
I told him not to tell you.

612
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,720
Your mom wanted to come see you soon.

613
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:02,080
She had asked us not to so you would hurt less.

614
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,650
How could I hurt less?

615
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:09,530
How could I feel less hurt

616
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:12,030
in this crappy situation?

617
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:16,220
Hae Joon.

618
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,900
Why is everyone doing this to me?

619
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,920
Why make me out to be stupid?

620
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,810
An idiot?

621
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:31,320
I'm happy with just eating a hamburger with you.

622
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:37,550
I'm just happy eating a bowl of noodles with you, Dad.

623
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:41,930
Does it...

624
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,480
Does it have to hurt like this?

625
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:51,600
What everyone is born with...

626
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,410
and what comes naturally to people...

627
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,470
Why don't I have that?

628
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,590
Why is it so hard for me?

629
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:58,290
For now, we definitely didn't know anything.

630
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:01,020
Dad said it would be catastrophic if we said we knew, too.

631
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:04,000
All right. This is the third time already.

632
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,770
I'm nervous. I wonder how happy they are.

633
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,130
You said we have to watch our words.

634
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:11,360
I'll be careful.

635
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:15,860
We didn't even know Ahjumma was alive. Okay?

636
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:18,300
You're making me nervous.

637
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,940
Let's go.

638
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,380
Oh, yes. Come in.

639
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,260
Hello.

640
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,390
It's hard to recognize you after 20 years.

641
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:39,140
What are you saying?

642
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:41,230
Mom looks the same.

643
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:43,310
Really?

644
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:46,960
My memory must be blurry since I was too young.

645
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:49,450
Hello.

646
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,020
It has been a while.

647
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:53,830
I'm glad you came.

648
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,760
Sit down. Sit down.

649
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,880
Let's eat.

650
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,040
Galbi-jjim (braised short ribs)?

651
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,170
Yes, thank you.

652
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:20,500
♫  How much I missed it; Never know  ♫

653
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:33,710
♫  Everything is spreading red like a sunrise  ♫

654
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:35,890
This is really good.

655
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:42,760
♫  The things I followed and I respected  ♫

656
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,710
Thank you,

657
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,010
everyone.

658
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:51,110
I didn't invite you to hear that.

659
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:53,460
We just happened to have galbi-jjim at home

660
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,140
and invited everyone for a meal together.

661
00:47:57,990 --> 00:47:59,590
Why did we happen to have galbi-jjim?

662
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,470
Is it someone's birthday?

663
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:05,050
Why?

664
00:48:07,450 --> 00:48:10,740
We just happened to have galbi-jjim at home, right?

665
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,980
♫  I missed it  ♫

666
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:21,130
♫  Now it's time to move forward  ♫

667
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:23,300
It's delicious.

668
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,300
I can never manage to get this taste.

669
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,280
You don't need to be a good cook, Mom.

670
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,850
I'm quite good since I take after Dad.

671
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,660
Oh, right.

672
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:38,900
I made your signature crab stew for Kang Hae Joon last time.

673
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,840
He absolutely loved it.

674
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,880
I must take after you, too.

675
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,460
Don't.

676
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,370
You don't have to cook, either.

677
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:52,920
Why not? You really enjoyed it.

678
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:56,120
I wish you'd only bake cakes.

679
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:01,090
No, I'm probably good at it.

680
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:03,050
Hey, but how do you bake cakes?

681
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,920
You, be quiet.

682
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,250
Gosh, this is nice.

683
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,470
What is?

684
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,110
It's nice, isn't it?

685
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:21,500
I absolutely love it.

686
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,170
I feel the tingling.

687
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:27,260
As if the moment I imagined has become a reality.

688
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,210
I feel that way, too.

689
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,030
It's not like you found your moms.

690
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,720
Why are you so happy?

691
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,940
Are you going to live with your mom now?

692
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,010
We didn't talk about those things yet.

693
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:44,480
Tell Ahjumma to move here so we can all live together.

694
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:58,830
The children always go up after eating

695
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:02,310
and spend time there until they're done digesting.

696
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:04,690
It has been 20 years.

697
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:10,900
I can't believe it's already been that long.

698
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,880
I thought...

699
00:50:16,290 --> 00:50:19,510
you were quite strange back then.

700
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,890
Why?

701
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:27,650
I wondered how it was possible to cook a warm meal for a stranger.

702
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:35,990
I asked you for too many shameless favors, didn't I?

703
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:41,000
I'll be upset if you keep saying things like that.

704
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,650
Thank you.

705
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:53,430
- The children are here– 
 - Tread gently.

706
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,750
Why do you enter so abruptly?

707
00:50:55,750 --> 00:50:58,310
Oh, you have a guest.

708
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:01,180
This is...

709
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,630
Hae Joon's mom.

710
00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:06,900
Hello.

711
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:10,480
Aigoo, yes. I'm glad you came.

712
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:14,250
Thank you for taking care of Hae Joon until now.

713
00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:16,490
Oh, what did I do? I didn't do any–

714
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:20,980
I told you to stop thanking everyone now.

715
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:24,960
Please sit down.

716
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:31,860
Oh, all the children must be on the rooftop.

717
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,100
I'll go up to see my son.

718
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,360
Suddenly? You've never gone up to the rooftop.

719
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:40,490
They'll be down soon. Just stay here.

720
00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:42,420
Oh, then...

721
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,930
I'm going to get changed and come down.

722
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,770
Dad said he'd take you home. Why didn't you accept his offer?

723
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:05,870
Aren't you tired?

724
00:52:05,870 --> 00:52:08,590
I'm not tired at all.

725
00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:04,920
Are you with Kang Hae Joon?

726
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,300
 No, I'm alone. 
   

727
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,760
 He's going to sleep over at Ahjumma's. 

728
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,840
"At Ahjumma's"?

729
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,470
Good for him.

730
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:14,550
 What are you doing? 

731
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:17,240
I didn't eat dinner, so I'll make something.

732
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,030
-  Right now?  
 - Yes.

733
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,640
I'm going to eat ramen.

734
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,390
"Ramen"? Why would you eat ramen?

735
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:25,980
Hold on. I'll bring over some side dishes.

736
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,880
No! Don't come!

737
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,460
Joo Won?

738
00:53:31,710 --> 00:53:33,950
Oh, what do I do?

739
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:41,380
 No, I'm alone. 

740
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:44,890
 I'm alone. 

741
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,190
 It's just the two of us here. 

742
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:43,130
Like this...

743
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:46,840
Naturally.

744
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:49,850
Hey, Joo Won. You're here?

745
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:53,850
Hey, Joo Won. You're here?

746
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,630
Whatever!

747
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,690
You're finished, right?

748
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:20,150
You shouldn't sleep right after you eat, so wait 30 minutes.

749
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:22,580
Did you wash up?

750
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:24,130
Yes... What?

751
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:25,310
No, I...

752
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:28,340
Right, I-I didn't wash yet.

753
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:30,630
I'll wash up and then sleep.

754
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:32,100
Sure.

755
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,230
I should wash up at home and go to sleep, too.

756
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:36,520
Just leave the bowl.

757
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,540
I'll take them in the morning.

758
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:41,430
Joo Won.

759
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:43,010
Yes?

760
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:45,640
Let's get permission from our dads.

761
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,890
I want their permission soon.

762
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,910
Okay.

763
00:55:57,670 --> 00:55:59,240
Good nigh...

764
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,400
Thank you.

765
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,700
I can walk by myself now.

766
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,040
What did I say?

767
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,930
I received so much help from you.

768
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:27,450
I can do this much.

769
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:28,950
I'll buy you dinner, too.

770
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:31,540
Let's go. Grab my arm.

771
00:56:33,910 --> 00:56:36,600
Get a good grip!

772
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:39,070
   

773
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,140
Did you get hurt?

774
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,590
Yes.

775
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:48,200
Are you two dating?

776
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,750
We aren't.

777
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:54,900
Why go that far if you're not her boyfriend?

778
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,840
I need to take care of her.

779
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,690
What?

780
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:01,310
She's important to me in many ways.

781
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:11,130
Spare me some time today. I need to tell you something.

782
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:13,380
Sunbae doesn't have time later.

783
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:15,460
He's going to have dinner with me.

784
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:17,970
Yes, she's right.

785
00:57:20,650 --> 00:57:24,530
I'm a little busy, so I'd like to see you today.

786
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:26,810
You can buy dinner next time.

787
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,060
I'm a little busy, too,

788
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:33,460
and I'll have dinner with Sunbae every chance I get. Not only today and tomorrow.

789
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:37,070
Yes, I'll buy her food whenever she asks me to.

790
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:39,480
I don't have much to say to you anyway.

791
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,140
We are leaving.

792
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:02,650
You can get in first.

793
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,620
Another one will come soon.

794
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:15,690
You're so kind like this, but you put Do Hui Joo in her place earlier.

795
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,450
You were helping me so she wouldn't bother me, right?

796
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:21,540
I think it'll work.

797
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:28,720
I didn't do that to help you.

798
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:38,220
I didn't hurt my leg because Joo Won made me follow you.

799
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:41,650
I followed you because I was worried about you.

800
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:46,720
Even today, I only said that

801
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,350
so Hui Joo would give up on you.

802
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:54,120
And I never liked San Ha.

803
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:01,280
I like you, Sunbae!

804
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:40,140
Hey! You shouldn't run!

805
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:42,930
Please don't follow me!

806
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:48,470
   

807
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:51,220
So you just ran away after confessing?

808
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,970
Yes.

809
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,390
You need to hear the answer to your confession!

810
00:59:56,390 --> 01:00:01,600
That wasn't even a proper confession.

811
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:07,440
I shouldn't have blurted out my 10-year-old one-sided love like that.

812
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,060
It's okay.

813
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:22,110
Give that to Dal.

814
01:00:35,130 --> 01:00:37,900
He must have run really fast to get these.

815
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:46,260
Pain relief spray.

816
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:54,430
How do you feel? Tell me.

817
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:57,360
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.

818
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,710
Don't you like Dal? What?

819
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:01,760
It's not that I don't...

820
01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:06,000
I don't think you should be worried about that right now.

821
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,760
You're right.

822
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:16,880
I'll see how the dads react first.

823
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,500
If things start going wrong, I'll mediate.

824
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:24,150
Hey, you should actively support us. Right?

825
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,320
Are you nervous right now?

826
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,810
Kang Hae Joon, look. Kim San Ha must be nervous.

827
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:31,360
I'm not.

828
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:34,970
You put on such a brave face. Are you scared now?

829
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:36,430
I'm not scared.

830
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:41,340
Should I just say, "Dad, I like Kim San Ha"?

831
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:44,880
Then wouldn't Dad just accept it without a choice?

832
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,640
I think Dad will slap you on the back and tell you to wake up.

833
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:52,730
You're right. He would.

834
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,940
What made you think of kalguksu?

835
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,620
We haven't had kalguksu in a while.

836
01:01:59,620 --> 01:02:01,560
There's no kalguksu like this in the city.

837
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,190
- Nowhere in the nation. 
 - Yes.

838
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:08,940
You all don't need to gather at the house now.

839
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,120
It's the weekend and your days off.

840
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:14,520
You must each have your own plans, too.

841
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,900
- We don't, though. 
 - We don't...

842
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:22,090
Hey, you should meet your friends and significant others.

843
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:24,990
You all are at the age to date and marry now.

844
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:26,870
How long will you stick together like this?

845
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:29,510
Yes, Ahjusshi is right.

846
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:32,250
We are glad you all get along,

847
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:34,690
but you should meet your own partners

848
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:38,080
and make your own families, too.

849
01:02:40,850 --> 01:02:44,220
Well, actually, you see–

850
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:47,830
That girl, Hui Joo...

851
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,970
- I like her. 
 - Yes.

852
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:51,610
Me, too.

853
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,970
Wait.

854
01:02:55,970 --> 01:02:58,990
And Joo Won, that alumni of yours at Myungju Hospital.

855
01:02:58,990 --> 01:03:03,490
He was the one who always gave you love letters, wasn't he?

856
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:08,880
If he's still pursuing you after all these years, he's a good one.

857
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:11,440
Even if it's not them,

858
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,310
you should give a chance to anyone who interests you.

859
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:17,340
Your dads aren't picky.

860
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:20,260
If you think they're a good person,

861
01:03:20,260 --> 01:03:23,020
we won't oppose them or argue.

862
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:26,090
- Right? 
 - Of course.

863
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,250
Then, don't oppose us.

864
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:43,590
We are dating.

865
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:45,100
What?

866
01:03:55,150 --> 01:04:04,060


867
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:19,200
♫  There was a time when I was filled with hopes about my dream  ♫

868
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:25,940
♫  That dream made me feel like I owned the world  ♫

869
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:27,740
   

870
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:31,430
 You have to take responsibility for Mr. Yoon, 

871
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:34,140
 who aged so much while raising Hae Joon. 

872
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:37,210
 Calling you Mom and Dad makes it feel like you really are my Mom and Dad. 

873
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:39,460
 Isn't Hae Joon's mom moving in with you? 

874
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,720
 Jae Eun set Dal up on a blind date. 

875
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,180
 I guess that's today. 

876
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:44,260
 "Blind date"? 

877
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:46,570
 I don't need an oppa. 

878
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:49,510
 I'll take Dal with me today. 

879
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:52,280
 Are you dating my San Ha? 

880
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:55,160
 What you both are doing isn't love. 

881
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,090
 It's delusional. 

882
01:04:57,090 --> 01:04:59,670
 I came to win against you. 

883
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:07,170
♫  We were dazzling and were united as one  ♫
