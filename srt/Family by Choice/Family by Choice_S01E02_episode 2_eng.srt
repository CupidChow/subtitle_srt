1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,990


2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,000
   

3
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,000
   

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,600
   

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,950
   

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,830
   

7
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,360
   

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,720
   

9
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:32,250
I'm thirsty.

10
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,970
Me, too.

11
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,290
I want snacks.

12
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:49,390
   

13
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:52,270
   

14
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,330
Make sure you brush your teeth.

15
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,650
Why did you buy so many snacks?

16
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,610
Girls always carry around a bag of snacks and give it to him.

17
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,930
I have a lot of snacks, too.

18
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,270
You can take some later.

19
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,070
Really?

20
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,130
   

21
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,050
Why aren't you eating any?

22
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:37,440
I'll eat them with a friend tomorrow.

23
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:40,700
Ta-da! 
    

24
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,290
This is a limited edition!

25
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,730
Where did you get it?

26
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:46,770
Oppa gave it to me. Try it.

27
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,370
It's so good.

28
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,290
Which oppa gave it to you?

29
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,860
Kim San Ha.

30
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,830
- Spit it out. 
 - What?

31
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:04,430
Spit it out!

32
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,270
I found it after going to ten different supermarkets.

33
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,410
Spit it out!

34
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,380
It's mine!

35
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,450
Spit it out!

36
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:16,840
- It's mine! 
 - Oppa gave it to me!

37
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,070
Spit it out!

38
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,680
- Spit it out! It's mine! 
 - No, it's mine!

39
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,890
Yoon Joo Won.

40
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:23,680
To whom? 
    

41
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,500
Kim San Ha.

42
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,410
To whom?

43
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,700
Kang Hae Joon.

44
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,430
Give this to San Ha Oppa.

45
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,270
San Ha Oppa.

46
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,770
Kang Hae Joon.

47
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,560
- Did he read it? 
 - I don't know.

48
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,800
Did he reply?

49
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,000
I don't know... ma'am.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,500
Do you like Kang Hae Joon?

51
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,750
Is that why he hasn't read it?

52
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,140
No way... ma'am.

53
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,720
 It started then. It all started back then! 
   

54
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,110
Those misunderstandings arose due to our different last names.

55
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,430
The root of all evil was the last name.

56
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,860
Just do what you did the first semester.

57
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,650
The first semester was the hardest.

58
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:08,890
I told you to make a scary first impression on your first day.

59
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,880
How would I do that?

60
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,040
I've always had a friendly face because I resemble Dad.

61
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,030
It isn't just because of your face.

62
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:17,690
It's your attitude.

63
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,450
- "Attitude"? 
 - If someone spits on you and you smile,

64
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:23,500
what will they think the next time?

65
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,860
- I don't know. 
 - "I can spit on her again."

66
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,380
That's what they'll think.

67
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,890
Even a mean frown on your face won't work anymore.

68
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,300
Is it too late?

69
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,120
Is there no other way?

70
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,070
If you want to change your established reputation...

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,950
you'll have to be tougher.

72
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,320
"Tougher"?

73
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,520
Don't think about causing trouble. Just call the teacher.

74
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,310
A third party should solve it.

75
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,790
Stay out of this, Bookworm.

76
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,190
When something happens, would you have time to call anyone?

77
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,360
- No. 
 - That's how you get into more trouble.

78
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,770
Repeat after me.

79
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,100
"Not just crazy, but an absolute lunatic."

80
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,960
"Not just crazy, but an absolute lunatic."

81
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,050
 I expected this. Stay calm. It's me! 

82
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,500
 I can handle this calmly and reasonably. 

83
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,040
This is for Kim San Ha.

84
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,610
This is for Kang Hae Joon.

85
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,320
You just have to deliver them.

86
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,990
That's all I have to do, right?

87
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,310
Of course.

88
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,170
Then...

89
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,170
What?

90
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:42,070
A contract agreeing to forgo any A/S (After-Sales service).

91
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,660
"A contract"?

92
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,270
Here.

93
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,000
This is for Kim San Ha.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,630
This is for Kang Hae Joon.

95
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,950
You won't ask if Kim San Ha or Kang Hae Joon have read your letters or ask for responses.

96
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,590
Write your grade and homeroom number and sign here, please.

97
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,590
I told you.

98
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:01,650
She's blocking us on purpose.

99
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,800
"Younger sister"? What a lie.

100
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,080
We were naive to believe that.

101
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,310
No! It isn't what you think.

102
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,090
We might have different last names–

103
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,100
Right.

104
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
You even have different last names.

105
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,690
We just have paperwork left, and we will soon have the same–

106
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,310
How can you have the same last name?

107
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,750
Are you making fun of us?

108
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,820
I said, are you making fun of us?

109
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,950
Stop staring at me!

110
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:39,740
 If someone spits on you and you smile, what will they think the next time? 

111
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,600
Did you just spit?

112
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,340
I did.

113
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,690
 "I can spit on her again." 

114
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:48,760
 That's what they'll think. 

115
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,100
You just met me!

116
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,710
Why would you spit when you just met me?

117
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,000
Then you'll spit again the second time.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,840
Right? Right?

119
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,800
- Darn. 
 - What's with her?

120
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,300
And...

121
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,430
And the third time...

122
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,590
She simply likes to spit.

123
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,490
She wasn't thinking too hard. She just wanted to...

124
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:11,150
 "Not just crazy," 

125
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:12,360
But an absolute lunatic.

126
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,660
I won't let you spit again.

127
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:19,770
Cola, cola, so delicious.

128
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,780
If it's delicious, let's drink it again.

129
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,440
- Me? 
 - You must be crazy.

130
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,770
How dare you point fingers at me?

131
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,650
You raised your hand.

132
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,640
What are you saying?

133
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:44,690
 Crazy, crazy, crazy! 

134
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,890
 I'm crazy! 

135
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:02,580
 Kang Hae Joon! Kang Hae Joon! 

136
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,220
 Kang Hae Joon! Kang Hae Joon! 
   

137
00:08:34,310 --> 00:08:37,600
Joo Won... Joo Won is...

138
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,440
What's going on?

139
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,690
Come look!

140
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,130
Look at that.

141
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,520
Someone fell in the pond.

142
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,400
Who hasn't turned in their counseling application forms?

143
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:06,800
Isn't that your sister?

144
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,760
Hey...

145
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,560
Hey, Kim San Ha!

146
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,360
What is she doing?

147
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,670
It isn't deep!

148
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,110
Hey, it isn't deep!

149
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,100
Get out of there!

150
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,160
Just get out of there!

151
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,150
Wh-What's with her?

152
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,110
- Why is she coming closer? Why, why? 
 - Why is she coming?

153
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,220
- What is it? 
 - Why are you coming here?

154
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,100
Unni, will you hit me again?

155
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,970
- She hit her? 
 - She hit Joo Won?

156
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:07,570
I'm so sorry!

157
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,020
It's all my fault.

158
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,500
Are you crazy?

159
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,700
Crazy...

160
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,450
Do I look crazy to you?

161
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,450
Really? Really? For sure?

162
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,610
Do I really look crazy?

163
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,810
She's weird.

164
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,490
Hey!

165
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,590
It wasn't us. We didn't do it.

166
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,800
She jumped in the pond herself.

167
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,150
How did you know I was here?

168
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:41,200
Class President! Did you bring him?

169
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,100
Yes.

170
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,140
Darn it!

171
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,040
Are you crazy? You'll catch a cold.

172
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,980
It reeks of sweat!

173
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,960
He's so hot.

174
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,820
Wow.

175
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,610
It's San Ha Oppa.

176
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,720
Are you okay?

177
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,350
- I'm not hurt. 
 - Let me see.

178
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,140
They'll never spit on you again.

179
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,660
I told you not to cause trouble, didn't I?

180
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,730
Why me? What did I do?

181
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:38,040
Oh, Class President! Your shoes!

182
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,790
   

183
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,700
Are you angry?

184
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,640
Let it go.

185
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,700
If you hadn't talked about first impressions and acting crazy...

186
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,250
This wouldn't have happened.

187
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,840
She needs to get used to solving her own problems.

188
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,310
They say tigers throw their cubs off a cliff to raise them strong.

189
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,990
Have you ever seen a tiger do that?

190
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:19,910
- No. 
 - Are you a tiger, then?

191
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,520
No.

192
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,870
Is Joo Won your child?

193
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,710
No, sir.

194
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,250
Joo Won! Here!

195
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,970
You smell like the pond.

196
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,610
I can't help it. Today was a total success, right?

197
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:50,490
I'm so dirty that they can't touch me.

198
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,160
Must be nice to be dirty.

199
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,040
Are you angry?

200
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,040
I'm not angry. I'm worried.

201
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,440
It's getting colder.

202
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,740
If you're going to be angry, be angry equally. Why are you only angry with me?

203
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,190
Let's go.

204
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,320
 What is that smell? 

205
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,710
 What is that? 

206
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,340
 Did someone fart? 

207
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:31,480
What's wrong with this bus?

208
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,740
It's bad...

209
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,570
- Do you have an umbrella? 
 - No.

210
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:15,740
The news said it would be clear skies today.

211
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:18,350
You two stay here. I'll go get an umbrella.

212
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,990
It's just a drizzle. Let's run.

213
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,670
- No, the rain–  
 - Let's go.

214
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,760
Wait for me!

215
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:54,770
♫  Back then, we were the world  ♫

216
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,560
♫  Everything existed for us  ♫

217
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,200
♫  Like the sun in the clearest summer sky  ♫

218
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:13,200
♫  We were dazzling and were united as one  ♫

219
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,850
Get inside!

220
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:30,080
- Aigoo! 
 - Hello.

221
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,480
Hi, hi.

222
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,380
You're soaked.

223
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,110
Joo Won, where's your uniform?

224
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:37,150
- In here. 
 - No, no, no.

225
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,950
- Let's share an umbrella. 
 - Children should get rained on to grow up healthy.

226
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:44,590
They aren't children. They're all grown up.

227
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,360
Aigoo, time flies.

228
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,640
You used to be this small when I first met you.

229
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,370
So, haven't you heard from your mom yet?

230
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,740
Pardon?

231
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,250
No.

232
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,320
What an interesting bunch you are.

233
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,890
I know.

234
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:08,690
My goodness, you're all so unfortunate.

235
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:11,810
No, we aren't unfortunate at all.

236
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:15,180
No one in this world is ordinary. Every family has their story.

237
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,050
We are all special in our own way.

238
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,060
Sure, of course.

239
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,850
We are all special.

240
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,620
That isn't what I meant.

241
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,930
As your neighbor, I was trying to express my interest in your well-being.

242
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,740
Stop it. Unwanted interest is just meddling.

243
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,920
You said you left laundry out to dry. Let's go.

244
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,390
- Let's go. 
 - Bye.

245
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,450
- Are we special? 
 - Yes!

246
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,460
Tie it tight so it doesn't slip.

247
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,630
Are you listening to me?

248
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,200
Your sons aren't your only children, you know.

249
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,500
You always make what Kang Hae Joon likes. Especially lately.

250
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,980
You like it, too.

251
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,510
So we don't need that legal adoption thing, right?

252
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,540
Oh, no, no.

253
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:22,680
Do you think I only suggested it to stop relaying love letters?

254
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,540
Considering everything, I think it would be better to do it.

255
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,470
Then we wouldn't have to hear weird comments from the neighbors.

256
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,800
"Weird comments"?

257
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,310
Like what? Did someone say something?

258
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:44,230
If one of us gets hurt, who signs the consent form for surgery?

259
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,040
Stop talking about bad stuff. Just eat.

260
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,550
It applies to good stuff, too.

261
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,290
Let's say I won the lottery, hypothetically.

262
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,770
But on my way from depositing money in the bank,

263
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,070
I get into a car accident.

264
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:59,150
Only my dad will get that money.

265
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,600
You guys won't get any of it!

266
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,260
Is that an example of a good thing? Me getting your inheritance?

267
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,110
No.

268
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,460
You can't even buy a lottery ticket yet.

269
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,750
I know. That's why I said "hypothetically." Life is about preparations.

270
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,990
Why do we get vaccinated? It isn't given after catching the flu.

271
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,290
Just eat.

272
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:21,410
If you eat well and sleep well, you won't get the flu.

273
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,600
Of course.

274
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,110
It isn't like that.

275
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,320
   

276
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,220
   

277
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:43,600
   

278
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,370
Hello.

279
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,920
Yes.

280
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,040
Oh, we are good.

281
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,950
Yes, we are doing well.

282
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:55,980
Yes.

283
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,200
My maternal grandma.

284
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,340
Eat what I gave you.

285
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,300
You can have mine.

286
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:28,910
Thank you for the meal.

287
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,740
Why don't you have a little more?

288
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,010
I had some bread at school.

289
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,050
   

290
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,220
 Ahjumma never calls. 

291
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,730
Yoon Joo Won.

292
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,530
Am I wrong?

293
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,670
Why should Kim San Ha hear about her being remarried and happy?

294
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,490
She married a doctor and had a baby.

295
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:15,400
The living room in their new apartment is as spacious as a soccer field.

296
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,730
Her child's English kindergarten costs ₩2 million a month.

297
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,700
Why should Kim San Ha know any of that?

298
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,190
Is San Ha's grandma your friend? Stop it.

299
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,060
 Yes. 

300
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,530
Let me get him.

301
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,290
 - Where's San Ha? 
 - He went upstairs. 

302
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,710
Oh, San Ha has already gone to bed.

303
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:37,200
He's tired these days from all the studying.

304
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,540
Yes. Bye.

305
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,080
Why this atmosphere?

306
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,880
I'll make some rice balls*. Take it upstairs after dinner. 
  (TN: "Fist rice" in Korean) 

307
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,540
What will you put in them?

308
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,090
My fist. My raging fist.

309
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,330
Okay.

310
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,290
What?

311
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,510
   

312
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:22,950
Doesn't that lady get along with her current rich son-in-law?

313
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,040
Why does she keep calling her ex-son-in-law?

314
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,580
San Ha won't answer, so she calls me.

315
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,750
While you listen to her brag,

316
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,740
remind her that he's a senior in high school.

317
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,830
Maybe she'll call him less.

318
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,670
Okay.

319
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:41,120
I did a good job washing all the dishes. Want to see?

320
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,060
What?

321
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:51,470
Why do you always return home empty-handed?

322
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,500
Why not bring some fruit to share?

323
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,970
You didn't like the melons I got last time!

324
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,270
You said I can't even pick good fruit and said not to buy anything.

325
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:02,400
I'm not just talking about food.

326
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,600
I'm asking you to put more care into the family.

327
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,320
Have you ever bought the children's birthday presents?

328
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,460
Aigoo,

329
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:16,570
why the nagging? Being a single dad is hard enough.

330
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:19,240
I haven't even started.

331
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,730
Do you want me to give my all?

332
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,960
- No thanks. 
 - While we are on the subject,

333
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,270
- why don't we air everything out? 
 - Don't follow me.

334
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:30,990
- Don't follow me. 
 - I mean...

335
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,770
Hey, just have some.

336
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:38,400
- Have some. 
 - I'll eat them later.

337
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,220
I'll get a stomachache if I eat them now.

338
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,830
When will you eat them?

339
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,720
Before midnight.

340
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:48,640
I'll check the plate tomorrow morning.

341
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,150
Fine.

342
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,030
What? What's this smell?

343
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,810
- Did you change your shampoo? 
 - What are you doing?

344
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,080
Do you use expensive shampoo by yourself?

345
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,080
This is it. What is this?

346
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,150
Why do you use cotton-scented shampoo by yourself, Oppa? Explain!

347
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,880
Explain!

348
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:35,210
Put some of this fierce energy into studying.

349
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,910
- You're changing the subject. 
 - He's changing the subject.

350
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,610
Cotton scent and lemon scent.

351
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,550
We got them on a 1+1 sale. You both took the lemon scent saying it smelt refreshing. Remember?

352
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:49,880
Oh?

353
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,180
I'm reminding you I have less than a hundred days until the college entrance exam.

354
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,880
- Spend time at your place. 
 - "Your place"?

355
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,300
He speaks so heartlessly.

356
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,010
- I also have less than a hundred days left. 
 - Sure. Go.

357
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:04,660
- Just go! 
 - Gosh!

358
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,080
Go!

359
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,220
I feel better now.

360
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,970
Close the door and go.

361
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,630
Go!

362
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,630
Good job!

363
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,120
He will eat the rice balls, right?

364
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,540
If he's hungry, he will.

365
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,050
Hey.

366
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,930
I'm disappointed about something.

367
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,500
Okay.

368
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,960
You sometimes call San Ha "Oppa."

369
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,120
I do? When?

370
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,150
"Why do you use cotton-scented shampoo by yourself, Oppa?"

371
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:00,840
Why am I just "you" when Kim San Ha is "Oppa"?

372
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,750
Shouldn't our titles be equal?

373
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,390
Oppa.

374
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,280
One hundred won for every time I call you that.

375
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,190
- Never mind. Stop it. 
 - Oppa, oppa, oppa.

376
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:11,130
- Three hundred won, okay? 
 - I said stop it!

377
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,840
Oppa, oppa, oppa.

378
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,590
Oppa!

379
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,770
 You really aren't changing this? Why Myungju University? 
   

380
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:59,660
Myungju University is close to my house.

381
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,720
An hour by car, or a maximum of an hour and a half.

382
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,710
Hey, you... oh...

383
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:08,780
It isn't a matter of distance!

384
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:12,920
Do you know your grades are good enough for Seoul National University Medical School?

385
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,230
I'm not going to Seoul. It's too far.

386
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:21,030
I'm not seeking an "Accepted to Seoul National University Medical School" banner here.

387
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:23,630
I don't know about the principal, but not me.

388
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:26,610
After graduation, we will be doctors all the same.

389
00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:29,460
It isn't all the same!

390
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,150
San Ha.

391
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,160
Talk to your father again.

392
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,060
This is not a decision you should make alone.

393
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,180
   

394
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,770
   

395
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,940
Let's talk somewhere quiet.

396
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:58,200
 They said I threw the first punch? 

397
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,370
And then? What else?

398
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,800
- You won't get mad, right? 
 - I won't.

399
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:10,850
That you steal snacks from the others, you give orders to your older brothers,

400
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:13,980
and you hit and bully anyone who approaches them.

401
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,750
That yesterday wasn't unique and those girls yesterday were the victims.

402
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,500
Really?

403
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,000
Yes.

404
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,350
Do they call me "crazy" secretly?

405
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,830
They do.

406
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:31,370
Thank goodness.

407
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,500
You don't know Kim San Ha, right? Should I introduce you?

408
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,980
- No, thanks. 
 - Don't back out.

409
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,380
My friend is a friend of Kim San Ha's. Let's go.

410
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,990
The music room? Hey, Kim San–

411
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,030
- Don't you understand? 
 - Pardon?

412
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:57,870
Lunch. Just the two of them. The music room.

413
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,980
- Don't you understand? 
 - No.

414
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,370
We shouldn't interfere.

415
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:06,170
- Why not? 
 - San Ha Sunbae and Hui Joo Sunbae are dating.

416
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,950
What?

417
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:11,180
Didn't you know?

418
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:14,210
Everyone in my class knows.

419
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:15,740
"Everyone"?

420
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,870
They all know?

421
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,950
Don't call me to a place like this.

422
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,540
People will misunderstand.

423
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,410
- Is it a misunderstanding? 
 -  It is.

424
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:32,080
When I said I was going to Seoul National University, you said, "Yes."

425
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,970
I did. As in, you should go.

426
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,060
When I said I liked you, you said, "Yes."

427
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,440
I did. As in, "Understood."

428
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,600
Anyway, you said, "Yes."

429
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:53,200
If a girl says she likes a guy, and he says, "Yes," that means you also like her.

430
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,510
So I thought we'd start dating when we go to Seoul National University together...

431
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,860
That's what I thought it was.

432
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:04,880
It isn't. But thankfully, now you know.

433
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,530
Make sure you go to Seoul National University.

434
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,800
Fighting.

435
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,470
 Do they all know? 

436
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:19,630
 Except me? 

437
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,340
Over there.

438
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,460
What's going on? Why aren't you talking?

439
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,070
I saw you during lunch, Oppa.

440
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,750
Really? Why didn't you say hi?

441
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,640
I tried to follow you, but you went into the music room.

442
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,530
You saw Hui Joo?

443
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:19,990
Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend?

444
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,070
What?

445
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,880
Everyone at school knew except me.

446
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,600
Is that why you're upset?

447
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,560
Of course! Everyone knew except me.

448
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,450
Ahjusshi, Dad, Kang Hae Joon, everyone will be so sad.

449
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,740
Are you sad, too?

450
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,470
Of course!

451
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:40,120
If we were your real family, you would have told us.

452
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,320
How can you not say anything? You see us every day.

453
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,070
Is it that important to you that we become family?

454
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:51,130
- Pardon? 
 - Is that why you're making a fuss about legal adoption?

455
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,310
Yoon Joo Won.

456
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,920
We aren't family.

457
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,950
Are we blood relatives? Why must we share a last name?

458
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:06,770
I'm Kim San Ha. You're Yoon Joo Won.

459
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:09,780
Let's say we match our last names and become family on paper.

460
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,070
So? Then what?

461
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,410
It isn't about doing something...

462
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:21,100
People obsess over the things they lack the most.

463
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,780
Whenever you talk about "Family," it shows.

464
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,530
You're anxious we aren't family on paper.

465
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,830
I'm not anxious.

466
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:37,940
It's just that you kept a secret from me, Oppa.

467
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,590
I'm just sad about it.

468
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,760
If you're going to cry, do it in private.

469
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,910
You're in high school now. You're too old to cry like a child.

470
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,330
I'm not crying!

471
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,420
I'm not crying!

472
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,240
Shoot!

473
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,220
Score!

474
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,930
Let's go!

475
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,070
Shoot!

476
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:12,030
Okay, get some water. Let's take a break.

477
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,620
My heart will pop out of my throat.

478
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,760
The competition is coming up.

479
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,110
Hey, look.

480
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:34,420
I heard a strange guy is hanging around these days. Is that him?

481
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,440
Hey, Ahjusshi!

482
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,550
Ahjusshi!

483
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:48,380
Ahjusshi!

484
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,930
Ahjusshi!

485
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,010
Ahjusshi!

486
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,050
What's wrong, Student?

487
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:06,880
Who are you? Why were you watching us practice?

488
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,480
Let me go.

489
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,420
How dare you? To an adult?

490
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,020
Let me go!

491
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,980
Fine, let's talk once you let me go. I understand, so just let go...

492
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,050
Darn it! Shoot!

493
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,020
What is that? A digital camera?

494
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,270
What?

495
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,250
Why was he taking pictures of us?

496
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,210
He was taking pictures of you.

497
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,580
Me?

498
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,670
Look. You're always in the middle.

499
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,870
 What's wrong, Student? 

500
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,020
He had a Seoul accent.

501
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:57,570
"A Seoul accent"?

502
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:01,420
Didn't you say your mom is in Seoul?

503
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,990
 I'll come get him as soon as I'm settled in Seoul. 

504
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:07,590
 I'll bring your favorite hamburgers when I come back, Hae Joon. 

505
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,320
Maybe your mom sent him.

506
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,930
It must be a spy from another school's basketball team.

507
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,160
In high school basketball?

508
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,320
If they're super competitive, it's possible.

509
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,150
Go practice more.

510
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:26,930
   

511
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:40,190
What's going on? You didn't call!

512
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:45,290
I wanted to stop by on my way home from work.

513
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,990
Why don't you have a bowl of noodles? It'll be quick.

514
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,490
It's okay.

515
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:57,110
You're closed. Don't bother.

516
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:09,960
I got them while I was buying Hae Joon's underwear.

517
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,920
Did you forget what we discussed last time?

518
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,050
You told me to come empty-handed.

519
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:18,670
Otherwise, you would scold me.

520
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:21,320
I'm just trying to make amends to you.

521
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,680
Overlook this one.

522
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,880
Thanks, I'll make good use of them.

523
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,920
This must be Joo Won's.

524
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,420
This is San Ha's, and mine, too.

525
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,160
How many did you get?

526
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,850
Mr. Yoon!

527
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:49,480
- What are you doing not closing the shop? 
 - I know, right?

528
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,390
Who is this?

529
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,930
Aren't you Hae Joon's aunt?

530
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:00,660
Hello.

531
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,360
It certainly has been a while.

532
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,700
It's still hot out. Thermal underwear?

533
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,010
So they'll sweat to death?

534
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:14,900
It's chilly in the morning and at night. It'll get colder soon.

535
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,060
It's just that I'm so ashamed.

536
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,500
I shouldn't have tried so hard to marry off Mr. Yoon.

537
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:34,080
Next to marrying my husband, it's my biggest regret in life.

538
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,730
- Madam. 
 - What?

539
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,840
I'll be leaving.

540
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,360
Thank you for these. I appreciate them. They'll make good use of them.

541
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,650
Be careful with the steps there.

542
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:51,560
I won't escort you. Get home safely.

543
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:55,940
Thermal underwear? After dumping the child on you for ten years?

544
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:59,580
Thermal underwear? Aigoo, what a joke.

545
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:08,280
He wasn't dumped on me. I took him in.

546
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,050
Please don't be so harsh.

547
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:15,230
She came to take Hae Joon many times.

548
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,520
I didn't let him go.

549
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,730
Auntie.

550
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,500
It's you! When did you get here?

551
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,300
- Are you coming home from school? 
 - Yes.

552
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,990
You're almost due! Why did you come all the way here?

553
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,270
I could have come to you.

554
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,610
The bus is still running.

555
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,130
I have money.

556
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,420
This is Joo Won's dad's money.

557
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,200
Yes,

558
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,880
but I saved up my allowance.

559
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,190
Still, it isn't money you earned.

560
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,630
You shouldn't waste it.

561
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,480
Even though he gave it to you to spend,

562
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,690
you should repay it all when you're grown up.

563
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,820
I will.

564
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,070
That's right, you should.

565
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:32,080
Don't be a burden. Read the room.

566
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,370
I know.

567
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,190
I'll take this cab.

568
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,110
   

569
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:34,950
 Hey! Are you the child Mr. Yoon took in? 

570
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:36,190
 Yes. 

571
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,890
 Clean up nicely! 

572
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:42,910
 If you don't do it right, Mr. Yoon will send you back home. 

573
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:54,250
 Yet again. I've told you not to talk to him like that so many times. 

574
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,190
 Don't cry. 

575
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,930
 Even if you don't do things like this, you can stay here, Hae Joon. 

576
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,370
 Don't be a burden. Read the room. 

577
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,800
Wow, looks delicious!

578
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,740
Dad got the best quality meat for you all.

579
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,240
I buy it once in a blue moon (rarely).

580
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,100
Look at this color.

581
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:40,960
If it's too well done, the fat's gone, and it isn't as tasty.

582
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,450
What's wrong, Hae Joon? Don't you have an appetite?

583
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:50,080
Should I make you some crab soybean soup?

584
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:53,040
No, this is good.

585
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,590
Scallion kimchi is perfect with pork belly.

586
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,140
Here.

587
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,720
Put some garlic in the wrap.

588
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,610
This garlic isn't your average garlic. It's from the Madam's mother's house.

589
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,190
Joo Won, what's going on with you?

590
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,010
Stop picking at your food. It's unlike you. It's pork belly.

591
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,640
Devour it like you usually do.

592
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,130
I don't always have an appetite.

593
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:21,380
What? Do you even know what it's like not to have an appetite?

594
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,780
We got into a fight.

595
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:32,890
What happened?

596
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,290
A fight about what?

597
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,090
Did you throw a fit?

598
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:43,190
Do you think I always throw a fit?

599
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:47,870
I'm sure San Ha didn't get himself into trouble.

600
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,940
Yes, I just gobble up meat,

601
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,600
get in trouble, and Kim San Ha is a flawless person.

602
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,800
Good for you, good for you!

603
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,950
But still, eat some meat!

604
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,990
- Dad got it for you! 
 - I'll talk to her.

605
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:02,640
It's fine. Eat.

606
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,980
She'll be fine tomorrow.

607
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,480
There's no need to wait until tomorrow.

608
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,750
I can make her feel better quickly.

609
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,960
Are you sleeping?

610
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,610
Yes.

611
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:36,230
I'm sorry.

612
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:39,430
I was harsh.

613
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:43,240
But there's one thing I feel was unfair.

614
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,020
That isn't how you apologize.

615
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,650
How should I do it, then?

616
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:54,060
Talk about what you did wrong, not what you thought was unfair.

617
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,970
Fine.

618
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:59,240
I'm sorry. I was harsh.

619
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,340
From now on, tell us if something bad happens or when you have good news.

620
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,880
- Share everything. 
 - I already do.

621
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,630
You aren't ready to apologize.

622
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:16,670
As far as I know, I don't have a girlfriend.

623
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,210
The "Hui Joo" you speak of is probably...

624
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,360
"Probably"?

625
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,190
Kang Hae Joon's ex-girlfriend.

626
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,620
So you aren't upset with me anymore, right?

627
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,620
Eat.

628
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:01,360
It's good, right?

629
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:05,960
Aigoo, have plenty. You're just grilling.

630
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:10,170
- I'll go ahead. 
 - Okay.

631
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,100
What's going on with her? Did I do something wrong?

632
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,210
- Hui Joo. 
 - Hui...

633
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,960
What about H-Hui Joo?

634
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,950
She's sad you didn't tell her you had a girlfriend.

635
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:35,230
She's realizing she and Kang Hae Joon have a shallow relationship.

636
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:37,980
It's probably an opportunity for her to learn that.

637
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,320
We've been broken up for ages!

638
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,820
- You told her we broke up, right? 
 - Yes.

639
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,770
You told her why we broke up, right?

640
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:46,730
Why would I tell her that? She didn't even ask.

641
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:49,730
You should have! It was because of you!

642
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:51,600
What?

643
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:54,650
What?

644
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:00,400
You called me up here. Start talking.

645
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,600
I think there has been a small misunderstanding.

646
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,390
It hasn't even been three months

647
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:08,100
since you threw me out like an old shoe, saying you like Kim San Ha.

648
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:11,960
I didn't throw you out.

649
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,890
Being with someone for a short time, you can't know.

650
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:16,850
I guess San Ha could have a cute side...

651
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:20,130
Sure, I guess.

652
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:22,560
- Let's get back together. 
 - Hey!

653
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,670
Please?

654
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,900
Stop. Don't make things difficult.

655
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,900
You told me not to tell anyone about us,

656
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,870
so I really didn't tell anyone.

657
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:38,290
But I just got caught, so I'm in a tricky situation with Joo Won.

658
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:41,270
Why is that tricky?

659
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:43,510
Is there something between you and her? I thought she was your sister.

660
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:46,910
It's a problem for me!

661
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,780
I don't want to hurt her feelings.

662
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:53,000
 She wasn't dating Kim San Ha. It was Kang Hae Joon. 

663
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:57,230
What? Really? Are you sure?

664
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,190
Why are you so surprised?

665
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,690
Oh, I mean...

666
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,930
I just can't see them together.

667
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:06,420
Maybe that's why they broke up.

668
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,660
- So did they break up? 
 - Yes.

669
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,060
Still, you must have been sad they didn't tell you.

670
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:18,500
I'll just stay angry for today and forgive them tomorrow.

671
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:21,040
He must have had a reason he couldn't tell me.

672
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,530
True...

673
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,810
There's no way he didn't have a girlfriend.

674
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:29,330
She's pretty.

675
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:32,360
Why would a girl like her ever date Kang Hae Joon?

676
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:43,530
Me?

677
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,330
Are you looking at me?

678
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,180
 You. 

679
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:13,090
- What are you doing? 
 - Oh!

680
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:17,730
You're always with Joo Won, right?

681
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,780
Y-Yes.

682
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,700
What was your name again?

683
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,330
It was a really pretty name.

684
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,750
   

685
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:31,830
Oh, right! Park Dal.

686
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,340
Where's Joo Won?

687
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,620
Well...

688
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,450
- What? 
 - You're so pretty.

689
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,270
I hear that a lot.

690
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:55,510
I see it.

691
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:59,880
You know Hae Joon and I dated briefly, right?

692
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,710
- Unni, it's fine! 
 - What?

693
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:06,700
You're beautiful enough just as you are,

694
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:09,320
and deserve to be loved.

695
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:15,350
Kang Hae Joon's eyes must be messed up from playing basketball every day.

696
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:19,490
- Pardon? 
 - Unni, shake it off. Understand?

697
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:22,410
Kang Hae Joon's muscles are just for show.

698
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:23,890
They aren't from basketball.

699
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:27,170
He built them on purpose by doing push-ups at home.

700
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,460
- It isn't– 
 - It's fine.

701
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,830
He looks normal in public.

702
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:33,000
I said it isn't like that.

703
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,910
If you waver now and get back with him,

704
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:37,870
it'll be a dark chapter of your life.

705
00:48:37,870 --> 00:48:40,030
Trust me and focus on your studies.

706
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:42,620
I dumped him!

707
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,650
- What? 
 - No.

708
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:48,160
Technically, I didn't even dump him.

709
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:50,740
We were dating, then we took a break.

710
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:55,130
Hae Joon misunderstood and said that I "threw him out."
    

711
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:58,600
You threw him out?

712
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,340
Who are you to throw anyone out?

713
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,270
Why would you throw him out?

714
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:06,150
Why does he have to get dumped?

715
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,730
Why do you care?

716
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:12,480
Whether Hae Joon gets dumped or not, it's his love life.

717
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,090
Honestly, you aren't even Hae Joon's real sister.

718
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:20,190
What angers me the most is your pretending to be his sister.

719
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,510
I am his sister.

720
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:25,790
How? Hae Joon's last name is Kang, and yours...

721
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:28,220
is Yoon.

722
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:34,270
That's a paperwork issue, it's not a big—

723
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:37,510
How isn't it a big deal that you aren't family on paper?

724
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:41,380
Didn't you learn about family units in elementary school?

725
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,470
Who cares who your family is on paper?

726
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,620
If you think you're family, then you are.

727
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:49,310
Do you need a piece of paper to validate that?

728
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:54,160
Our flesh and bones all grew eating the same rice!

729
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,670
If living and eating together makes you family,

730
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:01,050
is everyone living in the same dorm all one family?

731
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:04,600
- That's different. 
 - How so?

732
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,900
So, how far does a family go?

733
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:08,660
Your cousins? Because you're blood-related?

734
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:10,370
That's right! Because we're blood-related!

735
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:13,520
How about your step-siblings by re-marriage? Adoptees?

736
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:16,160
Plenty of families aren't blood-related.

737
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:20,110
Unni, do you really think those people aren't family?

738
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,230
Seriously? For real?

739
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:27,270
Don't you know how hurtful that thinking could be to those people?

740
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:30,880
I mean, those instances are different.

741
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,290
Right. Every case is different.

742
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:36,440
I think so, too.

743
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,690
If we are done, I'll get going.

744
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,170
We aren't finished.

745
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:01,820
Wait!

746
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:06,500
Just wait a second.

747
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:19,010
I'm sorry.

748
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,410
What?

749
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:27,430
I... didn't know you hated me that much.

750
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:30,580
That's Yoon Joo Won. First year.

751
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,860
The crazy one?

752
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:34,760
She keeps insisting she's Kim San Ha and Kang Hae Joon's younger sister.

753
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,390
I heard that, too.

754
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:38,550
I heard she bullies people if she doesn't like them.

755
00:51:38,550 --> 00:51:40,610
Right, right.

756
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:45,900
No! Joo Won isn't like that.

757
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,620
Stop being excessive and get up.

758
00:51:55,630 --> 00:52:00,520
I'm speaking from experience...

759
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,050
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

760
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:04,570
Get up.

761
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:08,880
Look at your knee!

762
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,410
You're bleeding!

763
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:12,470
Look at the blood! It must hurt.

764
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:15,040
No, I didn't do that.

765
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,290
She tried to push me into the pond last time.

766
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:20,520
She's a repeat offender.

767
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:21,890
She should go to a disciplinary hearing.

768
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:26,370
You're all witnesses. Understand?

769
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,310
Let's go to the nurse's office first.

770
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:46,440
So you won't apologize, right?

771
00:52:47,590 --> 00:52:50,470
There's nothing to apologize for.

772
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:52,390
She isn't going to apologize.

773
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:54,550
She's worse than I heard.

774
00:52:54,550 --> 00:52:57,240
So mean.

775
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:00,030
She was like that to us, too...

776
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:02,880
Say you're sorry.

777
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:13,490
Sorry for what?

778
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,120
Did you push her?

779
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,890
No, I didn't push her.

780
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:27,690
Really.

781
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,640
Who saw her push her?

782
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:37,820
Anyone?

783
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:44,690
Are there people who don't know about her bullying?

784
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:46,360
What bullying?

785
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:48,670
Falling into the pond?

786
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:51,690
Do you want me to explain how that happened right now?

787
00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:56,470
I can report spreading rumors to bully someone as school violence, right?

788
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,310
Plus, Hui Joo, you're going to Seoul National University next year.

789
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:04,010
You wouldn't want to bother with a school violence disciplinary hearing.

790
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,220
Right?

791
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,340
I didn't say anything.

792
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:19,950
Then, we are settled.

793
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:21,550
Let's go.

794
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,490
♫  Back then, we were the world  ♫

795
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:30,770
♫  Everything existed for us  ♫

796
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:32,800
What? Say I'm sorry?

797
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:37,830
♫  Like the sun in the clearest summer sky  ♫

798
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:47,340
♫  Those shattering days when we lived for each other  ♫

799
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,560
Wow, cheonggukjang!* 
  (TN: Korean fermented soybean stew) 

800
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:51,350
Wow!

801
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,950
Wow, delicious.

802
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:56,780
Are the children eating on their own?

803
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,540
Enjoy!

804
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:03,950
Hae Joon is the MVP* today. 
  (TN: Most Valuable Player) 

805
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,850
They're too old to still be fighting.

806
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:08,560
There's no age limit to fighting.

807
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:11,580
It would be unhealthy to never fight.

808
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,070
Right.

809
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:17,830
That's why you guys fought all the time.

810
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:19,670
In front of the child, too.

811
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:24,380
Why do you keep talking about things from a decade ago?

812
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:28,350
To be more specific, we didn't fight. I just took it all.

813
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:31,300
If we had fought properly, maybe...

814
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,790
You'll have a beer, right?

815
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:39,160
I have mugs cooling in the fridge.

816
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:40,680
Okay.

817
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:45,170
I got both fried and marinated chicken.

818
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,510
So?

819
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:51,910
She said if we were a real family, we would have papers.

820
00:55:51,910 --> 00:55:53,920
She said I was a fake sibling.

821
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,850
Wow. You heard all that from Hae Joon's ex-girlfriend?

822
00:55:56,850 --> 00:55:58,260
Right?

823
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,200
So I told her

824
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:03,400
I don't need validation from a piece of paper.

825
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,950
I don't think the legal adoption is as important as I thought.

826
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:14,160
Drumstick.

827
00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:37,980
Hey, isn't this a little weak?

828
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,640
She even got called a fake sister.

829
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,100
That's right.

830
00:56:48,430 --> 00:56:51,510
Stop making my surprise feel meaningless.

831
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,910
Don't you ever do anything wrong?

832
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:59,280
A surprise? What surprise?

833
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:13,050
Ta-da!

834
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:16,740
Do you want to have this and stop being angry? Or do you want to skip it and stay angry?

835
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,410
I'll stop. I'll stop!

836
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:21,760
I'm not angry anymore. I haven't been angry in a while!

837
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,360
Just like that?

838
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,500
Don't get it all over your face.

839
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:37,360
I'm fine.

840
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,310
Not you!

841
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:59,650
Fine, fine.

842
00:58:04,990 --> 00:58:07,300
   

843
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:12,170
- Have some. 
 - What is it?

844
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:15,280
You were so brave yesterday.

845
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,790
I was shocked and fumbling, but you stepped in and said, "No."

846
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:23,110
It's hard to defend yourself on your own.

847
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:41,760
So I don't know if you remember, but...

848
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:47,620
Remember the thing you said you'd repay me for?

849
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:50,830
Yes! Of course, I do.

850
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:54,190
What are you thinking? I'll do everything I can.

851
00:58:55,700 --> 00:59:00,070
Can you take me to the next basketball game?

852
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:03,290
You must go cheer him on as his sister.

853
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,930
"Basketball"? Why would I go to basketball?

854
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:08,500
It's no fun.

855
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:15,890
But why?

856
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:18,480
Think again!

857
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,960
No. Never!

858
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,140
Hey! Think again!

859
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,270
- Are you going home? 
 - Bye!

860
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:26,770
Bye. Take care.

861
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,160
Hey, Hae Joon, come here for a second.

862
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,840
- Go ahead. 
 - Bye!

863
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,100
The digital camera you dropped off with us,

864
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:39,840
the owner came to pick it up.

865
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,950
Just like that?

866
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:43,500
Yes. He was looking for someone.

867
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,420
The photos looked normal.

868
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:51,030
The principal told me to give it to him and get his contact info, so I did.

869
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:53,220
   

870
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,790
- So you know. 
 - Okay.

871
00:59:54,790 --> 00:59:56,660
Bye now.

872
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:04,690
 Didn't you say your mom is in Seoul? 

873
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:07,150
 Maybe your mom sent him. 

874
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:24,000
Mom...

875
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,890
Mom!

876
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:42,400
What?

877
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:45,120
I was mistaken.

878
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,430
- I'm sorry. 
 - What was that?

879
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:49,390
I'm sorry!

880
01:01:07,650 --> 01:01:09,930
Aren't you Joo Won's friend?

881
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:14,000
Yes. H-Hello.

882
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,320
Dal, right?

883
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:19,480
Yes, I'm Dal.

884
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:25,300
- Did you just hear that? 
 - No.

885
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:30,110
Okay. Good, then.

886
01:01:42,810 --> 01:01:44,410
Pardon?

887
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:49,260
If you didn't hear it, instead of "No,"

888
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,810
you would have said, "What," right?

889
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,090
Dal, do you have a minute?

890
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:08,850
Dal, do you have hand tremors?

891
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,600
Yes, it's severe.

892
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,840
Eat.

893
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:23,790
Thank you.

894
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,110
Remember the movie where they go into space,

895
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:36,570
shoot light, and erase people's memories?

896
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,750
If I had that, I wouldn't have to say all this.

897
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:51,450
Oh, right.

898
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:59,610
You heard, right?

899
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,970
The mom thing?

900
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:03,400
Yes.

901
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:09,020
About that... Can you pretend like it didn't happen?

902
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:15,630
If you tell Joo Won that I grabbed a passerby

903
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:19,750
and yelled, "Mom!",

904
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:22,760
I would be very upset.

905
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:25,640
Okay. What?

906
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,390
"Upset"?

907
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,570
Do you mean upset?

908
01:03:30,570 --> 01:03:33,270
Yes. Upset.

909
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:47,480
Dad, what are you making? It doesn't smell like broth.

910
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:51,470
Cartilage. The stove at home isn't strong enough.

911
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:54,410
It's tasty if I make it on the restaurant stove.

912
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:56,780
It's Kang Hae Joon's favorite again.

913
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:00,500
He plays sports! He needs to eat well.

914
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:03,440
It isn't just for Hae Joon.

915
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,740
San Ha, you should have some, too.

916
01:04:05,740 --> 01:04:07,180
Yes.

917
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:13,250
Don't you feel like we are Kang Hae Joon's parasites sometimes?

918
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:19,310
Last time, he let only Kang Hae Joon drink the spring water.

919
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:24,270
I drank some of that, too.

920
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:36,580
   

921
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,860
See? They're done.

922
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:16,120
Just wait. Let me set something up soon.

923
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:20,650
I don't understand it, but...

924
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:23,660
Class President, if it's what you want,

925
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:27,800
I hope what your heart wants comes true.

926
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:31,310
Let's go. Lunch is almost over.

927
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:01,940
Who...

928
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:09,970
Are you Kang Hae Joon?

929
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:12,610
Yes.

930
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:16,790
What are you doing?

931
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:20,970
I'm your...

932
01:06:22,430 --> 01:06:24,540
your...

933
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:28,650
I'm... your father.

934
01:06:28,650 --> 01:06:31,470
I'm your dad!

935
01:06:31,470 --> 01:06:34,130
Father!

936
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:56,000


937
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:04,450
♫  I must finish the race without giving up  ♫

938
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:07,160
♫  I can't afford to get tired  ♫

939
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:11,260
♫  My dreams are watching me  ♫

940
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:16,660
♫  The world keeps pushing me down  ♫

941
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:18,610
   

942
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:21,470
 I think this is for you. A letter. 

943
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:22,640
 For me? 

944
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,290
 He has a nice personality. He has many friends. 

945
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:26,640
 He's good-looking, too. 

946
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,160
 I'll start dating, too. 

947
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:30,280
 You can't tell by his appearance. 

948
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,420
 If you follow me to the U.S., you can do anything you want. 

949
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:37,260
 How can you be sure good intentions will lead to good results? 

950
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:38,760
 Don't tell Dad or Joo Won. 

951
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,120
 I disappointed you all this time, right? 

952
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:43,030
 I'll try to forgive you, too. 

953
01:07:43,030 --> 01:07:45,720
 So Hui, say hello. 

954
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:48,320
 Oppa?
