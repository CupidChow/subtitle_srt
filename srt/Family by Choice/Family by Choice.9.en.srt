[Family by Choice]

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,630
Why didn't you tell me Haejun was great at basketball?

8
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,510
I've heard that parents go crazy when their kids are lacking.

9
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:53,440
But who knew a parent could go crazy when their kids are incredible, too?

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,530
Can you face him every day while regretting not having sent him to America?

11
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,310
I'll follow that Ahjussi to America.

12
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:02,670
Mom was in an accident.

13
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,850
Sohui's dad, in the driver's seat, passed away.

14
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,390
What kind of shitty life is this?

15
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,990
You're the only one.

16
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,360
Sanha, can't you stay by your mom and Sohui's side?

17
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,810
What's keeping them?

18
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,420
Have you gone nuts?

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,090
You told her you're going to America?

23
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,580
You knew about this, Dad?

24
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,960
About Kim Sanha going to Seoul, too?

25
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:54,810
Why Seoul?

26
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,200
Because of your mom?

27
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,320
Yes.

28
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,710
I was going to tell everyone after dinner when my dad got home.

29
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,660
I don't think he'll let you go easily.

30
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,830
Yes.

31
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,600
That's all?

32
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,580
He said he's leaving home!

33
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,360
You should be telling him how ridiculous that sounds!

34
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,090
Seoul's miles away!

35
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,940
Is America a joke?

36
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,280
You should be mad at them.

40
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,620
I'll talk to her.

41
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,060
You should head down, too.

42
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,630
Haejun.

43
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,920
Sanha will make her understand.

44
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,300
She listens to Sanha.

45
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,670
Yes.

46
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,620
How could you make that decision alone?

47
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,970
That's why I came back to discuss this in person.

48
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,550
Isn't it more like notifying us?

49
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,220
You should've asked us before making a decision.

50
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,500
That's what families do.

51
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,130
You didn't even think about asking us, did you?

52
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,760
Since you have a real family.

53
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,980
Since we're not your real family.

54
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,930
Why are you bringing that up again?

55
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,090
You didn't even think about asking us since we're not your real family!

56
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,460
You don't care about us in the slightest right now.

57
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,410
You didn't even think about how my dad or I would feel

58
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:45,850
if you left, did you?

59
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,170
You only thought about your younger sister and Mom, right?

60
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,930
Can't I?

61
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:10,890
Is something wrong with me taking care of my younger sister and mom?

62

Both Kang Haejun and I will be 20 years old next year.

63
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,600
Naturally, our responsibilities will grow.

64

All right.

65
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,020
So, you're saying we're not included in your responsibilities.

66
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,020
I understand.

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,540

But Haejun's leaving, too.

74
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:40,560
We're letting him go to pursue his dream.

75
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,330
But how can we let you go when it's obvious you'll suffer?

76
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:55,380
Just last week, Mom tried to kill herself twice.

77
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,560
You and I have both lost a loved one once.

78
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,350
How can I bear it if something happens to her?

You-

80
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:13,810
Let's say we turn a blind eye and ignore her.

81
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,600
But what if something happens to her?

82
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,300
You should eat before you go.

83
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,810
- I'll get going, too.
- Sit down.

You're going to let him go?

86
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,440
I said sit down.

87
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,110
Eat up for now.

88
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,160
I'll pack some for Juwon separately.

89
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,370

Give me a bowl of beef broth.

100
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,330
If you want to feed him tomorrow, you'll have to boil the broth all night.

Good, right?

104
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:13,550
Just think the kids went to college.

105
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:20,050
Who'd return to this hick town with a college degree?

106
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:22,410
You think they're just going to college?

107
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,130
They're returning to their own family.

108
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,790
Feed them the broth and send them off,

109
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,430
and you should forget them.

110
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,190
They might be someone else's kids, but you raised them for ten years.

111
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:45,840
It's natural to feel lonely after sending them off.

112
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,440
But they're leaving in the end.

113
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,910
I'm telling you so you don't wait painstakingly for their return.

- Tomorrow.
- That soon?

Your brother is in the office submitting an application for Seoul National University.

121
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:24,410
And your other brother says he's pursuing basketball in America.

122
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:26,250
Weren't they going to attend Myungju University?

123
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,900
America?

124
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,500
It's okay! Distance makes the heart grow fonder.

125
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,850
I grew closer to my older sister after she went to college in Seoul.

126
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:39,500
That might be in your case.

127
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,510
Huh?

128
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:44,430
You're her real family.

129
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,080
We're not a real family. It's different.

130
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,600
I mean, you always said you're family, and I could see it, too.

131
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,140
I insisted that we are.

132
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,040
You all knew they weren't my real brothers.

133
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,820
Is this a surprise that only I wasn't aware of?

134
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,940
I heard you submitted an application to Seoul National University.

135
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:24,670
Have a good vacation, and I'll see you at school next year.

136
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,490
We'll stick together for six years.

137
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,090
I have to accept that we need to be apart for a little while.

138
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,000
The entire school knows you like Kang Haejun.

139
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,730
I heard he's going to America.

140
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,610
Such a distance is hard for me, too.

141
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,510
Don't you know the saying, "Out of sight, out of mind"?

142
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,110
Why is that so important?

143
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,140
If that's how you feel, you never liked him that much to begin with.

144
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,140
Go by yourself.

145
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,060
It's not something I can resolve by myself.

146
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,050
We both need to be present so she can feel better.

147
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,300
She even went to Seoul in case you were suffering by yourself.

148
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,330
You can't even make it to the 10th-grade classroom?

149
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,310
- Seoul?
- Yes, Seoul!

150
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,570
Went to Seoul with whom?

151
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,100
Alone.

152
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,070
You let her go to Seoul alone?

153
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,620
Why are you telling me that now?

154
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,780
I'll go by myself, so stay out of this.

155
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:39,860
She left early? When?

156
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,530
Just now. About three minutes ago.

157
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,490
Eat this. Or you can give it to Haejun.

158
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,990
I'm only going to give this to him.

159
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,280
Why? Because I was told to!

160
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:10,810
Wait. Can't I just give this to Juwon?

161
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,530
Fine. I'll bid him farewell while giving him this.

162
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:18,990
We're close enough to do that.

163
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:20,610
Hey!

164
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,530
Are you okay?

165
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:38,300
Are you okay?

166
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,810
I asked you first.

167
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,660
I'm okay.

168
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,890
Be more careful.

169
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:51,560
Sorry.

170
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,680
These are our containers.

171
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,750
Juwon went home early.

172
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,350
She didn't eat before she left?

173
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,400
I'll take it.

174
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,790
I think you should eat this right away.

175
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,550
I heard you're going to America.

176
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:26,950
Yeah.

177
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,610
When?

178
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,220
From here?

179
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,230
I leave here tomorrow.

180
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,340
Since things turned out this way, you should confess your feelings.

181
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,750
What feelings?

182
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,310
Tell Kim Sanha how you feel.

183
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,920
And if I do?

184
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,090
He'll probably reject you.

185
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:58,770
But at least you'll have no regrets.

186
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,740
Am I not attractive?

187
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,200
No way!

188
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,670
You're smart, kind,

189
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,780
and you can keep a secret.

190
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,120
Kim Sanha and I both know you're a good person.

191
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,120
But you're his younger sister's friend.

192
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,110
Which makes you his younger sister.

193
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,600
How could that be...

194
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:30,840
I'm really sorry about that.

195
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,070
This will all pass.

196
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,690
Just wait and see. Some incredible man might appear in your life tomorrow.

197
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,640
"Kim Sanha?"

198
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,770
"Who's that?"

199
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,670
That's what you'll say.

200
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,430
Here.

201
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
See you around!

202
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,340
Don't let your mom stress you out too much!

203
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:10,660
Eat well, sleep well,

204
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,710
and be well.

205
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,900
I'm off.

206
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,820
Go!

207
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,810
Take care!

208
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,780
If he can't catch onto how I feel, he could at least stop smiling at me.

209
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,910
Why did he block the ball, then?

210
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,800
Do you feel better after eating these things?

211
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,430
No.

212
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,510
You're right.

213
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:27,010
I have no memory of my mom.

214
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,150
I saw photos of her, but I can't remember anything.

215
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,220
Even if the townspeople felt bad for me for having no mom,

216
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,850
I couldn't really understand why they felt that way.

217
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,430
Since I never thought not having a mom stopped me from

218
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,760
doing something or made me feel lacking.

219
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,050
Since Dad did everything for me.

220
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,100
Since...

221
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:06,030
it's only natural for the two of us to live together.

222
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,450
But then you guys showed up.

223
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,610
I loved it.

224
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,060
It used to be just the two of us eating.

225
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,980
But when there were five of us at the table,

226
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:28,210
even if each person only said a few words,

227
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,500
there was so much to talk about.

228
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,860
And I didn't have to go home to an empty house.

229
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:45,640
There were plenty of people telling me to eat.

230
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,800
Now, all of that feels natural.

231
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:55,820
I naturally thought we'd live like this forever.

232
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,780
When I return,

233
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,530
I'll do that.

234
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,350
Everything you want.

235
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,300
Can't you stay?

236
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,560
I'll come back on holidays.

237
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,150
If I can't make it,

238
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,200
I'll call you every day.

239
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,740
What use is that?

240
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,550
When I return,

241
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,680
I'll never leave again.

242
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:01,220
♫ As I've always done ♫

243
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:11,070
♫ I'll always be with you like my breath ♫

244
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,720
You're home?

245
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,720
What?

246
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,890
You used a fortune.

247
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,340
How did you know?

248
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,450
I used up my entire savings.

249
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,930
You have a rich dad now, is that it?

250
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,080
This is just pocket money now, huh?

251
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,940
Hey.

252
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:20,850
What?

253
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,070
What are you doing?

254
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,470
It's not like you're taking these to America.

255
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,380
Give them to me.

256
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,830
This, too.

257
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,220
What use do you have for them?

258
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,940
That, too.

259
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,810
Hey, this is something I used to use.

260
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,130
Just take good care of it until I return.

261
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,660
See? I'm giving you everything.

262
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,000
Are you coming back?

263
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:05,930
Pray that I don't come back, and I'll still return.

264
00:23:05,930 --> 00:23:08,760
Why would I go through the trouble?

265
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,960
Hey, but this is a bit-

266
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,360
I need hair wax!

267
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,410
- Why do you need wax? Give it back.
- Hey! Hey!

268
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,990
- Buy one in America!
- I need it.

269
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:23,110
Eat American jelly!

270
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,560
They have a lot of delicious stuff there.

271
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,270
Why aren't you sleeping yet?

272
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,750
Why? You can't sleep?

273
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,680
Drink this tea.

274
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,060
All kids leave home when they're grown up.

275
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:39,400
How long could you live with me?

276
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,570
Even so,

277
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,860
I learned everything from you.

278
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,130
Bicycling,

279
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,500
shaving,

280
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,300
and basketball.

281
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,020
Shoot!

282
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,180
Whoa, he's good.

283
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,480
Right?

284
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,860
I never even taught him properly, but look at that clean form.

285
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,960
I guess he takes after his dad.

286
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,790
Of course.

287
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,690
Once I'm finished with school,

288
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,500
I'll return right away.

289
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,730
I'll make it big and return

290
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:54,440
to treat you and Juwon really well.

291
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:09,880
I'm not sending you there to make it big and return.

292
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,950
I'm sending you there to do what you want to your heart's content.

293
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,460
Don't try too hard over there.

294
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,390
Come back whenever if you think

295
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,700
you've done enough.

296
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,900
Okay?

297
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:35,450
All right?

298
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,250
Hey, just have some.

299
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,300
I feel better now.

300
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:25,510
♫ However, time is still ♫

301
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:28,480
♫ Never thought... ♫

302
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:36,070
♫ Everything is perfect prayer ♫

303
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:42,650
♫ Fire 'cause I cry ♫

304
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,800
Eat what I gave you.

305
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,660
You can have mine.

306
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:08,060
♫ Looking far ahead, I would feel her like that ♫

307
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:18,490
♫ How much I miss this ♫

308
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:25,960
♫ How much I miss this ♫

309
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:35,250
♫ Now it's time to forward beyond the sunrise ♫

310
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,710
Why? She's not answering?

311
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,360
I can just call her later.

312
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:44,060
Here.

313
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:51,170
Stash it away and use it when you need it.

314
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,500
Thank you.

315
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,260
What about me?

316
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:59,570
What money do you need when you're just going to Seoul?

317
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:01,310
Let's go. We'll be late for the train.

318
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,650
All right.

319
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,570
Always watch out for cars.

320
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:09,050
- And don't skip out on breakfast.
- Okay.

321
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,830
Always turn off the light before sleeping.

322
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:12,870
And drink lots of water.

323
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,080
Ahjussi.

324
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,180
Go on.

325
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,120
Wear your seatbelts.

326
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,090
Drive slowly.

327
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,510
Call me when you guys arrive!

328
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:35,140
You were home?

329
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,810
I'm hungry. Give me food.

330
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:54,780
You still should've seen them off.

331
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,600
Seasoned cucumbers.

332
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,020
Rice.

333
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:24,780
- You mean you can still eat more?
- Hey, hey.

334
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,510
Be quiet.

335
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:41,920
♫ One day, a precious memory ♫

336
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,410
See?

337
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,770
You already regret it.

338
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,060
If I say bye,

339
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,320
it seems like they're really leaving.

340
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:02,670
If I say goodbye,

341
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:07,890
it'll seem like we're really parting ways.

342
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:15,500
♫ We loved all those days ♫

343
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:22,380
♫ We were just young with our hearts racing back then ♫

344
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:32,690
♫ We were consoling each other as if arguing without knowing why ♫

345
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:41,910
♫ We probably didn't know what love meant ♫

346
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:45,460
♫ So we couldn't tell each other ♫

347
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,200
Thank you. Have a good day.

348
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,320
Yes, thank you.

349
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:57,920
♫ Words that always made us sad and worried ♫

350
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:07,950
♫ I'll tell you instead that I love you ♫

351
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:11,950
♫ That day when we met ♫

352
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:21,810
♫ From the day that you came to me in this world ♫

353
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:29,890
♫ We probably didn't know what love meant ♫

354
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:33,640
♫ So we couldn't tell each other ♫

355
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,830
♫ Every day, like that ♫

356
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,670
I'm going to sleep now.

357
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,860
Me, too.

358
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,580
The air in Seoul is so polluted.

359
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,490
I can't even breathe.

360
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,370
Don't copy me.

361
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:50,180
LOL.

362
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,130
I get to eat both drumsticks from now on.

367
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:11,500
Why? Did you think I'd offer you honey tea or something?

368
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,040
Why not?

369
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,810
Didn't you drink so you could feel awful?

370
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,550
Madam told me

371
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:59,790
to send the kids without expecting them to return.

372
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,950
That if they do well living with their birth families,

373
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:08,680
then it's all my blessings.

374
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,860
She's right.

375
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:24,000
If they live a good life with their birth parents,

376
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:27,230
it's my blessing.

377
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,600
But...

378
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,300
what if I miss them?

379
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:40,540
Sanha is my flesh and blood,

380
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:43,600
so he'll return eventually.

381
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,950
As for Haejun...

382
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,450
he will return even if we tell him not to.

383
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:06,220
He's going to correct his last name to Yang Heejun over there.

384
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,730
I never cared what his surname was until now.

385
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:16,730
People are so fickle.

386
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,210
I feel jealous now that I think about him changing his surname to his dad's.

387
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,770
He calls himself a dad?

388
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,920
He doesn't even know what Haejun likes or dislikes.

389
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,620
Why is that man his dad and not me?

390

Going through andropause?

391
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,130
Why the sudden dramatics?

392
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,980
Even if that man takes Haejun,

393
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:54,110
he'll never know what Haejun likes or dislikes.

394
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:58,840
I can tell by looking at his face.

395
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,560
Even if he took him when he was younger,

396
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,640
he's the type that would've neglected him.

397
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,830
Caretaking isn't cut out for everyone.

398
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,980
He hasn't even served in the military.

399
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,020
He knows nothing of this world.

400
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:34,680
How do you think he felt about leaving?

401
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:40,190
He probably left thinking it's better to suffer physically than emotionally.

402
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,520

Why wouldn't I know? I'm the one who brewed him jujube tea.

406
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,690
You should've brewed him jujube tea if he was your son.

540
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:37,000
Like a daughter and son...

541
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,150
Then these two are siblings, right?

542
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:42,570
If you're family-

543
00:50:42,570 --> 00:50:44,660
We're not family.

544
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:50,280
Do you know me?

545
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:26,810
Yes, Professor.

546
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:32,320
Yes. I'll visit you before I start work.

547
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,790
Yes.

548
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:44,920
[Out picking cherries]

549
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:05,360
Yoon Juwon!

550
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,420
[Statement]
You must listen carefully.

551
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:21,570
It's hard to prove an attempt at robbery,

552
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:24,420
but this is clearly trespassing.

553
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,950
He only attempted because I stopped him.

554
00:52:27,950 --> 00:52:31,400
I stopped him from committing the crime, so why does he benefit from it?

555
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,480
No, that's not what happened.

556
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,840
That's why you should've contacted her all this time.

557
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,220
What about assault? Doesn't assault apply?

558
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:43,700
That was by accident while trying to run away.

559
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,600
You hit me more.

560
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,090
W-Where? Where did she hit you?

561
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:50,200
- Did she get you good?
- Here...

562
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,930
Who are you worrying about right now?

563
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,810
Yoon Juwon.

564
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:08,350
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere? Let me see.

565
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,090
Kim Sanha?

566
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,240
I'm fine.

567
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,130
You- You rascal.

568
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:22,700
Ahjussi. Dad, you were here.

569
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:26,740
And what are you doing here?

570
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,920
Let's not do this here.

571
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:32,950
Let's talk at home.

572
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:34,420
Is today some special day?

573
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,160
Y-Yeah, let's c-clear things up and-

574
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,700
W-Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait.

575
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,590
So, earlier,

576
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:44,950
these two...

577
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,680
called him "dad."

578
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,250
And he called you "dad."

579
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:53,960
These two are strangers.

580
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,780
Then what are you two?

581
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:05,190
The man who just arrived, you're not related to the victim, are you?

582
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:07,030
We're not related.

583
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:10,750
Yes, we're not family.

584
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:13,130
We just used to live together.

585
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:17,140
Aren't we strangers if we haven't seen each other for ten years?

586
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,810
How could you talk to your brothers like that, no matter how upset you were?

587
00:54:24,810 --> 00:54:26,180
Why not?

588
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,630
They're not strangers.

589
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,870
Juwon's not wrong.

590
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:38,160
You didn't visit once for ten years.

591
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:43,140
Look. They grew so many gray hairs while you two never showed up.

592
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:44,830
They're old already!

593
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:46,330
I'm not!

594
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,450
Don't I have enough hair for my age?

595
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:53,290
Of course! It's still luscious and full of black hair.

596
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,840
I still called regularly.

597
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,850
You just never answered.

598
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:05,010
- Me?
- You haven't called or texted for years.

599
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:09,100
I was discharged last week from the military, so I haven't got a phone yet.

600
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,860
- You what?
- What?

601
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,900
I visited the store a few times over the week.

602
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:27,630
But when I thought about it,

603
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:31,650
I didn't even graduate from college

604
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:33,380
and quit basketball, too.

605
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:36,630
I didn't know what to say.

606
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:39,350
What about before the military?

607
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:42,210
You should've contacted me when you came to Korea.

608
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,030
I would've at least visited you.

609
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:46,110
You must've gotten leaves, too.

610
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:48,170
You could've called us, then.

611
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:51,210
I kept pushing it, and it got harder to do.

612
00:55:51,210 --> 00:55:54,000
Forget it! Let's hurry up and go home. We'll talk at home.

613
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,610
Yes. Let's go home and talk since you must be tired.

614
00:55:57,610 --> 00:55:59,740
I need to go to the store.

615
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:01,980
Why? Come with us.

616
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:06,630
She needs to clean up because someone made a mess.

617
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,320
Should I come with you, then?

618
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:12,180
It's fine. We met after ten years, so you should go home and catch up.

619
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:14,620
Yes, then. Clean up and come right away.

620
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:15,890
Let's go.

621
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:17,510
I'll see you at home.

622
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:22,800
I brought my car. Let me drop you off.

623
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:25,670
It's fine. You must be tired from driving. Don't bother.

624
00:56:25,670 --> 00:56:27,210
I can just take the cab.

625
00:56:27,210 --> 00:56:29,030
I'll see you later at home.

626
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:55,740
Hey, what's going on?

627
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,610
You're not hurt anywhere, right?

628
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:00,080
Nope.

629
00:57:04,150 --> 00:57:05,650
Are you happy?

630
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:08,310
Why would I be happy?

631
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:10,330
Kang Haejun- I mean,

632
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:12,320
he's Yang Haejun now.

633
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,290
Your first love came back. Aren't you happy?

634
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:17,150
That was ages ago.

635
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:19,550
I can't even remember his face.

636
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:22,980
Why did you come back to the store?

637
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,370
I can just clean up here.

638
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:28,930
Your brothers came after ten years, which calls for a teary reunion.

639
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:30,430
We already had a teary reunion.

640
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:33,030
They were just different kinds of tears.

641
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:39,350
I'll finish cleaning up here so you can go home.

642
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:42,800
It's fine. Four hands will be faster than two.

643
00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:45,690
You don't want to go?

644
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:49,130
It's not that I don't want to go.

645
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:56,170
It's not like I never imagined my brothers returning.

646
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:58,070
But...

647
00:57:58,070 --> 00:57:59,650
But?

648
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,250
I'm not as happy as I thought I'd be.

649
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:07,060
- Why?
- They're surely the Kim Sanha

650
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:11,520
and the Kang- I mean, Yang Haejun I know.

651
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,000
But they feel like strangers for some odd reason.

652
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,280
They smell a bit different, too.

653
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:20,780
Are you a dog? Why'd you smell them?

654
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:27,530
Ten years passed, you know.

655
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:30,060
Of course, you'd feel awkward and strange.

656
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:35,390
Even blood relatives feel awkward if you haven't met them for a while.

657
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:37,520
- Really?
- Yes.

658
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:06,380
It's still the same.

659
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:15,360
Still the same, right?

660
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:20,470
Mr. Yoon didn't let anyone touch your room and Haejun's.

661
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:23,880
So, you two can come and sleep over anytime.

662
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,310
I came too late, didn't I?

663
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:28,550
All that matters is you came.

664
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:46,940
I'm a distant relative.

665
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,720
I'm the in-law's third cousin's niece.

666
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:51,110
I feel awkward to see my relatives after a long time,

667
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:53,180
but I'm really glad to see them.

668
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:56,480
Let's go.

669
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:06,480
All right. Here's your rice.

670
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,900
You, too.

671
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:27,050
There isn't much on the table, but let's start eating.

672
01:00:27,050 --> 01:00:30,020
- Thank you for the food!
- Yes.

673
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:50,090
Why? Weren't you going to eat that?

674
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:51,590
Yes.

675
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,790
Thanks.

676
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,090
If you had given me a heads-up about coming, I would've gone grocery shopping.

677
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:02,670
How is it? Is it to your liking?

678
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:04,670
It's so delicious that I can't stand it.

679
01:01:04,670 --> 01:01:06,840
Eat slowly. Take your time.

680
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,750
There's a lot.

681
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,950
Gosh, you look great, Sanha.

682
01:01:12,950 --> 01:01:15,830
You can get married now.

683
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:18,440
- You're not dating anyone?
- Not yet.

684
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:22,720
A third-year resident doesn't have time to date. He barely gets any sleep.

685
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,080
- It's better than my first and second years.
- Yes.

686
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:32,120
Let me think about this. Hey, did we have any beer at home?

687
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,900
Yes, we do!

688
01:01:45,370 --> 01:01:47,030
What about mine?

689
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:50,040
You drink alcohol, too?

690
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:56,160
She's all grown up now. Think of her age.

691
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,190
All right. One for you.

692
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:01,720
- Juwon, too.
- Yes.

693
01:02:03,230 --> 01:02:05,380
- You, too.
- Thank you.

694
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,480
- Dad.
- Yes.

695
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,220
Allow me.

696
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:21,410
Man, it's just like ten years ago since we're all sitting together like this.

697
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:25,220
Since we all got together like this, let's make a toast.

698
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:28,690
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

699
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:33,190
It's nice to see you.

700
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:38,680
What?

701
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:40,990
It's nothing.

702
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:52,120
[Attorney Dal]

703
01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:02,010
- Yes.
- Is it going well?

704
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:04,880
Not everyone can be an in-law's third cousin's daughter.

705
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,280
Did you ask when they're leaving?

706
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:10,310
Well, I'll need to ask now.

707
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:13,100
Tell them to visit your store before they leave.

708
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:16,490
Why? You said you don't even remember Yang Haejun's face.

709
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:18,400
Well, I mean...

710
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,390
I'm just curious.

711
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:22,380
Just wait for now.

712
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:28,020
The cherries are in season, so they taste great. Help yourselves.

713
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:33,100
You're right. They're pretty good.

714
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:36,840
- Aren't they good?
- They're delicious.

715
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,130
Join us.

716
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:44,060
Did you two agree to come over?

717
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:46,640
- How did you two come together like this?
- Seriously.

718
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:50,780
We decided to come together since it's Juwon's birthday.

719
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,610
Why for my birthday?

720
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:57,150
We plan to spend birthdays together from now on.

721
01:03:57,150 --> 01:03:58,910
What does that mean?

722
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:04,210
Well, the two of us...

723
01:04:04,210 --> 01:04:06,660
moved back for good.

724
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:10,400
We're not going anywhere now.

725
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:12,090
That's why we're here.

726
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:14,470
- What?
- You aren't leaving?

727
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:18,520
We're really not leaving.

728
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:21,860
They aren't leaving.

729
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:29,830
Wow, my daughter's birthday will be a noisy one this year, right?

730
01:04:32,900 --> 01:04:34,760
Who said you can?

731
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:39,880
♫ Like the flowery path ♫

732
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,900
♫ Everything existed for us ♫

733
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:43,720
[Family by Choice]

734
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:49,160
♫ Like the sun in the clearest summer sky ♫

735
01:04:49,160 --> 01:05:01,160
♫ We were shining so brightly and so united ♫
