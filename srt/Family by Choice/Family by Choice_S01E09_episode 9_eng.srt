1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:11,420


2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,000
   

3
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:19,040
   

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,620
   

5
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,860
   

6
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:31,860
   

7
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,000
   

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,030
 Why didn't you tell me Hae Joon was great at basketball? 

9
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,010
 I've heard parents go crazy when their children are lacking. 

10
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,840
 But who knew a parent could go crazy when their children are incredible, too? 

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,030
 Can you face him every day while regretting not having sent him to America? 

12
00:00:58,030 --> 00:01:01,010
 I'll follow that Ahjusshi to America. 

13
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,170
 Mom was in an accident. 

14
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:06,350
 So Hui's dad, in the driver's seat, passed away. 

15
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,890
 What kind of ill-fated life is this? 

16
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,390
 You're the only one. 

17
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,860
 San Ha, can't you stay with your mom and So Hui? 

18
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,410
Why aren't they coming?

19
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,920
Have you gone crazy?

20
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,500
What?

21
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,800
What's going on?

22
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,720
Dad.

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,590
Did you tell her you're going to America?

24
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,180
Did you know about this, Dad?

25
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,560
About Kim San Ha going to Seoul, too?

26
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,310
Why Seoul?

27
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,800
Is it because of your mom?

28
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,160
Yes.

29
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,310
I planned to tell everyone after dinner when my dad got home.

30
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:13,360
I don't think he will let you go easily.

31
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,430
Yes.

32
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,200
Is that all?

33
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,080
He plans to leave home!

34
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,660
You should scold them for being so ridiculous.

35
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,580
Seoul is miles away.

36
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,490
Is America a joke?

37
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,680
You should be angry at them.

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,290
Has...

39
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,020
Has everyone gone crazy?

40
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,600
I'll...

41
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:41,320
I'll talk to her.

42
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,660
You should head down, too.

43
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,230
Hae Joon.

44
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,420
San Ha will help her understand.

45
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,660
She listens to San Ha.

46
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,170
Yes.

47
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,120
 How could you make that decision alone? 

48
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,370
That's why I returned to discuss this in person.

49
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,050
Isn't it more like notifying us?

50
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,720
You should've asked us before making a decision.

51
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,100
That's what families do.

52
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,630
You didn't consider asking us, did you?

53
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,360
Since you have a real family somewhere else.

54
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:31,890
Since we aren't your real family.

55
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,430
Why are you bringing that up again?

56
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,590
You didn't even consider asking us since we aren't your real family.

57
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,960
You don't care about us in the slightest right now.

58
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,910
You didn't even think about how my dad or I would feel

59
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,350
if you left, did you?

60
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:49,670
You only thought about your younger sister and mom, right?

61
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,530
Can't I?

62
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:11,490
Is something wrong with me taking care of my younger sister and mom?

63
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,810
Kang Hae Joon and I will be 20 years old next year.

64
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,200
Naturally, our responsibilities will grow.

65
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,080
All right.

66
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,880
So you're saying we aren't part of your responsibilities.

67
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,620
I understood it all well.

68
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:48,740
What's the matter? What's the matter?

69
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,510
Hey, Joo Won. Open the door. Aren't you eating?

70
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,220
   

71
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,380
You can't. You can't go to Seoul.

72
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:35,120
I'll talk to your uncle. End of discussion.

73
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,290
But Hae Joon is leaving, too.

74
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:41,160
We are letting him go to pursue his dream.

75
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,930
But how can we let you go when it's obvious you'll suffer?

76
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,880
Just last week, Mom tried to kill herself twice.

77
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,060
You and I have both lost a loved one once.

78
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,950
How can I bear it if something happens to her?

79
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,390
You...

80
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:14,310
Let's say we turn a blind eye and ignore her.

81
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,200
But what if something happens to her?

82
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,560
   

83
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,800
You should eat before you go.

84
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,310
- I'll get going, too. 
 - Sit down.

85
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,470
How much longer will you get to eat a home-cooked meal?

86
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,070
Will you let him go?

87
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,040
I said sit down.

88
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,610
Eat up for now.

89
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,660
I'll pack some for Joo Won separately.

90
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:37,870
 This is all because of you. 

91
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,260
Keep building your karma with that mouth of yours.

92
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,200
Hey.

93
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,430
Mind your own business.

94
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,710
Darn it.

95
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:13,610
   
   

96
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,150
Mr. Yoon. I'm here.

97
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,740
I bought some sagol* and 6 kg of loose bones. 
  (TN: Beef bone broth) 

98
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,040
They're good items you can't get without connections like me.

99
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,660
Yes, thank you.

100
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,940
Give me a bowl of beef broth.

101
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:44,830
If you want to feed him tomorrow, you must boil the broth all night.

102
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,650
Gosh, it's refreshing.

103
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,040
Good, right?

104
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:14,150
Just think the children went to college.

105
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:20,550
Who'd return to this rural town with a college degree?

106
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:22,910
Do you think they're just going to college?

107
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,630
They're returning to their own families.

108
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,290
Feed them the broth and send them off,

109
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,030
and you should forget them.

110
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:42,790
They might be someone else's children, but you raised them for ten years.

111
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,340
It's natural to feel lonely after sending them off.

112
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,940
They're bound to leave anyway.

113
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:54,310
I'm telling you so you don't wait painstakingly for their return.

114
00:09:54,310 --> 00:10:00,130
What parent out there doesn't have heartaches while raising children?

115
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,740
Goodness...

116
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,000
Why do I feel so sad?

117
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,430
 When? 

118
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:15,040
- Tomorrow. 
 - That soon?

119
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,460
Hey.

120
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,050
Your brother is in the office submitting an application for Seoul National University.

121
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:24,910
And your other brother says he's pursuing basketball in America.

122
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:26,750
Weren't they going to attend Myungju University?

123
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,500
"America"?

124
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:34,000
It's okay. Distance makes the heart grow fonder.

125
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,350
I grew closer to my unni after she went to college in Seoul.

126
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,000
That might be in your case.

127
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,910
What?

128
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:44,930
You're her real family.

129
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,680
We aren't a real family. It's different.

130
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,130
I mean, you always said you're family, and I could see it, too.

131
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,640
I insisted that we were.

132
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,540
You all knew they weren't my real brothers.

133
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,320
Is it a surprise that only I wasn't aware?

134
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,440
I heard you submitted an application to Seoul National University.

135
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:25,170
Have a good vacation, and I'll see you at school next year.

136
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,890
We will stick together for six years.

137
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:30,590
I must accept we need to be apart for a little while.

138
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,500
The entire school knows you like Kang Hae Joon.

139
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:36,230
I heard he's going to America.

140
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,110
Such a distance is hard for me, too.

141
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:43,010
Don't you know the saying, "Out of sight, out of mind"?

142
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,710
Why is that so important?

143
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:53,640
If that's how you feel, then you never liked him that much to begin with.

144
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:07,640
Go by yourself.

145
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,460
It's not something I can resolve by myself.

146
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,550
We both need to be present so she can feel better.

147
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,800
She even went to Seoul in case you were struggling.

148
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,830
Can't you even make it to the Grade 10 classroom?

149
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,810
- "Seoul"? 
 - Yes, Seoul.

150
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,070
She went to Seoul with whom?

151
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,600
Alone.

152
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,570
You let her go to Seoul alone?

153
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,220
Why are you telling me that now?

154
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,380
I'll go by myself, so stay out of this.

155
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,260
 Did she leave early? When? 

156
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,430
Just now. About three minutes ago.

157
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,090
Eat this. Or you can give it to Hae Joon.

158
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,490
I'm just going to give this to him.

159
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,880
Why? Because I was told to.

160
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:11,310
Wait. Can't I just give this to Joo Won?

161
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:17,930
Fine. I'll bid him farewell while giving him this.

162
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,490
We are close enough to do that.

163
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:21,110
Hey!

164
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,030
Are you okay?

165
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,800
Are you okay?

166
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,410
I asked you first.

167
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,360
I'm okay.

168
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,290
Be more careful.

169
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,060
Sorry.

170
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,180
These are our containers.

171
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,050
Joo Won went home early.

172
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,850
Didn't she eat before she left?

173
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,900
I'll take it.

174
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,290
I think you should eat this right away.

175
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,050
I heard you're going to America.

176
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,450
Yes.

177
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,210
When?

178
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,620
From here?

179
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,830
I leave here tomorrow.

180
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:45,840
Since things turned out this way, you should confess your feelings.

181
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,150
What feelings?

182
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,910
Tell Kim San Ha how you feel.

183
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,420
And if I do?

184
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,590
He will probably reject you.

185
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,270
But at least you'll have no regrets.

186
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,940
Am I not good enough?

187
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,700
No way.

188
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,370
You're smart, kind, and you can keep a secret.

189
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,720
Kim San Ha and I both know you're a good person.

190
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,620
But you're his younger sister's friend.

191
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,810
Which makes you his younger sister.

192
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,100
How could that work out...

193
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,640
I'm really sorry about that.

194
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,570
This will all pass.

195
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,190
Just wait and see. Some incredible man might appear in your life tomorrow.

196
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,340
"Kim San Ha?"

197
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,270
"Who is that?"

198
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:51,170
That's what you'll say.

199
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,930
Here.

200
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,300
See you around.

201
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,740
Don't let your mom stress you out too much.

202
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:13,160
Eat well, sleep well, and be well.

203
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,400
I'm off.

204
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,880
   

205
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,320
Go.

206
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,310
Take care!

207
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,280
If he can't catch onto how I feel, he could at least stop smiling at me.

208
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,410
Why did he block the ball, then?

209
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,300
Do you feel better after eating these things?

210
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,930
No.

211
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,010
You're right.

212
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,610
I have no memory of my mom.

213
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,750
I saw photos of her, but I can't remember anything.

214
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,820
Even if the townspeople felt bad for me for having no mom,

215
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,350
I couldn't really understand why they felt that way.

216
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,930
Since I never thought not having a mom stopped me from

217
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:51,260
doing something or made me feel lacking.

218
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,550
Since Dad did everything for me.

219
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,600
Since...

220
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,630
it's only natural for the two of us to live together.

221
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:12,950
But then you guys showed up.

222
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,110
I loved it.

223
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,560
It used to be just the two of us eating.

224
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,380
But when there were five of us at the table,

225
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,710
even if each person only said a few words,

226
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:32,400
there was so much to talk about.

227
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,550
♫  Even if you don't  ♫

228
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,090
And I didn't have to go home to an empty house.

229
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:40,750
♫  say where it hurts  ♫

230
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:46,140
There were plenty of people telling me to eat.

231
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,400
Now, all of that feels natural.

232
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:56,220
I naturally thought we'd live like this forever.

233
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,500
♫  While secretly following me  ♫

234
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,580
When I return...

235
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,990
♫  Without me knowing  ♫

236
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:15,330
I'll do that.

237
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,070
Everything you want.

238
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,790
♫  Your back as you looked  ♫

239
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,920
Can't you stay?

240
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:28,240
♫  Afraid stars might pour down on your cheeks  ♫

241
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:32,160
I'll come back for the holidays.

242
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,790
If I can't make it, I'll call you every day.

243
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,630
What use is that?

244
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:47,340
♫  I can't be the tree that you can take shelter under  ♫

245
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,090
When I return...

246
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,580
I'll never leave again.

247
00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:01,720
♫  I will always, as I have  ♫

248
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:11,370
♫  Be with you, like my breath  ♫

249
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,320
You're home?

250
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,220
What?

251
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,390
You used a fortune.

252
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,840
How did you know?

253
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,650
I used up my entire savings.

254
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,430
You have a rich dad now, is that it?

255
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,680
Is this just pocket money now?

256
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,540
Hey.

257
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:21,350
What?

258
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:27,570
What are you doing?

259
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,970
It's not like you're taking these to America.

260
00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:31,880
Give them to me.

261
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,330
This, too.

262
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,720
What will you do with these?

263
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,440
That, too.

264
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,310
Hey, this is something I used to use.

265
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,630
Just take good care of it until I return.

266
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,160
See? I'm giving you everything.

267
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,500
Are you coming back?

268
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:06,430
You can pray I don't come back, and I'll still return.

269
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:09,260
Why would I go through the trouble?

270
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,460
Hey, but this is a bit–

271
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,860
I need hair wax.

272
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:18,910
- Why do you need wax? Give it back. 
 - Hey. Hey!

273
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,490
- Buy one in America. 
 - I need it.

274
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:23,610
Eat American jelly.

275
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,160
They have a lot of delicious stuff there.

276
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:55,770
Why aren't you sleeping yet?

277
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:05,250
Why? Can't you sleep?

278
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,380
Drink this tea.

279
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,560
All children leave home when they're grown up.

280
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,900
How long could you live with me?

281
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,070
Even so...

282
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,460
I learned everything from you.

283
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,630
Bicycling,

284
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,100
shaving,

285
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,800
and basketball.

286
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:07,520
 Shoot! 

287
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,680
 Wow, he's good. 

288
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,980
 Right? 

289
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,360
 I never even taught him properly, but look at that clean form. 

290
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,460
 I guess he takes after his dad. 

291
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,490
 Of course. 

292
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:44,290
Once I'm finished with school,

293
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,000
I'll return right away.

294
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,230
I'll make it big and return

295
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:55,140
to treat you and Joo Won very well.

296
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,380
I'm not sending you there to make it big and return.

297
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,280
I'm sending you there to do what you want

298
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,450
to your heart's content.

299
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,960
Don't try too hard over there.

300
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,890
Come back once you think

301
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,200
you've done enough.

302
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,600
Okay?

303
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,950
All right?

304
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,750
 Hey, just have some. 

305
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,900
 I feel better now. 

306
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:25,170
­♫  How much I missed it  ♫

307
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,980
­♫  Never know  ♫

308
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:42,970
♫  Everything is spreading red like a sunrise  ♫

309
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,300
 Eat what I gave you. 

310
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,160
 You can have mine. 

311
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:07,580
­♫  Looking back, I looked a little like them  ♫

312
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:18,890
­♫  How much I, I missed it  ♫

313
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:26,460
­♫  How much I, I missed it  ♫

314
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:35,750
­♫  Now it's time to move forward, beyond the sunrise  ♫

315
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:38,210
Why? Is she not answering?

316
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,960
I can just call her later.

317
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,560
Here.

318
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,670
Stash it away and use it when you need it.

319
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,000
Thank you.

320
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,760
What about me?

321
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,070
What money do you need when you're just going to Seoul?

322
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,810
Let's go. We will be late for the train.

323
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:03,750
All right.

324
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:06,070
Always watch out for cars.

325
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,550
- And don't skip breakfast. 
 - Okay.

326
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,330
Always turn off the light before sleeping.

327
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,370
And drink lots of water.

328
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,580
Ahjusshi.

329
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,680
Go on.

330
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,620
Wear your seatbelts.

331
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,690
Drive slowly.

332
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,010
Call me when you guys arrive.

333
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,540
Were you home?

334
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:38,310
I'm hungry. Give me food.

335
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,130
You still should've seen them off.

336
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,950
Seasoned cucumbers.

337
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,370
Rice.

338
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,590
 Do you mean you can still eat more? 

339
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,030
 Hey, hey. 

340
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,860
 Be quiet. 

341
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,180
♫  One day  ♫

342
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,270
♫  A precious memory  ♫

343
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,910
♫  Entered my small heart the day you smiled brightly  ♫

344
00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:47,660
See?

345
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:50,120
You already regret it.

346
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,800
If I say bye,

347
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:57,670
it seems like they're truly leaving.

348
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,820
If I say goodbye,

349
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,540
it'll seem like we are truly parting ways.

350
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:15,750
♫  We loved all those days  ♫

351
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:22,730
♫  Back then, we were too young to know our hearts were racing  ♫

352
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:33,040
♫  We just argued and delayed things without knowing why  ♫

353
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:42,160
♫  Maybe we didn’t understand the meaning of love  ♫

354
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,610
♫  We just couldn’t say it  ♫

355
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:47,350
 Thank you. Have a good day. 

356
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:50,670
Yes, thank you.

357
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:58,300
♫  With words that once saddened and worried me  ♫

358
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:08,260
♫  I'll answer you now, that I love you  ♫

359
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:12,200
♫  The day you brought us together  ♫

360
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:22,170
♫  From the day you came into my world  ♫

361
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:30,240
♫  We didn’t know the word "love"  ♫

362
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,890
♫  We just couldn’t tell each other  ♫

363
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:39,290
♫  Day after day, like that  ♫

364
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,020
 I'm going to sleep now. 

365
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,110
 Me, too. 

366
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:44,930
 The air in Seoul is so polluted. 

367
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,840
 I can't even breathe. 

368
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,720
 Don't copy me. 

369
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,630
 Lol. 

370
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,380
 I get to eat both drumsticks from now on. 

371
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:04,550
♫  While carrying the warmth of our memories in our hearts  ♫

372
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:12,600
What on earth?

373
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,160
- Aigoo, careful. 
 - Hold him up.

374
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,850
Thanks.

375
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,850
What? Did you think I'd offer you honey tea or something?

376
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,290
Why not?

377
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,160
Didn't you drink so you could feel awful?

378
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,000
Madam told me

379
00:35:55,210 --> 00:36:00,140
to send the children off without expecting them to return.

380
00:36:01,550 --> 00:36:05,300
That if they do well living with their birth families,

381
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:09,130
then it's all my blessings.

382
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:16,310
She is right.

383
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,350
If they live a good life with their birth parents,

384
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,250
it's my blessing.

385
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,950
But...

386
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,750
what if I miss them?

387
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,890
San Ha is my flesh and blood,

388
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,950
so he will return eventually.

389
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:46,400
As for Hae Joon...

390
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,900
he will return even if we tell him not to.

391
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,670
He will change his name to Yang Hae Joon over there.

392
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:12,080
I never cared what his surname was until now.

393
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,080
People are so fickle.

394
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:22,560
I feel jealous now that I think about him changing his surname to his dad's.

395
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:26,120
Does he call himself a dad?

396
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,270
He doesn't even know what Hae Joon likes or dislikes.

397
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:33,970
Why is that man his dad and not me?

398
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,980
Are you going through andropause?

399
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,480
Why the sudden fuss?

400
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:48,330
Even if that man takes Hae Joon,

401
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:53,790
he will never know what Hae Joon likes or dislikes.

402
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:59,290
I can tell by looking at his face.

403
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,810
Even if he took him when he was younger,

404
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:08,990
he's the type that would've neglected him.

405
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,180
Not everyone is fit for caretaking.

406
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,330
He hasn't even served in the military.

407
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,070
He knows nothing of this world.

408
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:34,930
How do you think he felt about leaving?

409
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:40,640
He probably left thinking it's better to suffer physically than emotionally.

410
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,470
Hey!

411
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,550
What do you know, Mr. Yoon?

412
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,960
He's my son.

413
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,410
Why wouldn't I know? I'm the one who brewed him jujube tea.

414
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:54,940
You should've brewed him jujube tea if he was your son.

415
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,550
"The type to neglect his child." Yes, right.

416
00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:02,610
You must've recognized it since it felt like you were looking in the mirror.

417
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,570
Darn it.

418
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,140
How do other parents live?

419
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,640
We can't be the only ones like this.

420
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:25,640
But why are we the only ones...

421
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:29,530
who keep feeling unusually empty?

422
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:53,320

 Sorry, I was planning on visiting this year. 

458
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,830
 Happy birthday! 

459
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,840
 Sorry, Joo Won. I'll visit on your next birthday. 

460
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:23,800
   

461
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:33,560
   

462
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,150
What's the matter, Mr. Jeong Jae?

463
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:52,480
"The matter"? What's the plan for your birthday?

464
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,150
Will you come in the morning or evening?

465
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:57,120
"Birthday"? Is it this week?

466
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,860
 I knew it. It's this Thursday. 

467
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,870
You should at least eat seaweed soup.

468
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,150
It's difficult to visit on a weekday.

469
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,980
What about the weekend?

470
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:08,710
It's harder on the weekends.

471
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,110
 Does Monday work? 
   

472
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,780
"Monday"?

473
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,020
Okay, I'll come on Monday, then.

474
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,570
Okay.

475
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,420
She's too busy to even talk now.

476
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:53,240
What? Do you expect me to prepare a royal feast with seasonal ingredients?

477
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,450
Are you a king?

478
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:56,390
King, my foot.

479
00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:00,920
Even Dobby* wouldn't be able to change a sock with this meal. 
  (TN: Fictional house-elf) 

480
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,250
- Let's eat out for dinner. 
 - No.

481
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,940
I'll prepare meat and japchae for Joo Won's birthday in two days.

482
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:09,490
You can eat up then.

483
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:13,490
Here. Lav-spin-per-gar*. 
   (TN: Laver, spinach, perrila leaves, garlic stem) 

484
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:16,570
It's good if you eat them in that order. Make a wrap.

485
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,530
Another all-nighter at the store?

486
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,410
 I just took a brief nap. 

487
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:27,690
I told you to sleep at home.

488
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:30,110
I'll go to the courthouse today, so I think I'll end early.

489
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:32,190
I'll stop by a little past lunchtime.

490
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:35,500
 I'm on my way to pick cherries at Madam's cousin's place. 

491
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,150
 It should take me about three hours. 

492
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:40,270
 You have the keys, right? Just go inside the store if I'm not there. 

493
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:44,420
Okay. Oh, right. The part-timer at the convenience store told me

494
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,790
some weirdo keeps loitering around your store.

495
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,010
 "Some weirdo"? 

496
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:51,420
 He wears a hoody, so you can't see his face. 

497
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:55,050
 Anyway, he sounds really suspicious, so be careful. 

498
00:44:55,050 --> 00:44:58,130
 No way. What's there to steal from my store? 

499
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:02,110
 Okay, I'll install a security camera if I need to. 

500
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,970
 The part-timer at the convenience store told me 

501
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:08,550
 some weirdo keeps loitering around your store. 

502
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,220
I-I mean...

503
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:16,300
who leaves cash in the store these days?

504
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,390
C-Customers use the cards...

505
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:23,250
and even the ingredients are paid for with e-transactions!

506
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,470
You cheap punk.

507
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:10,360
Stealing money isn't enough, so you hit people, too?

508
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,220
Shame on you.

509
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,770
   

510
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:27,000
You're bound to reveal your face in the end.

511
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,640
You messed with the wrong person.

512
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,340
Joo Won. Joo Won!

513
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,890
Dad.

514
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:37,400
- Ahjusshi! 
 - What happened?

515
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:41,760
Hello.

516
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,430
- Sergeant. 
 - Hey.

517
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:45,820
Is she your daughter?

518
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,280
No.

519
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,890
He's the dad. I'm an ahjusshi.

520
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:52,390
She's like a daughter to me.

521
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:54,730
Oh, "Like a daughter..."

522
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:57,610
Are you hurt anywhere? Did he hit you or anything?

523
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:59,850
Dad.

524
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:03,470
He slapped me in the face.

525
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:08,650
You punk...

526
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,110
You...

527
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:11,540
Is it you, Punk?

528
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,570
- Is it you, Punk? 
 - Wait.

529
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:16,820
Are you aware of your crime? Why are you hiding your face?

530
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:20,300
Let go! Have you nothing else to do than to hit a woman, you punk?

531
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,440
You punk! Won't you show your face?

532
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,160
I didn't hit her.

533
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,450
I never meant to hit her. My goodness.

534
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,670
How dare you hit...

535
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:33,300
See? You look perfectly normal...

536
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:50,570
Hey.

537
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,880
Hae Joon.

538
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,870
Dad.

539
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:58,420
Dad...

540
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:02,980
You... Hae Joon.

541
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,700
You're really Hae Joon, right?

542
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:09,190
Dad!

543
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:10,950
"Dad"?

544
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,320
Ahjusshi! Ahjusshi, I'm back.

545
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,390
Yes, okay.

546
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:22,970
You should've come home if you were back.

547
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:26,480
Excuse me, Sergeant. What should I do?

548
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,630
Oh, he's like a son to me.

549
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:33,450
"Like a son..."

550
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:37,350
Like a daughter and son...

551
00:50:37,350 --> 00:50:41,500
Then these two are siblings, right?

552
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,920
If you're family–

553
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,110
We aren't family.

554
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,730
Do you know me?

555
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,160
Yes, Professor.

556
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,770
Yes, I'll visit you before I start work.

557
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:35,140
Yes.

558
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:45,270
   

559
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,910
Yoon Joo Won.

560
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:18,670
You must listen carefully. 
    

561
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:21,920
It's hard to prove an attempt at robbery,

562
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,770
but this is clearly trespassing.

563
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:28,300
It's an attempt only because I stopped him.

564
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,750
I stopped him from committing the crime, so why does he benefit from it?

565
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:34,830
No, that's not what happened.

566
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:38,190
That's why you should've contacted her all this time.

567
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:40,570
What about assault? Doesn't assault apply?

568
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:44,050
That was by accident while trying to run away.

569
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:45,950
You hit me more.

570
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:48,440
W-Where? Where did she hit you?

571
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:50,550
- Did she get you good? 
 - Here...

572
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:53,380
Who are you worrying about right now?

573
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,260
Yoon Joo Won.

574
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,700
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere? Let me see.

575
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,440
Kim San Ha?

576
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,590
I'm fine.

577
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:18,580
You... You rascal.

578
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:23,150
Ahjusshi. Dad, you were here.

579
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:27,190
And what are you doing here?

580
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:31,170
Let's not do this here.

581
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,200
Let's talk at home.

582
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,670
Is today some special day?

583
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,410
Y-Yes, let's c-clear things up and–

584
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:41,050
W-Wait, wait. Wait, wait.

585
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:42,940
So, earlier,

586
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:46,040
these two...

587
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,030
called him "Dad."

588
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,500
And he called you "Dad."

589
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,310
These two are strangers.

590
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:58,130
Then what are you two?

591
00:53:58,130 --> 00:54:05,540
The man who just arrived, you're not related to the victim, are you?

592
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,380
We aren't blood-related.

593
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,100
Yes, we aren't family.

594
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,480
We just used to live together.

595
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:17,490
Aren't we strangers if we haven't seen each other for ten years?

596
00:54:22,110 --> 00:54:25,160
How could you talk to your brothers like that, no matter how upset you were?

597
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,230
Why not?

598
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:29,680
They're not strangers.

599
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,520
Joo Won isn't wrong.

600
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:38,510
You didn't visit once for ten years.

601
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:43,490
Look. They grew so many gray hairs while you two never showed up.

602
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:45,280
They're already old.

603
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:46,580
I'm not.

604
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,700
Don't I have enough hair for my age?

605
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:53,640
Of course. It's still luscious and full of black hair.

606
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,190
I still called regularly.

607
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:58,300
You just never answered.

608
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:05,460
- Me? 
 - You haven't called or texted for years.

609
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:09,450
I was discharged last week from the military, so I haven't got a phone yet.

610
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,310
- You what? 
 - What?

611
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:24,550
 I visited the store a few times over the week. 

612
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,980
 But when I thought about it, 

613
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:32,000
 I didn't even graduate from college 

614
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,570
 and quit basketball, too. 

615
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:36,980
I didn't know what to say.

616
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,700
What about before the military?

617
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,560
You should've contacted me when you came to Korea.

618
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,280
I would've at least visited you.

619
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,460
You must've gotten vacation, too.

620
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,520
You could've called us then.

621
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:51,560
I kept pushing it, and it got harder to do.

622
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,350
Forget it. Let's hurry up and go home. We'll talk at home.

623
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:57,960
Yes. Let's go home and talk since you must be tired.

624
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,190
I need to go to the store.

625
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,090
Why? Come with us.

626
00:56:03,090 --> 00:56:06,880
She needs to clean up because someone made a mess.

627
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,570
Should I come with you, then?

628
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:12,430
It's fine. We met after ten years, so you should go home and catch up.

629
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:14,970
Yes, then. Clean up and come right away.

630
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:16,240
Let's go.

631
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,860
I'll see you at home.

632
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:23,050
I brought my car. Let me drop you off.

633
00:56:23,050 --> 00:56:26,020
It's fine. You must be tired from driving. Don't bother.

634
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,560
I can just take the cab.

635
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:29,380
I'll see you later at home.

636
00:56:53,740 --> 00:56:56,870
Hey, what's going on?

637
00:56:56,870 --> 00:56:58,960
You're not hurt anywhere, right?

638
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,430
No.

639
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,100
Are you happy?

640
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,660
Why would I be happy?

641
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,580
Kang Hae Joon... Actually,

642
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:12,670
he's Yang Hae Joon now.

643
00:57:12,670 --> 00:57:15,640
Your first love came back. Aren't you happy?

644
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,500
That was ages ago.

645
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:19,900
I can't even remember his face.

646
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,330
Why did you come back to the store?

647
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:25,720
I can just clean up here.

648
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:29,280
Your brothers returned after ten years, which calls for a teary reunion.

649
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,780
We already had a teary reunion.

650
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,380
They were just different kinds of tears.

651
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:39,600
I'll finish cleaning up here, so you can go home.

652
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,250
It's fine. Four hands will be faster than two.

653
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,240
You don't want to go, do you?

654
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:49,480
It's not that I don't want to go.

655
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,420
It's not like I never imagined my brothers returning.

656
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:58,420
But...

657
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,000
But?

658
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:04,600
I'm not as happy as I thought I'd be.

659
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,610
- Why? 
 - They're surely the Kim San Ha and Kang...

660
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,970
I mean, Yang Hae Joon I know.

661
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:15,350
But they feel like strangers for some odd reason.

662
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,530
They smell a bit different, too.

663
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:21,230
Are you a dog? Why'd you smell them?

664
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:27,880
Ten years passed, you know.

665
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,410
Of course, you'd feel awkward and strange.

666
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:35,740
Even blood relatives feel awkward if you haven't met them for a while.

667
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:38,070
- Really? 
 - Yes.

668
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,030
It's still the same.

669
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,710
Still the same, right?

670
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:20,820
Mr. Yoon didn't let anyone touch your room and Hae Joon's.

671
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:24,230
So you two could come and sleep over anytime.

672
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:26,660
I came too late, didn't I?

673
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:29,000
All that matters is you came.

674
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,290
I'm a distant relative.

675
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:49,070
I'm the in-law's third cousin's niece.

676
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:51,360
I feel awkward seeing my relatives after a long time,

677
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,630
but I'm really glad to see them.

678
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,930
Let's go.

679
01:00:02,910 --> 01:00:06,930
All right. Here's your rice.

680
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:09,250
You, too.

681
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:27,300
There isn't much on the table, but let's start eating.

682
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:30,370
 - Thank you for the food!  
 - Yes.

683
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:50,440
Why? Weren't you going to eat that?

684
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,940
Yes.

685
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:55,340
Thanks.

686
01:00:56,930 --> 01:01:00,440
If you had given me a heads-up about coming, I would've gone grocery shopping.

687
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,020
How is it? Is it to your liking?

688
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:05,020
It's so delicious that I can't help it.

689
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:07,190
Eat slowly. Take your time.

690
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:09,200
There is a lot.

691
01:01:11,050 --> 01:01:13,300
My goodness, you look great, San Ha.

692
01:01:13,300 --> 01:01:16,180
You can get married now.

693
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:18,790
- Are you not dating anyone? 
 - Not yet.

694
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:23,070
A third-year resident doesn't have time to date. He barely gets any sleep.

695
01:01:23,070 --> 01:01:26,430
- It's better than my first and second year. 
 - Yes.

696
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:32,570
Let me think about this. Hey, did we have any beer at home?

697
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:36,250
Yes, we do.

698
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,480
What about mine?

699
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:50,490
Do you drink alcohol, too?

700
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,510
She's all grown up now. Think of her age.

701
01:01:56,510 --> 01:02:00,240
All right. One for you.

702
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,470
- Joo Won, too. 
 - Yes.

703
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,830
- You, too. 
 - Thank you.

704
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:09,230
- Dad. 
 - Yes.

705
01:02:14,050 --> 01:02:15,670
Allow me.

706
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:21,760
Man, it's just like ten years ago since we're all sitting together like this.

707
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,630
Since we all got together like this, let's make a toast.

708
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:29,440
 Cheers. 

709
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:33,740
It's nice to see you.

710
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,130
What?

711
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:41,320
It's nothing.

712
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:50,050


713
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:52,570
   

714
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:02,360
- Yes. 
 -  Is it going well? 

715
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,230
Not everyone can be an in-law's third cousin's niece.

716
01:03:05,230 --> 01:03:07,630
 Did you ask when they're leaving? 

717
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:10,660
Well, I'll need to ask now.

718
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:13,450
 Tell them to visit your store before they leave. 

719
01:03:13,450 --> 01:03:16,840
Why? You said you don't even remember Yang Hae Joon's face.

720
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,850
 Well, I mean... 

721
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:20,640
 I'm just curious. 

722
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,830
Just wait for now.

723
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:28,470
The cherries are in season, so they taste great. Help yourselves.

724
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,550
You're right. They're very good.

725
01:03:34,790 --> 01:03:37,290
- Aren't they good? 
 - They're delicious.

726
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:40,480
Join us.

727
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:44,410
Did you two agree to come over?

728
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:47,190
- How did you two come together like this? 
 - Exactly.

729
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:51,130
We decided to come together since it's Joo Won's birthday.

730
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:54,720
Why for my birthday?

731
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,500
We plan to spend birthdays together from now on.

732
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,260
What does that mean?

733
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:04,560
Well, the two of us

734
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,110
moved back permanently.

735
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:10,750
We won't leave again.

736
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:12,440
That's why we're here.

737
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:15,670
- What? 
 - You won’t be leaving?

738
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:18,870
We are really not leaving.

739
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,310
They aren't leaving.

740
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:30,280
Wow, my daughter's birthday will be a noisy one this year, right?

741
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:35,210
Who said you can?

742
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:40,230
♫  Back then, we were the world  ♫

743
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:42,250
♫  Everything existed for us  ♫

744
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:44,070
   

745
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:49,610
♫  Like the sun in the clearest summer sky  ♫

746
01:04:49,610 --> 01:05:01,410
♫  We were dazzling and were united as one  ♫
