00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,000
Why did he put himself through that all the way there?

177
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,940
He should've come back sooner. He should've come back right away.

178
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,180
We waited for him for so long.

179
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,890
Exactly.

180
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,550
I don't think he still gets it, even after I've said all that.

181
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:16,710

By the way...

183
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:37,660
I followed you today because I was worried-

184
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,990
It's okay.

185
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:42,970
I know Juwon told you to because she was worried about me.

186
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,030
I see.

187
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,160
Did you hear what happened?

188
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,620
Yes.

189
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,490
But the two of them were worried sick about you all night.

190
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,100
They both cherish you dearly,

191
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,070
but they didn't want to upset you in the slightest.

192
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,620
I know.

193
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,900
I also know I'm being unreasonable.

194
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,020
But they don't know.

195
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,100
They don't know anything.

196
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,800
Even if you're being unreasonable,

197
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,460
I'll be on your side unconditionally.

198
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,780
Please don't be too upset.

199
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,620
You know, you always say the sweetest things.

200
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,620
The crab stew? Did Haejun crave it?

201
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,000
Then, come home and eat.

202
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,440
No, I'm going to make it. Hurry up and tell me.

203
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,720
Add green onions and chili pepper.

204
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,790
I got it. I'll make it as good as yours, Dad.

205
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,160
Dinner is at our place. Please make sure to come.

206
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,570
Here we go!

207
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,090
Ta-da!

208
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:29,870
I chose the biggest crab at the market to feed you and made it nice and spicy...

209
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,390
- It's good.
- Right? It's delicious, right?

210
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,500
I put lots of love and effort into it.

211
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,610
Lighten up, please?

212
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,770
Think about it.

213
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,650
If Kim Sanha messes up from now on, you can scold him.

214
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:52,850
Also, Kang Haejun is Yoon Juwon's oppa, so you're his hyungnim.

215
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,110
If Kim Sanha and I fight, whose side will you be on?

216
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:58,370
Gosh, you two shouldn't fight.

217
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:01,870
Of course, I'll be on your side. I'm on your side, no matter what!

218
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,310
You eat, too.

219
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,840
Should we go get some ice cream after? Some freezies?

220
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,540
If you want.

221
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:15,580
I'm here.

222
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,360
I'm almost done lightening him up.

223
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,660
I'm done eating.

224
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,550
Let's go eat ice cream.

225
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,520
- Already?
- Let's go.

226
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,570
- O-Okay.
- You can stay and eat.

227
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:39,030
Huh?

228
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,490
Gosh, Kang Haejun, you crazy punk.

229
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,130
He could eat this?

230
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,730
Why haven't you told the dads?

231
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:09,210
What if they find out?

232
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:12,720
We were going to, but the timing was a bit...

233
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,630
The timing for what?

234
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,630
Why?

235
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,250
Are you hiding something else from me?

236
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,350
Nope, there's none.

237
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,140
I'm still against it.

238
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,360
I'm sure the dads will feel the same.

239
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:34,220
People break up even after marriage, get divorced, and so on.

240
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,700
What if you break up while dating?

241
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,600
Will you cut ties?

242
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,560
I won't do that.

243
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,410
Can you do that as you please?

244
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,390
I can't do that as I please...

245
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:49,700
but what can I do when I like him?

246
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,060
Gosh, what do you like about that arrogant brat?

247
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:56,320
You know you like him, too.

248
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,440
- I don't.
- You do.

249
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,870
Why'd I like that punk?

250
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,310
You know you like him!

251
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,190
- I don't.
- You do.

252
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,110
- I don't.
- You do.

253
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,990
You know you do. Right?

254
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,160
[My Love♥]

255
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,780
Pick up.

256
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,720
Oh, okay.

257
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,810
Yes, I'm on patrol.

258
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:25,760
Oh, really?

259
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,860
Okay, I got it. All right.

260
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,190
She told me to buy a cake on the way home.

261
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,590
I couldn't do anything for her last week since I was on the night shift.

262
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:40,060
I'll have to do my best to survive this week.

263
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:44,880
You know what happens if you don't treat her well at times like that, right?

264
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,600
Yes.

265
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,730
I was ignorant about such things.

266
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,580
I do pass by the hospital pretty often.

267
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,650
So, we can eat in the city, too. Right?

268
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,220
You can call me anytime.

269
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,510
Or you can just come by, too.

270
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,060
Drop me off at the hospital.

271
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,940
I'll eat lunch and get home on my own.

272
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,770
So suddenly? Where are you going?

273
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,810
I'll have lunch with Sanha before going home.

274
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:18,160
I guess I'll buy a cake from Juwon's store, then.

275
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,920
Juwon's cake gets me double the points, you see.

276
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,400
Juwon's doing an important job, huh?

277
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,730
Just give up on Kang Haejun. You still don't get it?

278
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,310
He won't ever go back on his no.

279
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,750
You said he doesn't even answer your texts.

280
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,230
That's why I'm seeking your cooperation.

281
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:37,000
I can't cooperate anymore.

282
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,920
And I don't even talk to Haejun these days.

283
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,860
Why? Did you fight?

284
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,740
Gosh, we didn't.

285
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:48,430
- Dad.
- Yes, I was just passing by.

286
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,080
Did you eat lunch?

287
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,580
I figured you wouldn't know. There's a great noodle place nearby,

288
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,610
so I dropped by.

289
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,790
I was trying to figure out what to eat. Let's go together.

290
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,430
Shall we?

291
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,660
How do you do?

292
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,880
She's my high school friend. We work at the same hospital.

293
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,910
Oh, really? I see.

294
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,880
Please enjoy your lunch.

295
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,930
Why don't you join us?

296
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:18,120
Gosh, she'll be uncomfortable. See you later.

297
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,490
Oh, okay, then.

298
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:21,920
What about Haejun?

299
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,870
- Excuse me, Father.
- Yes.

300
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:27,030
If you don't mind, could I join you for lunch?

301
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:29,610
Aigoo, what's there to mind? You can come along.

302
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,680
All right. Let's go. I'd love to.

303
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,940
I'll buy you tangsuyuk, too.

304
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,680
Thank you, Father!

305
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,280
Aigoo, okay. Let's go now.

306
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,600
Hey, hurry up.

307
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,020
- Hurry along!
- Seriously.

308
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,940
I heard it's really famous.

309
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:45,720
People line up in the U.S. and hit it big in Seoul, too.

310
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,770
They opened a second Busan branch this time and-

311
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:51,160
Does it make sense to ask a café owner to go to a rival café?

312
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,780
It's for market research, so-

313
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,940
So, why would I go there with you?

314
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,280
You and I can just-

315
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,950
Oh, you're here.

316
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:02,450
Yes. Do you have a mango cake?

317
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,230
Of course. Do you want a slice or one whole?

318
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,650
Hey, I'm busy. Get going now.

319
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,090
Let's go. We'll go for a drive, too.

320
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,180
I'm busy. Get going.

321
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,180
I'll be back in the evening, okay?

322
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,630
Haejun said he couldn't come.

323
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:32,800
- Really?
- Yes.

324
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,970
Why? Where did he say he is?

325
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,220
I don't know.

326
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,010
Did you tell him you're with your dad?

327
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,910
I'll have black bean noodles.

328
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,990
It'd be nice to eat together on days like this. Right?

329
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:47,110
She's right about that.

330
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,750
By the way...

331
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:53,420
how should I address you?

332
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,820
You can just call me Huiju.

333
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:59,130
You can call her Dr. Do.

334
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,990
I-Is it okay for me to skip the honorifics?

335
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:06,180
Of course, Father.

336
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,810
There you go.

337
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:24,010
It seems she saw Sanha's mom in Seoul.

338
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,680
Sanha was acting prickly, but she wasn't even that fazed.

339
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,440
I saw her at the hospital once, too.

340
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,950
They looked good together!

341
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,450
Right?

342
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,470
I was worried he might take after me and only look at appearances.

343
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,880
But she's pretty, and she's very well-mannered, too.

344
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:47,300
Going after appearance is nothing to brag about.

345
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,120
Anyhow, what's more important

346
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,630
is that Juwon seems to have someone, too.

347
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,500
Someone? Who?

348
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,270
Officer Kim went to Juwon's store

349
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,160
and judging by the atmosphere,

350
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:07,710
it seemed like they go on dates, too.

351
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,240
Really?

352
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,690
What was he like? Did he look okay?

353
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,210
He's handsome and apparently hangs on to Juwon's every word.

354
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,260
Madam warned me that the three would never find anyone at this rate.

355
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,840
I was worried because of her negative comments, but I worried in vain!

356
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,100
Don't even listen to that old granny!

357
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,410
Of course! Everyone has their own match.

358
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:40,650
None of our children are lacking in any way.

359
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:45,730
He's not lacking in any way!

360
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,190
Then, are you saying Dal is lacking?

361
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,320
I'm not!

362
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,870
If my baby says it's Dal, then it's dal*.
(Dal means "moon" in Korean)

363
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,320
If you say it's the sun, then it's the sun.

364
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,250
My baby's sense of humor is killer!

365
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:02,420
Gosh, you're so cute.

366
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,580
Why don't you go since you picked up your cake?

367
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:11,590
By the way, why can't I reach Haejun?

368
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,230
He must be busy, I guess.

369
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:18,170
For some time now, I'm not sure what he's up to during the day,

370
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,950
but I can't get a hold of him at times.

371
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,920
It's suspicious.

372
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,870
Why?

373
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:31,040
It seems like Kang Haejun has something else going on beside us.

374
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,120
He must have something to do.

375
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,410
Exactly! What would that be?

376
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,850
Is he looking for a new store? That can't be.

377
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,340
Dad isn't planning to move stores.

378
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,450
What if he's fallen into a pyramid scheme?

379
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,560
Is it me or Kang Haejun?

380
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,780
- Huh?
- I mean...

381
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,010
while we walked around this area three times,

382
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:53,400
you only spoke about Haejun for the past 48 minutes!

383
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,040
I'm worried about him.

384
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,840
Kang Haejun isn't a little kid.

385
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,440
He's a 29-year-old who earned that much money.

386
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,730
You don't need to worry about him.

387
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,500
I guess...

388
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,690
So, can you look at your boyfriend who's next to you now?

389
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:14,130
Oppa!*
(Using Busan dialect)

390
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,690
Are you being jealous?

391
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:19,430
Are you being jealous?

392
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:21,290
Babe!

393
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,820
It's not working.

394
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,150
You're so lucky.

395
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,260
Your girlfriend acts cute like this to appease your jealousy.

396
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:30,830
I wasn't jealous, though.

397
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,220
You're quite blessed.

398
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,330
Am I?

399
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,540
Am I right or wrong? Huh?

400
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,410
Am I right or wrong?

401
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,470
You're right.

402
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,630
You two, follow me inside.

403
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,800
Go.

404
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:06,150
They're rules.

405
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,010
[Dating rules]
As Yoon Juwon's oppa,

406
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:13,800
these are rules for you to keep while you're dating her.

407
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:17,070
Shit, are you kidding me?

408
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,720
I would've done the same, even if it was some other guy!

409
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,540
That's right. This much is acceptable as an oppa.

410
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,530
[No staying out overnight! Yoon Juwon returns home by 12 a.m. no matter what.]
What's this?

411
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,490
"Returns home by 12 a.m. no matter what"?

412
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,730
Hey, that's too much!

413
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:41,410
What are you planning to do out past 12 a.m.?

414
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,300
Well, it's just...

415
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,580
time flies when you're having fun...

416
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,190
You can't.

417
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,280
You can't.

418
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,700
Understand?

419
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,420
Yes, Haejun.

420
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,490
["Hyungnim"]

421
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,020
Hyungnim?

422
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,740
Hyungnim?

423
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,280
I'm clearly the elder here.

424
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,230
You must call me Hyungnim.

425
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,750
Hyungnim, my foot.

426
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,800
Did- D-Did you just rip that?

427
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,140
Wow!

428
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,870
Geez! This just won't do!

429
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,300
Juwon, he's no good.

430
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,550
I'm totally against him!

431
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,700
Hyungnim.

432
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,400
Hey, Hyungnim.

433
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,880
Please take it easy on me.

434
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,950
Come on.

435
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,260
I'll be good.

436
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,960
I'll be good.

437
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,670
I'll be good, too.

438
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,860
Gosh, get off me!

439
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,490
Why, Hyungnim?

440
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,950
I'll be good!

441
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,200
All right! All right!

442
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,280
- Just be home by 12 a.m.
- 12 a.m.?

443
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,260
I won't ask for much, Hyungnim. Let's go with 1 a.m.

444
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,600
Fine! 12:30 a.m.!

445
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,540
Give it some good thought.

446
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,800
Who else in Haedong has played basketball in America other than you?

447
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:35,460
What kind of teacher could I be when I can't even beat a middle school student?

448
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,730
Just meet them first.

449
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:41,040
Forget about it. I'm hanging up. I'm busy.

450
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,630
What on earth are you doing these days-

451
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,860
Hello!

452
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,660
Would you like the same thing today, too?

453
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,140
Yes.

454
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:02,490
You must live around here.

455
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,060
Yes.

456
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:22,280
It's good to see you doing well.

457
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,660
It's all thanks to you, Attorney.

458
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:31,460
If it weren't for you, I might still be in prison.

459
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,130
No.

460
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:35,930
You were my first case as a lawyer.

461
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:41,930
I'm just thankful to see my client doing this well.

462
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,950
Have you met your son?

463
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:50,970
No.

464
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:54,810
I just saw his face in secret.

465
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,260
Even if it was just an accident,

466
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:05,510
I don't want him to know that someone died because of me.

467
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:11,680
Furthermore, I don't want him to know how I've been living after I left him.

468
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:17,930
Seohyeon, you led a diligent life.

469
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:26,720
After the ruling, I was undoubtedly innocent by law,

470
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,010
but I remained guilty in people's eyes.

471
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,760
I must've seemed like an easy women.

472
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,430
A woman who left her child behind to make money. How easy must I have looked?

473
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:53,500
A wealthy man who tried to party with an easy woman

474
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,620
had died.

475
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,990
People felt bad for the dead man.

476
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:03,520
That I'm the unlucky woman.

477
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,330
It was an accident.

478
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:12,310
Things like that usually happen to people who are born unlucky.

479
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,800
- I'll stop by again.
- Yes.

480
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,390
Please don't hesitate to call me if anything happens.

481
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:38,810
Yes.

482
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,820
I pray you meet your son.

483
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,750
Yes.

484
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,030
Haejun!

485
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,270
Haejun.

486
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:48,590
How... How did you find this place?

487
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,850
Why?

488
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,900
Am I not allowed to come here?

489
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:58,500
You abandoned me, and

490
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,210
lived happily,

491
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,580
and even met a man.

492
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,600
Shouldn't I have shown up in your great life?

493
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,770
You...

494
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,810
You knew I was here?

495
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,060
Yes.

496
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,410
It would've been better if I hadn't.

497
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:24,680
I would've just pretended you didn't exist.

498
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,890
What can I do since I know?

499
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:32,750
If I come and see you smile,

500
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,570
anger erupts inside me!

501
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,310
But I know...

502
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,360
I'll find you if I come here.

503
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,140
And I missed you! How can I not come?

504
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,180
When I see your smiling face,

505
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,030
I'm relieved to see you're doing well.

506
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:03,610
But then why won't you come find me?

507
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,280
I couldn't understand, no matter how much I thought about it.

508
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:14,160
But I came here every single day,

509
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:17,240
thinking you might still miss me.

510
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,160
I'm sorry.

511
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,490
Don't be sorry.

512
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,090
You weren't planning to see me anyway.

513
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,820
Pretend you didn't see me today.

514
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,120
I won't come back, either.

515
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,620
I'll set my mind

516
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,660
and never come back.

517
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,910
Haejun.

518
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,320
I'm sorry.

519
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,620
Haejun did?

520
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,950
I was worried because he left like that.

521
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:01,070
Yes, I'll look for him.

522
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,710
Yes, yes.

523
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,430
[My son]

524
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:18,720
The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

525
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:23,930
I see. All right.

526
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,590
Okay.

527
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,540
He didn't go to Seokhun's, either.

528
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,400
So...

529
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,840
if we had just told him the truth, this wouldn't have happened.

530
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:39,600
You two go home for now.

531
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,980
I think he'll come home after getting some air.

532
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,720
Hey, I'll get going first.

533
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,000
Okay. Sure, you're probably tired. You go ahead.

534
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,660
- Should I come with you?
- No, no.

535
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,410
I'm going.

536
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:14,020
I'll get going first.

537
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,720
I'm sorry I called you with your leg in that state.

538
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,120
It's fine.

539
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:40,300
I was waiting for you with Juwon and Sanha anyway.

540
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,820
Everyone knows I met my mom, right?

541
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,240
Yes.

542
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:55,680
I keep thinking the same thoughts.

543
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,240
But I can't find an answer

544
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,710
and I feel pathetic.

545
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:03,200
I can't tell anyone.

546
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:08,750
And Juwon and Kim Sanha will feel really sorry for me if I see them right now.

547
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,820
You're the smartest person I know.

548
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,440
Yes, feel free to talk to me.

549
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,190
What should I do?

550
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,100
Sorry?

551
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,820
How can I pretend

552
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,710
my mom doesn't exist when I have one?

553
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:42,380
Did you ask Ahjumma why she did that?

554
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:48,230
I didn't ask her.

555
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,810
What good comes from asking?

556
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:54,360
Ahjumma got into an accident when she went to Seoul to pay her debt.

557
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,350
She was in prison.

558
00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:00,050
She said she couldn't come, afraid that she'd hurt Kang Haejun's future.

559
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:08,370
There was a case when I was an intern.

560
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:11,620
A man's high school son got into a huge car accident.

561
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:17,580
After undergoing major surgery, it became difficult to live a normal life.

562
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:23,150
The son begged for the perpetrator to be severely punished.

563
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:27,870
But the father settled with the perpetrator without any punishment.

564
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:31,940
His wife and son asked how he could do that.

565
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,650
They got angry asking if he's all about the money.

566
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:40,580
He got a divorce and became alone after that.

567
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,430
There are parents who are only about the money.

568
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:50,080
The father passed away from cancer not long after.

569
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,460
Lonely by himself.

570
00:39:54,830 --> 00:40:00,290
He knew his wife and son would need money after he died.

571
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:03,330
He didn't even receive any treatment

572
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,730
and even though his family abandoned him,

573
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:11,030
he believed that was a way to protect his family.

574
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:17,050
Are you saying...

575
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:22,060
my mom could also have a reason she couldn't tell me?

576
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:28,880
I'm saying she might not have made that choice for her own sake.

577
00:40:58,310 --> 00:41:02,060
Did you not come for me, or couldn't come for me?

578
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,130
The call is not going through...

579
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,940
[My son]

580
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,290
[Seohyeon]

581
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,120
The call is not going through. You'll be connected to...

582
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,600
It took almost six months

583
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,260
undergoing trials and such while I was in prison.

584
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:38,210
I think that was when you got into middle school.

585
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:43,610
I secretly watched you from an alley having fun with your friends.

586
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,920
Then, Jeongjae came and was so happy to find you.

587
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:55,420
When I saw him take you home with the biggest smile,

588
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:59,600
I couldn't...

589
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,770
bring myself to show up in front of you

590
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:07,240
saying I came back to take you...

591
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:11,730
or just to see your face.

592
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,210
I couldn't do anything for you.

593
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:22,610
I felt so bad that someone like me was your mom.

594
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:26,470
Do you think that makes sense?

595
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:29,420
I'm sorry.

596
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,200
I'm really sorry.

597
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:36,520
Why do you keep saying you're sorry?

598
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,720
While you were living like that,

599
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,100
all I did was resent you.

600
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:44,500
You don't know

601
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,670
how hard I tried to hate you!

602
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:53,780
It would've been better if you just left me to pursue a better life!

603
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,400
What's this?

604
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,300
Why did you live like that?

605
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:04,760
Are you happy now that you made me out to be an ungrateful child?

606
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,350
Tell me!

607
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,690
Are you satisfied?

608
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,330
Dad.

609
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:25,190
Haejun, calm down

610
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,240
and listen to me.

611
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,150
Your mom had her own circumstances.

612
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,560
You were aware, too?

613
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,150
Did everyone know?

614
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,180
What happened was-

615
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,380
I told him not to tell you.

616
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:58,320
Your mom wanted to come see you soon.

617
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,680
She had asked us not to so you would hurt less.

618
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,250
How could I hurt less?

619
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:09,130
How could I feel less hurt

620
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:11,630
in this shitty situation?

621
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:15,820
Haejun.

622
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,500
Why is everyone doing this to me?

623
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,520
Why only make me out to be stupid?

624
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,410
An idiot?

625
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,920
I'm happy with just eating a hamburger with you.

626
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,150
I'm just happy eating a bowl of noodles with you, Dad.

627
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:41,530
Does it...

628
00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:46,080
Does it have to hurt like this?

629
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:51,200
What everyone is born with...

630
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,910
and what comes naturally to people...

631
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:00,070
Why don't I have that?

632
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:04,190
Why is it so hard for me?

633
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:57,890
For now, we definitely didn't know anything.

634
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:00,720
Dad said it would be catastrophic if we said we knew, too.

635
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,700
All right. This is the third time already.

636
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:07,370
I'm nervous. I wonder how happy they are.

637
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:09,730
You said we have to watch our words.

638
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:10,960
I'll be careful.

639
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,260
We didn't even know Ahjumma was alive. Okay?

640
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:18,000
You're making me nervous.

641
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,540
Let's go.

642
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,980
Oh, yes. Come in!

643
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,860
Hello!

644
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:36,990
It's hard to recognize you after 20 years!

645
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:38,740
What are you saying?

646
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:40,830
Mom looks the same.

647
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,910
Really?

648
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:46,560
My memory must be blurry since I was too young.

649
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,050
Hello.

650
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,620
It's been a while.

651
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,430
I'm glad you came.

652
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,360
Sit down. Sit down!

653
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:59,480
Let's dig in.

654
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,640
Braised short ribs?

655
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:11,770
Yes, thank you.

656
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:20,100
♫ However, time is still, never thought ♫

657
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:33,310
♫ Everything is perfect prayer, fire 'cause I cry ♫

658
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,490
This is really good.

659
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:42,360
♫ The things that follow ♫

660
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,310
Thank you,

661
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:47,510
everyone.

662
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:50,710
I didn't invite you to hear that.

663
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:53,160
We just happened to have braised beef stew at home.

664
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,740
And invited everyone for a meal together.

665
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:59,290
Why did we happen to have braised beef stew?

666
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:01,070
Is it someone's birthday?

667
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,650
Why?

668
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:10,340
We just happened to have braised beef stew at home, huh?

669
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,580
♫ How much I miss this ♫

670
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:20,730
♫ Now it's time to forward ♫

671
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:22,900
It's delicious.

672
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,900
I can never manage to get this taste.

673
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,880
You don't need to be a good cook, Mom.

674
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,450
I'm pretty good since I take after Dad.

675
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:34,360
Oh, right.

676
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:38,500
I made your signature crab stew for Kang Haejun last time.

677
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,440
He absolutely loved it.

678
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,480
I must take after you, too.

679
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,060
Don't.

680
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,970
You don't have to cook, either.

681
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:52,620
Why not? You really enjoyed it!

682
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:55,720
I wish you'd only bake cakes.

683
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:00,690
No, I'm probably good at it.

684
00:49:00,690 --> 00:49:02,650
Hey, but how do you bake cakes?

685
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:04,520
You, be quiet.

686
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,650
Gosh, this is nice!

687
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,070
What is?

688
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:19,710
It's nice, isn't it?

689
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,200
I absolutely love it.

690
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,870
I feel the tingling.

691
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:26,860
As if the moment I had imagined had really become a reality.

692
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:30,710
I feel that way, too.

693
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:33,630
It's not like you found your moms.

694
00:49:33,630 --> 00:49:35,320
Why are you so happy?

695
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,540
Are you going to live with your mom now?

696
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:40,610
We didn't talk about those things yet.

697
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:44,080
Tell Ahjumma to move here so we can all live together.

698
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,430
The kids always go up after eating

699
00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:01,910
and hang out there until they're done digesting.

700
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:04,290
It's been 20 years.

701
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:10,500
I can't believe it's already been that long.

702
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,480
I thought...

703
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:19,110
you were quite strange back then.

704
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,490
Why?

705
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:27,250
I wondered if it was possible to cook a warm meal for a stranger.

706
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,810
Gosh.

707
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:35,590
I asked you for too many shameless favors, didn't I?

708
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:40,600
I'll be upset if you keep saying things like that.

709
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,250
Thank you.

710
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:53,130
- The kids are here-
- Tread gently!

711
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:55,350
Why do you enter so abruptly?

712
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:57,910
Oh, you had a guest.

713
00:50:59,210 --> 00:51:00,780
This is...

714
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,230
Haejun's mom.

715
00:51:05,070 --> 00:51:06,500
Hello.
