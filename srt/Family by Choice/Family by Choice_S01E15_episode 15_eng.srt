1
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:12,170


2
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,960
   

3
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,130
   

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,600
   

5
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,850
   

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,840
   

7
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,040
   

8
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,360
 You're so lucky, Dal. 

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,480
 You get to be neighbors with your first love. 

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,320
 And you get to see his face every day. 

11
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,570
 - Do you really like Hae Joon? 
 - Pardon? 

12
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,260
 Let me know if you need me again. 

13
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,080
 I don't even come close. 

14
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,060
 Out of all 27 years of Park Dal's life, 

15
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,170
 you're the handsomest. 

16
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,680
 I like you, Sunbae! 

17
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,970
 You ruined my life! 

18
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,450
 Mom. 

19
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,220
 Must you see me die? 

20
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,930
 Go back to Seoul. 

21
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,810
 I'm not going. 

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,840
 Kim San Ha can't leave. 

23
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,200
 You're the one who handed Kim San Ha to me. 

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,680
 I won't send Kim San Ha back. 

25
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,490
 Yoon Joo Won, I love you. 

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,590
 What's going on? 

27
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,860
 It's as you see. We're dating. 

28
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,980
 Have you gone crazy? Get away from her! 

29
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,240
 It's Yoon Joo Won. She's our sister. 

30
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,880
 I said she's our sister! 

31
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,900
 Hae Joon, Joo Won and I really like each other. 

32
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,900
 Joo Won, he's no good. 

33
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,230
 I'm totally against him! 

34
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,370
 Hey, Hyungnim. 

35
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,980
 Please take it easy on me. 

36
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,530
 - I'll be good. 
 - All right. All right 

37
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:18,150
 That girl, Hui Joo... 

38
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,360
 I like her. 

39
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,670
 Yes, me, too. 

40
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,430
 We won't oppose them or argue. 

41
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,900
 - Right? 
 - Of course. 

42
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,480
 Then, don't oppose us. 

43
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,670
 We are dating. 

44
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,830
 What? 

45
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,940
Oh my.

46
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:03,990
Th-That's nice. That's nice!

47
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,780
They look very good together, right?

48
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,990
Sure, that's good. That's great.

49
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,840
No.

50
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,240
Why not? You just said you wouldn't oppose us.

51
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,250
That you're fine with Hui Joo and Joon Ho.

52
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,300
That you're all right with anyone.

53
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,210
You said you're fine with anyone else.

54
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:30,320
Is San Ha just anyone?

55
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,580
Exactly. He's more trustworthy and reliable.

56
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,300
You like Kim San Ha more than me at times.

57
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,780
I'm telling you no.

58
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,570
Don't just say no outright.

59
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,320
- Give it some thought– 
 - There's nothing to think about.

60
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,810
What's impossible is impossible.

61
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,220
   

62
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,000
Dad was just taken aback. He won't really oppose you both.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,660
At first, I was shocked and was against you, too.

64
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,160
I understand how Dad feels.

65
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,390
Are you disappointed?

66
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,670
Of course, I am.

67
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,970
I wonder if I'm worse than Joon Ho.

68
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,010
You're not. Dad is acting like that out of concern for you.

69
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:35,270
He could be opposing us because Hui Joo is better than me.

70
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,470
You're right. That's exactly right.

71
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,240
Shut your mouth.

72
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,660
When I said I'd marry you, he was against that, too.

73
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,870
He said to stop talking nonsense and didn't even take me seriously.

74
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,770
That was truly nonsense, though.

75
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,150
It won't be good if you keep treating me like this.

76
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,570
Don't you know how important my role is right now?

77
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:57,870
I trust you, Oppa.

78
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,230
Hey, you, too.

79
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,760
"I trust you, Hyungnim."

80
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:06,080
It's natural for him to oppose us.

81
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,660
How could anyone give a daughter like Joo Won so easily?

82
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,430
Any dad would feel she's too precious.

83
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,590
I would feel that way, too.

84
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,110
Don't worry.

85
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,440
I'm right here.

86
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,420
Me, too.

87
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,020
You always tell them it's the heart that counts.

88
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,640
Why are you acting all dramatic out here?

89
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,130
My goodness.

90
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,410
Is it because it's too sudden?

91
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,840
Even so, how could you leave so sternly?

92
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:17,610
Wait, is it because you don't like San Ha as Joo Won's match?

93
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,520
Yes, I don't.

94
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:29,850
A single dad with an only daughter. I wanted to show off my daughter.

95
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,120
But I can't, so I'm sorry.

96
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,320
And I don't like that with him I'd never be able to side with my poor daughter as I wish.

97
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,420
Did I tell you not to show off your daughter? Go ahead.

98
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,050
Is San Ha someone who'd make Joo Won suffer?

99
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,820
Regardless of who's at fault, does San Ha or Joo Won ever openly tell us about their struggles?

100
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:54,030
Do you think they'll ask us to take their side if they fear we will worry?

101
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:59,090
Why do you think about them fighting and suffering first?

102
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:02,880
Is it possible to live constantly laughing all the time?

103
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,100
Is that why you live alone?

104
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,800
Come on. They're different from San Ha's mom and me.

105
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,850
And it's not like they're getting married right now.

106
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,960
That's what I'm worried about.

107
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,960
What happens if they decide they won't work out anymore?

108
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:22,150
Will you tell them to go back to being a good brother and sister?

109
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,460
You know they're not the type to bring this up lightly.

110
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:31,160
That's why I'm against them. That's exactly why.

111
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,200
Will you really make them swear,

112
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,080
"You two better not break up, no matter what happens"

113
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,540
when this is their first relationship?

114
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,440
When my daughter is sad or suffering,

115
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,490
"Come home anytime. I'm on your side, no matter what."

116
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,570
I want to say that.

117
00:07:55,570 --> 00:07:58,930
But it's San Ha. How can I say that?

118
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,950
I'll only think about my Joo Won.

119
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,680
So don't bring this up again.

120
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,890
Mr. Yoon.

121
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,470
Okay, fine. I'll only think about San Ha, too.

122
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:19,350
Yes, I'll only worry about him.

123
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:24,290
Whatever San Ha wants, I'm also on his side, no matter what.

124
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,630
Honestly...

125
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,080
   

126
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:57,970
♫  Even if you don't say where it hurts  ♫

127
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:01,210
♫  I know  ♫

128
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:06,940
♫  Like a wildflower growing on its own  ♫

129
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,840
♫  The love I've kept hidden  ♫

130
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,700
    
 ♫  It hurts  ♫

131
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,990
 Dad. 

132
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:23,520
Yes.

133
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,860
Dad.

134
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,260
 Yes. 

135
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,860
Are you really against us?

136
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,010
 You should at least tell us the reason. 

137
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:41,430
Can't you give us a hint on how Oppa and I can convince you?

138
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,800
Dad.

139
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,920
Yes?

140
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,050
Do you remember what the neighborhood ahjummas used to say when I was little?

141
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:59,440
That you're the daughter of the kalguksu restaurant single dad.

142
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,980
Yes.

143
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,730
Even the children with moms would run around with their hair in a mess.

144
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:09,730
 But how was my ponytail always so neat and tidy? 

145
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,290
How were my clothes always so clean?

146
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,640
They asked how you raised me like that on your own.

147
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,270
I didn't want it to show that you didn't have a mom.

148
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,850
 Exactly. 

149
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:29,030
I grew up well without it showing that I didn't have a mom.

150
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:35,460
You raised me properly with a lot of love.

151
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,650
You can trust me.

152
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:42,930
♫  My wish, as it's smaller than my height  ♫

153
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,210
Dad.

154
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,700
 Yes? 

155
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,990
I'm sorry.

156
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:59,000
♫  But in days of joy, and in days of pain  ♫

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,900
♫  I will always, as I have  ♫

158
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:15,480
♫  Be with you, like my breath  ♫

159
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,790
- Okay, Hae Won, let's go. 
 - Yes.

160
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,260
- What do you want to eat? 
 - Chicken.

161
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,380
- You want chicken? 
 - Yes.

162
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:30,020
- Let's go. 
 - Yes!

163
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:32,250
- How many will you eat? 
 - Two chickens.

164
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,930
- Can you eat two? 
 - Yes.

165
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,410
Please...

166
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,430
give me food.

167
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,340
Do you want a glass?

168
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,430
Yes.

169
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:04,430
I've been thinking about how to tell you.

170
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:09,760
I thought you might say, "Great! Good for you."

171
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,980
And give us your approval.

172
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,700
I thought about how nice that would be.

173
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,560
Didn't you think I'd be against it?

174
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,700
No, you have so many reasons to oppose us.

175
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,620
If you said you would never approve of us,

176
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,270
I wasn't confident I'd be able to find a solution.

177
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:33,610
I reassured Joo Won not to worry.

178
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:36,500
But I was scared I wouldn't be able to do anything.

179
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,300
So I hoped you wouldn't

180
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,790
be against us.

181
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:47,200
Why make things complicated when you already know?

182
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,900
Why even start it?

183
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,840
You should've cut her off in advance.

184
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:58,040
You should've told her, "Let's treasure each other as siblings."

185
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,900
Even if Joo Won liked you,

186
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,070
you should've discouraged her.

187
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,160
I couldn't.

188
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,780
It was impossible,

189
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,470
so I clung to her.

190
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,240
My precious Joo Won.

191
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,390
My daughter is everything to me.

192
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:27,000
I'll do everything I can.

193
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,710
I'll wait until you approve of us, whether it takes a year or two.

194
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:36,270
I'll resolve all of your worries.

195
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,600
"Resolve"?

196
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,690
What can you resolve?

197
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,100
Because of me...

198
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,400
she secretly looked

199
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,130
at her mom's photo, not to upset me.

200
00:14:55,130 --> 00:15:00,070
So it doesn't show that she's motherless and to act indifferent to people whispering,

201
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,970
she insisted you were her real brother with a different last name.

202
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,930
And she wore a smile every day. How do you think she felt?

203
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,360
How on earth will you resolve the fact

204
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:15,860
that Joo Won is that kind of girl?

205
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:21,220
I'll make sure she doesn't have a hard time.

206
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,810
I'll make sure she doesn't struggle.

207
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:32,850
San Ha.

208
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,300
You know I just want

209
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:43,600
Joo Won to live ordinarily like everyone else, without having to try so hard.

210
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,170
That's all.

211
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:50,130
I'm sorry.

212
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,770
I'm fine.

213
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:52,030
I always told myself ever since developing feelings for Joo Won.

214
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,350
"I want to grow up

215
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:02,660
and live ordinary lives with her like everyone else."

216
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:10,830
I want to live like that with Joo Won, Ahjusshi.

217
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,530
You didn't have to buy this.

218
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,370
You probably skipped breakfast again.

219
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,830
It's fine since I usually skip it.

220
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:01,280
Exactly. Start eating breakfast from now on.

221
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,890
All right. Let's eat.

222
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,100
Gosh, it looks delicious.

223
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,060
Let's eat. Here.

224
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,860
Do you want to live with me?

225
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,200
Never mind. I'll live with you.

226
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,600
I planned to move in with Dad, but you live alone.

227
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,340
Dad has Ahjusshi and the others as well.

228
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,500
I've lived alone for so long that I'm used to it.

229
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,300
As if. You can't fool me twice.

230
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,410
Let's move together to Dad's neighborhood.

231
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:46,950
- Hae Joon– 
 - I'll do what I want.

232
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:57,340
What's this?

233
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,550
Oh, this?

234
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:02,480
Jeong Jae sent me a few of your photos.

235
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,420
Isn't there anything else? It's embarrassing.

236
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,340
How so?

237
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,560
All right, then.

238
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,540
- What about this one? 
 - No.

239
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,960
- This one? 
 - No, something else.

240
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,220
How about this one? I like this one.

241
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:23,340
They all came out nice.

242
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,490
You don't play basketball these days, do you?

243
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,510
- I don't. 
 - Why not?

244
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,400
What's the use when I can't even go pro?

245
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:43,100
You have the same expression here as you did as a baby.

246
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,260
This is exactly how you looked as an excited baby.

247
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,950
Is that right?

248
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:52,500
Do you have to play professionally?

249
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,800
Did you learn basketball to go pro?

250
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,520
Why don't you play when it makes you this happy?

251
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,280
Something is off. Tell me the truth.

252
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,150
Where were you last night? Why are you changing the subject?

253
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,970
 Are you at work? 

254
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,080
Did you visit Dad?

255
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,790
 You have me in the palm of your hands. 

256
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,180
You couldn't get his approval, could you?

257
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,560
 Yes, I couldn't. 

258
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,950
Did you get scolded?

259
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,990
 No. 

260
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,290
Stop by the store later.

261
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,700
 Why? 

262
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,760
Because I miss you.

263
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,210
You can see me now, then.

264
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,400
So is he at the hospital right now? 
    

265
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,180
I'll be right there.

266
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,910
He's fine. His forehead is a bit bruised, and his ribs are slightly injured.

267
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,580
See? Hui Joo is taking care of him.

268
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,580
The intern isn't here, so don't worry too much.

269
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,440
Also, look here.

270
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,750
Y-You have me here.

271
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,690
I told you I didn't have to come to the hospital.

272
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,990
Listen to your boyfriend sometimes, Yoon Joo Won.

273
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,490
Be gentle.

274
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,480
W-Wait, one second!

275
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,590
Wait, really? Is this real?

276
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,710
Dr. Lee, are you free?

277
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,050
You know we have a group wellness checkup, right?

278
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,320
Follow me.

279
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,210
Hurry up and go.

280
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:47,320
Elders, please come here and fill out the questionnaire in order.

281
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,970
If you need any help, I'm here for you.

282
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,340
Isn't that Mr. Yoon?

283
00:21:55,340 --> 00:22:00,740
Mr. Yoon said he couldn't come to the wellness checkup because he was hungover.

284
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,300
What's this? What happened? Did you hurt your head?

285
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,660
I'm really fine.

286
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,470
What on earth did you do for San Ha's face to end up this way?

287
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,910
I mean, I was just...

288
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,010
It's not Joo Won's fault. I was the one–

289
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:19,470
I'm sure you'd deny it even if it was Joo Won's fault!

290
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,260
How upset will your father be to see this?

291
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,960
I'm really fine.

292
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,150
Aigoo, what will we do about that?

293
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,160
Hurry up and put it on.

294
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:47,940
It is you! I followed you because I thought I saw you.

295
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,040
My goodness. What's wrong with his face?

296
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,330
Did you do it?

297
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,980
I did do it, but...

298
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,950
- Madam, you came for the wellness checkup, right? 
 - Yes.

299
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,500
Your turn must be coming up. Let's hurry up and go.

300
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,720
Never a dull moment, seriously.

301
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,650
Aigoo, what if it leaves a scar?

302
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,260
If it's not serious, it's fine. I'll get going.

303
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,970
Dad.

304
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:17,260
I have to go to the store because Madam isn't there, either.

305
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,060
How badly were you hurt?

306
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,800
I didn't need to come to the hospital.

307
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,350
But Joo Won insisted I had to, so I came.

308
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,120
It's fine, then.

309
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,380
Joo Won must've been scared.

310
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,540
How did you come so quickly?

311
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,830
You said you would only think about Joo Won.

312
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,180
I'll get going now.

313
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,800
If you came worried about San Ha, eat with us before you go.

314
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,590
How can a business owner eat when his store is unattended?

315
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,280
Aigoo, seriously.

316
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,690
I think I'll have to go back inside.

317
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,870
The neighborhood elders are here, too.

318
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:50,990
I'll call you later.

319
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:52,880
Yes, go back inside.

320
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,860
I'll drop off Joo Won.

321
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,700
You got scared, right?

322
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,930
It's fine.

323
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:02,840
San Ha is so calm that he has never even had a bone broken in his life.

324
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,290
Just look at Hae Joon. His entire body is full of scars and bruises.

325
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:09,580
They're all like that. Don't worry.

326
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,270
- I'm sorry. 
 - Sorry for what?

327
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,070
Don't say such a thing.

328
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,390
Shall we eat before we go?

329
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,340
Should I make you something tasty at the bakery? Brunch?

330
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:25,020
Sounds great. Let's go. Come on now.

331
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,500
Is your leg okay?

332
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,020
It's okay.

333
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,990
Let's talk for a bit.

334
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:55,140
I'm late to a meeting.

335
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,640
Taxi! Taxi!

336
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,660
Let's talk on the way, then.

337
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,110
Get in.

338
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:16,040
I couldn't even confirm properly because you left like that.

339
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,340
Pardon? Confirm what?

340
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,880
You said you liked me, didn't you?

341
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,880
Yes.

342
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,340
And you never liked Kim San Ha?

343
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,630
Yes.

344
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,870
But why didn't you tell me until now?

345
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,780
Because you don't like me, Sunbae.

346
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:52,520
Did I not?

347
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,830
"Did I not"?

348
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,130
But why'd you suddenly tell me?

349
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:01,160
Pardon?

350
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,710
Why'd you suddenly tell me something you didn't tell me ten years ago?

351
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:09,780
Well, that's...

352
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,890
I got carried away that day.

353
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:15,180
I said it on impulse, too.

354
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:20,060
I regretted it a lot after confessing like that.

355
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,050
That's fine, then.

356
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:26,790
If it was said on impulse, I'll just pretend I never heard you.

357
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,980
Just continue to think of me as Joo Won's oppa.

358
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,250
Ahjusshi, please drop me off here.

359
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,020
Do you want to get off here? It's in the middle of the road.

360
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,720
It's fine. You can just drop me off.

361
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:49,410
Just forget it.

362
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,910
You're like a sister I cherish, second only to Joo Won.

363
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,100
It'll continue like that.

364
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,140
Please drive her safely.

365
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:11,970
 Let me see. 
   

366
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,900
Does it hurt a lot?

367
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,170
- It hurts. 
 - Wait here. I'll go grab some ice–

368
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:26,200
I should've told Ahjusshi earlier, "My head is messed up because Joo Won hit my head."

369
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,060
"She has to take care of me now for good."

370
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:36,210
If you were hurt any worse, Dad might've beaten me to death.

371
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,260
- I'm sure you're wrong. 
 - Honestly.

372
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,790
Didn't you see Dad's face earlier?

373
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:47,810
Dad must be against me, not you, Oppa.

374
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:49,500
Joo Won.

375
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,690
I really like Ahjusshi.

376
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:56,740
I want to like you more than Ahjusshi does.

377
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:59,090
I can't lose to him.

378
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,170
But Ahjusshi is so strong, I must try harder.

379
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:06,120
Yes, you need to try harder.

380
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:09,770
Did my dad eat here before he left?

381
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:12,200
Yes, he said he loved my brunch

382
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,730
since he always ate Korean food my dad made.

383
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,310
Dad doesn't like to eat bread in the morning, though.

384
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:19,410
I don't think so.

385
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:23,580
He said he wanted to eat the brunch I made every day from now on.

386
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,980
Gosh, that's great. How nice.

387
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,930
Didn't you just eat before coming in?

388
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,940
Hey, this is dessert.

389
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:37,060
- Sorry? 
 - Well, you see...

390
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:43,040
Joo Won gave me a bunch of bread and grass, saying it was brunch or something.

391
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,730
But I became hungry soon after.

392
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:49,160
They say a man living alone has the hardest time eating meals on time.

393
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,200
I guess you don't have that problem because you have Mr. Yoon.

394
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:59,640
For your information, I eat whatever is given to me, whether it's bread or grass.

395
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,690
Gosh, to think about it, Mr. Yoon didn't raise just San Ha.

396
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,260
He also raised you, more or less.

397
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:13,450
Hey... what's a good way to ask your in-laws to look favorably upon your child?

398
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,350
When I went to meet my wife's family for the first time, my mother was really worried.

399
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:24,960
Saying there's nothing to like about a policeman son-in-law.

400
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,110
What's so bad about you, Lieutenant Kim?

401
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:30,420
That's not the point. I heard they're just saddened.

402
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,010
- Really? 
 - Anyhow,

403
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:37,020
for the first meeting, prepare lots of what her parents might like.

404
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,400
Right.

405
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,010
He went empty-handed with no plan and said, "We're dating."

406
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:44,300
Of course, that's not going to work. Aigoo.

407
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:48,050
I should've taught him these things sooner.

408
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:51,370
Excuse me, Madam. How much is that one?

409
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:04,440
Aigoo. What's with you?

410
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,640
My goodness...

411
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,570
Is it something Joo Won did again?

412
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:15,820
What do you mean "again"? Joo Won doesn't cause trouble all the time.

413
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:18,490
She cares for her brothers so much.

414
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,330
That's true.

415
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:23,530
I saw how San Ha

416
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:29,410
was taking care of the neighborhood folks in that white gown.

417
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:34,120
How did he grow up so well? Even I was so proud of him.

418
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,630
That's all thanks to you and Joo Won.

419
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,540
Think of when he first came to this area.

420
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:45,350
His face was...

421
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,340
so full of worries.

422
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:52,760
Whenever he was being cold to people, he was just like his mother, you know.

423
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,490
Madam, please watch what you say.

424
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,170
Don't think like that.

425
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:01,090
Because you say those things out loud...

426
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,320
Never mind.

427
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,900
   

428
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,760
Oh, my, my...

429
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,700
- My goodness. 
 - Yes...

430
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,640
Are you okay?

431
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,590
Yes.

432
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,100
Well...

433
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,530
I'm sorry for startling you.

434
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:11,150
Not at all. I'm the one who suddenly showed up without calling...

435
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,510
Are you filming a movie?

436
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,870
Madam, did you finish trimming the cabbage?

437
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,380
- Of course. 
 - I see.

438
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,460
What about the anchovies?

439
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:38,330
I finished them ages ago.

440
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:45,660
Hae Joon's mom, how are you still the same? You didn't age a bit.

441
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,280
That isn't so.

442
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,620
I mean it.

443
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:54,630
I got so scared because you looked exactly the same as when you first came here.

444
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,900
I thought you were a ghost.

445
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,960
Where are those flies coming from?

446
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,110
I didn't even thank you properly all this time.

447
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,030
Thank you.

448
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:15,920
I mean, I'm not trying to get thanked.

449
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:22,010
But do you know how upset I was after I made the mistake of setting you two up?

450
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,670
- Madam, I... 
 - Yes.

451
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,490
You need to get going now.

452
00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:29,240
- What? 
 - You should get off early.

453
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,890
You got a checkup and had blood drawn. You can't stand too long.

454
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,680
Please go home.

455
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:41,730
As I was saying, you have to take responsibility for Mr. Yoon,

456
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:45,330
who aged so much while raising Hae Joon. Okay?

457
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:50,600
G-Get home safe.

458
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,030
Well...

459
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:59,050
I heard Park Dal publicly confessed to Hae Joon.

460
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:01,980
So what did Kang Hae Joon say?

461
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,030
You can ask the man himself.

462
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:09,290
What does Yoon Joo Won like about this brat?

463
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,020
It's true Joo Won is too good for me.

464
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,410
Of course.

465
00:34:18,410 --> 00:34:20,980
Do Hui Joo, don't waste time dillydallying.

466
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:25,010
Just tell Kang Hae Joon properly and get rejected quickly.

467
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,380
Hey.

468
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,760
One sure thing is you have no chance with Kang Hae Joon.

469
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:32,710
Just forget him before you get rejected and embarrass yourself.

470
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:36,990
We are a small, tight group of friends. We should tell it like it is.

471
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,260
What a jerk.

472
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:45,350
Okay.

473
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:55,470
Hey, is the basketball class you mentioned last time still recruiting?

474
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,080
Really?

475
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,590
Really?

476
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,900
Are you really going to play basketball again?

477
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,100
Yes.

478
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,690
I'll call them right now, okay?

479
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,360
Right now.

480
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,770
By the way, why did you suddenly change your mind?

481
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:17,530
It's an important decision, so why'd you suddenly...

482
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:22,180
Could it be because of Dal?

483
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,370
What does Dal have to do with this?

484
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:27,090
The entire town knows Dal publicly confessed to you.

485
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:31,030
Why? Did you decide to date Dal?

486
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:35,810
Aren't you trying to spread your wings again to impress her?

487
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:38,240
Are you writing a novel?

488
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,140
It's because of my mom.

489
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:44,960
My mom wants to see me energetic again.

490
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,470
And I also...

491
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,970
Well, anyhow, that's the story.

492
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:51,650
Is that so?

493
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,430
By the way, does everyone really know?

494
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:59,830
I'm sure everyone in Haedong knows.

495
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:03,900
Why? Did you reject her?

496
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,610
Did Dal get rejected?

497
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:08,060
What do you mean get rejected?

498
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,810
It's not like that.

499
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:13,340
If you didn't accept her, that's rejection. What else is it?

500
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,650
 This is what Jae Eun told me. 

501
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:23,570
 When Dal became a lawyer in Seoul and came back to Haedong, 

502
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,470
 her mom was furious 

503
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:29,590
 because Dal moved to the countryside instead of working at a law firm in Seoul. 

504
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:33,720
 So she tells her to go on blind dates all the time to marry well, at least. 

505
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:40,150
 To be honest, you two wouldn't have lasted long, even if you said yes. 

506
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,850
 Her mom wouldn't have left Dal alone. 

507
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,040
 I like you, Sunbae! 

508
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,190
 Now that I think about it, she might look fine on the outside, 

509
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,650
 but I feel sorry for her. 

510
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,570
Gosh, this is driving me nuts. Why is it bothering me?

511
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:06,830
Ah, forget it. She and I aren't a good match anyway.

512
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:10,520
She seems smart, but why would she like me and go through all that?

513
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,120
 Who on earth is it? 

514
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,200
You ruined the blind date, saying you're seeing someone.

515
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,150
How bad is he that you can't even bring him to see me?

516
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,830
Park Dal.

517
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:26,300
It's not because he's bad. It's me. I'm lacking.

518
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,730
What?

519
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:30,420
He doesn't like me.

520
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,290
What does he do for a living?

521
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,170
How idiotic were you for a man to reject you?

522
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,670
What did I tell you? It's because you're so pathetic–

523
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,370
It's because you're like this.

524
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,410
Because you say, I'm pathetic, lacking, and stupid all the time.

525
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:54,030
That's why I can't even tell the person I like that I like him.

526
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:59,180
Just like an idiot, I ruined it all while walking on eggshells around him.

527
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:03,010
Even my mom thinks nothing of me

528
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:06,650
and tries to put me out for sale on blind dates.

529
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,230
Who'd ever like me?

530
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:11,640
I want you to meet a man of your level and upgrade your life.

531
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,550
I don't want you to meet some nobody and ruin your life–

532
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:16,530
Mom!

533
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:22,260
The man I like doesn't like me.

534
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,570
That's why I'm upset.

535
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:30,580
My heart is aching.

536
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:34,570
I don't care about levels and upgrading my life.

537
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:39,030
It feels like my life is ruined because that man doesn't like me.

538
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,890
We will take the cast off tomorrow as planned.

539
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:58,370
At this rate, he could get discharged in two weeks.

540
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,230
My goodness, Doctor.

541
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,190
Thank you.

542
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:04,570
Thank you so much, Doctor.

543
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:09,040
After today, you'll feel a lot better.

544
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,460
What about my mom?

545
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,670
Will my mom feel better, too?

546
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,800
My mom told me this.

547
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,890
It was the easiest when I was in her belly.

548
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:23,850
Now that I'm born, I'm giving her a hard time.

549
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:27,470
So will you go back into mommy's belly?

550
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:32,420
You said it's nice to have me in a cast and be still for once.

551
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:36,590
In that case, you'll have to live with a cast for life because of me, right?

552
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:40,080
No more soccer. No more playground?

553
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,910
You don't like your mom having a hard time, right?

554
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,300
I was also the same.

555
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:58,590
When my mom was having a hard time, I said I'd never do it again.

556
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:05,170
So did you quit soccer and riding bicycles even though you didn't want to?

557
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,550
Yes.

558
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,110
Really?

559
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,700
Yes.

560
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,710
Though I stopped playing soccer and riding bicycles,

561
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,370
my mom wasn't happy at all.

562
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:19,120
Why?

563
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:23,120
I guess my mom...

564
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:27,500
wasn't struggling because of those things.

565
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:35,060
What was it, then?

566
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:41,500
I think you can talk about that with your mom, Woo Hyeon.

567
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,670
Well, then.

568
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,850
Can I still play soccer?

569
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,080
Maybe.

570
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,740
- I'll see you tomorrow. 
 - Thank you.

571
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,470
Good night.

572
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,230
   

573
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:21,570
   

574
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,430
 What? 

575
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,740
I was wondering how you're doing.

576
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,260
 Why do you care after sending me off alone so you can live as you please? 

577
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,810
I'll visit you next week.

578
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:40,970
I have something to tell you.

579
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:47,520
   

580
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,790
 Are you on night duty today again? 

581
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:13,370
 Yes. Don't stay out too late and get home safe. 

582
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,960
 Get some sleep here and there. 

583
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,630
 Don't worry about me. 

584
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,220
 Text me when you get home. 

585
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:23,070
 Yes. 

586
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,310
I came here on the off chance. And the lights were on.

587
00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:57,840
Please have a seat.

588
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:27,590
Would you like something to drink?

589
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,260
No.

590
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,570
Are you dating my San Ha?

591
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:39,310
Yes.

592
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,530
Sit down.

593
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,930
San Ha said he would visit because he had something to tell me.

594
00:43:54,930 --> 00:43:57,360
I figured it had to do with you.

595
00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:03,610
I won't tell San Ha I'm against you.

596
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:06,120
It's not like he'd listen even if I do.

597
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:12,760
So I'd like it... if you could just break up with my San Ha.

598
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:25,250
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to voicemail. 

599
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,660
 After you're connected– 
   

600
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,290
 Yes? 

601
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,990
- Well– 
 -  Joo Won spent the night at the bakery last night. 

602
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:45,760
 She used to stay up at the bakery frequently before... 

603
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,280
Yoon Joo Won.

604
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,350
Oh, you're here.

605
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,060
Did you sleep here?

606
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:08,950
Yes, I didn't like the new summer menu.

607
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:11,600
But why didn't you tell me you were sleeping here?

608
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,910
I didn't?

609
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:15,350
Yoon Joo Won.

610
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:17,440
I'm still a business owner.

611
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,140
I've been neglecting the store while having too much fun with you.

612
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:27,080
There's really nothing wrong, right?

613
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,980
Nothing is wrong.

614
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,850
Look at the time already.

615
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:38,640
Did you eat? What should we eat...

616
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,480
Are you okay?

617
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,090
I think I worked too hard.

618
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,970
I'm really okay.

619
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:02,260
You have a slight fever, too.

620
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,960
Joo Won. Take the medicine and sleep.

621
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:25,140
Get some sleep.

622
00:46:51,790 --> 00:46:55,370
 So I'd like it if you could just break up with my San Ha. 

623
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:59,770
 When San Ha's having a hard time, it's possible you can console him. 

624
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:02,300
 That was the case ever since you two were young. 

625
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:10,130
 It's possible for San Ha to rely on you because of me. It can happen. 

626
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:14,640
 However, what if I stop giving San Ha a hard time? 

627
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:17,300
 I'll let San Ha live in peace now. 

628
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:23,610
  Wouldn't it be good for him to live a normal life 

629
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:26,730
 with someone who doesn't know about his scars? 

630
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:30,840
 Someone I can also live comfortably with as a family. 

631
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,660
 You and I can't do that. Isn't that right? 

632
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,610
 I don't like you as San Ha's match. 

633
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:47,030
 Will you let him lose his mom forever? 

634
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:57,580
 What you both are doing isn't love. 

635
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,560
 It's delusional. 

636
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:05,000
 It's because you grew up under unusual circumstances. 

637
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:13,030
   

638
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:16,820
   

639
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:22,640
Thank you.

640
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,580
Hey, you came, Dal.

641
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:49,640
Yes, there's something Joo Won asked me to do.

642
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,200
I see.

643
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,440
She could've asked me.

644
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:10,440
I-Is something missing?

645
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,580
I'll look for it.

646
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:15,140
   

647
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:22,440
I'll get going first.

648
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,390
Yes. Okay.

649
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,070
By the way...

650
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,930
I don't need an oppa.

651
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:52,140
You don't have to say I'm a sister like Joo Won.

652
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,610
Thank you for caring about me.

653
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,390
I came to win against you.

654
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,190
What?

655
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:27,620
I came to cry, plead, and beg you to let me do what I want.

656
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,340
To ask you to look at your son's pain.

657
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,480
I'm here to beg.

658
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,440
Mom.

659
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:01,970
I don't resent you.

660
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:06,670
I just...

661
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:10,070
didn't want you to be sad.

662
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:18,360
 You made my life like this! 

663
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:19,960
 I didn't want you to be in pain. 

664
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,530
 That's hot. 

665
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:25,500
 So Hui! How on earth... 

666
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,540
 San Ha, get some ice. Hurry up! 

667
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:30,650
 Sit down. 

668
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:32,880
 Hurry up with the ice! 

669
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,900
 You should've been careful. 

670
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,540
 It hurts so much. 

671
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:43,200
 So I couldn't be honest with you. Not even once. 

672
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:46,570
 - That it was so hot. 
 - Are you okay? 

673
00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:49,120
 That it really hurt. 

674
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:52,330
 I couldn't even show you the scar. 

675
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:58,300
Why are you telling me that now?

676
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,250
Mom.

677
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:19,090
 Mom! Mom! 

678
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:21,310
 If you weren't in pain... 

679
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:25,010
 If you weren't sad... 

680
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:29,880
 I thought we'd also get closer one day. 

681
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:33,250
I'm sorry.

682
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,820
I shouldn't have pretended to be okay.

683
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,670
I shouldn't have acted like an adult.

684
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:45,870
I should've told you everything sooner.

685
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,630
 That I was hurting, too. 

686
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:53,280
That I was really sad, too.

687
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,820
That I'm so scared...

688
00:52:59,350 --> 00:53:01,660
and that I needed a hug.

689
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:08,180
 That I'm also tormented because I feel like So Jeong died because of me. 

690
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,870
That...

691
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,130
I really miss So Jeong, too.

692
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,360
 So, Mom... 

693
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:26,630
I should have asked sooner that we should live together.

694
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:35,510
♫  We didn’t know the word "goodbye"  ♫

695
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,750
Mom.

696
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,370
We...

697
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,690
can be happy.

698
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,160
We can be happy.

699
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:16,070


700
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:28,070
What brings you here at this hour?

701
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:31,430
I missed you, Dad.

702
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:34,570
You should've come inside, then. Why are you sitting there?

703
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:38,630
What's with the long face?

704
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:39,780
Are you sick?

705
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,470
Overworked.

706
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:44,030
Running a small business is tough.

707
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:49,150
That's why I told you to hire more people.

708
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:52,720
I think I've been saying that to you for the past 20 years.

709
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:57,130
Dad.

710
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:59,370
If you're asking for me to approve of San Ha–

711
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:02,110
That's not it.

712
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:03,650
Then what?

713
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:08,910
What is love?

714
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:14,320
"Love"?

715
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,610
How do you love Kang Hae Joon like that?

716
00:55:18,610 --> 00:55:21,270
Given your dad is against your boyfriend,

717
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:24,640
isn't it funny to ask him what love is?

718
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,420
I'm your daughter.

719
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,380
We have the same blood.

720
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:31,970
It comes naturally, so loving me is easier.

721
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:35,750
But Kim San Ha and Kang Hae Joon are strangers to you.

722
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,510
But how do you love them so dearly?

723
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:41,620
I bathed them, clothed them, and fed them with my own hands.

724
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:44,760
It's not a matter of sharing blood or not.

725
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,820
What about Mom?

726
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:52,690
What was it like to love Mom?

727
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:55,580
You didn't raise her.

728
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:06,110
It felt like your mom was my entire world.

729
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,850
Is it like that for everyone else, too?

730
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,770
I would assume so.

731
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:21,320
You feel like you can't live without that person.

732
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:25,050
Like everything will be okay as long as you're with that person.

733
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:29,850
I see.

734
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:32,530
"I see"?

735
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:37,390
Did you break my heart when San Ha doesn't even feel like your entire world?

736
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:41,900
So it is like that for everyone?

737
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,310
That's a relief.

738
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:50,080
I wondered if, because we are a bit different

739
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,750
due to our complicated circumstances,

740
00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:55,960
we think we are the only ones for each other.

741
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,070
And what if we mistake that for love?

742
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:00,790
That thought suddenly crossed my mind.

743
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:04,910
I don't think Kim San Ha can live without me.

744
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:09,520
And no matter how I think about it, I can't live without him, either.

745
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:12,230
That's a relief.

746
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:15,990
It's a relief that other people feel like that, too.

747
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:18,930
Thanks, Dad.

748
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:21,750
I didn't approve of him yet.

749
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:23,200
Yes.

750
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,580
When did you grow up like this?

751
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:30,040
♫  I missed it  ♫

 I'll arrive in an hour. I'll go to the café. 

757
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,150
 Okay, I'll be waiting.

Yes.

770
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:12,460
I had a profound realization yesterday.

771
00:59:13,410 --> 00:59:15,110
About what?

772
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:23,140
Kim San Ha, I really...
