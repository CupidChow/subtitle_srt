1
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:11,420
[Mermaid Legend]

2
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:16,770
Come here.

3
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,110
Come here.

4
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,650
Come.

5
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,020
Everything is ready

6
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,270
except for one thing.

7
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,310
Granny.

8
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,480
The Heartlock Pill is indeed effective
against greedy people.

9
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,060
Of course.

10
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,020
Granny's curse is definitely effective.

11
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,440
We will find
the Phantom Physician Tribe soon.

12
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,110
Then, we will use
this Phantom Soul Flute

13
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,860
and capture all these evil people.

14
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,860
Capture all of them.

15
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,440
Good.

16
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:06,230
Who is killing my vibe?

17
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,520
Madam Xi,

18
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,980
it's a fox.

19
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,230
Foul beast,

20
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,110
how dare you ruin our plan.

21
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,360
I'll kill you
and make a coat for Granny.

22
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:30,810
Hmph.

23
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,770
This little bastard is so annoying.

24
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,150
The show

25
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,690
is just beginning.

26
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,020
Heaven and Earth.

27
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,060
Laws of Nature.

28
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:47,150
I command you!

29
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:47,860
Break!

30
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:03,980
Get lost!

31
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,020
Hmph!

32
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,610
Trying to escape?

33
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:31,810
Exorcist!

34
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,310
Exorcist!

35
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,230
Town Chief.

36
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,360
It's settled.

37
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:58,810
All of you may come out now.

38
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,520
Hurry.

39
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,150
All of them are gone.

40
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,770
Town Chief,

41
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,360
the evil being has been subdued.

42
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,520
Don't worry.

43
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,150
They will not disturb you anymore.

44
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,230
You are amazing.

45
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,690
Master,

46
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:28,310
here's a small token.

47
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:36,360
Come closer.

48
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:36,900
Fine.

49
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,980
Close your eyes.

50
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:51,480
Nice.

51
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,770
Is it nice?

52
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,020
Yes!

53
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,150
Nice.

54
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,150
Exorcist, take care.

55
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:11,860
Thank you, Exorcist!

56
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,060
Little dear.

57
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,270
How did you get hurt?

58
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:10,810
Don't be afraid.

59
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,020
Come.

60
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,810
Little dear,

61
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,310
does it mean you're following me?

62
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,310
That troublemaker at my house

63
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,440
was as obedient as you
when I first found it.

64
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,060
Whatever.

65
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,310
I'll take you back
so you can be Buku's friend.

66
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,810
Come here.

67
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:11,980
The flowers weren't blooming

68
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,110
when I passed by previously.

69
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,940
What's wrong?

70
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,270
I'm sure it hurts.

71
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,060
Who is there?

72
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,060
See no evil!

73
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,020
See no evil!

74
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,310
I am Tao Ran from Yunyin Town.
I went out to pick some herbs

75
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,360
and passed by this place.

76
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:43,770
I didn't know you were here.

77
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,690
I'm sorry

78
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,940
for offending you.

79
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:51,770
Miss.

80
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,690
Miss?

81
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,230
Where is she?

82
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,150
Could it be that my eyes
played tricks on me?

83
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,110
Young man.

84
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,690
Why are you stepping on my clothes

85
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,860
and not letting go?

86
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:32,810
Miss.

87
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,310
Taking a bath in daylight out here

88
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,560
is indecent

89
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,810
and not right.

90
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,610
If you meet bad people,

91
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:40,770
then...

92
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,650
What?

93
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,610
Miss,

94
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,020
I advise you to put on your clothes
and go back immediately.

95
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,020
Hey!

96
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,060
Young man.

97
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,520
You ruined my gauze dress.

98
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,310
So, what should I do?

99
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,310
I...

100
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,360
Miss.

101
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:04,690
Men and women
should not have intimate contact.

102
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,310
I advise you to...

103
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,770
Master!

104
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,610
- Physician Tao!
- Physician Tao!

105
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:10,150
Master!

106
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:10,690
Physician Tao!

107
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,650
Old man,

108
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,480
you worry me.

109
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:15,520
Old man,

110
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,060
what are you looking at?

111
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,060
Kids shouldn't be looking.

112
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,610
What's that noise?

113
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:22,900
Where?

114
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,060
Master,

115
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,310
where did you find
this little cute thing?

116
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,610
I picked it up on my way
while I was gathering herbs.

117
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,020
Oh.

118
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,980
Something serious happened in town.

119
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,060
Last night, seven men died in the town.

120
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,310
Hurry up.

121
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,230
How can you afford
to walk animals at a time like this?

122
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:42,520
Why are you dragging me around?

123
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,400
Let's go.

124
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,900
- Hurry up!
- Wait for me!

125
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,110
Hurry up!

126
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,400
Old man, wait for me!

127
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,650
What a fool.

128
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,900
Wow.

129
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,650
What kind of poison is this?

130
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:15,270
It's my first time
seeing something like this.

131
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,730
I can't recognize it

132
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,690
at once.

133
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,110
There's also a slight fishy smell.

134
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:30,560
Who do you think would use poison

135
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,690
in the middle of nowhere?

136
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,900
A exorcist came to town
a few days ago.

137
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,400
Do you think it's related to him?

138
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,810
Constable, watch your mouth.

139
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,230
It's him?

140
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:52,480
What?

141
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:53,360
Do you know him?

142
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,060
Calm down. Don't panic.

143
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,650
I've been here the whole day.

144
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,310
All of you have disturbed my sleep.

145
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,520
Don't accuse others without evidence.

146
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,770
In my opinion...

147
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,150
What do you think?

148
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,400
Is it caused by evil beings
that fell into flour again?

149
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:19,230
Well,

150
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,480
you are right.

151
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,690
This is not an act by ordinary people.

152
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,230
The poison

153
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,810
is not ordinary either.

154
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,730
Isn't that nonsense?

155
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,110
My old man
is not an ordinary physician.

156
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,560
If he can't recognize this poison,
it must be extraordinary.

157
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:38,270
Heh.

158
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,480
Young man.

159
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,190
An incense bag from Beidou Sect
that wards off evil and protects you.

160
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,310
Fifteen wen for one.

161
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,690
- Who is he?
- Liar.

162
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,980
Both of you,

163
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,940
calm down.

164
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,360
I still have more.

165
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,400
Fifteen wen for two.

166
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,690
I can't go any lower than that.

167
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,110
Do you want them?

168
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,360
Go away!

169
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,400
Those who are not involved

170
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,150
should leave immediately.

171
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,900
Interfering with official business

172
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:07,900
is punishable by death!

173
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,730
Get it?

174
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,520
Fine.

175
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,650
I'm leaving.

176
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,190
It seems like Yunyin Town is not safe.

177
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:17,860
Go!

178
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,810
I'm leaving.

179
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,810
Stay away from this place!

180
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:21,980
I haven't paid you.

181
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,610
It's free.

182
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,690
Why are you spacing out?

183
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,270
Come and help.

184
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,150
All right.

185
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:38,480
Little dear?

186
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,060
Little dear?

187
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,770
Little dear?

188
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,900
A fire?

189
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,230
Who is it?

190
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,770
Who is inside?

191
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,610
Who are you?

192
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,860
Brat!

193
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,690
If you take another step forward,

194
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:19,810
I'll scream.

195
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,690
Hmph.

196
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,190
You promised to feed me.

197
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,150
You promised to fatten me up

198
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,770
so that I could beat up
the dog beside you.

199
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,560
You...

200
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,770
Who are you?

201
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,610
Me?

202
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,230
I'm more than 500 years old.

203
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,560
I'm old enough to be your ancestor.

204
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:43,690
How dare you

205
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,690
call me little dear.

206
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,770
You reek of alcohol.

207
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,190
You are very drunk.

208
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,020
You came here to eat and drink my food

209
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,110
without my approval.

210
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,440
Brat, you are still wet behind the ears.

211
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,520
Don't regret this.

212
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,730
What are you trying to do?

213
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,560
Of course,

214
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,150
I'm going to eat you!

215
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,060
Master,

216
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,860
help me!

217
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,730
Benefactor.

218
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,610
I'm not a bad person.

219
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,270
I am Huazhi, a Nine-Tailed Divine Fox.

220
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:19,110
I will never harm you

221
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,560
and Buku.

222
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,480
Master.

223
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,980
Look at me.

224
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:24,770
I...

225
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,520
Seriously.

226
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,940
I've said it many times.

227
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,730
I was drunk.

228
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,020
Is...

229
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,400
Is your name Huazhi?

230
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,400
Benefactor!

231
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:52,400
I've never seen
any divine beings in my life.

232
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:57,400
Miss. You look like a little girl,
no matter what.

233
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,480
Benefactor...

234
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,020
Benefactor, you...

235
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,230
Don't you believe me?

236
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,400
Why are you two screaming?

237
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,270
Benefactor!

238
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:27,610
I'm not a monster!

239
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,980
I'm a Divine Fox!

240
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,310
Miss,

241
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,860
since you are a Divine Fox,

242
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,940
why did you get injured so badly?

243
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:35,900
I...

244
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,190
I don't remember clearly.

245
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,270
Why did I get injured?

246
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,270
Divine Fox?

247
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:51,770
Miss, why don't you
go back to where you came from?

248
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,020
Benefactor.

249
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,650
I'm injured,

250
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,190
yet you are still chasing me away.

251
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,230
You called me a "little dear"
when you saved me.

252
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,150
Why are you so heartless now?

253
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,520
Little dear?

254
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,730
You called her little dear?

255
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,770
There have been many murder cases
in the town recently.

256
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,440
Many people have been killed.

257
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,770
How do I know if you are good or bad?

258
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,560
Murder cases?

259
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,650
Many people?

260
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,650
The woods?

261
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:27,940
The woods?

262
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,690
Do you know something about it?

263
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,400
Think about it.

264
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,110
I can't remember well.

265
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,810
I only remember there were many men
and women drinking and having fun

266
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:50,560
in the woods on the western outskirts.

267
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:57,690
I was greedy and drank too much.
So, I can't remember anything else.

268
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:58,860
Whatever.

269
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:01,770
You can stay here temporarily

270
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,690
before the case is solved.

271
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,020
Perhaps you might be able to help.

272
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,520
All right.

273
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,900
I will be obedient

274
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,270
and protect you.

275
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:11,810
Master.

276
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,690
She has tails.

277
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,480
We might be in danger.

278
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,520
If she knows about the woods
in the western outskirts,

279
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,810
perhaps

280
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,860
she might be able to help us
after she recovers.

281
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,770
What kind of help?

282
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,810
Thank you, Benefactor.

283
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,850
[Jinse Textile Shop]

284
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,150
Everyone,

285
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,980
today is the grand opening
of Jinse Textile Shop.

286
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:44,980
We are new here.

287
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,730
I hope everyone can support us, ladies,

288
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,860
in the future.

289
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,480
These textiles are premium products
we imported from the Western Regions.

290
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,650
We have more inside.

291
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,060
Please go and have a look inside.

292
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:11,150
Come inside and take a look.

293
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,190
- The textile is nice.
- It looks so nice.

294
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,520
So pretty.

295
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,730
Old man.

296
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,610
Let's join in the fun.

297
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:22,400
It's half price.

298
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,190
You are right.

299
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:28,690
You've grown up.
It's time for you to dress nicer.

300
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,190
It's easier for me
to find you a pretty wife in the future.

301
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,480
Master, you're right.

302
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,520
Let's go.

303
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:55,980
Master!

304
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,400
Why did you leave?

305
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,310
Wait for me!

306
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,230
Wait for me!

307
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,270
Master, wait for me!

308
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
How can we not capture

309
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,980
a prey that comes on its own?

310
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,690
Isn't this Zhu, the liquor seller?

311
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,360
Right?

312
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,650
Why did he die here?

313
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,770
Do you think it's that fraud?

314
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:40,270
Two days ago, I saw Zhu chase him out.

315
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:42,480
Perhaps that person has a grudge.

316
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,190
There's a stink on Zhu.

317
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,150
Do you think

318
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,360
we've not worshipped the River God
for all these years,

319
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,520
so he came

320
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:50,270
and killed someone?

321
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:53,770
Hey! Make way!

322
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,310
Make way!

323
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,650
The Head Constable is here!

324
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,060
Make way!

325
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,770
What are you all looking at?

326
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,650
Move!

327
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,360
Go away!

328
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,650
Sir.

329
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,520
Do you think...

330
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,190
You came on your own.

331
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,560
What a foolish fish.

332
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,560
Forget it.

333
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,060
I'll let you go.

334
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,610
You are also foolish as well.

335
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,650
Miss, what is your name?

336
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,110
Wan.

337
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,020
Physician Tao,

338
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,190
why did you let the fish go?

339
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,480
It's just my hobby.

340
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,310
I don't need it to fill my stomach.

341
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,980
Why should I kill it?

342
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,190
Will Physician Tao

343
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,650
let go of a woman
who falls into your arms?

344
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,940
You fool aren't as honest as you seem.

345
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,520
It was urgent.

346
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,190
Please forgive me, Miss Wan.

347
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,860
I have things to do at the apothecary.

348
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,940
I'm heading back first.

349
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,810
The weather is dry and hot!

350
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,230
Beware of fire!

351
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,190
Miss.

352
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,270
Miss, come down.

353
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,480
That was dangerous.

354
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,520
Even if you have problems,

355
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,650
you mustn't think of killing yourself.

356
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,770
What are you talking about?

357
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,230
Miss,

358
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,610
this city

359
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,060
isn't safe recently.

360
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,110
You must be careful

361
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:13,940
since you are alone outside.

362
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:16,860
Then...

363
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,650
What should I do?

364
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:20,900
Miss, don't be afraid.

365
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,610
I'm here.

366
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,110
Let me send you home.

367
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:24,980
All right?

368
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,810
Let's go.

369
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,310
I'm also going back home.

370
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,900
Why don't I send you instead?

371
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:35,610
What are you doing?

372
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,270
Let go!

373
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:37,020
Let go!

374
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:37,980
Is he...

375
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,480
Is he a bad person?

376
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,110
I look so decent.

377
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,060
How am I a bad person?

378
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,020
Miss. You, on the other hand,

379
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,860
are suspicious.

380
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,400
What's wrong with you?

381
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,560
Heh.

382
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,560
I know you are not an ordinary being.

383
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:15,810
Let me deal with you!

384
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,230
What a busybody!

385
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,190
You are so violent.

386
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,520
Go!

387
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,940
Trying to run?

388
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:51,980
Trying to run?

389
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,190
I was fooled by the fox just now.

390
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,400
Do you think I can't deal
with the two of you?

391
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,150
Sir,

392
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,400
look over there.

393
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:42,980
Give chase!

394
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,650
Don't let that old man run!

395
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,230
Old man?

396
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,770
Are they talking about me?

397
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,810
Over here!

398
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,150
I should run.

399
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,060
Don't let him run away!

400
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:53,770
Give chase!

401
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,060
Yes!

402
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:54,860
Hurry!

403
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:55,520
Give chase!

404
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,270
Old man, stop right there!

405
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:58,360
I'm old now.

406
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,980
Physician Tao, are you home?

407
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,730
It's you?

408
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,230
Why do you only send her here now?

409
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,730
A female

410
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,190
won't be able to endure this.

411
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,270
Thank you for saving me, Physician Tao.

412
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,150
Miss,

413
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:39,730
who hurt you?

414
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,980
The perpetrator is too vicious.

415
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,980
Her fiance from her hometown came to her

416
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,860
and caused trouble after he got drunk.

417
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,770
Physician Tao.

418
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,650
Physician Tao.

419
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,310
Where are you going?

420
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,310
I'm going to report to the officials!

421
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,190
Zhenzhu escaped her marriage.

422
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,360
That guy was old and ugly.

423
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,190
We gave him money to chase him away.

424
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,730
If you make it public,

425
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,650
how can Zhenzhu
live with dignity in the future?

426
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,270
You are right.

427
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,730
Your family matters
should be decided on your own.

428
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,400
I'm going to get some medicine.

429
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,020
Wan.

430
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:53,110
Is he the guy Madam Xi
wants you to bring back?

431
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,230
Shush.

432
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:00,060
I still don't know if that fool
is a descendant of Phantom Physician Tribe.

433
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,360
If we act recklessly,

434
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,360
we might spoil Madam Xi's plans.

435
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,650
Your skin is fair.

436
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,940
It's a match

437
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:16,860
with this outfit.

438
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,560
Is that so?

439
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:18,610
Oh.

440
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,520
Isn't this color too bright for me?

441
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,610
No way.

442
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,190
It complements your skin nicely.

443
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,360
Why is the town so lively today?

444
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:30,690
Is something exciting going on?

445
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,560
Something exciting?

446
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,400
The yamen's mysterious case
has been solved.

447
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,770
It's huge.

448
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:35,860
Oh?

449
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,060
Who was it?

450
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,730
I heard it was that fraud.

451
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,150
But they couldn't arrest him.

452
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,230
However,

453
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,730
the girls at this textile store

454
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:47,520
should be careful when they go out.

455
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:50,980
How is that exciting?

456
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,270
Perhaps

457
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,020
the yamen only found a scapegoat.

458
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,520
A notice was just posted

459
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:57,770
to restart the River God Ritual again.

460
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:00,310
This is the real exciting event.

461
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,310
The ritual is important?

462
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,150
Of course.

463
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,440
During the River God Ritual,
the town's prettiest girl will be picked

464
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:09,860
and offered as a Holy Lady.

465
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,190
Being chosen as a Holy Lady
is an honor as a family.

466
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,560
I think

467
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,520
every lady who works
in this textile store is pretty.

468
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,360
Who is so lucky? I wonder.

469
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,230
Dear, stop talking nonsense.

470
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,150
Go and try on your clothes.

471
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:24,730
Go.

472
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,940
It's none of your business.

473
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:28,310
Take your time.

474
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,440
I, Qingtao, will go
and pick a few more textiles for you.

475
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:00,310
Shush.

476
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,900
Why are you here?

477
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:09,980
Miss Zhenzhu didn't come
to change her medicine for two days.

478
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,310
If her wound is infected,

479
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,440
she'll...

480
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:13,310
Leave...

481
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:26,190
Why did he

482
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,400
come into this trap himself?

483
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:31,060
Miss Wan,

484
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:32,770
you are strong

485
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,360
for a girl.

486
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,310
You hurt my hand just by grabbing on it.

487
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:40,230
Your hand...

488
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,150
Your hand is also very...

489
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,810
What?

490
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:49,980
Cold.

491
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,560
I think you have a chilly constitution.

492
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,190
You shouldn't eat cold food.

493
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:00,690
Sir, are you here today

494
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,690
to buy some silk and satin
for the person you like?

495
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,860
I'm not interested.

496
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,650
You haven't been changing
your medicine, Miss Zhenzhu.

497
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,810
Your wound might not heal.

498
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:15,810
I walked past this place

499
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,940
and came to check on your injury.

500
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,520
See?

501
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,520
Physician Tao is interested in me.

502
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:31,270
Zhenzhu.

503
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,110
What's wrong?

504
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:32,860
Shush.

505
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,610
Zhenzhu?

506
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,400
She...

507
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:47,150
Fool,

508
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,690
it's indecent for a guy like you

509
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,980
to enter our room.

510
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:53,150
Zhenzhu.

511
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:54,860
Hey,

512
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,110
I'm a physician.

513
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,020
Miss Zhenzhu is injured.

514
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,610
We are honest people.

515
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,060
Who is outside?
I'll just go and explain to them.

516
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:04,770
Open the door, Zhenzhu.

517
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,650
I know you are inside.

518
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,110
Open the door, Zhenzhu.

519
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,150
Why are you always so reckless?

520
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,270
I saw Zhenzhu
feeling unwell downstairs,

521
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,360
so I came to check on her.

522
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,190
Qingtao, you are really considerate.

523
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,150
Of course.

524
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:32,310
We've been sisters for so long.

525
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,150
I know you well.

526
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:35,810
Oh.

527
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
I heard there have been rats
in the textile shop recently.

528
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:42,520
I wonder if both of you
are scared by rats.

529
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,060
I'm scared of those little things.

530
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,900
Your sense of smell is good, Qingtao.

531
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,940
I hope you can help me check my room.

532
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,730
Since you've said that,

533
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,110
I will help you.

534
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,650
Qingtao, please help me check

535
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,860
if my room

536
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,860
does have rats.

537
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,060
This room

538
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,190
smells of medicine.

539
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,060
Let's open the window

540
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
and get some fresh air.

541
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,730
Qingtao, you are so interesting.

542
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,400
Zhenzhu got hurt

543
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:42,730
from dealing with the priest.

544
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:45,190
However, you are
spending effort on looking for rats.

545
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,980
I wonder what Madam Xi will think
if she finds out.

546
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,650
I will one day catch
the rat who has gained its form.

547
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:55,610
I want to see

548
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,860
how long he can
still keep his arrogant act going.

549
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,110
Catch it!

550
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,020
My pearl!

551
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:30,770
Compensate me!

552
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,190
This is your medicine.

553
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,230
Drink it first.

554
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:48,810
Thank you.

555
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,940
Do you feel unwell?

556
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:55,980
Please wait.

557
00:37:58,610 --> 00:37:58,940
How is it?

558
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,020
Do you feel better?

559
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,650
Do you still feel unwell?

560
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,150
Why are there so many people?

561
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,190
Benefactor!

562
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,360
You're finally back.

563
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,400
Come and take a look.

564
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,900
What's going on?

565
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:14,940
Master,

566
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,900
all of them have the same symptoms.

567
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,560
They are feeling extreme heartaches,

568
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,980
but their pulses are normal.

569
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,310
It's very strange.

570
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:22,690
Come here.

571
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:28,610
Buku.

572
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:29,690
Bring me the needle.

573
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,310
Old man.

574
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:35,560
Here you go.

575
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,060
Their illnesses are very weird.

576
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,360
They have the same symptoms.

577
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,310
I couldn't find the cause.

578
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,610
Benefactor,

579
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,310
why do you have a fishy smell on you?

580
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:54,190
It is similar to these patients.

581
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:56,360
A fishy smell?

582
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:58,810
Why can't I smell it?

583
00:38:59,440 --> 00:38:59,940
There's no smell.

584
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,060
Hmph.

585
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,150
Of course.

586
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,730
I am a Divine Fox.

587
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,860
My sense of smell is good.

588
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:10,270
Master.

589
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:10,810
This...

590
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:11,730
Isn't this...

591
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,440
Huazhi,

592
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,610
grind this pearl into fine powder.

593
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,730
Buku, ask Head Constable Zheng
to come to the apothecary immediately.

594
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,310
Yes.

595
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:22,360
Wow,

596
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,560
what a big pearl.

597
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,440
It's my first time seeing this.

598
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:30,190
Oh, everyone is here.

599
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,020
He he he.

600
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,360
You are a brave one, old man.

601
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,520
Ignore him.

602
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:37,360
He is a bad person.

603
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:38,270
Don't be afraid.

604
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,690
I'm here.

605
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,060
How dare you still come here?

606
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,440
I will arrest you today.

607
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:46,980
Heh.

608
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,560
Go away!

609
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,770
It hurts.

610
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,440
Kid,

611
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,310
is this the poison you are looking for?

612
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:57,940
Heh.

613
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,860
These are called Heartlock Pills.

614
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:23,020
They are made with ten types
of poisonous water bugs.

615
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:27,860
I tried to make an antidote.

616
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,110
I also ground the eastern pearl,

617
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,560
the ushering drug
mentioned in the ancient records,

618
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:34,060
into powder
and added it to the decoction.

619
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,730
But why isn't it effective?

620
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:43,150
Not bad, kid.

621
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:48,150
You are quite capable.

622
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,150
Let me tell you.

623
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,060
There's one more curse in this poison.

624
00:40:58,270 --> 00:40:59,860
Mermaid Blood.

625
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,730
How do you know that?

626
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,060
Are you lying?

627
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,520
Lying, my foot!

628
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:11,650
Nonsense.

629
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,610
These are just rumors
from all over the place.

630
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:17,810
You mustn't listen to rumors like these.

631
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,190
As expected.

632
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,900
This is the smell.

633
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,520
If you know what this poison is,

634
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:32,360
I'm sure you know how to cure it.

635
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:36,610
Please tell me about it.

636
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,230
Today is Blue Moon Day,
which comes once a decade.

637
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,860
There's a pond ten li east of the town.

638
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:49,560
The lotus in the pond will bloom
at the hour of Zi.

639
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,440
This is the antidote,
Heart-Cleansing Lotus.

640
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,310
Heart-Cleansing Lotus
can cleanse one's heart

641
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,310
and let them regain consciousness.

642
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,020
If the one poisoned
has regretted sincerely,

643
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,440
they will be free of the poison.

644
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,190
I'll give you this ancient jade.

645
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,230
[Warrant]
Take it with you

646
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,150
for protection.

647
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,900
The water is cold and sweet.

648
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,150
This must be the place.

649
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,900
Why does this pond look so familiar?

650
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:18,110
Physician Tao.

651
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,440
Miss Wan?

652
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,440
You are in the wilderness

653
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:25,610
at midnight.

654
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,610
Are you here to wait for Miss Wan?

655
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:30,190
That's...

656
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,900
It's dark and deserted.

657
00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:35,400
Why are you here?

658
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,520
Miss Qingtao, are you alone?

659
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,810
Of course, I'm alone.

660
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,360
Physician Tao,

661
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:48,610
do you want a couple of or three women?

662
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,690
Isn't that...

663
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:51,810
Miss Qingtao, please behave yourself.

664
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:56,360
Miss, please leave some dignity
for both of us.

665
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:58,730
It's inconvenient

666
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:01,440
for a woman to be out here alone.

667
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,610
If Miss Wan finds out,

668
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,150
she will misunderstand.

669
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:08,560
You should go home, Miss.

670
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,400
Wan is the only one on your mind.

671
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,020
What's so nice about her?

672
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:15,860
It seems like
you want to do this the hard way.

673
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,230
How dare you try to capture my guy.

674
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,360
You... I...

675
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:32,650
Your guy?

676
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:33,980
Enough of your nonsense!

677
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:34,900
Your guy?

678
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:36,650
That makes me want him even more today!

679
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:37,650
Miss Qingtao!

680
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:39,190
I have someone I like.

681
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,810
You will never win my heart.

682
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:42,900
Miss Wan,

683
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,940
we have not gone through
the formal procedures.

684
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,190
How could you say that I'm your guy?

685
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,400
Miss!

686
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:52,650
You talked too much!

687
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:06,560
Wan!

688
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:08,610
Wan!

689
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:45,900
I lost.

690
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:51,310
Wan.

691
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:53,520
What should we do?

692
00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:00,560
You should go back immediately.

693
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,310
I'll deal with this on my own.

694
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,560
Don't try to hurt him!

695
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:48,230
Heart-Protecting Scales?

696
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:49,650
Little fish,

697
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,860
are you going to give your
Heart-Protecting Scales to this kid?

698
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:53,110
You...

699
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:21,060
In the past, I heard there were scales

700
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:23,940
on the back of a mermaid's neck.

701
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:27,110
They can protect one's heart and soul,

702
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:28,650
cure various illnesses

703
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:29,360
and poison,

704
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:30,690
and revive the dead.

705
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:33,730
I've finally seen it for myself today.

706
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,610
I thought you wanted to...

707
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,360
Did you think I would kill him?

708
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:42,810
This fool is kind.

709
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,730
A fool who is hard to come by.

710
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:47,230
How can I bear to hurt him?

711
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:53,190
Little fish,

712
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,230
I can't let you go.

713
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:57,900
Senior,

714
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,150
if I don't go back,
my people will feel suspicious.

715
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,650
If they attacked first,

716
00:48:03,730 --> 00:48:05,730
the people of the town
would be in danger.

717
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:08,900
It's still not too late

718
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:10,310
to stop doing this.

719
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,310
I can no longer stop.

720
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:16,060
If you go back like this,

721
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:19,520
do you think Madam Xi
the old witch will let you go?

722
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,730
Madam Xi doesn't let go of anybody.

723
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,770
She never even lets go of herself.

724
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:34,810
Bring him away.

725
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,360
The further, the better.

726
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,610
Where are all the people?

727
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,810
Where's everyone?

728
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:30,190
Madam Xi, you are awake.

729
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,730
Let me bring you some water.

730
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,060
Hold it.

731
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:49,440
Why are you alone?

732
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:51,980
Where are the others?

733
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,770
Perhaps

734
00:50:55,730 --> 00:50:58,980
they are fast asleep or...

735
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:02,650
Open the door!

736
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:05,310
Return the people to us!

737
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,730
Make way.

738
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:10,360
Town Chief.

739
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:12,980
Town Chief, the women
from the textile store are outsiders.

740
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:13,440
Yes.

741
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,860
Why should we trouble them?

742
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:16,690
Yes. We should let them go.

743
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,690
The Holy Lady is important
to our town's safety!

744
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:23,400
Be careful.

745
00:51:25,110 --> 00:51:26,650
Let us go in! Move inside!

746
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,690
Make way.

747
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:30,520
Town Chief.

748
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:31,520
Town Chief.

749
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,110
I don't think this is right.

750
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,020
It's not right?

751
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,400
How so?

752
00:51:36,730 --> 00:51:37,860
It is a blessing for the woman

753
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:39,900
who is going to be chosen
as the Holy Lady.

754
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:41,310
Right?

755
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:43,650
Yes!

756
00:51:45,730 --> 00:51:46,310
Yes.

757
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,810
We are facing a crisis now.

758
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,230
I finally got a day of peace.

759
00:51:58,810 --> 00:51:59,310
Oh.

760
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:02,400
Why is everyone patronizing

761
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,190
my textile store today?

762
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:09,230
Tomorrow is the ritual.

763
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:14,650
Miss Wan
is the prettiest woman in this town.

764
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:16,400
A Holy Lady chosen by Heaven.

765
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,560
It's fine

766
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:22,770
if you agree to this.

767
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,650
But if you don't...

768
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:34,400
Why won't I agree to it?

769
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,440
Being chosen
as the River God's Holy Lady

770
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:42,860
to bless everyone is a good thing.

771
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:46,690
I, Madam Xi, will not stop all of you.

772
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:49,400
That's great.

773
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:52,190
I knew Madam Xi
was an understanding person.

774
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,360
Look at all of you.

775
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:57,440
All of you were worried about nothing.

776
00:52:57,730 --> 00:52:59,360
We were worried about nothing.

777
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:01,730
Go back and sleep.

778
00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:02,360
Let's go.

779
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:05,150
- Let's go.
- I've told you so.

780
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:05,310
I've told you so.

781
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:24,360
Stupid Exorcist, didn't you say
you are extremely skilled?

782
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,610
How did he end up like this?

783
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:34,270
Wan has already cured the brat's poison
with her Heart-Protecting Scales.

784
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,900
He will wake up later.

785
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:38,230
Stop making a fuss.

786
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:40,810
Miss Wan?

787
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:43,860
What are the Heart-Protecting Scales?

788
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:46,150
I knew the textile shop was strange.

789
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:47,690
It has a fishy smell.

790
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:48,730
As expected.

791
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,190
They are all mermaids.

792
00:53:51,610 --> 00:53:52,060
What?

793
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:52,980
Mermaids?

794
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:59,150
Yunyin Town has killed
a lot of small fish.

795
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,810
There's no fish in the water.

796
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:03,900
They are right
to take revenge on all of you.

797
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:07,310
Wan has been selected as the Holy Lady.

798
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:09,270
She will be sacrificed
to the River God tonight.

799
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:10,020
Bah!

800
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:11,480
There's no such thing as a River God.

801
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:13,980
You are gathering everyone in one place.

802
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,440
That's great

803
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,560
because it's just what Madam Xi wants.

804
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,150
Wan... Wan...

805
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:22,020
Benefactor.

806
00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:23,980
Wan...

807
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:25,020
Benefactor.

808
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:25,980
Benefactor.

809
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:28,650
Wan...

810
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:30,360
Let me tell you.

811
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:32,310
There's still one way

812
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:34,110
to defeat the old witch.

813
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:35,150
What?

814
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:36,230
What is it?

815
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:38,400
Phantom Physician Tribe.

816
00:54:39,730 --> 00:54:40,360
Why?

817
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,230
The old witch has a divine tool.

818
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:47,310
It's an ancient treasure
called the Phantom Soul Flute.

819
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:51,730
Only a descendant
of the Phantom Physician Tribe can use it.

820
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:53,310
Wan said

821
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:58,230
this brat might be the last descendant
of the Phantom Physician Tribe.

822
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,230
Ah.

823
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,650
I think something big

824
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:05,270
will go down tonight.

825
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,560
He even left his medicine box here.

826
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:18,110
That fool

827
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:19,980
is so foolish.

828
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,650
However, he is capable

829
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,690
when it comes to treating someone.

830
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:33,060
Without the Heart-Protecting Scales,

831
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:35,480
you won't even last three days.

832
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,480
When you live a life
of wanting revenge every day,

833
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:47,310
you no longer hope
and feel for anything.

834
00:55:48,610 --> 00:55:51,230
What's the meaning of existing?

835
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,440
Why are you doing this?

836
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:56,480
Granny said

837
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,610
she would

838
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,900
return the souls to everyone.

839
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:03,360
After today,

840
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,020
if Granny can get his wish,

841
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,770
you will be free.

842
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:14,020
If it fails,

843
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,650
Tao Ran's wish will be fulfilled.

844
00:56:19,230 --> 00:56:20,650
It's a good thing, no matter what.

845
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:23,480
Unfortunately,
I might not live to see it.

846
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:38,400
Open the door,

847
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:39,270
Buku!

848
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:42,770
I'm asking you to open the door!

849
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:44,110
Can you hear me?

850
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:45,940
Open the door!

851
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:49,360
Can you hear me?

852
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:50,230
Old man!

853
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,230
Stop shouting!

854
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,900
I will not let you go out
and die in vain.

855
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:56,060
Open the door!

856
00:56:58,610 --> 00:56:59,690
Instead of suffering here,

857
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:02,190
I'd rather die with her!

858
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:05,810
Open the door!

859
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:09,810
Ah!

860
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:13,360
Old man?

861
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:14,730
Old man!

862
00:57:16,110 --> 00:57:17,110
Old man!

863
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:25,480
The Mermaids

864
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,360
are pretty and kind.

865
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:32,310
The greedy and evil humans
do not deserve us.

866
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:34,770
Granny.

867
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:38,150
There are kind and evil people
in this world.

868
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,020
Tonight, why don't we...

869
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:50,400
Shush.

870
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:51,730
My dear.

871
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:54,230
That's because

872
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:56,730
they still don't know what you can do.

873
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,900
If they know
that your tears can turn into pearls,

874
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:03,190
your scales can be used for medicine,

875
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:05,150
and your fats
can be used to light the lamp,

876
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:06,610
they will

877
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:09,610
surely skin you alive and kill you.

878
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,190
Tonight, you are the bait.

879
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:19,560
I'm sure the guy
from the Phantom Physician Tribe

880
00:58:20,310 --> 00:58:23,020
will come and rescue you.

881
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:26,440
The ritual will begin soon!

882
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:27,400
Listen.

883
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:29,560
That bustling noise outside.

884
00:58:30,770 --> 00:58:31,940
Everyone

885
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,900
is excited
about sending you to your death.

886
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,270
None of them feel a little pity for you.

887
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:47,190
Whether this trap
can capture all the fishlings tonight

888
00:58:48,610 --> 00:58:50,610
will depend on you.

889
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:57,480
Sending the Holy Lady!

890
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,360
Send the Holy Lady!

891
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:02,980
Sending the Holy Lady!

892
00:59:03,810 --> 00:59:06,150
Send the Holy Lady!

893
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:09,400
Sending the Holy Lady!

894
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:12,860
Send the Holy Lady!

895
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:15,690
Sending the Holy Lady!

896
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:16,610
Old man,

897
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,310
don't think of escaping.

898
00:59:20,310 --> 00:59:21,940
Sending the Holy Lady!

899
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,110
Send the Holy Lady!

900
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,770
Sending the Holy Lady!

901
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,270
Send the Holy Lady!

902
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,060
Hey.

903
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:34,230
After they leave,

904
00:59:35,230 --> 00:59:36,310
you must capture her.

905
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:37,650
Sure.

906
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:38,690
We must sell her for a good price.

907
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:40,230
Go.

908
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:43,730
What's that tune?

909
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,440
Who are you?

910
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:10,230
Move!

911
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,310
Don't stand in our way!

912
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,610
Exorcist!

913
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:37,270
Town Chief?

914
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:38,610
Exorcist, save me!

915
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:39,560
Town Chief.

916
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:41,360
This is tough.

917
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:42,190
Look.

918
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,230
Ten small yellow croakers!

919
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,020
Ten?

920
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:54,610
Exorcist!

921
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,230
I can give you as many as you want.

922
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:57,110
You must save me.

923
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:57,690
I can't do this

924
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,190
without 80 to 100 of them.

925
01:00:59,270 --> 01:00:59,810
Sure.

926
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:01,480
You can have it.

927
01:01:01,650 --> 01:01:02,190
Seriously?

928
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,560
Yes!

929
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,190
Sir,

930
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,400
what... what is this place?

931
01:01:49,110 --> 01:01:50,400
I don't know.

932
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:51,860
Be careful.

933
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:53,440
Stay calm.

934
01:02:34,730 --> 01:02:35,610
What is this place?

935
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:38,060
What kind of place is this?

936
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:44,230
Wan?

937
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:46,770
Wan!

938
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:48,900
Wan!

939
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:50,150
Tao Ran.

940
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:53,440
Tao Ran!

941
01:02:56,110 --> 01:02:56,730
Tao Ran!

942
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:57,690
Wan!

943
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,730
Tao Ran!

944
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:03,690
Tao Ran!

945
01:03:05,940 --> 01:03:06,560
Wan!

946
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:09,900
Wan!

947
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:12,980
Wan!

948
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:16,980
Wan!

949
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,110
Tao Ran.

950
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:19,020
Wan?

951
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:20,230
Wan!

952
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:21,900
Tao Ran.

953
01:03:23,650 --> 01:03:24,860
Wan!

954
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:29,860
Wan,

955
01:03:30,980 --> 01:03:32,190
why are you here?

956
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:35,610
Let's get out of here.

957
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:46,060
Sorry.

958
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:47,440
I made a mistake.

959
01:03:48,150 --> 01:03:49,190
Sorry for disturbing you.

960
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:57,560
Wan is capable indeed.

961
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:59,770
She could actually make you

962
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:03,020
enter the illusory realm willingly.

963
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:08,020
Tao Ran!

964
01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:10,610
Tao Ran, where are you?

965
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:11,480
Wan.

966
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:13,730
Let go of me!

967
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:15,650
What did you do to Wan?

968
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,900
Let her go!

969
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:22,730
Hmph.

970
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,900
This old witch is trying to trap me.

971
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:35,650
Are you trying to save your Wan?

972
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:37,310
Here.

973
01:04:38,650 --> 01:04:41,560
If you use it, the person you love

974
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:43,900
and the villagers can be free.

975
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:49,230
You are the only one
who can truly free all of them.

976
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:50,730
No, Tao Ran!

977
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:52,060
That is the Phantom Soul Flute.

978
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,190
It can control one's mind and soul.

979
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,770
You must never use it!

980
01:04:57,610 --> 01:04:58,190
Tao Ran!

981
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:01,810
Tao Ran!

982
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:26,310
I will never let you get your wish!

983
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:27,480
You can kill me

984
01:05:27,770 --> 01:05:28,610
or do whatever you want to me!

985
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:30,980
How dare you

986
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:32,310
choose the hard way.

987
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:34,560
I'll kill you first!

988
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:49,690
I didn't do it on purpose.

989
01:06:02,020 --> 01:06:02,650
Xiao!

990
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:03,360
Hurry!

991
01:06:03,610 --> 01:06:04,770
I can't hold on for much longer!

992
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,400
Break!

993
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:31,310
Your suffering begins

994
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:34,650
once I'm free.

995
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:41,730
Wan's soul and mine are connected.

996
01:06:42,770 --> 01:06:43,230
Wan.

997
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:44,610
You must suffer a heartbreak...

998
01:06:44,610 --> 01:06:45,860
Wan!

999
01:06:46,190 --> 01:06:49,400
to feel the taste of pain and hatred.

1000
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:52,440
Ha ha ha!

1001
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:54,400
Ha ha ha!

1002
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:55,310
Wan!

1003
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:57,810
Ha ha ha!

1004
01:06:57,810 --> 01:06:58,690
Wan!

1005
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:00,650
The illusory realm is collapsing.

1006
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:01,650
Run!

1007
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,480
It's Xiao's voice!

1008
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:05,860
Run!

1009
01:07:06,520 --> 01:07:07,150
Run!

1010
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,150
Run!

1011
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:09,730
Run!

1012
01:07:10,650 --> 01:07:11,480
Tao Ran!

1013
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:12,860
Wan.

1014
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:13,560
Tao Ran!

1015
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:14,190
Wan.

1016
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,310
Wan!

1017
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:28,020
Wan!

1018
01:07:39,730 --> 01:07:40,360
Run!

1019
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,150
The illusory realm is collapsing.

1020
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:45,400
Over there.

1021
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:47,980
Tao Ran.

1022
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:51,650
The power of the Phantom Physician Tribe

1023
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:55,190
is strong enough
for you to kill all these darned people.

1024
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,690
One day,

1025
01:07:59,770 --> 01:08:02,190
you will fulfill my dying wish.

1026
01:08:05,810 --> 01:08:06,400
Ha ha ha!

1027
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:23,060
Old man!

1028
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:24,770
Old man!

1029
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:26,480
Old man!

1030
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:37,480
Ouch.

1031
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,650
I almost died.

1032
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:44,810
That was terrifying.

1033
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:45,270
Xiao.

1034
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:46,230
Xiao, how are you?

1035
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:47,360
Get up.

1036
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:25,650
Why are all of you here?

1037
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:26,810
I finally found all of you.

1038
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:28,020
Master!

1039
01:09:28,020 --> 01:09:28,610
Hey.

1040
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:30,440
Shush.

1041
01:09:45,270 --> 01:09:46,650
When I first met you,

1042
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:49,860
I had already fallen in love

1043
01:09:50,610 --> 01:09:51,730
with you.

1044
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,270
I wonder

1045
01:10:02,310 --> 01:10:03,900
if I'm fortunate enough

1046
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:07,060
to share a lifetime

1047
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:09,230
and grow old with you

1048
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:16,900
in this life.

1049
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:25,560
Meeting you in my life

1050
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:28,150
is already a surprise.

1051
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:51,110
The pain of yearning
persists year after year.

1052
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:01,940
The complexities of life
are hard to overcome.

1053
01:13:02,650 --> 01:13:05,440
Ha ha ha!

1054
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,230
Ha ha ha!
