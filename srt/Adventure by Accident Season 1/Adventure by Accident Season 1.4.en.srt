1
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,970
We're finally greeting
the new year together.

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,110
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:16,179
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

4
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:18,410
Thank you for watching.

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,679
It hasn't been more than a few weeks
since we started Adventure by Accident,

6
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,420
but this is technically the second year
that we've been together.

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,489
That's a good point.

8
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:28,190
- She's right.
- This is the second year we're together.

9
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:29,690
- It's been two years already.
- Yes.

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,390
- It was last year.
- Yes, last year.

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,699
- Last year.
- One year ago.

12
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,399
- Last year.
- Last year, Pani Bottle came on the show.

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,530
I heard he was struggling
somewhere overseas even now.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,700
That's why he can't join us now, right?

15
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,539
He said he'd come if our ratings
surpass ten percent.

16
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:45,570
(No, that's not it.)

17
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:48,079
Don't even think about meeting me
before you surpass ten percent.

18
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:49,649
He's a special person.

19
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:53,119
But Pani Bottle is good at traveling.

20
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,280
What does it mean to be good at traveling?

21
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,990
- He can talk well.
- He can communicate well.

22
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,219
First of all, I think Pani Bottles
strongest point...

23
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,789
is that he can act as a mediator
that connects you two...

24
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,689
- while he reacts...
- It's not like that, actually.

25
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,060
- It's not like that.
- I don't have anything to say.

26
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,799
He's always like this.

27
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,429
- But really.
- Gosh. I'll never...

28
00:01:10,429 --> 00:01:11,929
- I'm serious.
- travel with you.

29
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:14,340
If you watch, you'll see.
It shows that it's not like that.

30
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,840
- Really?
- What, Pani Bottle?

31
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,939
He's weak.

32
00:01:17,239 --> 00:01:18,370
What do you mean he's weak?

33
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,540
His body is fragile.

34
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,180
That's why people can't be
absent in meetings.

35
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:23,280
Right. You should always join.

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,549
He has to let go of his pride
of being a good traveler.

37
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:26,620
Let's watch. Let's talk after we watch.

38
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,519
From Cusco to Puno.

39
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,790
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my!

40
00:01:35,019 --> 00:01:37,659
(Oh, my goodness!)

41
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,359
(What is this?)

42
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,870
- You scared me.
- What is this?

43
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,099
(The youngest member, Pani Bottle)

44
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:47,400
- Gosh. You scared us.
- Who is this? Hey.

45
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,969
- Oh, my.
- Hey, you.

46
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:50,540
- You said you were in Vietnam.
- Oh, my.

47
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,939
I just got back today. Just now, actually.

48
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:53,209
- Oh, my.
- Hey, how did you get in my house?

49
00:01:53,209 --> 00:01:54,379
Pani Bottle.

50
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:57,079
(Pani Bottle was listening to them
praise him.)

51
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,879
(Sneaking up)

52
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,120
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my!

53
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:02,489
(Surprised)

54
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:05,390
(I caught you,
the guy who was praising me.)

55
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,859
- Hello.
- Hello.

56
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:08,159
- It's good that you came quickly.
- Nice to meet you.

57
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:09,859
We were going
to really start criticizing you.

58
00:02:09,859 --> 00:02:11,359
- Didn't you know?
- No, I didn't.

59
00:02:11,359 --> 00:02:12,629
Gosh. I'm so surprised.

60
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,400
We filmed here last year.

61
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,300
Were you hiding here since last year?

62
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,840
No. I just got here.

63
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,139
- Oh, just now?
- Yes.

64
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:23,039
When I called, he said he was in Vietnam.

65
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,539
I got back around 5 or 6 a.m.
from Vietnam.

66
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:29,280
It was hard to travel
with these two, right?

67
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:31,310
While I was traveling with them,

68
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,250
it didn't feel like I was traveling
with two older brothers.

69
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,050
It felt like I was traveling
with two young brothers.

70
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,719
- Like babies.
- You took care of them.

71
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:37,949
That's a bit harsh.

72
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,219
Since people are around,
he'll say what he wants.

73
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:41,919
Think about your own actions.

74
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:43,189
You really held them in your arms.

75
00:02:43,189 --> 00:02:44,259
You. Leave.

76
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,500
You can go back into the room.

77
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,930
- Go ahead.
- Back into the room.

78
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,729
Go home, Pani Bottle.

79
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:54,099
(On the fourth day of the trip,
they began to see conflict in Cusco.)

80
00:02:54,669 --> 00:02:56,840
(Finally, their emotions exploded.)

81
00:02:57,069 --> 00:02:58,740
(Thinking about it
is making me angry again.)

82
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:01,479
(It was getting harder and harder
to talk to Si Eon then.)

83
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,979
(A helping hand...)

84
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,080
(for these two)

85
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,520
(Number one travel YouTuber, Pani Bottle)

86
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,689
(Do they feel reassured
traveling as a group of three?)

87
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,719
(They start...)

88
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,520
(their bike tour without any plans.)

89
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,289
It's a perfect day to cruise.

90
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:19,060
(They will drive for many hours
to get to today's destination, Puno.)

91
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,870
(Get to La Raya observatory
before sundown.)

92
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:26,740
(Thanks to the eldest brother
who takes the lead,)

93
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,740
(they move smoothly along.)

94
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,039
(Control tower)

95
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,780
(However)

96
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:33,909
(Smack)

97
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,750
(The sand hit my face.)

98
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:39,150
(Even terrible exhaust)

99
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,550
(I'm suddenly crying so much.)

100
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:45,289
(They make an emergency stop
in the village center.)

101
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:49,330
If you went 150km,

102
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,590
that was about halfway, right?

103
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:53,699
Si Eon. Let's take a break.

104
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,030
Rest.

105
00:03:56,229 --> 00:03:59,300
It was tiring to ride a motorcycle
for a long time.

106
00:03:59,569 --> 00:04:02,039
It looks easy, but you have to focus.

107
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,340
(They couldn't go any further,
so they sat on the bench.)

108
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,979
(Completely exhausted)

109
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,810
The sun just set. It's nice.

110
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,909
It'd be nice
if the sun was always like this.

111
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,849
(They recharge their strength
by photosynthesis.)

112
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,689
Let's eat some bread.

113
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:20,719
Let's eat something else other than bread.

114
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:22,560
Let's go to a restaurant.

115
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,459
Everything is closed. No stores are open.

116
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:30,430
They're closed.

117
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:33,069
They're all closed because it's Sunday.

118
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:34,500
How unlucky.

119
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,470
Wait. There's a hamburger place.
We could eat hamburgers.

120
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:40,079
- Here?
- Yes.

121
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,709
- Pa Picha.
- Let's go.

122
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:43,449
Pa Picha.

123
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,879
(They came all the way to South America,
and they get a hamburger.)

124
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,149
I just need one hamburger
and an Inca Kola.

125
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:52,660
I think Inca Kola plays
a pretty important role in Peru.

126
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,959
(We'd like to order.)

127
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:58,560
Two Inca Kolas.

128
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,430
One regular hamburger.

129
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,240
Is this Lima patty?

130
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,269
(Peru's capital)

131
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:10,139
- Beef?
- Llama.

132
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,610
- Llama.
- Beef? Pork?

133
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,709
Beef.

134
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:16,850
Yes. Thank you.

135
00:05:17,149 --> 00:05:18,709
The altitude sickness
is not as bad here, right?

136
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,019
I'm okay now,

137
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,319
but we'll have to see
once we get to 4,300m.

138
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:26,860
Just in case, let's take some medicine
after our meal.

139
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,259
- I don't get altitude sickness.
- Okay.

140
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,730
I've been to a place 5,000m high.

141
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,959
I started to feel sick there.

142
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,459
From there, I felt altitude sickness.

143
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,029
- Below that, you were fine?
- Yes.

144
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:39,300
Where is the highest city in the world?

145
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,040
Among capitals, La Paz is the highest.

146
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,370
What country is La Paz in?

147
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,639
Bolivia. Where we're going.

148
00:05:44,009 --> 00:05:46,079
- That's the highest city in the world?
- Yes.

149
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,339
It's higher than Chile.

150
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,879
It's higher than Lhasa.

151
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,279
(La Paz, the highest capital in the world
3,250m to 4,100m above sea level.)

152
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:51,579
That place is really tough.

153
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,480
Let's go to America next time, Kian84.

154
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:56,149
America's nice.

155
00:05:56,889 --> 00:06:00,920
If it hadn't been for Pani Bottle's
glasses, I couldn't have gone.

156
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,259
(They're so thankful to have Pani Bottle.)

157
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,829
Don't ignore us...

158
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:07,759
when we call you in Korea.

159
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,629
Right. Could I have your phone numbers?

160
00:06:10,269 --> 00:06:13,500
- Phone number.
- We got it last time.

161
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
- We got it last time.

162
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,870
- Oh, really?
- I have your phone number.

163
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:20,180
(A few days before going to South America,
Kian84 met Pani Bottle for some advice.)

164
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,610
(Pani Bottle shared a lot of good tips.)

165
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,850
(Could I have your phone number?)

166
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,350
He definitely got your phone number then.

167
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:30,519
It's not there.

168
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,689
Hey. I'm disappointed.

169
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:34,490
- What is this?
- Why isn't it there?

170
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,389
Why do you think? You didn't save it.

171
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:37,759
I saved yours.

172
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:41,259
Gosh. He didn't save my phone number.

173
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,600
Are you going to this time?

174
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,139
Please save it this time.

175
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,970
I must've forgotten.

176
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,139
You didn't delete it
after you talked to us yesterday, right?

177
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:51,240
No.

178
00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:54,540
- Do you have their numbers now?
- Yes, I do now.

179
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,879
Have we passed?

180
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,579
(Anyway, it's been a while
since they've ordered.)

181
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:58,680
What's taking so long?

182
00:06:59,779 --> 00:07:01,879
Did they go somewhere to catch the cow?

183
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,449
It's coming.

184
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,550
(The hamburger finally arrives.)

185
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:08,319
Oh, it's not ours.

186
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,319
(Embarrassed)

187
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:11,689
Fast food isn't fast food in Peru.

188
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:13,899
It's slow food.

189
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,670
(20 minutes)

190
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:20,399
(30 minutes)

191
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:22,269
Does it really take that long?

192
00:07:22,269 --> 00:07:24,910
Everything is done slowly.

193
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:28,439
Could it be that they forgot our order?

194
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,579
How are they taking 30 minutes
to make a hamburger?

195
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:33,680
Should we wait a little bit more?

196
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:36,420
(Getting up)

197
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:41,290
Excuse me? How long will it take?

198
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,459
How long will it take for our menu?

199
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:46,899
Ten minutes?

200
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,759
How many minutes...

201
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,670
- do we have to wait?
- Five minutes.

202
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,170
- She said five minutes.
- Okay.

203
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,269
Thank you.

204
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,699
(Scratching)

205
00:07:55,339 --> 00:07:56,970
I guess it just always takes long.

206
00:07:59,069 --> 00:08:01,579
(I don't know anymore. Let's just sleep.)

207
00:08:02,009 --> 00:08:03,480
Let's rest.

208
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:05,779
You should rest too.

209
00:08:06,149 --> 00:08:08,050
- No, it's okay, Pani Bottle.
- Oh, my.

210
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,720
Oh, if you give me a massage,
I'll give you one after.

211
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,589
(Yelling)

212
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:15,019
I think our shoulders and hips tense up.

213
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,930
(Because we ride in this position)

214
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,060
(Groaning)

215
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,329
(Si Eon's massage for Pani Bottle)

216
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,199
- Isn't it nice?
- Yes, it's nice.

217
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,670
- I'm pretty good, right?
- Yes, you are.

218
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,170
How is it?

219
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,839
Oh, it's here.

220
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:33,939
- Did you finally get the drink?
- Yes, the drink came out.

221
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:36,850
Wait. Coca-cola?
Didn't we order Inca Kola?

222
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:39,850
- Let's just drink Coca-cola.
- Oh, that feels nice.

223
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,649
(We can't wait any longer.)

224
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,590
Thank you.

225
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,919
- Oh, the ice?
- Oh, there's ice.

226
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:48,019
Oh, take the ice like this.

227
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:50,259
We should add the ice
since the drink isn't cold.

228
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,360
(He gulps down one glass...)

229
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,299
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

230
00:08:54,299 --> 00:08:58,429
(and gets knocked out again.)

231
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,269
(The road where you can cruise
at 4,000m above sea level)

232
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:06,210
(Ruta Del Sol)

233
00:09:06,409 --> 00:09:08,940
(The three are very excited...)

234
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,149
(because of the bike store owner's
high praise.)

235
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:13,980
Let's go.

236
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:20,519
(They feel the wind on their skin...)

237
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,559
(and see South America
with their own two eyes...)

238
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,299
(to save this memory
somewhere in their minds.)

239
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,539
(But he's too tired for that.)

240
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:38,539
I really think we waited about an hour
for our meal.

241
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:40,340
That must be tiring.

242
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,580
It just doesn't come out.

243
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,009
I think it's been over five minutes.

244
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:45,879
Gosh.

245
00:09:46,049 --> 00:09:49,320
This is taking longer
than grilling meat at a BBQ place.

246
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,990
When will it come out?

247
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,019
They're missing the most basic part
of fast food.

248
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,590
I think the hamburger will come out
when we're about to fall asleep.

249
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,460
(The souls that came
from the other side of the planet...)

250
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,659
We were so tired. Seriously.

251
00:10:02,659 --> 00:10:05,070
(to order a hamburger)

252
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,669
(They need a hamburger.)

253
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:09,539
(How pitiful.)

254
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,539
(A long time passes again.)

255
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:15,639
It's here.

256
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,210
(Chicken tortilla)

257
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:21,850
(Chicken burger)

258
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,950
That's mine. Banana burger.

259
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,519
- Banana.
- What's that? A banana?

260
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,820
- Is it fried banana?
- My goodness.

261
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,090
Thank you for the food.

262
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:34,629
(Taking a bite)

263
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,399
(They eat without saying a word
because they're hungry.)

264
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:39,600
Kian84, yours even has a fried egg.

265
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,000
(He takes a big bite.)

266
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:43,539
How was the banana burger?

267
00:10:43,539 --> 00:10:46,210
I didn't eat the banana burger.

268
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,740
I think... Did Pani Bottle eat it?

269
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,139
No, mine's the wrap.

270
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:50,279
I didn't know about the burger.
This is my first time seeing it.

271
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,250
- I ate the banana burger?
- He can't even remember what he ate.

272
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,149
The banana is sticking out of your burger.

273
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:56,250
Really? I ate that?

274
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,250
(When he took a big bite...)

275
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,860
(Sticking its tongue out)

276
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:02,919
(Laughing)

277
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:04,690
What's that?

278
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:07,100
There was banana.

279
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:10,169
(How do the burgers they've waited
for a long time taste?)

280
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,730
- It's salty, right?
- Really?

281
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:12,799
It was very salty.

282
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,639
I personally like my food salty,
but this is way too salty.

283
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,639
Right?

284
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,539
Peruvian burgers are salty.

285
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,610
- It's too salty.
- What I had...

286
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,009
in the airport tasted
like pickled food too.

287
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,950
- It's so salty.
- Look.

288
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:27,980
It's like a lump of salt.

289
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:30,350
(He takes a bite even if it's salty.)

290
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,649
(He takes another bite.)

291
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,590
Honestly,
it tastes good because I'm hungry.

292
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,230
Even though it's salty.

293
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,960
- It's tasty because we're hungry.
- I'm hungry, so everything tastes good.

294
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:44,399
I feel much better after eating.

295
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,340
Finish eating and come to the park.
I'll go there first.

296
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:50,440
Won't it be hot in the park?

297
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,539
- Sorry?
- Won't it be hot?

298
00:11:51,539 --> 00:11:53,879
- It's fine.
- Stay in the shade.

299
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,610
I don't want to eat anymore.

300
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,210
It must not have been...

301
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:00,950
to City Man Si Eon's taste.

302
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,879
Let's pay.

303
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,620
(Lunch: 42.20 soles, about 14.06 dollars)

304
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,460
I feel fine now.

305
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,519
- Me too.
- Once we leave this place...

306
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:10,330
- But the time...
- What time is it?

307
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:11,629
We need to go now. Let's go.

308
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:14,629
I checked yesterday,
and the sun sets at 5:30 p.m.

309
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:18,070
When the sun sets, it gets really cold.

310
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,399
(They quickly set off
before the sun sets.)

311
00:12:21,539 --> 00:12:22,700
Let's go.

312
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,139
Let's go.

313
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:29,379
(They get going after a short rest.)

314
00:12:35,649 --> 00:12:36,889
Does the radio work?

315
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:39,960
Pani Bottle.

316
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,659
Pani Bottle.

317
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:44,259
The radio got disconnected.

318
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:45,559
Did the battery run out?

319
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,899
Pani Bottle. I don't think it's working.

320
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,600
- You need to communicate.
- We need to.

321
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,029
(They stop for a while
to check the radio.)

322
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:54,870
Stand up for a while.

323
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:00,610
(Stretching)

324
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,210
(The exhaustion is not relieved
completely.)

325
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,350
I can smell mint.

326
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,379
What?

327
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:09,649
It's either mint or menthol.

328
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,690
(What smell is this?)

329
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:20,100
- Oh?
- What is it?

330
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,129
(The staff who was checking the radio)

331
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,970
(Shocked)

332
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,100
What's happening?

333
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,769
- Hey.
- Hey.

334
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:30,240
- Oh, dear!
- Really?

335
00:13:31,539 --> 00:13:32,740
(Nose Bleeding Bottle)

336
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,940
(Really?)

337
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,639
Really?

338
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:36,809
(It's hard to believe
that the travel veteran had a nosebleed.)

339
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,649
(Since the day before, he emphasized
that he didn't have altitude sickness.)

340
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,450
(Travel YouTuber
with 1,370,000 subscribers...)

341
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,450
(who has no altitude sickness)

342
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,649
Then why is his nose suddenly bleeding?

343
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:45,919
(But his nostrils emphasizes
that he has altitude sickness.)

344
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,190
His nose is bleeding.

345
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:50,529
You must be tired.

346
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:53,059
- Do you normally...
- My nose doesn't bleed easily.

347
00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:54,129
- Right?
- Yes.

348
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:55,759
Didn't you overexert yourself?

349
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:57,799
Goodness.

350
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:00,000
Aren't you showing your weak side
too early?

351
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,169
Are you feeling okay?

352
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:05,539
I felt a bit sleepy,
but not to the point of dying.

353
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:06,940
You look like you could die.

354
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:09,340
You look very unstable now.

355
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,850
I'm fine.

356
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,950
I think it's because I didn't sleep
in the airplane.

357
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,220
It's not something else.

358
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,879
I'm really fine
except feeling slightly sleepy.

359
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:17,250
I really don't have altitude sickness.

360
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,389
I really don't.

361
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,850
(Embarrassed)

362
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,590
That was...

363
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:24,559
not altitude sickness.

364
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,929
I was just tired.

365
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:27,460
Yes. I was really tired.

366
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,299
I felt really tired
when riding the motorcycle...

367
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,029
because I had to stay alert all the time.

368
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:32,330
For a scooter, I just need to pull this,

369
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,000
but for a motorcycle,
I have to control the clutch and the gear.

370
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,110
It made my body really tense.

371
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:39,710
It was cold,

372
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,740
the altitude was rising,
and I couldn't breathe.

373
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,909
The tension I couldn't feel
when I was riding the motorcycle...

374
00:14:43,909 --> 00:14:45,679
hit me at once when I got off.

375
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,750
So when I got off, I felt tired.

376
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,389
I felt something
beyond what could be expressed...

377
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,250
as feeling sleepy.

378
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,559
But it's not altitude sickness?

379
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:56,320
It really isn't altitude sickness.

380
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,259
Nose bleeding isn't a part
of altitude sickness.

381
00:14:58,259 --> 00:14:59,259
My gosh.

382
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:02,200
My nose must've bled
because of the pressure difference.

383
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,370
It could be from the pressure difference,

384
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,570
but it wasn't altitude sickness?

385
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,629
It wasn't altitude sickness.

386
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:07,070
Nosebleed isn't a symptom
of altitude sickness.

387
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,269
That's altitude sickness.

388
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:10,509
It makes me so worried if he's that bad.

389
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,679
That's like "A Moment Of Romance."

390
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:15,110
"A Moment Of Romance."

391
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:16,850
What's "A Moment Of Romance?"

392
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,210
- It's a Hong Kong movie.
- A Hong Kong movie.

393
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:21,649
(A movie with a great nosebleed scene
released in 1990)

394
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:23,080
It's really "A Moment Of Romance."

395
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,919
Tle, I have a question.

396
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,059
"Tle."

397
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:30,029
What's that, a denture?

398
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,259
- "Denture..."
- Is he a denture?

399
00:15:31,259 --> 00:15:33,929
- Saying "Pani Bottle" sounds too stiff.
- Okay.

400
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:35,059
Tle sounds nice.

401
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,059
Tle. Well...

402
00:15:36,059 --> 00:15:37,269
- Tle.
- Let's call him Tle.

403
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,429
- You traveled a lot.
- Yes.

404
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:42,070
Did you never bleed before?

405
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,870
- That was...
- Was that the first time?

406
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,009
- the first time, I think.
- Oh, dear.

407
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:46,009
Really?

408
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:47,679
I don't have altitude sickness yet.
I mean it.

409
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,840
- Not yet...
- If you admit...

410
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,710
to having altitude sickness,
will you lose your subscribers?

411
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,980
Why are you being so insistent?

412
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,779
It won't cost me anything,

413
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:57,320
but I should say what's wrong is wrong.

414
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,389
Sure.

415
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,019
I'm pretty sure that's the case.

416
00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:02,159
Let's save his face.

417
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,360
Stick it in your nose.

418
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,629
I will.

419
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:08,960
His nose...

420
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,129
He stuck that in his nose.

421
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,200
He's riding while he's injured.

422
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,669
(Despite his injury,)

423
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:19,809
(he continues his motorcycle tour.)

424
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:24,809
(They set off to La Raya,
their midway destination.)

425
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:26,649
Pani Bottle.

426
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,480
Pani Bottle.

427
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,779
I can hear you now.

428
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:31,250
- Pani Bottle.
- Yes.

429
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,320
- Where are you, Pani Bottle?
- Behind you.

430
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,620
Is your nose bleeding?

431
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,460
No. I'm fine.

432
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,690
(Laughing)

433
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:41,259
They keep taking care of Pani Bottle
because they're worried.

434
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,399
It's been so long
since I last had a nosebleed.

435
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
(They're riding and recuperating.)

436
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,639
There's a sauna.

437
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:53,639
- A sauna?
- Yes, there's a sauna.

438
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,549
Shall we go to a sauna when we reach?

439
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:00,850
You must want to heat up your body
and relax, Kian84.

440
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
(Request accepted)

441
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,019
I'll look for a place where you can.

442
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:06,149
Thank you.

443
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,389
For sure.

444
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,259
Gosh, it's so hard to travel on a bicycle.

445
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,170
I used to travel like that before.

446
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,829
- Pani Bottle.
- It looks the same.

447
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:22,170
- You did that?
- Yes, I did exactly that.

448
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:23,509
How long was it?

449
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,269
I didn't measure the distance.

450
00:17:25,269 --> 00:17:26,880
I traveled until the town located
at the furthest end of Argentina.

451
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,509
- Really?
- The furthest end of Argentina?

452
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:30,509
- Yes.
- How long did it take?

453
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,849
Six months.

454
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:33,650
You rode a bicycle for six months?

455
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:35,579
- Half a year?
- Six months.

456
00:17:35,579 --> 00:17:38,089
You withdrew money from Korea bit by bit?

457
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,259
Yes. I spent 6,000 dollars for 6 months.

458
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,690
I lived like a beggar.

459
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,259
Six thousand dollars for six months.

460
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:46,029
Six thousand dollars for six months?

461
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:47,430
I used up all my money.

462
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,500
- That's cool.
- You're really amazing.

463
00:17:49,829 --> 00:17:51,769
You're really amazing.
Traveling on a bicycle for six months.

464
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,299
I can never do it now
because it's so exhausting.

465
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:55,539
(It's so exhausting.)

466
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,210
- This is amazing.
- The view.

467
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,079
- We've never seen from above like this.
- Exactly.

468
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,079
It's so cool.

469
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,980
Now that the sun's setting,
the weather is changing.

470
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:08,880
It's 3,463m above sea level.

471
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,019
This is the highest place so far.

472
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,789
What was I doing,
living without seeing this splendid view?

473
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,289
It's not easy to come all the way here.

474
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,029
The town and the railway.

475
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,329
(Everywhere they look is a piece of art.)

476
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:24,430
This is insane.

477
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:27,369
I can't help but say that it's beautiful.

478
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,200
It's so nice.

479
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,509
"Feliz Viaje."

480
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,809
It means "have a good trip."

481
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,880
Yes.

482
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,950
- I'm having fun.
- Journey.

483
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,920
Guys, can we go faster?

484
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,049
- Yes.
- Yes.

485
00:18:42,549 --> 00:18:45,220
Go straight. There aren't any cars.

486
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,289
Okay.

487
00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:47,960
A train's passing by!

488
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:49,259
A train!

489
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:51,359
- That's really...
- Even the train is romantic.

490
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,690
(Hello.)

491
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,730
(Honking)

492
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,200
- Hey!
- Hello.

493
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,460
(The train responded to Si Eon.)

494
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,000
(Honking)

495
00:18:58,299 --> 00:18:59,430
- Hey!
- Hello.

496
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:02,599
Nice.

497
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,640
Did it honk because of us?

498
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,640
I think so.

499
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,640
Honk.

500
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,079
I waved at it, and it honked back.

501
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:11,480
(He is very excited.)

502
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,119
- Amazing.
- The train engineer knows what's cool.

503
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,579
For the 1st time in almost 5 hours,

504
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:19,619
a train passed by on the railway beside.

505
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:22,859
The train engineer honked...

506
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:24,789
at us.

507
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:29,529
(A dreamlike moment added
to the picturesque view)

508
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,769
I waved at it, and it honked back.

509
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:36,569
That felt familiar.

510
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,440
(Honking)

511
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,710
- They all waved at us.
- Cool guys.

512
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,279
They know what's cool.

513
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:47,420
They're cool.

514
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:49,579
This really heals you.

515
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,549
It really does.

516
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:53,349
(People)

517
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,720
South America has a lot of travelers
on motorcycles and bicycles.

518
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,460
Saying hi is nothing much,
but it makes me feel good.

519
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:03,059
(Very happy)

520
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,599
This is like a work of art.

521
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,339
It's so cool.

522
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,470
This is the best!

523
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,410
I was so excited.

524
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,440
It looks really cool to ride
for one hour like that.

525
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,710
It's 3,750m above sea level.

526
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:19,950
(Meanwhile,
they're 3,750m above sea level.)

527
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,980
Look in front. Look at the road...

528
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,019
and the mountain together.

529
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:28,089
What's this view?

530
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,329
This looks like the view...

531
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:33,329
from "3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother."

532
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,359
Do you know how
"3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother" ends?

533
00:20:36,359 --> 00:20:38,400
He hugs Patrasche the dog,

534
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,029
and they both freeze to death in a church.

535
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:41,599
Isn't that "A Dog of Flanders?"

536
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,069
Is that "A Dog of Flanders?"

537
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,710
Does he not look for his mom
in "A Dog of Flanders?"

538
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:46,809
He must've looked for her at least once.

539
00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:48,109
I thought wrong.

540
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:52,480
What to do with this
"3,000 Leagues in Search of Mother" vibe?

541
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:55,619
This is...

542
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,220
What is this? My goodness.

543
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,259
The mountain on the left.

544
00:21:03,259 --> 00:21:05,430
This is so cool.

545
00:21:05,789 --> 00:21:07,960
When I met the deadline for my webtoon,

546
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,529
I wonder why I only worked until now.

547
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,630
Isn't it like your concerns are...

548
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,140
- solved?
- That's right.

549
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,339
I felt like I only worked until then.

550
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:21,380
(He worked hard nonstop for 10 years
as a webtoon artist.)

551
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,079
(In the daily life that repeats,
he couldn't take care of himself.)

552
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:26,549
- Gosh, you worked hard.
- Yes.

553
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:29,579
(Once he finished his 10 years
of serialization,)

554
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,089
(all he had felt was emptiness.)

555
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:36,519
It's nice.

556
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,000
I should've done this when I was younger.

557
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,269
Now is still fine.

558
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,140
- You're cool. "Now is still fine."
- He's blunt but nice.

559
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,740
Seriously...

560
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,910
I'm about to tear up.

561
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,539
I lived without seeing this amazing view
until now.

562
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:01,119
Although it's not a comfortable trip,

563
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:02,880
I feel very happy.

564
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:06,250
You're not living your life to the fullest
if you don't travel.

565
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,160
(You travel to get the strength
to move forward again.)

566
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,460
I should do this once every year.

567
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,059
I should do it again.

568
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,559
I want to travel a lot.

569
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,670
I'm going to and from work...

570
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,339
like what I used to do
when I drew webtoons...

571
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:24,269
and following a fixed schedule for work.

572
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,809
I want to go on a trip again.

573
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,609
I feel a bit dizzy. Are you okay?

574
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,650
I'm feeling it a bit.

575
00:22:37,589 --> 00:22:39,220
Pani Bottle, what's the altitude?

576
00:22:39,589 --> 00:22:41,490
It's past 4,000m above sea level.

577
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,660
(They're past 4,000m above sea level.)

578
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:44,730
I just got chills.

579
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:49,099
I'm get to be on ground
4,000m above sea level while I'm alive.

580
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:53,000
We arrived at the ground 4,000m
above sea level on motorcycles.

581
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,640
Aren't we close to our destination?

582
00:22:56,769 --> 00:22:58,910
We're 335m away.

583
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:00,640
- You're right.
- Let's go!

584
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:04,609
"Aguas calientes?"

585
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,309
Is there a hot spring?

586
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:08,519
- Five thousand meters?
- A hot spring.

587
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:10,019
- A hot spring?
- Yes.

588
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:11,589
There's a hot spring?

589
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:15,559
(Just now,
Kian84 wanted to go to a sauna.)

590
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:18,029
(Saved)

591
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:21,200
- A hot spring.
- There was a sauna.

592
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,230
My gosh.

593
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,569
Everyone, turn left.

594
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,500
"Aguas calientes" means hot spring.

595
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,339
- Really?
- Yes.

596
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,410
- Since we had no plan,
- Just stop by on the way.

597
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,339
we just stopped by wherever we wanted to.

598
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:35,109
We didn't initially plan on going there.

599
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,579
Nice.

600
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:40,180
(With Si Eon's lead,
they enter the hot spring.)

601
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,720
(How is the Peruvian hot spring 4,000m
above sea level?)

602
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,119
There's a hot spring at a place like this.

603
00:23:49,389 --> 00:23:52,260
"Aguas calientes." "Aguas" means water
and "calientes" means warm.

604
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,690
- Hot spring.
- Is this a sauna?

605
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,589
What are they? Did they just arrive?

606
00:23:55,589 --> 00:23:56,790
- I think...
- A field trip.

607
00:23:56,790 --> 00:24:00,159
a Peruvian high school came
on a field trip.

608
00:24:00,629 --> 00:24:01,770
Hello.

609
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,569
- Hello.
- Hello.

610
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:07,540
Do you know BLACKPINK?

611
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:10,369
- That was so random.
- Do they not know them?

612
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,940
Everyone knows BLACKPINK.

613
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:15,780
I'm in Peru,
and I feel so sorry for Jennie...

614
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,809
that I only met once.

615
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:20,349
(Even though it was an online meeting,
he wants to show off as a fan.)

616
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:22,389
High school?

617
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,849
How old are you?

618
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:28,059
How old are you?

619
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:30,260
How old are you?

620
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,159
(The brains of the group approaches them.)

621
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,099
How old are you?

622
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:36,300
- Fifteen.
- They're fifteen.

623
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,829
- Fifteen. Yes.
- You're from middle school.

624
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,440
What's a field trip in Spanish?

625
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:42,010
I don't know.

626
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,639
Travel is "viaje."

627
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:46,180
- Traveling?
- Yes.

628
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,210
Yes?

629
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,149
Are you on a school trip?

630
00:24:49,149 --> 00:24:50,849
They're on a school trip.

631
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:52,349
- You're good.
- The king of communication.

632
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:56,050
Every country's field trip is similar.

633
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:57,750
- Bye.
- Bye.

634
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:59,760
You had a nosebleed just now.
Are you okay?

635
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,359
I don't think I am.

636
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,530
- I feel sleepy.
- I was so shocked.

637
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:04,559
I think I might faint in the sauna.

638
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,230
That's altitude sickness.

639
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,329
Just admit it.

640
00:25:07,329 --> 00:25:08,770
- You...
- My head doesn't hurt, really.

641
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,569
- You're doing this on purpose.
- Our heads don't hurt either.

642
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:12,740
You said you didn't have altitude sickness
to look tough.

643
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,399
I really don't have altitude sickness.

644
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:15,839
- I really don't.
- Just now,

645
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:18,069
your nose bled like a movie.

646
00:25:18,069 --> 00:25:20,579
I thought it was snot,
but it started dripping.

647
00:25:21,139 --> 00:25:22,550
We need to heat up our bodies.

648
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,280
We overexerted ourselves.

649
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,250
Guys, we will get prepared...

650
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:30,450
- There are clothes inside.
- and go to a Peruvian sauna...

651
00:25:30,589 --> 00:25:32,990
- Everyone.
- that is 4,000m above sea level.

652
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,720
I've never been here before too.

653
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:36,490
I only passed by.

654
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,790
I'm curious.

655
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:38,859
You need to get warm.

656
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,859
The view's fantastic.

657
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,430
Have you never been to a sauna
in South America?

658
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,200
I did go to a hot spring in Bolivia.

659
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,899
- A hot spring in Bolivia?
- Past the Uyuni Salt Flats,

660
00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:48,240
there's a hot spring.

661
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,409
That place is amazing.

662
00:25:49,409 --> 00:25:51,069
It's a desert without anything around,

663
00:25:51,069 --> 00:25:53,579
but there's a hot spring right there.

664
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:55,210
- Here?
- No, Bolivia.

665
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,379
If it's near the Uyuni Salt Flats,

666
00:25:57,379 --> 00:25:58,750
won't the water be salty?

667
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,919
No. There's no water there.

668
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,089
There's no water?

669
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:03,490
How can a hot spring not have water?

670
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:05,059
I mean,
the Uyuni Salt Flats don't have water.

671
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:06,589
- I see.
- There, yes.

672
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:09,030
It's past the Uyuni Salt Flats.

673
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,430
Isn't that salt?

674
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,800
So it's past the Uyuni Salt Flats.

675
00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:14,430
You need to tell us about three times.

676
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,500
They don't listen.

677
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:18,000
They can't communicate.

678
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,540
- They don't listen to each other at all.
- They can't communicate well.

679
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,770
- I can't hear well.
- It's altitude sickness.

680
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,710
There's a reason
why Pani Bottle had a nosebleed.

681
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,780
Exactly.

682
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:27,139
(The causes of his nosebleed)

683
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,280
I'm so curious.

684
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,109
A Peruvian sauna.

685
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,480
- "Aguas calientes."
- I'm excited.

686
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,750
There are a lot of people.

687
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,490
I'm so curious.

688
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,960
- Tickets.
- Let's buy the tickets.

689
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,220
How much is it?

690
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,089
Sauna.

691
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:46,329
It looks like eight soles.

692
00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:48,300
Let's try the eight soles one.

693
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,339
One, two, three people.

694
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,069
(They learn how to count in Spanish
while they wait for the tickets.)

695
00:26:58,409 --> 00:26:59,940
- Let's dance.
- Where did he go?

696
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,339
- Four.
- Four.

697
00:27:01,339 --> 00:27:02,750
- Let's dance.
- Where did he go?

698
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,450
- What's this?
- Where did he go?

699
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:06,520
Hey, man.

700
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,720
He disappeared
when we asked for the tickets.

701
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,089
After you paid?

702
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,389
Is there a way out?

703
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:15,930
The owner suddenly disappeared.

704
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,559
Is this magic?

705
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,760
Where are you?

706
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:23,069
The owner went into hiding.

707
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:24,770
What's this?

708
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,369
(They were just learning how to count.)

709
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:27,800
How did he get out?

710
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,909
Did they see a ghost?

711
00:27:28,909 --> 00:27:31,210
- Exactly.
- That's the only space in there.

712
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,379
Where did he hide?

713
00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:37,680
(Puzzled)

714
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,050
- Man.
- "Man."

715
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:43,250
- He's here.
- What was "man?"

716
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,659
(I'm going to issue now.)

717
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,990
The door's down here.

718
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,829
It was over there.

719
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:52,159
(The owner had his own exit.)

720
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,470
(While they were buying the tickets)

721
00:27:57,069 --> 00:27:59,240
- He left.
- Did he go to take something?

722
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,770
(He escaped secretly
using his private exit.)

723
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:03,510
- My goodness.
- It's like the secret to a magic trick.

724
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:07,139
Three, sauna.

725
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,409
- Sauna?
- Sauna. Hot spring.

726
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,720
One, two, san, four...

727
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,819
No. One, san, three.

728
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,589
- One, san, three, four.
- Three, four.

729
00:28:17,589 --> 00:28:19,260
- One more.
- What's "san?"

730
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,919
Isn't it "san?"

731
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:22,990
- Isn't that three in Mandarin?
- Isn't that Mandarin?

732
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,359
Really? What's that?

733
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,500
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

734
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,000
- What is it again?
- One, two,

735
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,139
- three, four.
- What's "san?"

736
00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:34,970
- One, two, three in Mandarin.
- One, two, three in Mandarin.

737
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,510
Really?

738
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:39,909
- It's 5 soles per person.
- How much is 5 soles in dollars?

739
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,210
It's 1.70 dollars.

740
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,250
The sauna's so cheap.

741
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,349
One, ssan, three, four.

742
00:28:45,349 --> 00:28:47,119
This is warm water.

743
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:48,819
It's boiling.

744
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,250
- You'll die if you get in there.
- Pani Bottle.

745
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,059
- It looks like a volcano.
- You'll die.

746
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:54,260
This is way too hot.

747
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,129
- It's boiling.
- You'll die.

748
00:28:56,129 --> 00:28:58,829
This is the right temperature
to add ramyeon and soup base.

749
00:28:58,829 --> 00:29:00,800
There. We need to go to the place
where people are gathered in the water.

750
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:02,800
- We can go in, right?
- Yes.

751
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:04,930
This looks warm too.

752
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:06,000
Yes.

753
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:08,909
(The outdoor hot spring
is next to a small volcano.)

754
00:29:08,909 --> 00:29:10,169
That's a part of nature.

755
00:29:10,169 --> 00:29:12,240
- That's an open-air hot spring?
- Yes, it is.

756
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,309
How nice.

757
00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:15,579
(The sulfur hot spring is located
on the way to the observatory in La Raya.)

758
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:17,349
I could actually smell the sulfur.

759
00:29:17,349 --> 00:29:19,250
That's why the water seems muddy.

760
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:21,579
- But the smell of sulfur...
- How did it smell?

761
00:29:21,579 --> 00:29:24,190
- It smells like boiled eggs.
- I see. I get it.

762
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,819
First of all, where's the changing room?

763
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,889
Is that it? Yes, that's it.

764
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,589
- What?
- I think it's there.

765
00:29:31,589 --> 00:29:33,859
- That's it.
- Then where can we put our bags?

766
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,030
We need to keep an eye on our bags.

767
00:29:37,099 --> 00:29:39,399
- Then I'll go and change.
- Okay.

768
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,440
- Shorts and short-sleeve shirts?
- Yes.

769
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,809
I'll just wear my swimsuit.

770
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:45,309
- Just your swimsuit? Okay.
- Yes.

771
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,780
Gosh, it stinks.

772
00:29:48,649 --> 00:29:49,780
I can't lock the door.

773
00:29:52,149 --> 00:29:53,780
Gosh. When I go into the hot spring,

774
00:29:54,879 --> 00:29:56,389
I might pass out.

775
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,149
(Slamming)

776
00:29:58,319 --> 00:29:59,690
What's wrong with the door?

777
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:01,960
Darn it. I can't lock it.

778
00:30:02,589 --> 00:30:04,530
People can see inside the changing room.

779
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:05,960
That's interesting.

780
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:09,399
(Stripping)

781
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:13,940
Wait. Did I not bring my swimsuit? No way.

782
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:16,109
This is crazy. Why did I not pack that?

783
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:17,869
- Can I just wear my underwear?
- You can.

784
00:30:17,869 --> 00:30:18,879
- I can?
- It's fine.

785
00:30:18,879 --> 00:30:20,010
As long as you're fine with that.

786
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,809
- I'll be fine.
- Okay.

787
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:24,550
I didn't bring my swimsuit.
I thought I did.

788
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,079
Welcome.

789
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:27,079
(Last night)

790
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:29,250
Can I borrow your toothpaste?

791
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,690
- Sure.
- Toothpaste too?

792
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,490
You didn't prepare anything for the trip.

793
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,359
I rarely do.

794
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:36,389
I really thought I brought one.

795
00:30:36,629 --> 00:30:39,099
But I realized that I didn't bring
any toothpaste or swimsuit when I arrived.

796
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:41,829
When I travel, I always pack my swimsuit.

797
00:30:41,829 --> 00:30:44,200
But I didn't come prepared
or bring a lot of things.

798
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,639
The funny thing is
I always pack my swimsuit.

799
00:30:46,639 --> 00:30:48,569
- Just that time?
- Right. I didn't pack it then.

800
00:30:48,569 --> 00:30:50,839
I asked him. "Why didn't you bring this?"
Then he answered so confidently.

801
00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:52,339
"I can buy it."

802
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,440
- When did I say that?
- Was he...

803
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,710
- He was like...
- Was he going to hit someone?

804
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:56,950
What was that?

805
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:58,619
- He's a stubborn version of Kian84.
- Yes.

806
00:30:58,619 --> 00:31:00,319
He can be quite stubborn.

807
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:03,220
Who pooped here? Why?

808
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,119
- Gosh.
- Did someone pee here?

809
00:31:05,589 --> 00:31:07,389
- It smells like urine here.
- Right.

810
00:31:07,389 --> 00:31:09,230
Seriously. Why would anyone pee
in the changing room?

811
00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:11,129
- It stinks there too?
- A bit.

812
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:12,930
(They are unexpectedly attacked
by feces and urine.)

813
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:15,470
By the way, I'm really glad I bought this.

814
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,569
- What?
- I bought a short-sleeve shirt yesterday.

815
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,169
Does the T-shirt say "llama?"

816
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:22,839
Yes. Llama.

817
00:31:23,069 --> 00:31:24,409
That's like a knockoff.

818
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,740
- I couldn't believe my eyes.
- There was one with "llama."

819
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,609
- What else was there?
- You bought a nice one.

820
00:31:29,609 --> 00:31:31,480
- "Llama-didas."
- I bet you can only buy that there.

821
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,020
- Llama-didas.
- Yes.

822
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,550
(Special, localized T-shirts)

823
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:39,319
- That's nice. That makes a nice souvenir.
- That's novel.

824
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,159
He bought a nice regional product.

825
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:46,099
- What if people say this to us?
- It smells like poop.

826
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,099
"Why did you change in the bathroom?"

827
00:31:48,099 --> 00:31:49,669
- It looks like a bathroom.
- Right?

828
00:31:49,669 --> 00:31:51,569
- But there's no hole.
- Right.

829
00:31:51,569 --> 00:31:52,639
- There's no hole.
- Yes.

830
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:54,240
But people pooped and urinated there.

831
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:55,839
You don't need a hole to go.

832
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:57,270
Si Eon. Do you think...

833
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:59,040
- I bet a dog probably went there.
- Gosh.

834
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,540
- Was it like that in every stall?
- Yes.

835
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:02,879
- Which one should we go?
- What about this one?

836
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,109
- "Poza number one."
- Let's go to that one.

837
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:06,879
It doesn't say about the temperature.

838
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:10,119
Is this hot?

839
00:32:10,419 --> 00:32:11,490
Hot?

840
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:13,260
(It's perfect.)

841
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:14,889
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

842
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:16,230
It's pretty big.

843
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,859
- That hurts.
- The bottoms of his feet are weak too.

844
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,000
The altitude sickness is getting to him,
and the bottoms of his feet are weak too.

845
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:24,230
(Checking the temperature of the water)

846
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:29,540
This... Wait. Is this possible?

847
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,639
- Why? Was it hot?
- It was so hot.

848
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:33,240
- I can just keep my underwear on, right?
- Sure.

849
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,579
- I only have these shorts.
- You'll just go in with your underwear.

850
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:39,349
A lot of local people there
went in there with only their underwear.

851
00:32:39,349 --> 00:32:41,450
Right. I saw people
just with their underwear.

852
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,589
Right.

853
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,419
This is nice.

854
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,359
- Gosh.
- Goodness. Hey.

855
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,329
He likes to put on a show.

856
00:32:52,329 --> 00:32:54,359
- He held his nose, though.
- Right.

857
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,829
Why did they add
the slow motion effect to this?

858
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,270
- "Good boy."
- What was that? "Good boy?"

859
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,270
"Pretentious."

860
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,510
(I'll allow all the hot water
in the world to splash me.)

861
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,940
- He's acting tough again.
- He's acting tough again.

862
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,240
- His face got red again.
- Hey, your nose is bleeding.

863
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,710
- Did his nose bleed again?
- Hey, your nose is bleeding.

864
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,710
Again?

865
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:14,079
Pani Bottle, stop acting as if
you're tougher than the altitude sickness.

866
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,520
Tougher than the altitude sickness.

867
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,889
Come on.

868
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:20,159
Gosh. That makes him look so lame.

869
00:33:21,089 --> 00:33:22,589
Pani Bottle, what kind of water is this?

870
00:33:22,589 --> 00:33:24,460
It's sulfur water.

871
00:33:24,829 --> 00:33:25,960
Gosh, this hits the spot.

872
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,829
Hold on. To go in, the water is...

873
00:33:29,329 --> 00:33:31,700
In 1, 2. We should go in the water at one.

874
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:33,500
(Going in)

875
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,409
(Screaming)

876
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,210
Gosh. This is nice.

877
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:42,909
(Pani Bottle swims across the hot spring
while holding his nose.)

878
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,280
Gosh. That was nice. It was so warm.

879
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,819
- It just washed away all of our fatigue.
- This is nice.

880
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,450
It's so nice.

881
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,990
I wonder if sulfur will be effective
in getting rid of dandruff?

882
00:33:52,819 --> 00:33:53,990
Do you have dandruff?

883
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,829
- Dandruff...
- I have dandruff too.

884
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:58,089
You guys have a lot in common.

885
00:33:58,089 --> 00:34:00,030
(They bond over dandruff.)

886
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,829
I wonder if sulfur will be effective
in getting rid of dandruff?

887
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:09,970
(Floating)

888
00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:16,180
(Pani Bottle goes under the water
just like Kian84.)

889
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:19,619
I can't go under the water.
My ears aren't good.

890
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:25,859
(Elegantly swimming
to wish for a healthy scalp)

891
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:28,289
- He's good at swimming.
- Gosh.

892
00:34:29,959 --> 00:34:32,229
- He's become one with water.
- Yes.

893
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,530
Since the water has sulfur,
it might've gotten rid of some dandruff.

894
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:39,140
Kian84.

895
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,499
I'm so happy right now.

896
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:42,640
- Pani Bottle, can you swim?
- What?

897
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,839
- Can you swim?
- I can't.

898
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,339
- Really?
- I can only go under the water.

899
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:47,609
- Really? You're a certified freediver.
- Yes.

900
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:49,209
Do you want to see
who stays longer under the water?

901
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,479
Are you up for a match?

902
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,979
Don't act tough. You might pass out.

903
00:34:53,979 --> 00:34:55,249
I won't go that far.

904
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,819
The best freediver... How should I put it?

905
00:34:58,819 --> 00:35:00,819
The rule of freediving
is not going too far.

906
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,490
- "Good boy."
- Testing your limit can cause you a lot.

907
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,229
- So I won't test my limit.
- You slept all day yesterday.

908
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:06,629
But your nose still bled today.

909
00:35:06,629 --> 00:35:08,560
- I didn't sleep all day.
- Okay.

910
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,700
- You slept for 18 hours.
- Are you up for it?

911
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,999
- Are you serious?
- Hold on. Okay.

912
00:35:12,999 --> 00:35:14,640
I can't do it. I can't go
under the water because of my ears.

913
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,439
- Your ears? Then you can count.
- Okay.

914
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:17,609
I'll watch you guys.

915
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:19,180
- My lung capacity... Hold on.
- Okay.

916
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,810
I'll hold you guys like this.

917
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,910
You must play that game when you're there.

918
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:25,780
(He swam in the Amazon with the piranhas.)

919
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,379
- He loves water.
- Swimming.

920
00:35:27,379 --> 00:35:30,089
(He swam in the Amazon with the piranhas.)

921
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:33,089
(Participant 2, Pani Bottle)

922
00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:36,129
(He's a certified freediver.)

923
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,189
(He can hold his breath
for 1 minute and 30 seconds.)

924
00:35:38,189 --> 00:35:39,800
He's a certified freediver.

925
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,129
Right. Not everyone can get certified.

926
00:35:41,129 --> 00:35:42,600
- He's a professional.
- Are you ready?

927
00:35:43,129 --> 00:35:44,999
- In 1, 2, 3.
- I'm curious.

928
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:46,300
Their pride is at stake on this.

929
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,600
(The breath-holding match begins.)

930
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,740
And the water must be hot.

931
00:35:50,939 --> 00:35:52,280
What if he comes up right away?

932
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,510
(Kian84)

933
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,910
(Pani Bottle)

934
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,019
- I'm getting nervous.
- I'm getting nervous just watching them.

935
00:36:01,649 --> 00:36:03,249
(Increasing the speed 5 times faster)

936
00:36:03,249 --> 00:36:04,819
Really? They stayed underwater that long?

937
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:07,120
They both wanted to win the match.

938
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,890
And people are watching too.

939
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:13,600
- Gosh.
- He lasted 45 seconds.

940
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,930
He didn't even last a minute?

941
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,729
- Come on, Pani Bottle.
- I lost.

942
00:36:18,729 --> 00:36:19,800
- Pani Bottle.
- He lost.

943
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,870
You lasted 45 seconds.

944
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,870
(Getting up)

945
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,039
Kian84 lasted 49 seconds. You, 45 seconds.

946
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:26,039
Kian84 wins.

947
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:27,810
- He always loses.
- I have a reason.

948
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,910
(I have a reason.)

949
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:33,149
(I always have a reason for losing.)

950
00:36:33,879 --> 00:36:37,149
(The freediver finally reveals
the reason behind his defeat.)

951
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:40,789
I easily get hot. I'm serious.

952
00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:42,490
I easily get hot. I'm serious.

953
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,760
- Hey.
- I easily get hot.

954
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,560
- What kind of excuse is that?
- He has a lot of excuses.

955
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,160
- How is that relevant?
- Seriously.

956
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,729
- The water doesn't matter for you?
- I can stay longer if the water is cold.

957
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:52,439
- I see. Because the water was warm?
- But the water was warm. I was too hot.

958
00:36:52,439 --> 00:36:54,140
- Do you want to do it in the Antarctic?
- Of course.

959
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,399
I'm in no matter what.

960
00:36:55,399 --> 00:36:57,970
(He'll allow himself
to go underwater in the Antarctic.)

961
00:36:58,569 --> 00:37:01,910
I clearly remember him saying
that he could last two minutes.

962
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,310
- Pani Bottle.
- Pani Bottle.

963
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:05,479
What do you mean you could last
two minutes underwater?

964
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,180
Were you going easy on me?

965
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,220
I need to set you straight.

966
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,749
We won't scold you or anything.

967
00:37:10,749 --> 00:37:13,419
But you need to stop mentioning
how you're a freediver.

968
00:37:13,419 --> 00:37:15,060
I really have the certificate.

969
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:17,589
- Freediving for 45 seconds...
- Right.

970
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,600
- I was out of breath.
- He was out of breath.

971
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,700
The altitude is high here.

972
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,129
You said the altitude sickness
didn't affect you!

973
00:37:22,129 --> 00:37:23,370
(Flinching)

974
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,870
Everything he says is a lie.

975
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,669
Pretentious Bottle.

976
00:37:27,669 --> 00:37:29,970
Gosh. After arriving in Peru,
today has been...

977
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,769
- Was it a fun day? The hardest day?
- a touching day.

978
00:37:31,769 --> 00:37:32,810
A touching day.

979
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:33,879
(Feeling proud)

980
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:36,010
- I see cars on the mountain there.
- Where?

981
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:38,109
- Do we have to get there?
- We have to get there.

982
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:40,350
- That's the path?
- Then let's hurry.

983
00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:41,620
Let me explain. Look.

984
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:44,689
We'll be going to the highest point
we can reach via motorcycle.

985
00:37:44,919 --> 00:37:46,019
- Really?
- Yes.

986
00:37:46,019 --> 00:37:47,260
What time is it now?

987
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,560
(Let me see.)

988
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,330
It's 6:50 a.m. in Seoul.

989
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,160
No, not the time in Seoul.
What time is it here?

990
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,530
- It's 6:50 a.m.
- How would I know that?

991
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,169
- I should call my mom.
- It's 5 p.m. now.

992
00:37:56,169 --> 00:37:58,530
- My mom gets worried.
- What a nice son.

993
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,999
I noticed this yesterday.

994
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,269
The sun goes down at 5:30 p.m.

995
00:38:02,269 --> 00:38:03,370
- We should hurry.
- Yes.

996
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,470
- Let's go.
- Now. Yes.

997
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,810
- Hold on. Do we have a towel?
- I have one.

998
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:10,450
Kian84 looks cool with wet hair like that.

999
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,810
Well, you know...

1000
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,120
It looks like he applied hair mousse.

1001
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,919
I sometimes push up my forehead.

1002
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,390
(Kian84 with pushed-up bangs)

1003
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:19,990
(A fan of Kian84)

1004
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,459
(Two girls approach Kian84.)

1005
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:23,589
- Pani Bottle.
- Yes.

1006
00:38:24,789 --> 00:38:25,930
A photo?

1007
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,100
- A photo.
- Gosh.

1008
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:28,560
Are they his fans?

1009
00:38:29,169 --> 00:38:30,499
I'm only wearing my underwear.

1010
00:38:31,629 --> 00:38:32,669
(Pani Bottle joins them in his underwear.)

1011
00:38:32,669 --> 00:38:33,970
Underwear Bottle.

1012
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,709
(Underwear)

1013
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:37,039
How fascinating.

1014
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:39,539
Hold on.

1015
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:42,410
The Internet is slow.

1016
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,479
- Internet? Instagram?
- Yes.

1017
00:38:44,709 --> 00:38:46,819
- Internet.
- Internet.

1018
00:38:46,819 --> 00:38:48,379
- She'll post that?
- Okay.

1019
00:38:48,379 --> 00:38:49,550
- Okay.
- Sure.

1020
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,620
Bye.

1021
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,660
Very cool. Very cold.

1022
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:55,629
That rhymed.

1023
00:38:55,629 --> 00:38:56,760
(The older guys go to the changing room.)

1024
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,789
Do you know BLACKPINK?

1025
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,459
Yes. We're Korean. Jennie.

1026
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,370
I don't personally know them.

1027
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:07,899
But I know that
BLACKPINK is a Korean group.

1028
00:39:08,769 --> 00:39:10,069
I don't get it.

1029
00:39:10,609 --> 00:39:11,769
BTS.

1030
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,039
BTS.

1031
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,839
Help me out!

1032
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:17,249
I think they're asking me
if I'm friends with BTS.

1033
00:39:17,879 --> 00:39:19,419
(The so-called Jennie's friend comes out
after hearing his request.)

1034
00:39:19,419 --> 00:39:20,950
- There he is.
- There he is.

1035
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,550
- Jennie's friend.
- Jennie's friend.

1036
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:24,120
BTS' friend.

1037
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,319
- "BTS' friend."
- Are you friends with BTS?

1038
00:39:26,319 --> 00:39:29,060
She didn't do anything wrong.
Jennie just did one video call with me.

1039
00:39:30,229 --> 00:39:31,459
Jennie of BLACKPINK.

1040
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:33,930
She's my friend.

1041
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,359
(Acting like a fan again)

1042
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:38,030
- Phone. Friend.
- "Phone. Friend."

1043
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,999
- Do you know SHINee?
- SHINee.

1044
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:41,240
- SHINee?
- Yes.

1045
00:39:41,269 --> 00:39:44,140
- Do you know KEY of SHINee?
- Yes.

1046
00:39:44,209 --> 00:39:47,310
KEY is my brother.

1047
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,149
Wait.

1048
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:52,580
I acted like the coolest guy.

1049
00:39:53,249 --> 00:39:55,350
Right. I'll show it to you.

1050
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:58,589
(The celebrity takes out his phone.)

1051
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,890
(The K-Pop fans wait for him.)

1052
00:40:02,189 --> 00:40:04,430
Do you know KEY of SHINee?

1053
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:05,490
That's proof.

1054
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,930
You know him? It's me.

1055
00:40:11,669 --> 00:40:13,970
- You?
- She doesn't believe him.

1056
00:40:14,269 --> 00:40:16,310
Yes. I look different, right?

1057
00:40:16,939 --> 00:40:17,970
(Zooming in)

1058
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:20,109
Why did she zoom in?

1059
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,410
I couldn't take a picture with Jennie
as she was busy.

1060
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:24,979
I only had one video call with Jennie.

1061
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,879
They are just phone buddies.

1062
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:29,850
Okay. Are you a singer?

1063
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:31,289
Is that your dream?

1064
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,560
No. Anyway, be happy.

1065
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,089
- "Be happy."
- Let's go.

1066
00:40:37,089 --> 00:40:38,560
- A photo?
- You wished her happiness.

1067
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:39,760
We already took one.

1068
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:41,459
Fine. Let's take another one.

1069
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:42,870
Somehow, you guys could communicate.

1070
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:45,169
Kian84, you just spoke in Korean.

1071
00:40:45,169 --> 00:40:46,269
(The master of communication)

1072
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:50,310
Jennie. KEY. I'm really sorry.

1073
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:52,269
Thank you.

1074
00:40:52,269 --> 00:40:53,640
Thank you.

1075
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:57,910
(She smacks the back of her friend's head
and spreads Korean.)

1076
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:59,010
She smacked her friend.

1077
00:40:59,479 --> 00:41:01,379
Thank you.

1078
00:41:01,379 --> 00:41:02,919
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1079
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,220
I will never mention...

1080
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:10,089
BLACKPINK ever again.

1081
00:41:10,229 --> 00:41:11,330
I'm sorry.

1082
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,999
Okay. As long as you were happy.

1083
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,600
- They seem really happy.
- Right.

1084
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:21,240
(Closed for the day)

1085
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:22,810
K-Pop was popular in South America...

1086
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,510
seven years ago. But it was still popular.

1087
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,310
- I should go to South America.
- Isn't K-Pop at its peak there?

1088
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,680
Seven years ago,
I saw DVD or videotapes...

1089
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,950
on the street.

1090
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,109
They sold a lot of DVDs or videotapes
for Korean dramas.

1091
00:41:32,109 --> 00:41:33,149
I see.

1092
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:35,990
(In no time, the sunset engulfs the sky.)

1093
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:39,589
(They set out
to the highest point, La Raya.)

1094
00:41:39,789 --> 00:41:41,890
Gosh. The hot spring recharged...

1095
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:43,560
- half of my energy.
- Right.

1096
00:41:47,729 --> 00:41:50,229
Gosh. The view changed again.

1097
00:41:50,569 --> 00:41:51,999
This is amazing.

1098
00:41:54,669 --> 00:41:55,939
My eyes don't sting anymore.

1099
00:41:56,109 --> 00:41:58,410
- Don't you feel great?
- Yes. It feels great.

1100
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,879
I feel dry and soft.

1101
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,149
Kian84, can you feel
the attitude going up?

1102
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,479
I see the numbers going up still.

1103
00:42:06,479 --> 00:42:07,479
Right.

1104
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:09,550
Pani Bottle, what's the altitude now?

1105
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:11,019
It's 4,230m.

1106
00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:13,160
Right. I'm at 4,200m now.

1107
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,419
Right. I'm at 4,230m.

1108
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,819
Gosh.

1109
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:19,129
Si Eon, if the sun goes down,
it will be pitch-dark here.

1110
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,399
Exactly.

1111
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,459
We do have to hurry up.

1112
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:24,569
- Should we pick up the speed?
- Yes.

1113
00:42:24,999 --> 00:42:26,240
How about 70 to 80?

1114
00:42:26,769 --> 00:42:27,939
- Okay.
- Okay.

1115
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:32,510
When we got to that point, there weren't
any cars from the opposite direction.

1116
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:35,410
It's getting emptier now.
I only see the three of you.

1117
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,350
Nice!

1118
00:42:37,649 --> 00:42:39,280
(Chuckling)

1119
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,950
Gosh. The wind feels so refreshing!

1120
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:43,450
This is great!

1121
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,149
Gosh.

1122
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:50,089
It's different in the evening.

1123
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,999
There was nothing on the road.
When we drove on that straight road,

1124
00:42:55,229 --> 00:42:58,030
the mountain was really high,
and the surrounding view was really nice.

1125
00:42:58,030 --> 00:42:59,970
When we were driving fast there,

1126
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:02,870
I could feel the adrenaline rush.

1127
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,269
When the sun was setting,

1128
00:43:04,269 --> 00:43:07,439
the view was just out-of-this-world.
That's how I felt then.

1129
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,450
There were no cars.

1130
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:12,720
The entire view felt dreamy.

1131
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,919
Yes. It was dreamy.

1132
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:17,350
Gosh. We'll crush
all the other MBC variety shows.

1133
00:43:18,689 --> 00:43:20,160
As long as we're having fun!

1134
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,589
Let's edit that out!

1135
00:43:22,589 --> 00:43:24,160
Edit that out!

1136
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,930
- Gosh. No. People will criticize me.
- Oh, my.

1137
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:27,899
Kian84, you did crush it.

1138
00:43:27,899 --> 00:43:28,959
- Edit it out.
- You called it.

1139
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,930
(Falling down)

1140
00:43:31,899 --> 00:43:33,100
What's wrong?

1141
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,269
- Edit it out!
- Hey.

1142
00:43:34,269 --> 00:43:35,769
- Edit it out.
- I've never seen him like this.

1143
00:43:35,769 --> 00:43:38,470
Kian84. Don't slam the floor.
My neighbor will come up.

1144
00:43:38,709 --> 00:43:39,839
Don't slam it.

1145
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:43,350
- It's approaching 4,300m now.
- Gosh.

1146
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,450
- I'm starting to see ice on the mountain.
- Yes.

1147
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:47,620
- The permanent snow.
- Ice?

1148
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,450
Gosh. Over there.

1149
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:51,649
The snow didn't melt. It's still there.

1150
00:43:51,649 --> 00:43:52,959
The permanent snow.

1151
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,220
(The permanent snow is seen
past the ridge.)

1152
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:59,260
Si Eon, you can see
a lot of the snow on the left now.

1153
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,300
(Intrigued)

1154
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:02,999
Gosh. There's so much snow.

1155
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:06,240
The altitude is 4,330m.

1156
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:07,399
- Okay.
- Gosh.

1157
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,539
(The permanent snow is welcoming them
at 4,330m above ground.)

1158
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:17,609
Right there. It's at 4,338m.

1159
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,819
It's at 4,338m. Gosh.

1160
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:22,419
"Road Limit." I think it's the right way.

1161
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:27,720
(They safely arrive before the sunset.)

1162
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,260
- That's great.
- It would've been so cold at night.

1163
00:44:32,899 --> 00:44:36,600
(The highest point
in the Route of the Sun)

1164
00:44:37,069 --> 00:44:38,830
Gosh. Look at the mountain.

1165
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,399
Gosh. Look how only that part
of the mountain still has snow.

1166
00:44:41,399 --> 00:44:42,470
(La Raya at the altitude of 4,335m)

1167
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:43,870
That was the peak.

1168
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:48,240
Guys. Stand over there.

1169
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:50,510
No. Come out. I'll take pictures
of you guys separately.

1170
00:44:50,709 --> 00:44:52,249
- Si Eon.
- I'll take one for Pani Bottle first.

1171
00:44:52,819 --> 00:44:54,450
- Pani Bottle, I'll take a good one.
- Okay.

1172
00:44:56,249 --> 00:44:58,089
- In 1, 2.
- His skin is glowing.

1173
00:44:58,749 --> 00:45:00,459
The picture came out nicely.

1174
00:45:00,459 --> 00:45:01,589
That's a nice photo.

1175
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:05,390
Si Eon, do you think you can include
the church over there?

1176
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:07,930
Gosh. I ran for a few seconds.
And I'm out of breath.

1177
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:10,069
- You admitted that you felt it, right?
- I ran for a few seconds.

1178
00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:11,669
I was feeling the altitude sickness then.

1179
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,870
Great.

1180
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,510
- Gosh.
- That's such a nice photo.

1181
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:18,109
That's so picturesque.

1182
00:45:18,109 --> 00:45:19,240
In 1, 2.

1183
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,680
(Conquering the altitude of 4,335m)

1184
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,740
Nice.

1185
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,249
Pani Bottle, join him.

1186
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,950
In 1, 2, 3.

1187
00:45:28,149 --> 00:45:30,019
I love how the pictures come out
from film cameras.

1188
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:32,890
Let's stand here. Look cool.
Lean back like this.

1189
00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:35,890
(Striking a cool pose)

1190
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:37,830
- In 1, 2, 3.
- Kian84 is pretending to look handsome.

1191
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:39,430
(The view makes him
want to look handsome.)

1192
00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:40,930
The photos came out nicely.

1193
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:42,999
Okay. I got it.

1194
00:45:42,999 --> 00:45:44,200
(They're dizzy
only after taking the pictures.)

1195
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,200
I was dizzy.

1196
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,240
- It was really exhausting.
- I'm dying here.

1197
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,640
I can feel it.

1198
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:50,209
All I did was to crouch down and get up.
But I'm dizzy.

1199
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:51,939
Does it feel very different?

1200
00:45:51,939 --> 00:45:53,740
- It's so different.
- It is?

1201
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,479
It was exhausting on a deeper level.

1202
00:45:56,910 --> 00:45:58,550
Let's include both of them
in the pictures.

1203
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:01,019
(Despite the altitude sickness,
they keep taking pictures.)

1204
00:46:01,019 --> 00:46:02,050
Stay there.

1205
00:46:02,379 --> 00:46:05,490
You know, we're running out
of oxygen pretty fast.

1206
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,189
Nice!

1207
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:10,030
Si Eon is a great photographer.

1208
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:11,830
- Right. I'm good at taking pictures.
- Perfect.

1209
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:12,930
In 1, 2.

1210
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:15,600
- Gosh.
- That's so picturesque.

1211
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,100
(The highlight of the bike tour
he's been dreaming of)

1212
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,769
We were there only for a short time.

1213
00:46:19,769 --> 00:46:22,140
But the peak. The top.

1214
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,669
I loved the peak the most.

1215
00:46:23,669 --> 00:46:26,910
We were rushing to take pictures.
That was nice too.

1216
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:29,310
Out of all the trips
I've gone on so far...

1217
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,850
including the one today,
that was the best.

1218
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:35,120
(The three guys started off
the bike tour with a big dream.)

1219
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:38,289
(It was a 390km journey,
following the Route of the Sun.)

1220
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:40,819
(They started off at the altitude
of 3,000m from Cusco.)

1221
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:43,560
(Altitude of 3,300m)

1222
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,589
(Altitude of 3,411m)

1223
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:46,930
(Altitude of 3,463m)

1224
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:50,200
- The views are changing little by little.
- Right. They all look different.

1225
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:52,370
Hey, I just got goosebumps.

1226
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,839
(It's not every day they get
to experience something like this.)

1227
00:46:59,269 --> 00:47:02,879
I really want to go on more trips.

1228
00:47:03,379 --> 00:47:06,109
I really loved our trip.

1229
00:47:06,109 --> 00:47:07,950
So I bought another motorcycle.

1230
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,089
- Really?
- He bought one right away.

1231
00:47:10,089 --> 00:47:12,289
You said you were going to buy one.
Wait. Your mom can't know?

1232
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:13,289
No.

1233
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,120
He's not going to buy it.

1234
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,930
We can go on a bike tour around Korea.

1235
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:21,600
Or the three of us might go abroad
and try this again.

1236
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,399
- When the weather warms up.
- Yes. In spring,

1237
00:47:23,399 --> 00:47:24,700
- we'll drive around Korea.
- In spring?

1238
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:27,240
Then this will be the starting point
for the three of you.

1239
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,039
- Of your bike tour.
- Yes.

1240
00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:32,709
- Let's go.
- Let's hurry up.

1241
00:47:32,709 --> 00:47:33,910
(A merchant shows up like a cameo
in this dream-like situation.)

1242
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:35,010
- Alpaca?
- Yes.

1243
00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:36,649
- How much?
- One hundred twenty.

1244
00:47:36,649 --> 00:47:38,850
- You bought the hat there?
- I want this one.

1245
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:40,550
- We were the only customers.
- Two.

1246
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:41,879
I thought if we bought them,
she would go home.

1247
00:47:41,879 --> 00:47:43,749
You're the favorite celebrity
of the merchants.

1248
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,620
(They head to Puno,
their final destination.)

1249
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:51,189
(They set out on their motorcycles again.)

1250
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:54,060
The sun went down now.

1251
00:47:55,459 --> 00:47:57,830
(A while ago,
the sky was blue and bright.)

1252
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:00,569
The sun went down.

1253
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,539
I bet it looked beautiful
when the sun was setting.

1254
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:04,669
It's even more beautiful.

1255
00:48:04,669 --> 00:48:07,510
(The orange sky, tinted by the sunset,)

1256
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:10,950
(soon...)

1257
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:16,180
(became pitch-black.)

1258
00:48:16,819 --> 00:48:20,890
(The current time is 6:30 p.m.
And the temperature feels like 3°C.)

1259
00:48:21,089 --> 00:48:24,060
(La Raya to Puno)

1260
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:26,999
(La Raya to Puno)

1261
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,700
(They drive through the cold wind
and arrive after 15 hours.)

1262
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,200
It took 15 hours?

1263
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:32,069
I was so exhausted.

1264
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:39,780
(Puno, Peru)

1265
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:43,450
(Welcoming)

1266
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,379
Thank you. Are you guys good?

1267
00:48:45,379 --> 00:48:48,019
(Who are these people?)

1268
00:48:49,149 --> 00:48:52,249
(When they were renting
the motorcycles...)

1269
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:55,919
We have an office in Puno
where you can leave the bikes.

1270
00:48:56,189 --> 00:48:59,629
(They can return the motorcycles in Puno.)

1271
00:49:00,399 --> 00:49:04,569
(They return the motorcycles
at an arranged meeting place.)

1272
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,169
Gosh.

1273
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:08,870
It's cold.

1274
00:49:09,399 --> 00:49:10,410
(Sniffling)

1275
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:11,769
It's really cold here.

1276
00:49:11,769 --> 00:49:14,140
(A jacket borrowed from Si Eon)

1277
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:18,080
(He puts on his alpaca hat.)

1278
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:24,490
(Staggering)

1279
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,359
Wasn't it difficult?

1280
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:28,019
I'm sleepy.

1281
00:49:28,019 --> 00:49:29,019
(Exhausted)

1282
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:30,490
Thank you.

1283
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:33,560
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1284
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,700
(Goodbye, travelers.)

1285
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,870
Let's go to the nearest place.

1286
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,039
- They don't have a reservation.
- I don't care about the quality.

1287
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:46,479
It's a three-star hotel.

1288
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:48,709
- Is it three-star?
- Is it written on it?

1289
00:49:48,709 --> 00:49:50,280
- I'm glad that there's one.
- Here?

1290
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,310
Yes.

1291
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:53,450
- Can we go here?
- Why is the door closed?

1292
00:49:54,019 --> 00:49:55,419
I think they're closed.

1293
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:56,950
Hold on.

1294
00:49:56,950 --> 00:49:58,550
The door is locked.

1295
00:49:58,550 --> 00:49:59,689
(The door is firmly locked.)

1296
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,330
All the locals went to bed.

1297
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:08,129
It's completely empty.

1298
00:50:08,899 --> 00:50:11,129
- It's 10 p.m.
- They closed the shutters.

1299
00:50:11,129 --> 00:50:14,300
(As it's too late,
all lodgings are closed.)

1300
00:50:18,669 --> 00:50:22,680
(Too tired to talk, they just walk.)

1301
00:50:22,879 --> 00:50:26,680
My bones are resonating.

1302
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:28,649
- Wasn't it at a high altitude?
- It's cold.

1303
00:50:28,649 --> 00:50:29,990
That's right.

1304
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:31,950
I have the chills.

1305
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:33,589
(From headache to chills)

1306
00:50:33,959 --> 00:50:35,490
I don't think it disappears.

1307
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,189
It's not a question
of your physical strength.

1308
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:38,990
My throat hurts a lot.

1309
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:41,899
I have a lasting headache,

1310
00:50:41,899 --> 00:50:44,600
and it feels like I have a golf ball
inside my head.

1311
00:50:44,899 --> 00:50:46,030
It was very exhausting.

1312
00:50:47,899 --> 00:50:50,810
After we warmed up
in a hot spring, it got cold again.

1313
00:50:51,569 --> 00:50:53,609
- This looks nice.
- Yes.

1314
00:50:53,609 --> 00:50:55,010
Let's go over there.

1315
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,249
Finally.

1316
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,050
There was exactly one hotel.

1317
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:01,379
Hello.

1318
00:51:01,379 --> 00:51:03,249
- Hello.
- Hello.

1319
00:51:05,319 --> 00:51:08,220
A room for...

1320
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,060
three people.

1321
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:11,629
Okay.

1322
00:51:11,629 --> 00:51:14,430
(Registering their passports)

1323
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:18,530
(Thankfully, they have a room.)

1324
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:20,339
(Staring)

1325
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:21,370
It's 10 p.m.

1326
00:51:21,899 --> 00:51:25,240
Did we leave at 7 a.m.
and arrive at 10 p.m.?

1327
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:28,039
Did we ride the motorcycle for 15 hours?

1328
00:51:30,510 --> 00:51:32,850
(We should get some rest.)

1329
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,850
(They're exhausted from
a long drive and altitude sickness.)

1330
00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:38,519
- They're too tired to talk.
- I can understand.

1331
00:51:38,519 --> 00:51:40,019
They should get some rest.

1332
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,760
(At that moment)

1333
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,789
What's that?

1334
00:51:44,789 --> 00:51:46,760
Is that an oxygen tank?

1335
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,660
There's an oxygen tank
for the altitude sickness.

1336
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,569
(It's really an oxygen tank.)

1337
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,399
- He gave it to us.
- For free?

1338
00:51:53,399 --> 00:51:55,600
- Is that really an oxygen tank?
- Yes.

1339
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:58,539
They give you welcome oxygen
instead of welcome drinks.

1340
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:00,879
- Welcome air.
- Welcome air.

1341
00:52:00,879 --> 00:52:02,680
As the region is at a high altitude,

1342
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:06,149
many of the hotels have oxygen tanks.

1343
00:52:06,749 --> 00:52:08,379
If he's giving them an oxygen tank,

1344
00:52:08,379 --> 00:52:11,919
I can see how serious
altitude sickness can be...

1345
00:52:11,919 --> 00:52:13,160
over there.

1346
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,459
It was the most difficult time.

1347
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,129
Is that for us?

1348
00:52:18,129 --> 00:52:19,160
(It's unbelievable to see
an oxygen tank at a hotel.)

1349
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,300
Is that for us?

1350
00:52:20,959 --> 00:52:22,430
He's giving it to us so that we don't die.

1351
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:24,530
(He's giving it to us
so that we don't die.)

1352
00:52:24,899 --> 00:52:27,470
I heard that you can buy it
at a convenience store.

1353
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:29,439
Because many people get altitude sickness?

1354
00:52:30,169 --> 00:52:31,910
I don't think that I need it.

1355
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:33,939
He's handing you something.

1356
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:35,910
(Taking it off)

1357
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:37,580
As if it were a matter
of life and death...

1358
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,149
Hurry up.

1359
00:52:40,819 --> 00:52:42,120
(Oxygen on)

1360
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,450
- There's nothing.
- It's coming.

1361
00:52:44,919 --> 00:52:46,149
(It's coming.)

1362
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:47,890
(Breathing)

1363
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,490
(We can see that he's determined to live.)

1364
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:53,830
(Rough inhale and exhale)

1365
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:55,800
The oxygen was so delicious.

1366
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,530
(Curious)

1367
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:01,839
Kian84, did you feel better
after doing that?

1368
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:02,999
- I felt better.
- I see.

1369
00:53:05,539 --> 00:53:07,180
There's a way to use it.

1370
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,709
When you have a splitting headache,
and you feel like dying,

1371
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:12,510
you should put it on right away.

1372
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:14,519
(Silence)

1373
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:16,180
What are you talking about?

1374
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:19,120
(What are you talking about?)

1375
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,720
(He doesn't seem fully recovered.)

1376
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,629
Your lips are... Put it on.

1377
00:53:25,089 --> 00:53:27,330
Your lips look out of this world.

1378
00:53:27,629 --> 00:53:29,999
- Oh, no.
- They're chapped.

1379
00:53:29,999 --> 00:53:31,930
You look completely pale.

1380
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:33,240
It was really difficult for me.

1381
00:53:33,370 --> 00:53:34,700
- He should hurry.
- Goodness.

1382
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,609
(An emergency care)

1383
00:53:40,839 --> 00:53:42,339
Wait, in this case...

1384
00:53:42,339 --> 00:53:43,550
(He seems to like it.)

1385
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:47,319
Turn it off, and with this...

1386
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,589
He looks so pitiful.

1387
00:53:50,589 --> 00:53:52,819
- Let's take turns.
- Oh, no.

1388
00:53:52,819 --> 00:53:54,819
(The most amount of oxygen
consumed in South America)

1389
00:53:57,129 --> 00:53:58,390
I want to try it too.

1390
00:53:58,390 --> 00:53:59,589
It's nice when you put it on.

1391
00:53:59,589 --> 00:54:01,930
It lessened my headache a little.

1392
00:54:01,930 --> 00:54:03,399
(Pani Bottle doesn't have altitude
sickness, but his nose bled.)

1393
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:06,839
It's better than nothing.

1394
00:54:07,269 --> 00:54:08,439
What do you think, Pani Bottle?

1395
00:54:10,339 --> 00:54:11,640
It cleared my head.

1396
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,069
- Right?
- It's nice.

1397
00:54:14,439 --> 00:54:15,640
It was sweet.

1398
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,950
(It was sweet.)

1399
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:19,879
The air was sweet.

1400
00:54:20,019 --> 00:54:22,979
I'd like for us...

1401
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:26,050
to get to La Paz tomorrow.

1402
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:28,560
Our final destination is Uyuni Salt Flats.

1403
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:32,330
It's the last city before getting there,

1404
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:34,430
so we decided to go through it.

1405
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:37,700
How shall we get to La Paz?

1406
00:54:38,399 --> 00:54:40,370
- We should take a bus.
- A bus?

1407
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:44,039
There should be a bus from here, right?

1408
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:45,370
We have to look it up.

1409
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:47,580
- It's from a city to another city.
- Yes.

1410
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,410
We can take 15-7 Bus.

1411
00:54:49,979 --> 00:54:51,479
(What is he saying?)

1412
00:54:51,479 --> 00:54:52,479
That sounds good.

1413
00:54:52,479 --> 00:54:54,019
- Isn't that the bus?
- Yes.

1414
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:55,680
- That's the bus.
- It's on that street.

1415
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,689
In that case...

1416
00:54:57,689 --> 00:54:59,089
(Never mind.)

1417
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:01,959
- We need to know the bus time.
- Right.

1418
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:03,729
There should be many buses.

1419
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:06,160
You can't just presume it.

1420
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,300
There should be.

1421
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,430
- There should be?
- Perhaps.

1422
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,830
Maybe.

1423
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:14,600
Shall we stand outside and wait?

1424
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:16,810
- Why?
- At the bus stop.

1425
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:21,180
There's one at 5:45 a.m.

1426
00:55:21,879 --> 00:55:23,810
- There's a bus?
- Yes, at five in the morning.

1427
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:25,850
It arrives at 2 p.m.

1428
00:55:26,249 --> 00:55:28,519
Wait a minute.

1429
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:31,220
It leaves at 5:45 a.m.

1430
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:32,390
It takes seven hours.

1431
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:33,990
(Confident)

1432
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:35,189
- Seriously?
- Gosh.

1433
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,189
How can we ride a bus for seven hours?

1434
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,959
Seven hours isn't a long time
in South America.

1435
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:43,530
Some buses take 12 to 21 hours.

1436
00:55:43,669 --> 00:55:45,899
Since it's a night bus,
instead of spending a night at a hotel,

1437
00:55:45,899 --> 00:55:48,870
you get on the bus at night
and arrive early in the morning.

1438
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:51,709
We travel a lot by bus in South America.

1439
00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:53,939
What was your longest bus ride?

1440
00:55:53,939 --> 00:55:57,810
It was from Buenos Aires to Iguazu Falls.

1441
00:55:58,249 --> 00:56:00,819
My longest bus ride was 30 hours
without any transfer.

1442
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:04,149
Since the country is big, you take
1 to 2 days to travel.

1443
00:56:04,149 --> 00:56:05,289
It was bearable.

1444
00:56:05,289 --> 00:56:08,459
Let's say that we take the bus
for seven hours.

1445
00:56:08,789 --> 00:56:10,160
Can we use the restroom?

1446
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,160
There's a restroom inside the bus.

1447
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,459
In my opinion...

1448
00:56:13,459 --> 00:56:15,359
- There's a restroom inside the bus?
- Usually.

1449
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,269
- In my opinion...
- Ninety percent of them do.

1450
00:56:17,269 --> 00:56:18,769
There are resting areas from time to time.

1451
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:20,899
The bus will stop, won't it?

1452
00:56:20,899 --> 00:56:22,300
Let's rent a car.

1453
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,569
We can't return it because
we're going to a different country.

1454
00:56:24,569 --> 00:56:27,310
(We can't return it because
we're going to a different country.)

1455
00:56:27,539 --> 00:56:30,450
Is La Paz in a different country?

1456
00:56:30,709 --> 00:56:32,709
It's in Bolivia.

1457
00:56:33,149 --> 00:56:35,019
His altitude sickness must be intense.

1458
00:56:35,649 --> 00:56:38,019
Is La Paz in Bolivia?

1459
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,660
- He said,
- What?

1460
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,260
"Is La Paz in Bolivia?"

1461
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,459
I don't even know where I'm now anymore.

1462
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:46,830
- I don't know right now.
- We're crossing a border.

1463
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:49,459
It's in a foreign country.

1464
00:56:49,729 --> 00:56:52,030
That's why it takes seven hours.

1465
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:55,439
Customs at the border takes a long time.

1466
00:56:55,439 --> 00:56:56,910
- Really?
- How about a car rental?

1467
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,839
"Car rental?"

1468
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:00,180
(How will we return it?)

1469
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:01,740
(Sighing)

1470
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:02,740
Goodness.

1471
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:05,310
Let's have the dealer sit
in the passenger seat.

1472
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:06,749
- Dealer?
- The company owner.

1473
00:57:06,749 --> 00:57:08,080
- How about a car on consignment?
- Now...

1474
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,450
A car on consignment?

1475
00:57:10,789 --> 00:57:13,050
We can abandon the car.

1476
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,289
Abandon the car?

1477
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:15,789
(It's beyond his imagination.)

1478
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:18,530
(Altitude sickness can be serious.)

1479
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:20,859
They definitely have altitude sickness.

1480
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,760
- That's true.
- Two.

1481
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,030
(Will we be able to arrive in La Paz
tomorrow?)

1482
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,930
- Now...
- I can ask the hotel.

1483
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:27,339
Okay.

1484
00:57:27,339 --> 00:57:28,439
Excuse me.

1485
00:57:28,439 --> 00:57:30,939
If I want to go to La Paz from here...

1486
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:33,539
He puts it into action.

1487
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:34,680
(He asks the front desk.)

1488
00:57:34,839 --> 00:57:37,109
What's the name of the station?

1489
00:57:37,109 --> 00:57:39,709
(The youngest does the research
for sick Kian84 and Si Eon.)

1490
00:57:39,950 --> 00:57:42,220
We couldn't have done anything with Pani.

1491
00:57:42,379 --> 00:57:43,890
I'll explain.

1492
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:47,789
There's a big terminal.
We'll walk over there.

1493
00:57:48,189 --> 00:57:51,330
We'll take the earliest bus to get there.

1494
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:53,629
If there's no bus,

1495
00:57:53,629 --> 00:57:56,300
we'll find a night bus for tomorrow.

1496
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:58,499
Listen. We have to cross the border.

1497
00:57:58,669 --> 00:58:00,169
We have to do our check-in.

1498
00:58:00,169 --> 00:58:02,039
The border is open 24 hours.

1499
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,039
That was before the pandemic.

1500
00:58:04,039 --> 00:58:06,370
Now, the immigration office closes early.

1501
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:09,609
There are buses in the morning...

1502
00:58:09,609 --> 00:58:11,310
according to the immigration office hours.

1503
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:14,220
You should take a morning bus...

1504
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,180
to get to the immigration office.

1505
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,450
Then we'll get up in the morning.

1506
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:20,459
Okay.

1507
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:22,120
Many things changed after the pandemic,

1508
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,689
so you have to research things in advance.

1509
00:58:23,689 --> 00:58:25,160
- The old information isn't valid.
- The procedures...

1510
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,160
- Many things changed.
- That's right.

1511
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,729
If you go there at night,

1512
00:58:28,729 --> 00:58:30,229
- it could be hard to cross the border.
- Right.

1513
00:58:30,729 --> 00:58:33,470
Since the production crew aren't with you,

1514
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:36,569
I heard that they didn't explain
anything to you.

1515
00:58:36,569 --> 00:58:38,910
If you have a problem
crossing the border...

1516
00:58:38,910 --> 00:58:40,439
- The problem gets worse.
- Right.

1517
00:58:40,439 --> 00:58:42,180
You might be MIA internationally.

1518
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,209
- That's so scary.
- The production crew told us...

1519
00:58:43,209 --> 00:58:46,010
if it was unbearable for them.

1520
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:47,220
It's really scary.

1521
00:58:47,379 --> 00:58:49,519
You have to leave early in the morning...

1522
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:51,350
- and look for the bus.
- Yes.

1523
00:58:52,249 --> 00:58:54,060
(A bowl of ramyeon before going to bed)

1524
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,160
(Slurping)

1525
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,289
That looks delicious.

1526
00:58:59,959 --> 00:59:01,760
How can it be so tasty?

1527
00:59:02,399 --> 00:59:04,399
- That's the best in foreign countries.
- It's the best.

1528
00:59:04,399 --> 00:59:05,470
It's the best.

1529
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:06,830
(A common Korean traveler abroad)

1530
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,669
This is great. Pani Bottle, have some.

1531
00:59:10,169 --> 00:59:11,669
I have no appetite.

1532
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:12,970
Then what do you have?

1533
00:59:13,609 --> 00:59:15,010
(Laughing)

1534
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:18,450
(While the others were concentrating
on the oxygen tank,)

1535
00:59:19,350 --> 00:59:20,419
(he ate some bread.)

1536
00:59:20,419 --> 00:59:22,120
He had some bread.

1537
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:25,490
(This is so good.)

1538
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:26,519
(Eating)

1539
00:59:27,819 --> 00:59:28,819
(Eating more)

1540
00:59:30,789 --> 00:59:32,060
He's eating a lot.

1541
00:59:32,689 --> 00:59:34,129
It's not that he has no appetite.

1542
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:35,430
(Eating)

1543
00:59:36,229 --> 00:59:37,399
He's eating so much.

1544
00:59:39,499 --> 00:59:41,140
(Coughing)

1545
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:43,399
(Even if it's dry, he keeps eating it.)

1546
00:59:44,209 --> 00:59:46,539
(The youngest had eaten a lot
without realizing it.)

1547
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,539
I set the alarm to 5 a.m.

1548
00:59:48,539 --> 00:59:49,640
Okay.

1549
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:53,010
(He falls asleep...)

1550
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:55,720
(right away.)

1551
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:58,990
(Snoring)

1552
00:59:58,990 --> 01:00:00,289
I snore?

1553
01:00:01,019 --> 01:00:02,819
He found out something
that he didn't know.

1554
01:00:04,330 --> 01:00:06,629
(The city man is full.)

1555
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:08,729
- He's putting on a facial mask?
- For his beautiful skin.

1556
01:00:08,729 --> 01:00:10,060
I knew it.

1557
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,530
(Squeezing)

1558
01:00:13,939 --> 01:00:16,800
(He uses it to its last drop.)

1559
01:00:17,769 --> 01:00:21,180
(After putting on the mask,
he makes a video call.)

1560
01:00:22,609 --> 01:00:24,749
(Si Eon's wife, Actress Seo Ji Seung)

1561
01:00:25,050 --> 01:00:26,280
It's 8:30 p.m. right now.

1562
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,819
We woke up today at 5 a.m.

1563
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:32,289
Gosh, your eyes look red.

1564
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:33,589
Yes.

1565
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,089
Isn't it fascinating...

1566
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:37,530
- What?
- that we're calling each other...

1567
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:38,859
when you're on the other side of Earth?

1568
01:00:38,859 --> 01:00:40,430
We're living in a world
of advanced technology.

1569
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:42,800
Your face looks red.

1570
01:00:43,999 --> 01:00:45,229
(Pouting)

1571
01:00:45,229 --> 01:00:46,430
My gosh.

1572
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:47,769
What am I doing?

1573
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:48,939
(Showing off his lips
that are full of love)

1574
01:00:48,939 --> 01:00:50,069
What am I doing?

1575
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:53,569
Do you want to go to Patagonia?

1576
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:55,039
Yes.

1577
01:00:56,410 --> 01:00:58,609
Look it up on the Internet.
I'm hanging up.

1578
01:00:58,609 --> 01:00:59,910
(A real man)

1579
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:02,819
- Okay, goodnight.
- Bye.

1580
01:01:04,019 --> 01:01:05,249
That's sweet.

1581
01:01:07,089 --> 01:01:11,459
(One person who's listening
to Si Eon's sweet talk)

1582
01:01:12,189 --> 01:01:13,189
(Exclaiming)

1583
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:18,899
(It's bitter like alcohol.)

1584
01:01:19,569 --> 01:01:22,499
(He looks at his contact list,)

1585
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:29,780
(but there's no one to call.)

1586
01:01:29,910 --> 01:01:32,379
Do you know how many hours
we have left before 5 a.m.?

1587
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:34,550
- How many?
- Five hours.

1588
01:01:36,019 --> 01:01:40,519
(Gosh, I should go to sleep.)

1589
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:42,260
I'll turn off the lights.

1590
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:43,830
(Leaving the bitterness behind,
he gets ready to sleep.)

1591
01:01:44,189 --> 01:01:45,990
My head hurts.

1592
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:48,959
My head hurts.

1593
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:52,430
(He complains about his headache
until he goes to sleep.)

1594
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,939
My head hurts.

1595
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:57,910
That's when I had the worst headache.

1596
01:01:57,910 --> 01:01:59,640
Don't you feel better with Tylenol?

1597
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:01,680
It worked for the first few days,

1598
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,810
- There's a limit.
- but it didn't work after that.

1599
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:04,450
- You didn't take medicine?
- You must build tolerance.

1600
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:07,010
(While bearing the headache,)

1601
01:02:07,819 --> 01:02:10,390
(they barely fall asleep.)

1602
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:13,859
(It's one in the morning
when everyone is asleep.)

1603
01:02:15,319 --> 01:02:16,519
He's not sleeping?

1604
01:02:17,019 --> 01:02:18,229
(Kian84 isn't sleeping.)

1605
01:02:18,229 --> 01:02:20,260
They have to leave the next morning.

1606
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,830
I couldn't fall asleep because I was
suffering from altitude sickness.

1607
01:02:24,269 --> 01:02:25,470
I was physically tired.

1608
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,870
- But you couldn't fall asleep?
- No.

1609
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:29,700
- That's painful.
- I understand.

1610
01:02:30,810 --> 01:02:33,240
It was a painful situation.

1611
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,240
(A difficult night for Kian84)

1612
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:38,810
(After tossing and turning
for a long time,)

1613
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:46,850
(he finally falls asleep.)

1614
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,060
(Thirty minutes after Kian84 falls asleep)

1615
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,499
(The alarm goes off.)

1616
01:03:00,499 --> 01:03:03,140
- As soon as he fell asleep...
- I feel tired for him.

1617
01:03:05,569 --> 01:03:07,539
(Getting up)

1618
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:12,109
(Pani Bottle gets ready
after a goodnight sleep.)

1619
01:03:14,350 --> 01:03:15,580
He's diligent.

1620
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,789
Guys, you should get ready soon.

1621
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:22,419
My head hurts.

1622
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:24,830
My head hurts.

1623
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:26,660
(His head hurts as soon as he gets up.)

1624
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,899
(He gets emergency treatment
by taking medicine.)

1625
01:03:29,899 --> 01:03:31,530
- Is he taking medicine right away?
- Tylenol.

1626
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:35,640
(With strength from the medicine)

1627
01:03:35,939 --> 01:03:38,010
(Brushing his teeth)

1628
01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:40,740
(He gets ready quickly to go out.)

1629
01:03:40,979 --> 01:03:42,879
- Kian84, get up.
- Yes?

1630
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:46,680
(Half asleep)

1631
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:49,319
I'm so tired.

1632
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,649
- My ankles hurt so much.
- It must be so hard.

1633
01:03:51,649 --> 01:03:53,519
(He's more tired from altitude sickness
and lack of sleep.)

1634
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:55,689
I'm so tired.

1635
01:03:56,260 --> 01:03:58,729
(It's hard to wake up.)

1636
01:03:58,959 --> 01:04:01,160
- I'll wash up.
- Okay.

1637
01:04:04,229 --> 01:04:06,169
Why did my lips turn purple?

1638
01:04:07,069 --> 01:04:09,669
(Sixth day of their trip, Puno, Peru)

1639
01:04:10,569 --> 01:04:11,669
Kian TV.

1640
01:04:12,339 --> 01:04:14,140
What's today's date?

1641
01:04:15,879 --> 01:04:17,580
I forgot today's date.

1642
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:18,810
(He's out of it
because of altitude sickness.)

1643
01:04:18,979 --> 01:04:20,180
We're in...

1644
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:23,680
Pu...

1645
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,450
- Poop?
- Pu...

1646
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:27,720
- Puno.
- I forgot the name of this place.

1647
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:29,160
Puno.

1648
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:30,660
He couldn't remember Puno.

1649
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,459
I thought
that altitude sickness would disappear,

1650
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:35,560
but the symptoms came back.

1651
01:04:36,459 --> 01:04:38,800
(He puts on the oxygen mask
to treat himself.)

1652
01:04:40,939 --> 01:04:42,970
Let's go going.

1653
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:44,539
(They head to the bus terminal
after charging themselves with oxygen.)

1654
01:04:44,769 --> 01:04:45,810
(Current Time: 6:20 a.m.)

1655
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:48,379
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1656
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:50,410
Where's the entrance?

1657
01:04:51,209 --> 01:04:52,280
Is this it?

1658
01:04:52,879 --> 01:04:54,379
We don't know the bus time.

1659
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,550
Where is it open?

1660
01:04:57,550 --> 01:04:59,519
(They have to check the bus time
on the same day.)

1661
01:05:00,289 --> 01:05:04,060
We're going into the bus terminal.

1662
01:05:05,089 --> 01:05:06,459
Puno Bus Terminal.

1663
01:05:08,100 --> 01:05:09,260
Wow.

1664
01:05:11,999 --> 01:05:13,769
In Korea, it's separated by region.

1665
01:05:13,769 --> 01:05:15,200
Here, it's separated by company.

1666
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:16,769
It looks like a small airport.

1667
01:05:16,769 --> 01:05:17,810
Right.

1668
01:05:18,169 --> 01:05:19,539
(Among so many buses,
will there be one for them?)

1669
01:05:19,539 --> 01:05:20,979
There are so many companies.

1670
01:05:22,439 --> 01:05:24,249
(Let's see.)

1671
01:05:25,350 --> 01:05:26,780
There's one at 7 a.m.

1672
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:27,919
(They find the bus time.)

1673
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,280
Kian84.

1674
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,720
(Flapping)

1675
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,050
It's over here.

1676
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:34,220
There it is.

1677
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:36,720
Hello.

1678
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:38,990
If I want to go to La Paz from here...

1679
01:05:39,089 --> 01:05:41,229
Please hand me your passport.

1680
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:43,499
- Give me your passport.
- They're rewarded for getting up early.

1681
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,669
Here are tickets for three people.

1682
01:05:45,669 --> 01:05:47,030
Okay. Thank you.

1683
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:48,539
- Did you tell her?
- Gate Six.

1684
01:05:48,539 --> 01:05:50,740
Show your boarding tickets.

1685
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:52,810
- Okay.
- Next gate.

1686
01:05:54,010 --> 01:05:55,510
Gate Six.

1687
01:05:56,109 --> 01:05:58,180
Gate. Here's Gate Six.

1688
01:05:58,609 --> 01:06:00,919
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1689
01:06:00,919 --> 01:06:04,120
(There's a feeling
that the trip will go smoothly.)

1690
01:06:04,589 --> 01:06:06,919
- Copacabana?
- No.

1691
01:06:06,919 --> 01:06:08,819
He says that this isn't our bus.

1692
01:06:08,819 --> 01:06:10,220
- What?
- This isn't our bus.

1693
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:11,689
- Copacabana?
- Isn't this it?

1694
01:06:11,689 --> 01:06:13,430
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

1695
01:06:13,859 --> 01:06:17,100
(He hurries to understand the situation.)

1696
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:20,030
- This isn't it.
- What? Isn't this it?

1697
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:21,370
- Oh, no.
- Kian84, it's the wrong bus.

1698
01:06:21,370 --> 01:06:22,669
- Who should we ask?
- Where is it?

1699
01:06:22,669 --> 01:06:24,039
(This isn't the right bus.)

1700
01:06:24,269 --> 01:06:26,640
There isn't a bus right away
if we miss this bus.

1701
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:28,879
We might have to wait the next day.

1702
01:06:28,879 --> 01:06:30,039
There's no bus for Titicaca.

1703
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:33,410
(They check with a bus driver
in front of them.)

1704
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:34,979
(You can go over there.)

1705
01:06:34,979 --> 01:06:36,350
What's going on?

1706
01:06:37,019 --> 01:06:38,220
What are we supposed to do?

1707
01:06:38,789 --> 01:06:39,819
What's going on?

1708
01:06:39,819 --> 01:06:42,319
He said that this isn't the bus.

1709
01:06:42,789 --> 01:06:44,060
It's over there.

1710
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:45,990
- What's this?
- What's going on?

1711
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:49,729
Excuse me. Did you buy a ticket
to Titicaca at the ticket booth?

1712
01:06:49,729 --> 01:06:52,129
- No.
- Where did you buy the ticket?

1713
01:06:52,129 --> 01:06:54,069
(There's no bus that corresponds
to their tickets.)

1714
01:06:54,069 --> 01:06:55,499
- Okay.
- This isn't it?

1715
01:06:55,569 --> 01:06:58,240
- What's going on?
- I'm worried for them.

1716
01:06:58,669 --> 01:06:59,669
(They have to find their bus
among so many buses.)

1717
01:06:59,669 --> 01:07:01,410
There are so many bus companies.

1718
01:07:02,439 --> 01:07:03,810
We have seven minutes left.

1719
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:05,149
(Seven minutes before their bus leaves)

1720
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:08,649
(They might...)

1721
01:07:09,050 --> 01:07:10,050
Oh, no.

1722
01:07:11,089 --> 01:07:12,419
Don't end it.

1723
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:14,160
I'm worried for them.

1724
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,960
(The South America Brothers might miss
their bus.)

1725
01:07:26,429 --> 01:07:28,460
We should go. We don't have much time.

1726
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:29,599
Let's go.

1727
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:32,130
Our bus isn't here.

1728
01:07:33,269 --> 01:07:34,869
- They're in a rush.
- Hurry.

1729
01:07:34,869 --> 01:07:36,340
(They hurry up.)

1730
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:40,340
- Titicaca.
- It's here.

1731
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,079
- Here?
- Yes.

1732
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:43,510
We have to wait?

1733
01:07:43,510 --> 01:07:44,750
She's telling us to wait.

1734
01:07:44,849 --> 01:07:47,320
That startled me.

1735
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,519
That's a relief.

1736
01:07:48,820 --> 01:07:51,719
Do we get on the bus from here at 7 a.m.?

1737
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:53,320
Some buses wait,

1738
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,760
and some arrive on time.

1739
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:57,329
We're supposed to wait for the bus.

1740
01:07:57,329 --> 01:07:58,760
- Really?
- We don't know when it will come.

1741
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,230
Is it up to the bus driver?

1742
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:01,699
- Yes.
- Peruvian bus drivers?

1743
01:08:01,699 --> 01:08:03,630
- What's interesting is that...
- Is that it?

1744
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:05,469
That must be it.

1745
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:07,340
- Where is it?
- "Lake Titicaca."

1746
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:08,340
- I was scared.
- "Lake Titicaca."

1747
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:09,500
- It says that.
- Yes.

1748
01:08:10,769 --> 01:08:16,210
(They went through a lot
even before getting on the bus.)

1749
01:08:16,579 --> 01:08:18,250
It could be better to load
our bags onto it later.

1750
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:20,349
Are you going to store your bags
under the bust?

1751
01:08:20,349 --> 01:08:21,949
- Yes. We should.
- We should.

1752
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:24,090
I'll carry my bag with me.

1753
01:08:24,090 --> 01:08:25,289
(As Kian84 has a much smaller bag,
he doesn't have to store it.)

1754
01:08:25,289 --> 01:08:26,690
It's only three hours anyway.

1755
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:28,119
- What? Three hours?
- It won't take long.

1756
01:08:28,119 --> 01:08:29,420
You said it was seven hours.

1757
01:08:29,789 --> 01:08:31,159
- That's to La Paz.
- We have to transfer.

1758
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:34,230
We're going to Copacabana
before La Paz now.

1759
01:08:34,230 --> 01:08:36,869
- Do we transfer there, then?
- Yes. And another three hours.

1760
01:08:36,869 --> 01:08:38,930
After we transfer,

1761
01:08:38,930 --> 01:08:40,340
- Yes. And to La Paz.
- how many hours do we travel?

1762
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:41,739
- Oh, my.
- Three or four hours.

1763
01:08:41,739 --> 01:08:42,840
- Three to four hours?
- Yes.

1764
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:44,840
So it's about 7 to 8 hours in total.

1765
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:46,170
Yes. I think so.

1766
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:50,510
We take the first bus
and go through immigration...

1767
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:52,180
- Copacabana.
- at the border.

1768
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:53,819
Then we go to Copat...

1769
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:56,079
- Copacabana.
- Copacabana.

1770
01:08:56,079 --> 01:08:58,449
We go to Copacabana and take another bus.

1771
01:08:58,449 --> 01:09:02,060
You might not get to buy tickets to La Paz
in Copacabana.

1772
01:09:02,659 --> 01:09:05,090
- We'll have to see.
- You're just going now.

1773
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:06,500
If there are no tickets,
you stay the night there?

1774
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:07,960
I guess so if we don't get our tickets.

1775
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:09,600
Seriously.

1776
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,630
(Suddenly, a foreigner talks to them.)

1777
01:09:10,630 --> 01:09:11,869
- A photo?
- Excuse me?

1778
01:09:11,869 --> 01:09:13,600
- Okay.
- He's so handsome.

1779
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:14,739
Is he a subscriber?

1780
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:17,340
(He's been watching them talk.)

1781
01:09:17,640 --> 01:09:18,670
(Peeking)

1782
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:21,640
- Did he recognize him?
- That's interesting.

1783
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:24,710
(He looked at them again.)

1784
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:26,310
Where are you from?

1785
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,220
- Israel.
- Israel?

1786
01:09:28,220 --> 01:09:29,890
- Yes.
- Israel.

1787
01:09:29,890 --> 01:09:31,050
Israel where?

1788
01:09:31,050 --> 01:09:32,090
- Shalom.
- Israel.

1789
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:33,359
- Hello.
- Shalom.

1790
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:36,590
- He can even speak Hebrew.
- I only knows how to say hi.

1791
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:37,590
- Shalom.
- I was jealous.

1792
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,590
I just said hello.

1793
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:40,529
How many days have you been traveling?

1794
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,060
How many days has it been?

1795
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:44,029
It's been about ten days.

1796
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:45,600
Ten days?

1797
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,800
- That's his altitude sickness talking.
- Because it took two days to get here...

1798
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,640
So, Iquitos and...

1799
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:51,909
What does he do?

1800
01:09:51,909 --> 01:09:54,579
Iquitos and Cusco.

1801
01:09:55,439 --> 01:09:56,550
And...

1802
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:57,779
(Leaving)

1803
01:09:57,779 --> 01:09:59,680
- He didn't react when I talked.
- Where is he going? I'm talking.

1804
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,079
He asked him a question and left.

1805
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:04,149
So I guess you're traveling...

1806
01:10:04,149 --> 01:10:06,789
- after fulfilling your military service.
- Yes.

1807
01:10:06,789 --> 01:10:09,489
- You're traveling around the world.
- Yes, I am.

1808
01:10:09,489 --> 01:10:11,890
Israelites usually...

1809
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:12,960
What is it called?

1810
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,329
Many Israelites travel abroad
with the money they've saved...

1811
01:10:14,329 --> 01:10:15,899
when they're discharged.

1812
01:10:15,899 --> 01:10:18,699
- Really?
- So there are many travelers from Israel.

1813
01:10:18,699 --> 01:10:20,000
He was discharged from the military.

1814
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,869
- Are you a soldier in Israel?
- Yes.

1815
01:10:22,869 --> 01:10:24,439
- I was a Korean soldier.
- A Korean soldier.

1816
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:26,539
(The two soldiers say hello.)

1817
01:10:26,539 --> 01:10:29,210
- Korean police.
- Korean police.

1818
01:10:30,279 --> 01:10:32,609
He was a conscripted police officer
a long time ago.

1819
01:10:33,079 --> 01:10:34,479
- Two years.
- It's been so long.

1820
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:35,779
I was a police officer for two years.

1821
01:10:36,119 --> 01:10:38,489
Actually, he's an actor in Korea.

1822
01:10:38,489 --> 01:10:41,159
And he's a webcomic artist.

1823
01:10:41,489 --> 01:10:43,590
- And I'm a YouTuber.
- Okay.

1824
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,329
- Are you a YouTuber?
- Yes.

1825
01:10:45,329 --> 01:10:46,699
A YouTuber.

1826
01:10:46,699 --> 01:10:49,060
- He's a famous YouTuber.
- The good-looking guy...

1827
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:50,470
seems quite interested in you.

1828
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:52,770
He wasn't that interested
when we were talking.

1829
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:54,069
He only reacted when Pani Bottle spoke.

1830
01:10:54,069 --> 01:10:55,569
It's because he didn't understand you.

1831
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:58,069
- So many travelers from Israel.
- Everyone,

1832
01:10:58,069 --> 01:11:00,539
this is why you should learn English.

1833
01:11:01,109 --> 01:11:02,539
Knowledge is power.

1834
01:11:02,539 --> 01:11:06,079
He can communicate with people
from other countries in English.

1835
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:07,319
(He's jealous
Pani Bottle can communicate in English.)

1836
01:11:07,319 --> 01:11:09,819
I tried talking to him,
but he didn't even respond.

1837
01:11:10,189 --> 01:11:11,920
He knew I didn't speak English that much.

1838
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,689
You need more...

1839
01:11:13,689 --> 01:11:16,220
Pani Bottle got closer...

1840
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:20,000
to the handsome Israeli guy than to us.

1841
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,100
At leat, I'm holding a camera,

1842
01:11:22,829 --> 01:11:24,270
so I can talk to it.

1843
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,140
This camera feels more precious than ever.

1844
01:11:28,939 --> 01:11:30,909
- I'm only talking to my camera.
- Three days.

1845
01:11:30,909 --> 01:11:32,369
- Look at him.
- Three days.

1846
01:11:32,369 --> 01:11:34,380
That's so sad.

1847
01:11:34,539 --> 01:11:37,380
I couldn't talk at all,
and neither did Si Eon.

1848
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:38,779
I did. I said "army."

1849
01:11:38,779 --> 01:11:41,819
Well, it makes me feel better.

1850
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:44,390
Tikitaka.

1851
01:11:45,649 --> 01:11:48,460
- We're going to tikicaca.
- Titicaca.

1852
01:11:49,489 --> 01:11:51,359
We're going to Bolivia now, right?

1853
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:53,060
Once we get on the bus,

1854
01:11:53,060 --> 01:11:55,729
- we'll be...
- Out.

1855
01:11:55,729 --> 01:11:56,869
out of Peru.

1856
01:11:57,569 --> 01:12:00,739
(They're leaving Peru now.)

1857
01:12:00,739 --> 01:12:02,539
- Are you leaving now?
- Go.

1858
01:12:02,539 --> 01:12:07,710
(They get on the bus to Bolivia!)

1859
01:12:09,010 --> 01:12:11,310
I'll learn English
when I go back to Korea.

1860
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,350
- This...
- Yes.

1861
01:12:13,550 --> 01:12:16,119
- You can't speak English anymore.
- Okay.

1862
01:12:16,119 --> 01:12:18,420
- It was too cool.
- I'll speak Konglish.

1863
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:20,390
Pani Bottle is also good at English,

1864
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:23,430
but Si Eon is not even good at Korean.

1865
01:12:24,060 --> 01:12:25,960
Do you have something to put on your face?
Wet wipes?

1866
01:12:26,729 --> 01:12:27,829
I mean, sunblock.

1867
01:12:28,229 --> 01:12:30,300
See? Even his Korean got weird.

1868
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:31,930
I was suffering from altitude sickness.

1869
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:33,800
- What is this?
- Since we're going to Bolivia,

1870
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,770
we should fill out a form.

1871
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:37,369
This is for the immigration.

1872
01:12:37,369 --> 01:12:38,909
The immigration form.

1873
01:12:38,909 --> 01:12:40,739
You have to fill that out
just like when you take a flight.

1874
01:12:40,739 --> 01:12:42,939
- It makes you nervous.
- It's all Spanish.

1875
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:44,609
It's Spanish.

1876
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:47,880
(While they're looking at the form,
Pani Bottle's Israeli friend comes.)

1877
01:12:49,319 --> 01:12:51,489
He's sitting next to me.
I was going to sleep.

1878
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:53,859
Pani Bottle's Israeli friend is here.

1879
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:55,659
Israeli friend.

1880
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:58,060
Why am I so jealous?

1881
01:12:58,060 --> 01:12:59,560
They sat together in the end.

1882
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:03,329
- They're best friends.
- I'm sleepy. I'm going to sleep.

1883
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:06,529
We're on the bus...

1884
01:13:06,529 --> 01:13:09,640
to Lake Titicaca, Bolivia.

1885
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,069
They gave us the form,

1886
01:13:12,470 --> 01:13:13,909
but not a pen.

1887
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:16,479
- You should have a pen.
- Do you have one?

1888
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:18,510
Traveling doesn't get you things.

1889
01:13:18,510 --> 01:13:20,750
- Did you bring one, then?
- No, I didn't.

1890
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:23,649
You're wearing my shirt and jacket.

1891
01:13:23,649 --> 01:13:25,220
- You even used my blanket.
- Si Eon.

1892
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:27,760
When you go on a trip,
you don't lend things to your friend.

1893
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,260
We get used to the surroundings.

1894
01:13:29,260 --> 01:13:31,159
You used my blanket and my padded jacket.

1895
01:13:31,159 --> 01:13:32,689
You're now wearing my shirt.

1896
01:13:33,399 --> 01:13:34,960
Behind us they're having
a beautiful conversation.

1897
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,399
You're not responding.

1898
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:38,670
- And we're fighting in Korean.
- They're talking...

1899
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:40,939
in the same language,
but they don't understand each other.

1900
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:45,609
I learned French in school.

1901
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:48,479
I didn't learn any foreign language.

1902
01:13:48,479 --> 01:13:49,510
You were not required to?

1903
01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:52,050
They told us to speak Korean better.

1904
01:13:52,050 --> 01:13:53,850
- Korean?
- "Be a good Korean speaker."

1905
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:54,949
- Our language?
- Yes.

1906
01:13:54,949 --> 01:13:57,750
You speak Korean.

1907
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:00,560
Why do you babble these days?

1908
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:03,560
I'm having a hard time
because of altitude sickness.

1909
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:06,329
You're getting bad
at the only language you can speak.

1910
01:14:06,329 --> 01:14:08,800
It's not easy.
I even called sunblock wet wipes.

1911
01:14:09,329 --> 01:14:11,600
You'll understand when it happens to you.

1912
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:13,399
Altitude sickness is interesting.

1913
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,069
I want to block the sun.

1914
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:16,699
- Do you want to switch?
- No.

1915
01:14:16,699 --> 01:14:18,069
- Gosh.
- I'll sit there.

1916
01:14:19,369 --> 01:14:20,710
(They often bicker,
but Kian84 switches seats for Si Eon.)

1917
01:14:20,710 --> 01:14:21,779
- I'm sorry.
- You're like a kid.

1918
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:23,949
Oh, dear.

1919
01:14:25,909 --> 01:14:27,180
He switches seats with him.

1920
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:29,420
They squabble
but take good care of each other.

1921
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:31,550
- I know.
- They're still having fun behind them.

1922
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:32,689
They look like a couple.

1923
01:14:32,689 --> 01:14:34,489
- Goodness.
- Are they on a date?

1924
01:14:36,619 --> 01:14:38,890
They talked the whole time.

1925
01:14:38,890 --> 01:14:40,399
English makes me dizzy now.

1926
01:14:40,930 --> 01:14:42,060
(Kian84 blamed English to sleep.)

1927
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:44,500
I'm going to your dream.

1928
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,529
(He tries taking a nap.)

1929
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:50,770
(We hope you don't hear English
in your dream.)

1930
01:14:51,569 --> 01:14:53,439
(Behind Si Eon and Kian84
they're in their own world.)

1931
01:14:53,439 --> 01:14:54,539
They're still talking.

1932
01:14:54,539 --> 01:14:56,409
- Are they still talking?
- Did we talk that much?

1933
01:14:58,279 --> 01:15:00,819
(Extrovert Pani Bottle fall asleep
after chitchatting.)

1934
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:04,520
(The bus is headed
to the border in peace.)

1935
01:15:05,489 --> 01:15:08,890
(They go past villages in Peru.)

1936
01:15:10,329 --> 01:15:12,989
(Then they get to the riverside.)

1937
01:15:15,060 --> 01:15:17,670
(Stiff)

1938
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:21,699
(The two suddenly wake up.)

1939
01:15:21,699 --> 01:15:22,939
(Impressed)

1940
01:15:23,909 --> 01:15:25,140
What is that?

1941
01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:27,210
- Is that the ocean?
- It's a lake.

1942
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,310
I have to record this.

1943
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:30,479
(I have to get this with my camera.)

1944
01:15:31,149 --> 01:15:32,710
Everyone,

1945
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:34,380
- this is Lake Titicaca.
- Isn't that an ocean?

1946
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:36,119
Is that a lake?

1947
01:15:36,579 --> 01:15:38,420
I don't know how big this is,

1948
01:15:38,420 --> 01:15:41,619
but it looks like the sea.

1949
01:15:41,619 --> 01:15:42,859
(The lake looks like an ocean.)

1950
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,789
I can't see the horizon
at the end of the land.

1951
01:15:44,789 --> 01:15:46,159
(At the end of the water)

1952
01:15:47,529 --> 01:15:49,199
The water looked so clear.

1953
01:15:49,199 --> 01:15:51,529
It looks like an ocean.

1954
01:15:52,069 --> 01:15:54,140
(Lake Titicaca)

1955
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:55,939
It was so beautiful.

1956
01:15:57,310 --> 01:15:59,069
- My gosh.
- I've never seen a lake...

1957
01:15:59,069 --> 01:16:00,380
that doesn't meet the sky.

1958
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:01,710
(They've never seen a lake this huge.)

1959
01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:04,680
This is freshwater.

1960
01:16:05,550 --> 01:16:06,750
You were thinking about that too.

1961
01:16:07,079 --> 01:16:08,550
- They have farms here.
- What?

1962
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:10,520
- They have farms in the lake?
- I know.

1963
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:13,119
(Pani bottle mentioned Lake Titicaca was
known for its trout.)

1964
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:14,220
(They're called rainbow trout.)

1965
01:16:14,220 --> 01:16:15,659
(Are they from the ocean?)

1966
01:16:15,659 --> 01:16:17,289
(You're talking about salmon.)

1967
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:19,359
(Salmon or trout?)

1968
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:21,100
They look similar.

1969
01:16:21,100 --> 01:16:22,960
Those were trout farms.

1970
01:16:23,159 --> 01:16:26,069
"It's located 3,810m above sea level."

1971
01:16:26,229 --> 01:16:29,539
"It's the highest lake on earth."

1972
01:16:30,199 --> 01:16:31,909
How big is this?

1973
01:16:32,739 --> 01:16:34,409
It covers 8,300 km².

1974
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:37,710
It is about 80km wide from east to west...

1975
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:39,850
and 190km from north to south.

1976
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:42,079
I see.

1977
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,520
Let's see how big this is.

1978
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:47,260
Jeju Island is 1,848km².

1979
01:16:47,720 --> 01:16:49,220
It's even bigger than Jeju.

1980
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:51,029
- A lake bigger than Jeju.
- Yes.

1981
01:16:51,029 --> 01:16:52,489
It's four times as big as Jeju.

1982
01:16:52,489 --> 01:16:53,960
(It's such a huge lake.)

1983
01:16:54,199 --> 01:16:55,260
Look over there.

1984
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:57,829
- That looks like an island.
- Yes.

1985
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,539
I think I saw it in Korea.

1986
01:17:00,539 --> 01:17:04,210
I like the view here.

1987
01:17:04,609 --> 01:17:06,710
- The way from Jebudo Island...
- Yes.

1988
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:09,510
to Daebu Island looks a lot like this.

1989
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:11,550
Right. There's an island on the way too.

1990
01:17:12,609 --> 01:17:13,680
(The view reminds them of Daebu Island.)

1991
01:17:13,680 --> 01:17:15,319
They're right. What is this place?

1992
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:17,220
- That's Daebu Island.
- It surprised me.

1993
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,119
I was thinking
Peru looked just like Daebu Island.

1994
01:17:19,119 --> 01:17:20,960
- I thought it was Bolivia.
- Oh, my.

1995
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:22,060
- This is Daebu Island.
- Daebu Island.

1996
01:17:22,060 --> 01:17:23,729
- This is our country.
- This is Peru.

1997
01:17:23,729 --> 01:17:24,859
It looks similar.

1998
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:27,500
Do they also have grilled clams?

1999
01:17:27,829 --> 01:17:28,930
Grilled clams.

2000
01:17:29,130 --> 01:17:31,930
Let me find out if they have
grilled calms at Lake Titicaca.

2001
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:34,600
There are no clams in lakes.

2002
01:17:35,140 --> 01:17:36,239
Si Eon.

2003
01:17:36,899 --> 01:17:39,670
I'm shocked
whenever you say things like that.

2004
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:40,680
- What?
- Why?

2005
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,439
Clams live in lakes.

2006
01:17:44,149 --> 01:17:45,310
(Sighing)

2007
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:46,850
(Annoyed)

2008
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:47,949
He's actually annoyed.

2009
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:50,550
(What?)

2010
01:17:50,550 --> 01:17:52,449
What kinds of clams live in lakes?

2011
01:17:52,449 --> 01:17:54,020
Can you grill them?

2012
01:17:54,189 --> 01:17:57,189
It doesn't matter if you can grill them.
There are clams in lakes.

2013
01:17:57,460 --> 01:17:59,060
There are freshwater clams.

2014
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,130
Don't say something like that
somewhere else.

2015
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,069
Why are you being so mean?

2016
01:18:04,069 --> 01:18:06,300
I don't deserve hearing that from you.

2017
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,939
Clams live in lakes.

2018
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,439
I told you my hometown looked like Peru.

2019
01:18:11,439 --> 01:18:13,569
There are big calms called zebra clams.

2020
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:15,109
Right. Zebra clams.

2021
01:18:15,109 --> 01:18:16,779
I forgot about them.

2022
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:19,609
(Kian84 caught...)

2023
01:18:20,180 --> 01:18:22,350
(zebra clams in his hometown.)

2024
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:23,680
(Zebra clams live in freshwater.)

2025
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:25,050
You can't really eat them, though.

2026
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:27,989
I'm sorry, Kian84. I didn't know.

2027
01:18:28,159 --> 01:18:29,220
I apologize.

2028
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:31,659
If you say to someone...

2029
01:18:31,659 --> 01:18:33,800
- I forgot about it.
- that clams don't live in freshwater,

2030
01:18:33,859 --> 01:18:35,829
they might look down on you.

2031
01:18:35,829 --> 01:18:38,100
I didn't think
clams could live in freshwater.

2032
01:18:38,170 --> 01:18:40,170
(That's unbelievable.)

2033
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:42,869
Kian84, why were you so mad
about the clams?

2034
01:18:42,869 --> 01:18:45,439
- Honestly, I don't know well either.
- It wasn't just that.

2035
01:18:45,439 --> 01:18:47,109
I've been holding my anger in.

2036
01:18:47,109 --> 01:18:49,010
Since when?

2037
01:18:49,180 --> 01:18:51,210
- When you couldn't speak English?
- Since we arrived in Iquitos?

2038
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:52,479
- It's been a while.
- Well.

2039
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:54,350
I wasn't furious.

2040
01:18:54,380 --> 01:18:55,750
You were.

2041
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:56,920
No, I wasn't.

2042
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,890
You looked at me as if I was pathetic.

2043
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,460
I was embarrassed.

2044
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:03,390
You yelled at me for not knowing
clams lived in lakes.

2045
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:05,760
- He's calling you stupid with his face.
- I mean...

2046
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:08,800
To me, the question sounded like
"Are there clouds in the sky?"

2047
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,029
Not everyone knows this.

2048
01:19:10,029 --> 01:19:12,300
- Right. I didn't know.
- Me neither.

2049
01:19:12,300 --> 01:19:14,270
I'm sorry. I got too mad.

2050
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:18,270
Not many species live
in lakes at high altitudes.

2051
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:20,609
There was a rare species...

2052
01:19:20,939 --> 01:19:24,850
that only lived in lakes
called Titicaca orestias.

2053
01:19:25,409 --> 01:19:28,220
Trout ate them and made them go extinct.

2054
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,420
It's like bass messing up
the ecosystem in Korea.

2055
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:33,489
It was a foreign species.

2056
01:19:33,489 --> 01:19:36,460
- They got beaten up by salmon...
- No. Trout.

2057
01:19:36,460 --> 01:19:38,060
They got eaten by trout.

2058
01:19:38,390 --> 01:19:39,930
I made a decision, Si Eon.

2059
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:42,159
Let's eat some salmon
and get back at them.

2060
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:44,329
- Trout, you silly.
- Trout.

2061
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,140
Let's eat trout and get their revenge.

2062
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:48,670
Why does he keep calling it salmon?

2063
01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:50,909
- Were you craving salmon, Kian84?
- "Delicious..."

2064
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:53,109
"Delicious trout dish."

2065
01:19:53,439 --> 01:19:55,880
Let's eat salmon in Copacabana.

2066
01:19:55,939 --> 01:19:57,149
It's trout.

2067
01:19:57,149 --> 01:19:59,880
After yelling so much at me about clams.

2068
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:02,279
Pani Bottle, help us.

2069
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:04,550
Pani Bottle.

2070
01:20:05,449 --> 01:20:07,189
- He's sleeping.
- Pani Bottle.

2071
01:20:07,659 --> 01:20:10,930
Let me end it for now.

2072
01:20:13,029 --> 01:20:16,430
Passengers, we've arrived at the border.

2073
01:20:16,899 --> 01:20:18,100
Pani Bottle said...

2074
01:20:18,100 --> 01:20:20,670
- We arrived at the border.
- You arrived.

2075
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:24,539
(Border office between Peru and Bolivia)

2076
01:20:24,539 --> 01:20:27,810
- Peru.
- And we check out.

2077
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:32,750
You'll check in at the Bolivia
immigration office on your left.

2078
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:35,420
We should submit the form soon.

2079
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:36,949
(Figuring out what's going on)

2080
01:20:36,949 --> 01:20:39,119
How do you cross the border there?

2081
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:42,460
We go
to the Peru immigration office first...

2082
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:46,029
and then to the Bolivia immigration office
to enter the country.

2083
01:20:46,029 --> 01:20:48,130
The bus crosses the border
without any passengers on it.

2084
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,029
Only the passengers get off
and go through immigration.

2085
01:20:50,729 --> 01:20:54,170
This is how you cross the border on foot.

2086
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:57,270
- That's cool.
- We should buy Bolivia currency.

2087
01:20:57,270 --> 01:21:01,579
Yes. We should complete this form first.

2088
01:21:02,039 --> 01:21:04,609
Check "foreigner."

2089
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:06,250
- South Korea.
- Where?

2090
01:21:06,250 --> 01:21:07,420
(Si Eon was waiting.)

2091
01:21:07,619 --> 01:21:09,619
Check here and put your passport number.

2092
01:21:10,350 --> 01:21:11,819
Assistant Pani Bottle.

2093
01:21:11,819 --> 01:21:12,819
(Let me see.)

2094
01:21:12,819 --> 01:21:13,989
It's not one, right?

2095
01:21:13,989 --> 01:21:15,359
- I have two.
- I see.

2096
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:16,789
- You put two too.
- Yes.

2097
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:19,989
They're asking how much money you have.

2098
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:21,899
Sign here.

2099
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,069
All right.

2100
01:21:24,069 --> 01:21:25,229
(Assistant Pani Bottle helped them
to fill out their forms.)

2101
01:21:25,229 --> 01:21:26,670
They almost fail to cross the border.

2102
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:27,939
That's so true.

2103
01:21:27,939 --> 01:21:29,199
I almost copied his passport number too.

2104
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:30,869
Filling out those forms are difficult.

2105
01:21:31,170 --> 01:21:33,210
- Seriously?
- You could've been detained.

2106
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:36,279
- I've been confused too.
- You get it, right?

2107
01:21:36,279 --> 01:21:37,850
- When you've just waken up.
- No way.

2108
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:39,279
I put my own name,

2109
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:40,350
- but I almost put his passport number.
- No.

2110
01:21:40,350 --> 01:21:42,819
You should make sure to put
your birth date and your passport number.

2111
01:21:42,819 --> 01:21:46,050
- That happens.
- I was fatigued.

2112
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:49,220
- You did a good job copying.
- I filled out the form.

2113
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:52,359
- Do we walk there?
- It's Bolivia over there.

2114
01:21:52,789 --> 01:21:54,699
- That's the border.
- Yes, it is.

2115
01:21:54,699 --> 01:21:55,699
(The last time to be in Peru)

2116
01:21:56,930 --> 01:21:58,399
Where's Pani Bottle?

2117
01:21:58,569 --> 01:21:59,869
- Hey.
- What did they say?

2118
01:22:00,270 --> 01:22:01,770
I'll be in line.

2119
01:22:01,770 --> 01:22:03,399
I'll wait here...

2120
01:22:03,399 --> 01:22:05,640
so you guys can join me later.

2121
01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:09,640
Pani Bottle,
give me the money you have left.

2122
01:22:10,279 --> 01:22:13,149
It's better to have one person
wait in line.

2123
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:17,390
What we have left is...50. Sixty soles.

2124
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:20,319
We have 660 soles left.

2125
01:22:20,319 --> 01:22:23,689
In Korean won, that's...

2126
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:26,460
- Kian calculates fast.
- He's fast.

2127
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:30,930
We want to exchange soles for bolivianos.

2128
01:22:32,069 --> 01:22:35,399
I want to go to the bathroom.
What should I say?

2129
01:22:35,399 --> 01:22:37,039
(He wants to use the restroom.)

2130
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:39,369
- Toilet.
- They won't understand that.

2131
01:22:39,369 --> 01:22:40,739
They don't know that word?

2132
01:22:40,939 --> 01:22:42,680
Where is the toilet?

2133
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,880
They understand right away.

2134
01:22:45,180 --> 01:22:47,210
- The conversation was a little weird.
- I'm going to the bathroom.

2135
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:51,119
Si Eon, come this way.

2136
01:22:51,850 --> 01:22:53,289
Pani Bottle, where is the bathroom?

2137
01:22:53,289 --> 01:22:55,560
The bathroom? I don't know.

2138
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,960
Right. When you're on a trip,

2139
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,189
you should know
how to ask where the restroom is.

2140
01:23:00,329 --> 01:23:02,699
I asked them and they pointed this way.

2141
01:23:03,029 --> 01:23:04,100
Wait.

2142
01:23:04,100 --> 01:23:06,029
Were they talking about the one
on the bus? I'll take that.

2143
01:23:06,029 --> 01:23:08,039
- Can you use the one on the bus?
- No, I can't.

2144
01:23:08,899 --> 01:23:10,569
We should wait for a long time.

2145
01:23:11,739 --> 01:23:12,939
Thank you.

2146
01:23:13,140 --> 01:23:14,909
It looks interesting.

2147
01:23:14,909 --> 01:23:17,380
It's the currency of Bolivia.

2148
01:23:18,010 --> 01:23:20,949
Interestingly enough,
they use both the old and new bills.

2149
01:23:20,949 --> 01:23:22,420
- Right.
- Look at this one.

2150
01:23:22,779 --> 01:23:25,289
It looks like a new bill.

2151
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:27,390
You exchanged soles for bolivianos.

2152
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:29,289
Yes. It's called bolivianos.

2153
01:23:29,289 --> 01:23:31,289
- Bolivianos, right?
- One boliviano.

2154
01:23:31,430 --> 01:23:32,890
(Kian84!)

2155
01:23:32,890 --> 01:23:35,029
This.

2156
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:38,270
(He hasn't used the bathroom yet.)

2157
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:41,640
One boliviano is 210 Korean won.

2158
01:23:42,899 --> 01:23:44,970
If 1 boliviano is 210 won...

2159
01:23:45,869 --> 01:23:48,239
- That means.
- They don't even look at each other.

2160
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:49,409
(It's that way.)

2161
01:23:49,409 --> 01:23:51,550
As if they're not in the same place.

2162
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:52,880
It looks so funny.

2163
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,079
- The guy was saying...
- This one is a new bill.

2164
01:23:55,079 --> 01:23:57,390
the bathroom was over the border.

2165
01:23:57,949 --> 01:23:59,220
They didn't let me use the bathroom.

2166
01:23:59,220 --> 01:24:00,590
I almost pooped.

2167
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:04,329
(He wanted to use the bathroom
since the start.)

2168
01:24:05,029 --> 01:24:06,630
(Kian84 is used to it.)

2169
01:24:07,090 --> 01:24:08,630
(Bathroom)

2170
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,130
(He looks for the bathroom
wherever he goes.)

2171
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,970
(We can only take a bus.)

2172
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:14,140
(He's worried about using the bathroom.)

2173
01:24:14,199 --> 01:24:15,470
There's a bathroom on the bus?

2174
01:24:15,470 --> 01:24:17,739
Bathrooms are important
when you're traveling.

2175
01:24:17,739 --> 01:24:20,409
You can't use the bathroom
before crossing the border.

2176
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,979
They had a bathroom on the bus.

2177
01:24:23,180 --> 01:24:25,750
- It says, "No poop" in Korean.
- Really?

2178
01:24:25,750 --> 01:24:27,420
You must know this...

2179
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:29,250
because the bus ride is long.

2180
01:24:30,350 --> 01:24:31,890
(Worried)

2181
01:24:32,050 --> 01:24:33,390
I'll be traumatized about pooping.

2182
01:24:33,390 --> 01:24:35,090
He goes to the bathroom often.

2183
01:24:35,090 --> 01:24:38,390
I should sew his butthole in Bolivia.

2184
01:24:38,659 --> 01:24:40,829
He goes to the restroom too often.

2185
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:44,100
(He'll block his butthole with chips.)

2186
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:46,100
- The taste of capitalism.
- I thought that was his bathroom.

2187
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:47,899
Why did you put that caption?

2188
01:24:47,899 --> 01:24:49,369
(The caption is so realistic
that it makes him mad.)

2189
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:51,510
(Kian84 only finds it funny.)

2190
01:24:51,710 --> 01:24:54,279
- Their exchange rate is not that bad.
- Is it okay?

2191
01:24:54,279 --> 01:24:55,539
- No.
- I thought it'd be bad.

2192
01:24:55,539 --> 01:24:57,010
Pani Bottle had it calculated.

2193
01:24:57,409 --> 01:25:00,109
- Hello.
- We should show our passports.

2194
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,279
Thank you.

2195
01:25:02,279 --> 01:25:03,279
(They passed the immigration checks.)

2196
01:25:04,119 --> 01:25:06,489
(It was the first step to get to Bolivia.)

2197
01:25:06,819 --> 01:25:09,220
I did some research about Bolivia.

2198
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:11,689
Once we cross this, we'll be on Bolivia.

2199
01:25:11,689 --> 01:25:13,430
Can we take photos here?

2200
01:25:13,989 --> 01:25:15,060
I think we can over there.

2201
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:16,960
(Their bus crosses the border first.)

2202
01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:18,100
Bye, Peru.

2203
01:25:19,069 --> 01:25:21,640
So, is Bolivia similar to Peru?

2204
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:24,640
- Yes. To me, it was similar.
- I see.

2205
01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:28,210
Pani Bottle,
do you know how big Lake Titicaca is?

2206
01:25:28,609 --> 01:25:30,180
It's as big as an ocean.

2207
01:25:31,609 --> 01:25:33,310
Why don't we take a photo here?

2208
01:25:33,310 --> 01:25:34,850
Here at "I love Peru."

2209
01:25:35,579 --> 01:25:36,649
Stand there.

2210
01:25:37,050 --> 01:25:38,819
- Shall we use the film camera?
- Yes.

2211
01:25:40,689 --> 01:25:41,960
It's the border.

2212
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:43,989
I've never been to a border in my life.

2213
01:25:43,989 --> 01:25:45,090
That's fascinating.

2214
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:48,130
(Kian84 also shows his palm
as Pani Bottle does.)

2215
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:52,029
(They're taking
their last photos in Peru.)

2216
01:25:52,869 --> 01:25:54,739
(Kian84 strikes the same pose.)

2217
01:25:55,170 --> 01:25:56,800
Hold on.

2218
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:58,970
In 1, 2, 3.

2219
01:25:58,970 --> 01:26:00,210
(Holding hands tightly)

2220
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:03,539
They fought a lot,
but they look like a married couple now.

2221
01:26:03,710 --> 01:26:06,050
It was different
from the border I imagined.

2222
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:08,550
I thought it'd be scary,

2223
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:11,590
but it was so relaxing.

2224
01:26:12,850 --> 01:26:14,760
You take a few steps,

2225
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:16,520
and you'll be in a different country.

2226
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:18,060
What an interesting experience.

2227
01:26:18,060 --> 01:26:20,529
They go through that door,
and they'll be in a different place.

2228
01:26:20,529 --> 01:26:21,760
That's indeed amazing.

2229
01:26:22,229 --> 01:26:23,729
We only took pictures,
and I'm out of breath.

2230
01:26:24,229 --> 01:26:25,630
By the way...

2231
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:29,069
(They're getting excited.)

2232
01:26:29,170 --> 01:26:30,970
I'm walking to cross the border.

2233
01:26:31,140 --> 01:26:33,510
It's Bolivia over the arch.

2234
01:26:33,510 --> 01:26:35,539
It must feel weird.

2235
01:26:35,539 --> 01:26:39,010
I've only seen people
crossing the border...

2236
01:26:39,810 --> 01:26:42,050
on TV and in movies.

2237
01:26:42,319 --> 01:26:43,649
We're in Bolivia now.

2238
01:26:44,119 --> 01:26:45,789
Here.

2239
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:47,760
It's Bolivia here.

2240
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:49,960
There it is.

2241
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:51,859
It's the checkpoint
between Peru and Bolivia.

2242
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:53,989
(The border mark
that divides Peru and Bolivia)

2243
01:26:53,989 --> 01:26:55,760
That mark divides the border.

2244
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:57,869
- Peru and Bolivia.
- Ta-da.

2245
01:26:57,869 --> 01:27:00,369
- Can you take a video of me?
- This side is Bolivia.

2246
01:27:00,369 --> 01:27:02,039
- I'm on the border.
- It's Peru on this side.

2247
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,210
- Do it again.
- Peru and Bolivia.

2248
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:08,710
How many times did he cross the border?

2249
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,380
- You try it too.
- Me?

2250
01:27:10,909 --> 01:27:13,010
(Excited)

2251
01:27:13,250 --> 01:27:15,649
- Do you have a headache?
- I won't two-time.

2252
01:27:15,979 --> 01:27:17,550
That's being a bat.

2253
01:27:17,989 --> 01:27:19,890
What does that make Si Eon look like?

2254
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:23,960
- I'm Bolivian now.
- They're in a different country now.

2255
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:27,159
We crossed the border to Bolivia.

2256
01:27:27,359 --> 01:27:29,130
Uyuni Salt Flat is in Bolivia.

2257
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:30,729
You're getting close.

2258
01:27:31,470 --> 01:27:34,399
When will I get to come here again?

2259
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,100
We should go through immigration
to enter Bolivia now.

2260
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:39,140
- Should we do this again?
- Yes, we should.

2261
01:27:40,010 --> 01:27:41,479
Now it's to enter a country.

2262
01:27:42,909 --> 01:27:46,310
(They're getting stamps in order.)

2263
01:27:47,050 --> 01:27:49,380
Don't be nervous, Kian84.
They don't ask you anything.

2264
01:27:49,949 --> 01:27:51,220
Thank you.

2265
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:56,289
It's fascinating how I went through
immigration in a place like this.

2266
01:27:57,289 --> 01:27:59,689
When could we come to Bolivia again?

2267
01:28:00,859 --> 01:28:01,859
(Thumbs-up)

2268
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:07,770
(They leave Peru
and start a new journey in Bolivia.)

2269
01:28:10,539 --> 01:28:11,539
(Bolivia)

2270
01:28:11,539 --> 01:28:13,310
(It's higher and deeper.)

2271
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:15,039
(A country of a thousand faces)

2272
01:28:15,479 --> 01:28:16,939
(Through Death Road...)

2273
01:28:16,939 --> 01:28:18,649
(towards Uyuni Salt Flats)

2274
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:22,180
(A turbulent opening act)

2275
01:28:22,619 --> 01:28:24,319
(The start of another type of struggle)

2276
01:28:24,819 --> 01:28:27,520
(Unparalleled population density)

2277
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:31,229
(Traffic congestion)

2278
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,430
(Natural disasters)

2279
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:34,930
(I suddenly can't breathe easily.)

2280
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:36,659
(A journey...)

2281
01:28:36,659 --> 01:28:38,399
(that seems to have no end)

2282
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,199
(A fierce fight...)

2283
01:28:40,199 --> 01:28:41,500
(against time)

2284
01:28:41,770 --> 01:28:43,600
(Don't touch our camera.)

2285
01:28:44,069 --> 01:28:46,039
(The most dangerous adventure by accident)

2286
01:28:46,270 --> 01:28:47,270
(Uncontrollable laughter)

2287
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:49,909
(The trip to Bolivia...)

2288
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:53,079
(that knocked Kian84 down)

2289
01:28:53,649 --> 01:28:54,880
(Applause)

2290
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:55,920
Good job, guys.

2291
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:57,850
- It's fun.
- It's so fun.

2292
01:28:57,850 --> 01:29:00,949
Until then, it was pretty peaceful.

2293
01:29:00,949 --> 01:29:05,090
When we went over the Bolivia,
things got really touchy.

2294
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:08,859
Was it completely different
from Iquitos or Cusco?

2295
01:29:08,859 --> 01:29:10,060
Peru...

2296
01:29:11,369 --> 01:29:14,329
(Curious)

2297
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:16,699
was the mild version.

2298
01:29:17,039 --> 01:29:18,670
- Really?
- Bolivia was the spicy version.

2299
01:29:18,670 --> 01:29:19,909
- The spicy version?
- Super spicy.

2300
01:29:19,909 --> 01:29:21,109
It was like mala soup almost.

2301
01:29:21,109 --> 01:29:23,109
We only saw bits and pieces,

2302
01:29:23,109 --> 01:29:25,649
but it seems
like you went through more struggle.

2303
01:29:25,649 --> 01:29:27,720
There were some
unexpected natural disasters, I saw.

2304
01:29:27,720 --> 01:29:30,850
Kian84 and I became friends again
after we went to Everland together,

2305
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:34,149
but there was a time
when we really split up then.

2306
01:29:35,889 --> 01:29:37,719
(Finally?)

2307
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:38,990
Yes.

2308
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:39,990
(The two decided to split up?)

2309
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:41,860
(The anticipated next destination)

2310
01:29:41,860 --> 01:29:43,759
(La Paz)

2311
01:29:43,999 --> 01:29:45,870
(But the traffic is ridiculous
from the get go.)

2312
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:48,400
(I want to break the window and get out.)

2313
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:49,700
(Losing it)

2314
01:29:50,539 --> 01:29:51,969
(This is too much.)

2315
01:29:52,370 --> 01:29:54,110
(I think we should just get off.)

2316
01:29:54,370 --> 01:29:56,910
(We have to go that way.
A right turn over there.)

2317
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:59,249
(Guide me, Pani Bottle.)

2318
01:29:59,509 --> 01:30:00,850
(Will their conflict become a fight?)

2319
01:30:01,219 --> 01:30:04,950
(Even suggesting using separate rooms)

2320
01:30:05,320 --> 01:30:06,549
(Early next morning)

2321
01:30:07,120 --> 01:30:09,889
(A pressing knock to wake up Kian84)

2322
01:30:10,419 --> 01:30:14,530
(Unexpected road blockages)

2323
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,329
(Feeling unsafe, he leaves on his own...)

2324
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:19,770
(and heads to a completely
different destination.)

2325
01:30:20,129 --> 01:30:23,370
(The overwhelming anxiety...)

2326
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:27,410
(and a travel destination that feels
completely different from before)

2327
01:30:28,179 --> 01:30:30,639
(This is so scary, seriously.)

2328
01:30:31,209 --> 01:30:33,610
(He arrives in an unknown world
after passing through Death Road.)

2329
01:30:34,650 --> 01:30:36,980
(What did Kian84 see here?)

2330
01:30:37,650 --> 01:30:38,719
(Adventure by Accident)
