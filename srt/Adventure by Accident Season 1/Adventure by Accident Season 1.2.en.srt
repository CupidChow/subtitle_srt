1
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,369
(They enter into an unknown world.)

2
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:06,479
Into the unknown world.

3
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,980
- I can really feel it.
- It's really the Amazon now.

4
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,079
We're entering the jungle now.

5
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,049
Look at this.

6
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,420
- Achiote.
- Achiote?

7
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,590
(They find a unique fruit
as soon as they enter.)

8
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:17,950
- Add.
- Is that good?

9
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:20,360
(Is it safe to eat?)

10
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,219
No. It's for putting on your face.

11
00:01:22,219 --> 00:01:23,660
- On your face?
- I see.

12
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,259
Si Eon. This is that thing
that Yamulu put on.

13
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:28,559
(Kian84, This is the thing that Yamulu
from Amazon's Waura tribe put on.)

14
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,000
Everyone. Take a look at this.

15
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,040
It almost has the color of paint.

16
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:39,440
I thought it would be
a mosquito repellent,

17
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,209
but it wasn't something like that.
It's just for makeup.

18
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,109
Indian community.

19
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:45,809
Thank you.

20
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:47,480
You too?

21
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,580
(Me too.)

22
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,919
No mosquito?

23
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,620
- Not for mosquitoes.
- Amazon style.

24
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,749
(Amazon style)

25
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:55,590
- Isn't this that thing?
- You too?

26
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,660
You.

27
00:01:57,529 --> 00:01:58,959
This is...

28
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:02,429
I am...

29
00:02:02,429 --> 00:02:04,700
a Korean painter.

30
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,870
Artist.

31
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,340
Korean movie star.

32
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,439
Sure. Korean artist.

33
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,880
(Sure.)

34
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:15,010
They seem to think we're lying.

35
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:17,079
(They seem to think we're lying.)

36
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:19,549
Why did you interpret it in that way?

37
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:22,180
They had almost no reaction.

38
00:02:22,419 --> 00:02:24,290
It felt like they thought
we were saying useless things.

39
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:27,389
I'll make you look cooler.

40
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,400
Shouldn't it not go in my eyes?

41
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:36,900
It's not an artificial chemical.

42
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,930
(Not my problem.)

43
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,240
(They don't hold back
when investing in improving their looks.)

44
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,570
(Satisfied)

45
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,909
I'll put it on like this.

46
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,210
- Wait here.
- Yes.

47
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:51,380
Nice.

48
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,680
The more I put on, the more I want.

49
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:55,880
A little bit more like this.

50
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,320
(Putting on more and more)

51
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:00,189
(Nice.)

52
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:02,490
Some on my lips too.

53
00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:07,130
- He's really putting on a lot.
- Gosh.

54
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:09,999
It fits you. It's nice.

55
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:12,130
It looks like we put on gochujang.

56
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,570
(The gochujang brothers from Korea)

57
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,169
- Here.
- What is this?

58
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:18,169
- Fishing for piranhas.
- I see.

59
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:19,780
- It's a completely handmade fishing pole.
- Interesting.

60
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,609
I think we can put down our bags.

61
00:03:21,609 --> 00:03:23,010
Okay. Go.

62
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,280
(Let's go fishing.)

63
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,910
They're going fishing finally.

64
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:29,019
I really like this.

65
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,119
I wonder what it'll be like
to fish in the Amazon.

66
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,160
You know when fishermen catch a big fish?

67
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,290
That's not something you come by
often in life.

68
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,130
If I can do something like that,
it'll be like winning the lottery.

69
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,399
It'll be like a dream.

70
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,440
I'm very excited.

71
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,470
(I'm very excited
for fishing in the Amazon.)

72
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,810
Salvatore!

73
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:50,910
(They take off while dreaming
of becoming Amazon's big fish king.)

74
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,139
(Excited)

75
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:59,820
(They anchor down at the fishing spot.)

76
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:02,780
(The bait is chicken gizzards?)

77
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,089
- Is this the bait?
- Yes.

78
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:08,359
They usually use worms for fish bait.

79
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:10,889
These are piranhas. They have teeth.

80
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:13,200
They said they could smell blood.

81
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,660
(Piranha, Meaning "fish with teeth")

82
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,269
(A carnivorous fresh-water fish
that responds to blood)

83
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,369
Oh, those teeth.

84
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,239
I'll add one here.

85
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,470
(Put on some bloody bait,)

86
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,739
We should start together.

87
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,369
(and they're ready to fish.)

88
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:27,079
I've never seen someone
fish for piranhas before.

89
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:29,810
(Interesting)

90
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,280
(First, Eric, the fishing tour guide,
gives a demonstration.)

91
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,019
- What is that?
- What is that?

92
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:37,549
(He makes a unique sound
to lure the piranhas.)

93
00:04:37,549 --> 00:04:38,589
- They have to call them.
- I see.

94
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:40,459
They don't run away instead?

95
00:04:42,389 --> 00:04:45,429
(They do as they were taught.)

96
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,269
(Splashing)

97
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:58,510
(They swish around
until their arms are about to fall off.)

98
00:04:58,869 --> 00:05:00,579
(He's so focused.)

99
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:03,549
(Biting down)

100
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:07,149
Why aren't they biting?

101
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:09,179
(Why aren't they biting?)

102
00:05:09,179 --> 00:05:10,690
(Gosh.)

103
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,560
In movies,
I always see piranhas attack people...

104
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,889
- when they're playing in the water.
- That's true.

105
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:16,160
I feel like I hear something.

106
00:05:16,459 --> 00:05:21,630
(The piranhas people normally see)

107
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:25,070
(So peaceful)

108
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,440
(I'm here.)

109
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,639
(I'm here too.)

110
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,010
(No answer)

111
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:34,479
(They didn't expect fishing would be
lacking in interactions this much.)

112
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:37,110
(Pouting)

113
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,349
Fishing is all about waiting.

114
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,920
(So peaceful.)

115
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:51,459
That river was so peaceful.

116
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:52,589
It was so quiet.

117
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,000
Do they actually bite?

118
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,229
They seem to have realized
that we are fishing.

119
00:05:57,529 --> 00:05:59,099
This isn't easy.

120
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:00,839
(Will they have to give up
on becoming Amazon's big fish king?)

121
00:06:04,969 --> 00:06:05,969
(Flinch)

122
00:06:05,969 --> 00:06:07,079
They're biting.

123
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,639
(They're biting!)

124
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,110
They're here.

125
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,320
They're here.

126
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:17,389
Bite it. Just do it.

127
00:06:18,389 --> 00:06:21,360
Fishing is my only hobby.

128
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,229
I'm excited about fishing in the Amazon.

129
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:28,099
(This is it!)

130
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:30,769
(Excited)

131
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,099
Gosh.

132
00:06:35,599 --> 00:06:37,940
(He got nothing.)

133
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,909
I should wait a little bit more
before I pull.

134
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:41,839
(Glancing over)

135
00:06:43,149 --> 00:06:44,880
- Give me some space.
- What?

136
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,050
- Move just a little.
- Okay.

137
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:47,579
(He moves right away
after the news of the fish biting.)

138
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,789
(While they were all
waiting for a bite...)

139
00:06:58,589 --> 00:06:59,719
I got one.

140
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:02,089
- Oh, my.
- Oh, he got something.

141
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:03,760
- Oh, my!
- Oh, my!

142
00:07:04,289 --> 00:07:05,329
I got one.

143
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:06,959
- Oh, my!
- Oh, my!

144
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:09,000
A red piranha.

145
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,159
(A red piranha)

146
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:11,430
Yes.

147
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,430
A piranha?

148
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,769
The stomach is red.

149
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:16,039
- Those teeth are scary.
- Gosh.

150
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:18,539
This is a red piranha.

151
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,440
He's really good at fishing.

152
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:23,979
(Turning around)

153
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,750
Why do you keep switching directions?

154
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,550
I started to feel a bit competitive.

155
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,120
- Let's concentrate.
- Oh, my!

156
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,360
- Oh, my.
- That side is better.

157
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,089
(Will Si Eon become
Amazon's big fish king?)

158
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:43,760
(No!)

159
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,729
Pull it up.

160
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:47,130
(It goes back in the water.)

161
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,170
- Oh, no!
- What a loss.

162
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,300
How sad.

163
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,839
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

164
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,909
It fell in? That's a relief.

165
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,349
I need to catch at least one.

166
00:07:58,349 --> 00:08:01,110
(After seeing Si Eon almost catch one,
Kian84 feels rushed.)

167
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:04,050
Maybe the smell of blood
has almost gone away.

168
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,450
I really want to catch one,
even if I have to make my hand bleed.

169
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:08,149
You need to at least get one to bite.

170
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,519
How infuriating.

171
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,789
(His anger explodes...)

172
00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:15,529
(from Si Eon provoking him.)

173
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,599
I just kept doing that.

174
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:21,130
That's not going to work, Kian84.

175
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:22,200
What?

176
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,940
Be smooth.

177
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,079
(Irritated)

178
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,279
(As Si Eon was provoking Kian84...)

179
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:32,310
(Flying up)

180
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,279
(Eric catches one too?)

181
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,579
I saw one.

182
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,820
- Eric is kind of weak.
- He is.

183
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,089
I thought he'd be really good at fishing.

184
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:45,459
Eric.

185
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,589
(He's similar to us.)

186
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,500
(They just keep waiting for a bite.)

187
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,300
(Glancing over)

188
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,829
(Glancing over again)

189
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,300
Oh, baby.

190
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,670
(The piranha that the tour guide caught)

191
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,709
(He suddenly moves
to the inside of the boat.)

192
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,420
This...

193
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:12,389
Living? Go?

194
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,060
With the smaller ones,

195
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:18,789
they're supposed to be
from an underwater palace.

196
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:20,060
So we should let them live.

197
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:22,659
You have such a warm heart.

198
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,329
Sure. Go ahead.

199
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:25,329
Okay.

200
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh, I got it.

201
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Okay.

202
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,570
I'm sorry.

203
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,240
(The piranha goes back
into the Amazon River.)

204
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,839
What? He's weird!

205
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:41,349
You didn't catch it. Someone else did.
Why are you letting it go?

206
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:42,519
That's true.

207
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,680
- That's true.
- That's true. He didn't catch it.

208
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,749
- It's fine if he caught it.
- Exactly.

209
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:48,920
He could have a family at home.

210
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,089
Gosh.

211
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,930
Si Eon. Do you know
how cutely the piranha flapped its tail...

212
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:56,459
while swimming away when I let it go?

213
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,969
I really don't understand you.

214
00:10:00,599 --> 00:10:01,839
Finish.

215
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,800
- You're finished?
- Yes.

216
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,140
(They finish with no fish left.)

217
00:10:05,369 --> 00:10:07,209
We'll change the system.

218
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:08,579
Okay. Let's go.

219
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,739
(The second course
of their Amazon fishing tour)

220
00:10:11,739 --> 00:10:13,280
(Look over there.)

221
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,379
- They're using nets, I see.
- Yes. They're throwing in nets.

222
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:17,379
- Net fishing.
- I see.

223
00:10:18,489 --> 00:10:21,589
(They exchange their fishing poles
for nets.)

224
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:22,719
Are they catching it just like that?

225
00:10:22,859 --> 00:10:23,859
Yes.

226
00:10:23,859 --> 00:10:25,489
(Will they be able to achieve their dreams
of coming back with a full boat?)

227
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,499
We must be riding in that.

228
00:10:28,829 --> 00:10:30,800
Oh, a small boat.

229
00:10:31,099 --> 00:10:32,129
Yes.

230
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:35,030
(A small size)

231
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:38,540
(Rocking side to side)

232
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,109
This looks even more dangerous.

233
00:10:40,109 --> 00:10:42,709
(Just getting on is difficult.)

234
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,410
It sinks a little with the three of us on.

235
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,349
(Oh, my.)

236
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,450
(They could fall into the Amazon River
full of piranhas.)

237
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:51,079
Balance.

238
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,650
(Look at this.)

239
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,849
This is nice.

240
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,320
(So good)

241
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,890
(Their fishing tour has become
a little bit more analogue.)

242
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,259
How often does someone get a chance
to fish a boat like that on the Amazon?

243
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:05,869
- Exactly.
- That's why I'm jealous.

244
00:11:07,629 --> 00:11:10,540
(They find a place where piranhas
might be hiding and anchor down.)

245
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:14,869
(Glancing over)

246
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,209
(Orlando was trying to balance,)

247
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,849
(but he falls into the river.)

248
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,379
- What happened?
- Oh, my.

249
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:21,379
(He falls into the river.)

250
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,320
Isn't that a bit dangerous?

251
00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:24,950
Seriously. Can you just go in like that?

252
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:29,859
Won't piranhas attack if you swim in here?

253
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,160
- No attack.
- No attack?

254
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,890
Why? Why don't they attack?

255
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:40,499
(Piranhas only bite if you have a wound.)

256
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:45,099
(He dives in with ease
as if he came to play in the water.)

257
00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:47,609
(Staring)

258
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,009
(He follows him into the Amazon River.)

259
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:53,249
- He has no fear.
- True.

260
00:11:54,509 --> 00:11:56,879
I see. Is he trying to unravel the net?

261
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,420
That's it.

262
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:00,989
Oh, I see.

263
00:12:00,989 --> 00:12:02,259
(Kian84 has naturally settled in.)

264
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:03,390
He's unraveling the net.

265
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:07,530
(He has totally become a local.)

266
00:12:08,329 --> 00:12:10,400
(Good job.)

267
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,270
Gosh. That's how long they make it.

268
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,109
(They stand on the boat
and keep unraveling,)

269
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,180
(and soon, they have a net
that's crossing the giant Amazon River.)

270
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,119
So they put the net
all the way across like that?

271
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:30,520
They block it off completely.

272
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,520
- Now that...
- Oh, my!

273
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,060
(A surprising size)

274
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:48,640
(They put all of their strength together
to pull the net.)

275
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:52,440
(Jumping)

276
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,280
Their jumps are so cool.

277
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,180
(The Amazon has such lively views.)

278
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,609
- Oh, my.
- That's so cool!

279
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:02,879
Look over here, Kian84.
This is what peace is.

280
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:06,989
(The Amazon family became one
through fishing.)

281
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:09,589
I had so much fun.

282
00:13:09,589 --> 00:13:11,259
I like how fishing makes me feel.

283
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,859
More so than catching the fish
and eating it,

284
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:16,829
it gives me a feeling of exaltation,

285
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,800
what with the nice air and all.

286
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:21,129
Fishing and riding in a boat.

287
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,400
It's not something you can do every day.

288
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
(A unique experience
you can't have anywhere else)

289
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,310
I'm really grateful for it.

290
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,780
- It's so cute how they jump.
- Seriously.

291
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,050
- Oh, my.
- Piranha.

292
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:36,150
(Piranhas caught in the net)

293
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:37,820
Four piranhas.

294
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:40,290
What if one of them is the one you let go?

295
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,660
- That could be.
- Didn't you think about that?

296
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,920
Then that one's just unlucky, honestly.

297
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,430
Yes. It was meant to die.

298
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:49,099
(Net fishing is over.)

299
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:50,259
I want to swim.

300
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,430
Do you want to ride the boat?

301
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:54,099
I'm going to swim.

302
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:58,200
(He kept talking about swimming
since the first day he got to Peru.)

303
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,609
(No swimming pool?)

304
00:14:00,109 --> 00:14:01,440
(There's no swimming pool.)

305
00:14:01,969 --> 00:14:05,239
(He kept trying to swim
even while fishing.)

306
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:09,280
(Finally,)

307
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,050
(his wish comes true.)

308
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,800
I think this is so cool.
He just bravely tries everything.

309
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,969
He must not have any regrets.

310
00:14:27,969 --> 00:14:29,040
(A man who does things
just because he was born)

311
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:33,170
Gosh. Look at that. Look at that sunset.

312
00:14:33,469 --> 00:14:35,109
This place is so beautiful.

313
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:37,209
You're such a free spirit, Kian84.

314
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,550
I almost swam across the river
at some point.

315
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,050
It was like a dream.

316
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:46,890
Will I have an experience like this again
in life? That's how it felt.

317
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,690
When the sun was setting,

318
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,759
(A double thumbs up
from feeling deeply moved)

319
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,430
Look. Who in Korea...

320
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,400
has rowed across the Amazon...

321
00:14:58,969 --> 00:15:00,270
during a sunset?

322
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:01,869
I loved it.

323
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:04,770
(An unforgettable day on the Amazon River)

324
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,509
Is it deep?

325
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,810
I feel like I'm going to die.

326
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,550
- Stay next to me.
- Okay.

327
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,910
- Si Eon.
- What?

328
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,950
(He's already tired.)

329
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,150
Hurry.

330
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,489
- I'm tired.
- I can't go that way anymore.

331
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:21,950
It was a lot farther than I thought.

332
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,320
- Si Eon's so helpful.
- Hey. Be careful.

333
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:27,930
Hey. You can't hang on to that.

334
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:30,129
Hey. Don't hang on to that. Hey!

335
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,499
What is that?

336
00:15:31,499 --> 00:15:33,369
- Did you hit him with the oar?
- Just stay still.

337
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,800
I was almost about to drown
because my endurance is bad.

338
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,339
How can you tell me not to hang on?

339
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:40,009
(So upset,
How can you tell me not to hang on?)

340
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:43,209
(He barely held on to his life
despite Si Eon stopping him.)

341
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:44,979
(Swaying side to side)

342
00:15:44,979 --> 00:15:46,050
Hey.

343
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:47,810
Stay still.

344
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:50,079
Please stay still.

345
00:15:52,749 --> 00:15:55,759
Let go. You shouldn't do that.

346
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,030
(He was stopped from boarding the boat,
so he just lies down.)

347
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,729
(An Amazon waterbed)

348
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,300
(Grabbing the boat)

349
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,469
There are no alligators in here, right?

350
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:11,499
No, there aren't.

351
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,609
If there are alligators, we're in trouble.

352
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,079
- Go faster. Alligators might come.
- Gosh!

353
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,879
I'm not worried about piranhas,
but I'm worried about alligators.

354
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,379
- I'm going!
- Go!

355
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:27,690
(Hurrying)

356
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:29,290
We're almost there.

357
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,259
(The fishing tour ends
somewhere in between romance and reality.)

358
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,390
(Completely exhausted)

359
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:37,729
(The two brothers are tired
from the intense fun in the water.)

360
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:39,900
My house is close by.

361
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:45,140
Come change your clothes and eat with us.

362
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,640
- Okay. We go with you?
- Yes. To my house.

363
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,079
Is going to Eric's house part of the tour?

364
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,680
The tour ended after net fishing.

365
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,009
I think he offered to let us wash up...

366
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:57,950
and eat at his house
because Kian84's clothes were wet.

367
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,050
- How kind.
- Really.

368
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,619
- He invited you guys over.
- It's over there.

369
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,359
- I see.
- Okay. Thank you.

370
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,129
(They carried their things together.)

371
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:09,229
Okay.

372
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,300
There's some heat
coming from my feet and shoes.

373
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,469
(They follow Eric.)

374
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:21,770
(After a few steps...)

375
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,209
- Is this your house?
- Yes. It's my house.

376
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:28,310
(Eric's house is right next to the river.
Welcome.)

377
00:17:28,609 --> 00:17:30,849
- Excuse me.
- The stairs are very steep.

378
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:32,790
They build their houses
high up from the ground.

379
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:35,420
- During rainy season, the water comes up.
- I see.

380
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:37,089
(The house is built high up
as water levels rise during rainy season.)

381
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,430
This is my daughter.

382
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:43,259
- Hello.
- This is my grandmother.

383
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:45,599
- Hello.
- Hello.

384
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:47,869
- This is my mother.
- Hello.

385
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:49,900
- Hello.
- This is my youngest daughter.

386
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,270
- Baby? Is this your baby?
- Yes.

387
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,969
- Is this your wife?
- This is my wife, Esposa.

388
00:17:54,969 --> 00:17:56,040
- Wife?
- Wife.

389
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,640
- Hello.
- What a big family.

390
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,709
You can put your stuff over here.

391
00:18:00,709 --> 00:18:02,520
- Okay.
- Yes. Right over there.

392
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,749
Okay. Thank you.

393
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,420
You can wash up first,

394
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,119
- then you can change your clothes.
- Okay.

395
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,420
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

396
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,589
- Nice.
- Shower time.

397
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:12,930
Shower.

398
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,459
Kitchen.

399
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:19,499
Shower.

400
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,969
(An open shower right next to the house)

401
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,840
I don't have pants.

402
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,069
You know how this works.

403
00:18:28,709 --> 00:18:30,840
He assimilates easily anywhere.

404
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,380
(Splashing)

405
00:18:35,009 --> 00:18:36,249
- My goodness.
- He just...

406
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:38,420
- He looks like he's at home.
- It's like he's at home.

407
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,690
That's practically your home.

408
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:43,519
(Si Eon came to Kian84's house shirtless.)

409
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:45,360
What happened to your body?

410
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:49,860
It looks like he drank a lot.

411
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:53,529
Splash some water on my back.

412
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,370
(Screaming)

413
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,799
(It's very cold.)

414
00:18:57,799 --> 00:18:58,870
Is it good?

415
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,069
(Groaning)

416
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,580
Look. The front of your body.

417
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,880
(Splashing)

418
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,479
(One more time)

419
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
(Once again)

420
00:19:13,749 --> 00:19:15,190
It's refreshing.

421
00:19:15,959 --> 00:19:17,890
(Very satisfied)

422
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,590
What's more fascinating is,

423
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,590
we just swam in the Amazon river.

424
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:23,029
That water was from the river too.

425
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:26,430
(The water they used to wash up
was from the river as well.)

426
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,469
- What's that?
- They're all connected.

427
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,640
- That's why I...
- If that's the case, why...

428
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,610
Why did you shower?

429
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:36,009
Do you filter the water...

430
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,479
or use the river water as it is?

431
00:19:37,479 --> 00:19:40,749
When you put the water in there,
the impurities sink.

432
00:19:40,749 --> 00:19:43,380
- And you only use the water on top.
- Yes, the water on top.

433
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,390
(Rummaging)

434
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,789
I brought a towel.

435
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,690
(He dries himself.)

436
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:56,600
(He checks his handsome face
in the mirror.)

437
00:19:58,299 --> 00:19:59,799
Kian84, don't you need to dry yourself?

438
00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:01,769
It's okay.

439
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,200
(Wearing his clothes just like that)

440
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,440
His clothes...

441
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,940
(At a loss for words)

442
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,509
(Right, he is Kian84 after all.)

443
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,809
It was here. This must be our dinner.

444
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:16,219
(The dinner is getting prepared
in one corner of the kitchen.)

445
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,219
You get to eat Peruvian home-cooked food.

446
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:20,190
(They come for the fishing tour
and get to eat Peruvian food too.)

447
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,150
(Place vegetables...)

448
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,259
(on the piranhas they caught)

449
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,759
(Roll them with a banana leaf...)

450
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:35,630
(and place them on the fire.)

451
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,539
What's that? Alligator?

452
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,209
- It looks like fish.
- That's the one.

453
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,640
Pirarucu.

454
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,309
- Pirarucu?
- I see, pirarucu.

455
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:47,580
- Luxurious fish.
- Pirarucu?

456
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,009
- Yes.
- Pirarucu?

457
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:52,019
Do they normally eat this?

458
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,289
They shared what they bought
for themselves.

459
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,719
- Hello.
- Hello.

460
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:00,989
(Shy)

461
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,729
(Hold on.)

462
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,130
Wife.

463
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,830
- Mother.
- Mother.

464
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:08,830
Mother.

465
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:09,999
(She is Eric's...)

466
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:11,170
- Sister.
- Sister.

467
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,239
Sister.

468
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:13,910
Oh, Father?

469
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:15,670
- Orlando.
- Father.

470
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:16,739
- Your father is Orlando?
- Father.

471
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:17,779
- That's right.
- I only found out then.

472
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:18,880
Me too.

473
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:20,450
- Hello.
- Hello.

474
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,380
(My name is Orlando,)

475
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,819
(Eric's father.)

476
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,950
(He explained
when they met in the afternoon.)

477
00:21:27,749 --> 00:21:29,620
(When they met Eric,)

478
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,259
(they thought
he was just a fishing tour guide.)

479
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:33,930
(That's true too.)

480
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,100
(We speak pretty good English, don't we?)

481
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,529
(We're pretty cool right now.)

482
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:40,370
(Embarrassed)

483
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:42,999
- Father.
- Father.

484
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,600
- Captain.
- Hello.

485
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,469
- He's good at English.
- He is.

486
00:21:47,469 --> 00:21:50,640
Is your father American?

487
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,809
- Your father...
- From the jungle.

488
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:57,920
Father, you look like
a Hollywood movie star.

489
00:21:58,319 --> 00:21:59,319
Yes.

490
00:22:00,289 --> 00:22:01,749
He didn't react much.

491
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:06,690
I am from Piura, in the north of Peru.

492
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:08,729
- Buran?
- Piura.

493
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:10,600
- Beach.
- Beach?

494
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,630
Yes. Mancora Beach.

495
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:16,370
- Beach.
- It's by the sea.

496
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,569
(They don't know what else to say.)

497
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,640
What is this?

498
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:26,910
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask.

499
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,279
We'll translate for you.

500
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:31,350
We couldn't hold a conversation,
so they translated for us.

501
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:32,749
Yes.

502
00:22:32,749 --> 00:22:34,420
They didn't expect us to be that terrible.

503
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,420
I see.

504
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:39,019
Have any outsiders been here before?

505
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,489
Normally, they tour the Amazon
for a few days.

506
00:22:46,029 --> 00:22:49,640
(They normally camp in the jungle.)

507
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:51,739
They rarely have people sleeping over
at their place.

508
00:22:51,739 --> 00:22:53,140
They hunt and stuff.

509
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:56,180
I have a small group...

510
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:59,580
for expeditions.
And they go to different places.

511
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,249
Because of COVID-19,
they took a big blow as well.

512
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:04,850
Tourists didn't come.

513
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,819
It's been a while since they had tourists,
so I think they were being considerate.

514
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:08,890
I see.

515
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:13,259
(The dinner gets ready
with warm consideration.)

516
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,059
(Take out the rice wrapped
in banana leaves.)

517
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:20,870
That's their most common food.
They cook it with Banana leaves.

518
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,100
It's steamed rice.

519
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,440
Piranha.

520
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,170
(Grilled piranha they caught just now)

521
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,979
(Add deep-fried pirarucu.)

522
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,410
It looks good.

523
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,049
(A meal of the Amazon is completed.)

524
00:23:34,979 --> 00:23:37,920
- Father, you first.
- Yes, Father.

525
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,549
- Grandmother.
- Grandmother.

526
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,160
Grandmother.

527
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,959
(Thank you.)

528
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,559
(From Grandmother to the baby,)

529
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,900
(everyone has dinner together.)

530
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:52,360
Thank you.

531
00:23:52,969 --> 00:23:54,100
(Taking a bite)

532
00:23:57,799 --> 00:23:59,870
(He picks up the whole piranha.)

533
00:24:00,610 --> 00:24:02,110
(Taking a big bite)

534
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,380
You released a lot of them just now
saying you pitied them.

535
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,380
Exactly.

536
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,549
He looks as if he'd eat down to the bones.

537
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:11,549
Piranha tastes good.

538
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,719
Si Eon, try this.

539
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:17,319
Mine doesn't have much meat.

540
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:18,590
It doesn't have meat.

541
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:19,930
(Rummaging through for a long time)

542
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,590
(Little bit)

543
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,100
(He sure is a city man who eats a little.)

544
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,739
(He changes to pirarucu.)

545
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,069
- This is good.
- It's good.

546
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:36,180
Pirarucu...
Normally, fish meat crumples easily.

547
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:39,110
This is bouncy like pork.

548
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,209
It's chewy.

549
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,479
(Shaking)

550
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,319
What's that white stuff?

551
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:46,989
What's that?

552
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,249
Salad.

553
00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:50,959
- This is salad.
- Salad.

554
00:24:51,789 --> 00:24:53,360
- Palm.
- Palm tree stem?

555
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,430
- Take this.
- Thank you.

556
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,069
It's like noodles.
And you add sauce onto it.

557
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:02,700
- Like salad.
- Yes. That's salad.

558
00:25:03,739 --> 00:25:05,299
I wonder what that tastes like.

559
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:07,039
You really eat it as if it's noodles.

560
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,269
It's really soft.

561
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,940
I thought it would feel like the bark
of a tree.

562
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,209
(Slurping)

563
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,209
That was good.

564
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,249
Keep eating this.

565
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:19,180
- Si Eon is almost...
- What's that?

566
00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:21,789
What's that on his hair?

567
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:22,819
It's a moth.

568
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:24,059
I didn't know.

569
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:25,690
You've become a local.

570
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,259
You need more rice? Here.

571
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:30,799
(No and yes)

572
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:33,870
(The Amazon-customized prodigy
eats everything well.)

573
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:35,670
(Satisfied)

574
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:38,140
Look at that.

575
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:40,009
Yes?

576
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:42,910
Is that liquor? Makgeolli?

577
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,979
Whiskey?

578
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:47,779
- Whiskey? No whiskey?
- No.

579
00:25:48,709 --> 00:25:50,479
It's our typical food.

580
00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:52,319
It's a drink.

581
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:53,620
- Drink.
- Drink.

582
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,819
- Alcohol?
- No.

583
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,190
It's a traditional drink
we drink often in Peru.

584
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,360
It's called masato.

585
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,160
- Masato.
- Masato.

586
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:07,799
(Masato is
a Peruvian traditional drink...)

587
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:08,999
- Yuca.
- Yuca.

588
00:26:08,999 --> 00:26:10,769
(made by boiling yuca,
a common root vegetable in South America.)

589
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,769
- It looks like makgeolli.
- Yes.

590
00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:15,870
If you leave it long enough,
it becomes like makgeolli.

591
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,180
I see.

592
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,610
I saw this in a documentary.

593
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,680
- Really?
- I saw this on "National Geographic."

594
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:23,019
Thank you.

595
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,690
(Drinking)

596
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,360
It tastes like yogurt.

597
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:32,620
Thank you.

598
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:36,959
(He pours it full and takes a sip.)

599
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:38,360
It brings back memories.

600
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,630
It tastes like yogurt mixed with coconut.

601
00:26:42,069 --> 00:26:43,539
That was delicious.

602
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:46,940
The bug is still on my hair.

603
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,870
It's living on your hair.

604
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,009
(It has become one with him already.)

605
00:26:52,979 --> 00:26:54,049
You know,

606
00:26:55,350 --> 00:26:58,580
it's been a very long time
since I was invited to a family's meal.

607
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,090
I always eat alone.

608
00:27:01,249 --> 00:27:03,459
My relatives' house is in Yeoju.

609
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:05,390
But that house is...

610
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:10,799
a very old-fashioned house. So...

611
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:13,269
It was a house with a furnace.

612
00:27:13,969 --> 00:27:16,370
The kitchen was made of dirt too.

613
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,299
So things felt similar to me.

614
00:27:20,009 --> 00:27:23,140
It reminded me a lot of when I was young.

615
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,979
(The meal reminded him of his childhood.)

616
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,009
- Have another dish.
- I already did.

617
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,989
You know Korean idols?

618
00:27:36,259 --> 00:27:38,090
(He randomly starts looking
for similarities.)

619
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:39,789
BTS?

620
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:40,860
Yes, BTS.

621
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,229
You know BTS?

622
00:27:42,229 --> 00:27:43,830
Si Eon,
aren't you close with one of the members?

623
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:49,100
He has a lot of Korean superstar friends.

624
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,940
Many of them.

625
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,700
(He means Si Eon is close with idols.)

626
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,809
Idol.

627
00:27:53,809 --> 00:27:55,509
Do you know Korean...

628
00:27:57,779 --> 00:27:59,549
- BLACKPINK?
- Yes.

629
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:01,709
BLACKPINK, BTS.

630
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,350
(Oh, right!)

631
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,150
Jennie is my friend.

632
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:07,289
What?

633
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:09,559
- What do you mean?
- Are you talking about MINO?

634
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:11,789
Really.

635
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:16,130
Last time, I did a video call with Jennie.

636
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:18,799
(When he camped with MINO,)

637
00:28:19,569 --> 00:28:21,870
Who is it? What's happening?

638
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:24,739
(he had an honorable video call
with Jennie.)

639
00:28:24,739 --> 00:28:26,469
(I'll root for you. I'm your big fan.)

640
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,069
She's already a friend to me.

641
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:31,180
(Even after then...)

642
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,910
(My phone friend)

643
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:36,009
(His love as a fan was revealed
in South America.)

644
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:37,380
I'm sorry.

645
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:39,850
How many times did you say that?

646
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:41,690
(He was so proud of himself for it.)

647
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,690
- She doesn't believe it.
- She didn't believe it.

648
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:50,160
We are, together, we...

649
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,600
You treated us.

650
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,569
(Treated?)

651
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:59,299
So I want to draw a picture for them
as a present.

652
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,769
Good, thank you.

653
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,979
I had nothing else to do for them.

654
00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:06,009
That was nice.

655
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:07,910
Are you going to draw the family?

656
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:09,950
It will be too tough
to draw all the family members.

657
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,680
Should I draw Father...

658
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:13,120
or Grandmother?

659
00:29:13,249 --> 00:29:15,150
- Grandmother?
- Grandmother?

660
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:19,890
Should I draw one
for the daughter as well?

661
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,090
(He already made up his mind.)

662
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,029
You...

663
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,969
Drawing present...

664
00:29:26,969 --> 00:29:28,529
I'll draw you.

665
00:29:28,969 --> 00:29:30,670
- Me? Yes.
- You?

666
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,969
- Okay.
- Draw her.

667
00:29:34,239 --> 00:29:36,170
(He passes him a notebook they use
at home.)

668
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,809
Thank you very much.

669
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,249
(With a special model)

670
00:29:40,249 --> 00:29:42,279
In a way, she is Generation MZ...

671
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:43,719
of Peru.

672
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:45,680
She's Generation MZ of Peru.

673
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,219
You wanted to draw Generation MZ of Peru.

674
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:49,860
- When I see youths like her,
- Generation MZ of the Amazon.

675
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,019
I want to root for them...

676
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,489
because they will have
to enter the real world soon.

677
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,799
Look here.

678
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,029
She might feel awkward
if she looks into my eyes.

679
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:03,569
(She stares as she is instructed.)

680
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:04,600
Oh, gosh.

681
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,840
- Are you okay?
- Okay.

682
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,180
(Fidgeting)

683
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,549
(Blinking)

684
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:17,880
Why are you so nervous?

685
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:22,049
I'm shy.

686
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:24,819
(Sighing)

687
00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:28,590
(He tries again.)

688
00:30:30,499 --> 00:30:32,130
(Clenching his eyes shut)

689
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:33,930
- I can't draw.
- Why?

690
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:36,069
I feel awkward whenever our eyes meet.

691
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,069
He's so shy about it.

692
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,870
The daughter is so nonchalant.

693
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,469
I'm shy.

694
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,680
Very difficult face.

695
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:52,620
Beautiful.

696
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,590
Because you're beautiful,

697
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:58,019
it's difficult.

698
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,620
Please translate.

699
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,690
It's hard to draw her
because she's pretty.

700
00:31:02,989 --> 00:31:05,729
He says it's hard to draw you
because you're pretty.

701
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:08,269
(Grinning)

702
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:09,299
She likes it.

703
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,509
(Laughing)

704
00:31:14,969 --> 00:31:17,479
I'm sorry.

705
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:18,509
(It's fun to watch.)

706
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:20,180
So I'm sorry.

707
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:22,110
(Shy)

708
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,319
Gosh, her throat must feel dry too.

709
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:27,519
Are you done eating?

710
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,660
- Yes, thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

711
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,090
- Draw quickly.
- I'm shy.

712
00:31:33,229 --> 00:31:35,860
Let me collect myself first.

713
00:31:35,959 --> 00:31:38,259
I'm not in my right mind
because I just ate.

714
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:39,299
(He'll draw next time
after collecting himself.)

715
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,469
Who is she?

716
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,910
- She's Mother.
- She's Mother?

717
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,309
(She is Eric's mother?)

718
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:50,680
She's not.

719
00:31:50,739 --> 00:31:52,509
She's not. Mother's over there.

720
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:53,680
You're right.

721
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,690
Does Father have two wives?

722
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,160
Their culture is different from ours.

723
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,930
(What is she doing?)

724
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,660
This is masato.

725
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,799
Masato.

726
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,400
That day was the day for making masato.

727
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,799
They drink it all the time like water.

728
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:19,870
- They drink masato like that?
- Yes, they need to drink all the time.

729
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,940
These are a cleanly-washed mortar...

730
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:26,309
and yuca, washed and boiled once.

731
00:32:26,309 --> 00:32:27,749
Yuca.

732
00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:30,749
When you boil it,
the texture becomes like potato.

733
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,749
You boil it once before crushing it.

734
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:38,289
Come to think of it, you boil rice once
before making makgeolli as well.

735
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:41,660
You need to boil it to ferment it.

736
00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:44,259
- If you don't, it won't ferment.
- You're right, for fermentation...

737
00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:45,299
(The process is rather similar.)

738
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,209
I'll do it.

739
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:55,110
- He'll do it.
- It must be hard.

740
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:59,009
This is pretty tough.

741
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,019
(Scraping)

742
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:10,059
(She puts it into her mouth.)

743
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:11,519
Is that how you eat it?

744
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,029
It's like...

745
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,700
She's eating a lot.

746
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,130
- She must be hungry.
- She must've been starving.

747
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,739
- Why is she eating?
- She keeps eating.

748
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,170
(She munches...)

749
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,539
(then spits it out.)

750
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,840
(Spitting it out)

751
00:33:48,709 --> 00:33:49,779
She...

752
00:33:52,979 --> 00:33:54,019
Really?

753
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,120
(They're at a loss for words.)

754
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,759
(Shocked)

755
00:34:03,489 --> 00:34:04,529
(Innocent)

756
00:34:04,529 --> 00:34:05,630
No way.

757
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,469
That's how they ferment it.

758
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:12,969
No.

759
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,900
Yes. I watched this...

760
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,110
on "National Geographic."

761
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:19,709
(You really spit it?)

762
00:34:20,509 --> 00:34:21,539
Yes.

763
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,749
Really?

764
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:25,779
The city man is shocked.

765
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:30,390
She's really keeping it in her mouth.

766
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:34,319
Of course.
She ferments it in her mouth first.

767
00:34:34,759 --> 00:34:37,190
That's what we drank?

768
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,100
(Masato they drank 10 minutes ago)

769
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,430
They drank a lot.

770
00:34:42,769 --> 00:34:44,999
It tastes like yogurt.

771
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:48,769
That's what we drank?

772
00:34:48,769 --> 00:34:49,809
(The secret to the taste is revealed.)

773
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,410
That's right.

774
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,610
It's rude to do that.

775
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,249
(Chewing)

776
00:34:56,309 --> 00:34:57,309
(Spitting)

777
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,519
You chew it to ferment the drink.

778
00:35:03,989 --> 00:35:05,049
That's right.

779
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:07,819
Yes, that's the wisdom of life for them.

780
00:35:07,819 --> 00:35:09,330
(The wisdom of life
that was passed down to them)

781
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:11,390
This requires a lot of work.

782
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:14,299
(Still, it's too hard for me
to accept it.)

783
00:35:14,299 --> 00:35:16,029
Your reaction is so funny.

784
00:35:16,029 --> 00:35:20,039
I didn't expect her
to spit out what she was chewing.

785
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,709
Masato... Gosh.

786
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:25,739
It's a culture shock, honestly.

787
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,039
I liked it.

788
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:31,450
It's worth trying once.

789
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:38,149
(The fermenting factory operates nonstop.)

790
00:35:38,149 --> 00:35:42,589
If you keep it without chewing it,

791
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,460
it will rot.

792
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,830
Instead, we brush our teeth cleanly
before chewing.

793
00:35:53,399 --> 00:35:55,200
(The city man has a hard time adjusting
to the cultural difference.)

794
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,469
(Devastated)

795
00:35:56,469 --> 00:35:58,270
(Laughing)

796
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:00,509
That's rude, Si Eon.
What does that make Mother?

797
00:36:00,509 --> 00:36:01,810
Keep quiet.

798
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,750
She's not Mother.

799
00:36:04,109 --> 00:36:05,680
Mother is over there.

800
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,180
Then she must be the aunt.

801
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:08,950
She's their aunt.

802
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,390
- Aunt.
- I told you she was their aunt.

803
00:36:11,189 --> 00:36:13,919
(Auntie that lives next to Eric's house)

804
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:15,589
What's more fascinating is...

805
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:17,560
that she's the only one who can make it
in that town.

806
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,560
(She is the only one
who can make masato in this town.)

807
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,730
(Instead of mother's touch,
it's Auntie's mouth.)

808
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,230
What's with "Auntie's mouth?"

809
00:36:24,129 --> 00:36:27,899
Do you have to eat all of this?

810
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,810
(Eating)

811
00:36:29,810 --> 00:36:31,270
- All?
- All?

812
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:37,779
We ferment a fully-chewed dough.

813
00:36:37,779 --> 00:36:39,250
To chew all of that...

814
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:41,219
Imagine how hard it is for her.

815
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:42,379
(Mix sugar to the dough and ferment it,
and it's done.)

816
00:36:42,379 --> 00:36:44,189
Right, they add sugar in it.

817
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:50,689
(After that...)

818
00:36:50,689 --> 00:36:52,160
(Staring intensely)

819
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,100
(The memory of masato will remain...)

820
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,830
(as an intense one.)

821
00:37:00,399 --> 00:37:01,399
(Sighing)

822
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,739
(The strong impression lingers.)

823
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,210
It must be so hard for Auntie.
Look at her sweating.

824
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:10,379
(Sweating buckets)

825
00:37:10,549 --> 00:37:12,350
We need to be thankful when drinking this.

826
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,980
(After watching her make it
with a lot of effort,)

827
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:17,020
(he works up the courage
and takes another sip.)

828
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,960
Drinking after knowing this...
It is a bit tough.

829
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,500
(It's a bit tough to eat it
now that I know how it's made.)

830
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,029
All right. Let's bring out the masato
we brought and give it out.

831
00:37:30,899 --> 00:37:31,969
There's masato?

832
00:37:32,739 --> 00:37:35,169
I saw the producer spitting
something out earlier from upstairs.

833
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,540
- I saw him constantly chewing something.
- Right.

834
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,439
I don't think he's an expert.

835
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,839
If you want to try it, call us.

836
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,580
- We'll go and chew it for you.
- Really?

837
00:37:45,509 --> 00:37:47,480
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

838
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,549
- Thank you for the food.
- Sure.

839
00:37:49,419 --> 00:37:51,989
(They're checking the remaining budget.)

840
00:37:51,989 --> 00:37:54,359
Hey, do you want me to tell you
tomorrow's schedule again?

841
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:56,489
Wait. Did you actually plan our trip?

842
00:37:56,489 --> 00:37:57,930
I only planned one thing for now.

843
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,430
What did you plan?

844
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,299
I planned on riding a motorcycle.

845
00:38:01,299 --> 00:38:02,460
- I wanted to do that abroad.
- Okay.

846
00:38:03,969 --> 00:38:05,430
We have to make two transfers.

847
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,739
(He looked up plane tickets at home.)

848
00:38:06,739 --> 00:38:08,969
We can rent motorcycles there.

849
00:38:11,509 --> 00:38:13,580
(Si Eon planned this activity himself.)

850
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:16,850
(Riding a motorcycle in Cusco)

851
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,020
Going on a motorcycle tour
while traveling overseas...

852
00:38:20,419 --> 00:38:23,120
was my biggest wish...

853
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,620
just like Kian84 wanted
to come to the Amazon.

854
00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:28,589
(Si Eon enjoyed driving motorcycles
only in Korea.)

855
00:38:28,589 --> 00:38:30,730
I used to drive that back in the day.

856
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:36,330
(Will he be able to fulfill his wish
of riding a motorcycle abroad?)

857
00:38:36,969 --> 00:38:41,469
Si Eon only thought about
riding the motorcycle. Seriously.

858
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:42,640
- That's the only thing I wanted to do.
- Right.

859
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,839
- That was the most important goal.
- Just that.

860
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,580
- And it was my dream.
- Right.

861
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:49,779
Anyway, when we get up in the morning,

862
00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:51,180
we'll go back to the airport.
The same airport we landed at.

863
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,080
Then we'll take the plane
to go to Cusco from Lima?

864
00:38:54,549 --> 00:38:55,620
Yes.

865
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:57,450
We'll arrive in Cusco tomorrow.

866
00:38:57,649 --> 00:38:59,319
- We'll get our lodging there.
- Okay.

867
00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:01,620
- We'll take a day to regroup ourselves.
- Okay.

868
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,589
We really need to rest up.
Or we could cause accidents the next day.

869
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,600
I'll be fine.

870
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,870
- That was around 8 p.m.
- I see.

871
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:12,899
I have a T-shirt.
So let me know if you need it.

872
00:39:12,899 --> 00:39:13,899
Okay.

873
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,069
It's pretty late.
Why don't you sleep here tonight?

874
00:39:19,069 --> 00:39:20,509
Really? Can we?

875
00:39:20,509 --> 00:39:21,509
Yes. You can sleep here.

876
00:39:21,509 --> 00:39:23,410
- But there's nothing we can do for them.
- Of course.

877
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:24,410
(Pondering)

878
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:25,509
Okay?

879
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,719
(Their stuff is at the lodging
where he extended his stay.)

880
00:39:30,819 --> 00:39:31,819
Okay?

881
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:34,020
- One minute.
- Thank you.

882
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,390
That's... Si Eon. What was his name?

883
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:37,560
- Eric.
- Eric?

884
00:39:39,189 --> 00:39:41,759
(He turns on Kian TV
after pondering for a moment.)

885
00:39:42,629 --> 00:39:45,969
Everyone, we're in the Amazon now.

886
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,509
We were just going to fish
and swim for a bit.

887
00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:51,969
But he said he would let us crash
at his house for one night.

888
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:53,509
So we'll sleep here tonight.

889
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,810
His family is here.
So we'll try to stay out of their hair.

890
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,649
I hope we can have a good time
before going back.

891
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,219
Sleeping over there
wasn't part of the tour.

892
00:40:04,219 --> 00:40:06,489
Right. They have their own privacy too.

893
00:40:06,489 --> 00:40:08,589
- Right. They're so kind.
- Yes.

894
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:13,560
- I feel awful staying here, though.
- Gosh.

895
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,669
Should we do something for them
for letting us sleep here tonight?

896
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,700
Yes. Shouldn't we help them or something?

897
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,399
- You must have felt bad.
- Is there anything we can do for them?

898
00:40:24,939 --> 00:40:26,580
(They will be returning the kindness
tomorrow morning.)

899
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,109
- Did you help them with the chores?
- Gosh.

900
00:40:28,109 --> 00:40:29,779
- My legs. Gosh.
- You should.

901
00:40:29,779 --> 00:40:31,710
(An Amazon way of paying for the lodging)

902
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:37,189
Then yesterday,

903
00:40:37,189 --> 00:40:39,719
I shouldn't have extended my stay
at the lodging.

904
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,730
- Hammocks. Yes?
- Thank you.

905
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:46,129
- I'll set them up for you.
- Thank you.

906
00:40:46,129 --> 00:40:48,000
Since there aren't any beds,
they will sleep on the hammocks.

907
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,460
Hammocks?

908
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,600
Hammocks. I see.

909
00:40:52,969 --> 00:40:55,469
Gosh. This is a great experience.

910
00:40:56,469 --> 00:40:58,310
But I've never slept on hammocks before.

911
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:03,009
(Hang both ends of the hammocks
on the ceiling.)

912
00:41:03,009 --> 00:41:04,710
(And then it's done.)

913
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:08,080
(Amazed)

914
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:11,489
What's the name of this?

915
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:13,819
Hammocks.
How many times do we have to tell you?

916
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,160
- Hamburgers?
- Let me lie down here.

917
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,859
- Hamburgers?
- Hammocks.

918
00:41:18,859 --> 00:41:20,160
(Trying out the hammock
for the first time)

919
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,200
Hammocks.

920
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,500
(Surprised)

921
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,700
- Good?
- I've seen that.

922
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,469
Good. It was really comfortable.
I'm serious.

923
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:30,169
- And this is so spacious.
- Right. It stretched a lot.

924
00:41:30,169 --> 00:41:31,969
- Is it comfortable?
- It's so comfortable.

925
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,580
It's comfortable,

926
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,350
but I still need to get used to it.

927
00:41:39,950 --> 00:41:42,180
(The younger one lies down
just like the older one.)

928
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,560
(Feeling uncomfortable)

929
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:48,660
Are we supposed to sleep like this?

930
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:51,660
It's sort of bending a lot for you, right?

931
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,529
- Right. I see.
- Then move up a bit.

932
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,529
I should move up.

933
00:41:56,529 --> 00:41:57,830
- I just heard it rip.
- Gosh.

934
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:00,299
- Goodness.
- Wait. This...

935
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:01,839
(Wriggling)

936
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:02,939
Like this.

937
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:07,779
By the way, I've never slept
in a hammock like this before.

938
00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:09,640
Hey, let me know
if you need a pillow. I have that too.

939
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,509
But Si Eon,
my body is at a 90-degree angle.

940
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,989
- This...
- You need to move that up.

941
00:42:18,989 --> 00:42:20,060
I already moved up. Wait.

942
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,319
- You mean I should raise the hammock?
- Yes.

943
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:23,189
You need to raise it and spread it out.

944
00:42:23,189 --> 00:42:24,290
- Okay.
- Like mine.

945
00:42:24,489 --> 00:42:26,290
I should raise it later.

946
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:27,730
(It's not easy to sleep in a hammock.)

947
00:42:28,529 --> 00:42:30,370
Gosh. This is so comfortable.

948
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,830
- It was so comfortable.
- It's more comfortable than I thought.

949
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:36,569
We should get an early start tomorrow.
We should leave early.

950
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:38,509
First of all, as for tomorrow,

951
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:41,980
we'll be moving around a lot,
but let's rest up once we arrive.

952
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:42,980
Okay.

953
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,049
That way, we can drive the motorcycle.

954
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,310
Okay.

955
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:50,549
Let's go to sleep. Good job today.

956
00:42:51,419 --> 00:42:53,460
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

957
00:42:53,759 --> 00:42:56,060
Gosh. I got to sleep properly
after three nights.

958
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,359
I bet you slept so well then.

959
00:42:58,189 --> 00:43:02,759
(Meanwhile, many stars have embroidered
the sky in the Amazon.)

960
00:43:05,399 --> 00:43:08,500
(Snoring)

961
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:14,109
(The two of them are sleeping soundly
while snoring away.)

962
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:21,450
(The sky slowly brightens.)

963
00:43:23,149 --> 00:43:26,120
(The sea of clouds springs up magically.)

964
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:31,689
(Busy movements of nature
signal the start of a day.)

965
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:36,730
(There's a rainbow in the sky.)

966
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:38,899
(And the kids are already up.)

967
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,739
(It's a bright morning in the Amazon.)

968
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:45,210
(They're still sleeping
at 90-degree angles.)

969
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:47,239
(Opening)

970
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,410
(Flinching)

971
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,520
(He gets up with a stiff body.)

972
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,649
- Hi.
- Hello.

973
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:00,790
(Groaning)

974
00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:05,489
(He escapes the hammock
with some difficulty.)

975
00:44:05,989 --> 00:44:07,029
(Squirming)

976
00:44:07,029 --> 00:44:08,560
Oddly, it got cold during the night.

977
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,830
(Peeking)

978
00:44:11,469 --> 00:44:12,770
Kian84, let's get up.

979
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:14,370
What? I'm up.

980
00:44:16,509 --> 00:44:19,210
(Wiggling)

981
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:22,640
I should brush my teeth.

982
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:25,379
My breath stinks.

983
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:28,819
(I slept so well.)

984
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,350
I should brush my teeth.

985
00:44:33,859 --> 00:44:34,890
- Si Eon.
- Yes?

986
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,060
- We only have one, right?
- Yes.

987
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:37,830
- Can I get the toothpaste?
- Okay.

988
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:42,629
(Smelling)

989
00:44:42,629 --> 00:44:44,129
(Rubbing)

990
00:44:45,129 --> 00:44:47,469
(The socks pass the test
and are worn again.)

991
00:44:48,299 --> 00:44:50,410
(He borrows the toothpaste...)

992
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:52,339
(and puts it in his mouth.)

993
00:44:52,939 --> 00:44:55,379
(Spreading)

994
00:44:56,379 --> 00:44:57,850
(He's done
once he rinses it with the water.)

995
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:58,980
Oh, my gosh.

996
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,719
Hello.

997
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:05,089
(He films in the morning
after washing up.)

998
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:11,460
We slept in the owner's room for a night.

999
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,859
There weren't a lot of bugs in here.

1000
00:45:14,859 --> 00:45:16,129
There weren't any bugs.

1001
00:45:16,129 --> 00:45:18,730
It was comfortable to sleep here.

1002
00:45:19,799 --> 00:45:21,040
But the problem is...

1003
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:23,569
the rooster.

1004
00:45:23,569 --> 00:45:24,609
Was it you?

1005
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,779
It wasn't dawn.

1006
00:45:27,239 --> 00:45:30,779
This crazy rooster kept crying all night.

1007
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:34,319
(The problematic night)

1008
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,549
(Cock-a-doodle-doo)

1009
00:45:37,549 --> 00:45:40,390
- It kept crying when we were sleeping.
- Gosh.

1010
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:43,660
(The rooster didn't rest
when it was pitch-dark outside.)

1011
00:45:44,129 --> 00:45:46,359
Gosh. That crazy rooster.

1012
00:45:47,629 --> 00:45:48,759
"Crazy rooster."

1013
00:45:48,759 --> 00:45:50,399
(Getting up)

1014
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,569
(He couldn't hold it back anymore
and got up to inspect it.)

1015
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:56,140
(Rattling)

1016
00:45:56,370 --> 00:45:59,040
The rooster crossed the line
it shouldn't have.

1017
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,580
Roosters don't cry late at night.

1018
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:03,180
It just cried when it wanted to.

1019
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,480
Right.

1020
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,450
I went out to make it quiet.

1021
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:08,980
But the dogs...

1022
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,589
They snarled at me.

1023
00:46:10,589 --> 00:46:11,649
(Snarling)

1024
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:14,419
I saw two pairs of eyes gleam at night.

1025
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,060
I was scared, so I came up.

1026
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,189
Then the rooster cried again.

1027
00:46:18,189 --> 00:46:20,660
(Cock-a-doodle-doo)

1028
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:23,669
I kept waking up and falling asleep.

1029
00:46:23,669 --> 00:46:25,370
That's how I slept.

1030
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:27,569
(Boohoo.)

1031
00:46:27,939 --> 00:46:30,439
- Which one was it?
- That rooster.

1032
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:33,069
- I can shove sticky rice in your...
- Hey.

1033
00:46:33,069 --> 00:46:35,080
- Which one was it?
- I think it was this one.

1034
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:37,549
Seriously. Consider yourself lucky.

1035
00:46:37,549 --> 00:46:39,549
Gosh. I couldn't sleep
because of that rooster.

1036
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,419
(They are chasing away the rooster.)

1037
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:45,890
(Eric is doing a house chore.)

1038
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:48,890
(They start their day
as they retrieve the net.)

1039
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:52,060
We spread out a small net last night.

1040
00:46:52,759 --> 00:46:54,359
- In the morning? Now?
- Yes.

1041
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,600
They're alive.

1042
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:57,730
(Freshly caught fish)

1043
00:46:57,730 --> 00:46:59,230
He must have caught them now.

1044
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,339
A sardine.

1045
00:47:01,069 --> 00:47:02,239
Good, right?

1046
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:05,239
How do you ask him if he needs any help?

1047
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:08,109
Don't ask me.

1048
00:47:08,109 --> 00:47:09,609
(We should do something in return.)

1049
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:16,480
(Surprised at the sight of the machete)

1050
00:47:17,219 --> 00:47:18,819
- A machete?
- Yes.

1051
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:21,290
Colombia.

1052
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:22,359
(I see. This is a machete.)

1053
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:24,390
Do you want to come to the farm?

1054
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,189
Sure.

1055
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:28,830
Let's help them with the morning chore.

1056
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:29,859
(They head out to Eric's farm together.)

1057
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:33,129
(In this vibrant rainforest
of the Amazon River...)

1058
00:47:33,129 --> 00:47:34,169
How beautiful.

1059
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:37,009
(Nature is preserved in Eric's farm.)

1060
00:47:37,009 --> 00:47:38,140
This is so beautiful.

1061
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:39,910
Amazing.

1062
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:43,750
(Surprised)

1063
00:47:44,850 --> 00:47:46,950
(A bicycle?)

1064
00:47:47,149 --> 00:47:49,980
She's on her way to school. To study.

1065
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,589
- School?
- Yes. School.

1066
00:47:52,589 --> 00:47:55,089
- School?
- Yes.

1067
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:56,830
- I see.
- School.

1068
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:59,089
- She was a student.
- Gosh. She was going to Eric's farm?

1069
00:47:59,089 --> 00:48:00,799
- No.
- There's a school?

1070
00:48:00,799 --> 00:48:03,029
- There's a school.
- I see.

1071
00:48:03,029 --> 00:48:05,370
She was riding the bicycle to school.
That was around 6 a.m.

1072
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:06,399
(She went to school at 6 a.m.)

1073
00:48:06,469 --> 00:48:09,500
Gosh. I went to my relative's house
in the countryside...

1074
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,710
when I was in elementary school.

1075
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:13,609
My cousin used to go to school
on a trail like this.

1076
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:15,810
He took this kind of trail to school?

1077
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:17,580
It was unpaved back then.

1078
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,750
It reminded me of the Amazon in a way.

1079
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,049
No, Kian84. Things weren't
this underdeveloped when we were young.

1080
00:48:23,049 --> 00:48:25,049
- But my relative's house...
- Were there trees like that?

1081
00:48:25,049 --> 00:48:27,390
No, listen.
When I went to my relative's house,

1082
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:28,859
it was like this.

1083
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,489
The bus ran every four hours.

1084
00:48:31,189 --> 00:48:34,259
I went to school while walking
on the grass with morning dew.

1085
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,560
(What's he talking about?)

1086
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,370
It's shocking that
you don't seem to understand this.

1087
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:41,700
I'm sorry, but I'm a city man.

1088
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,169
Right. That's surprising.

1089
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,339
(He looks around the Amazon
with this city man.)

1090
00:48:46,339 --> 00:48:47,939
Bananas.

1091
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:49,310
Bananas.

1092
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:52,250
Kian84, isn't this cotton?

1093
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:53,480
It really is cotton.

1094
00:48:53,919 --> 00:48:56,890
(Eric demonstrates
how to use the machete.)

1095
00:48:58,149 --> 00:49:01,089
Gosh. This is sharper than the trimmer.

1096
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:02,989
My back hurt more.

1097
00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:04,689
(They start to cut down the grass
with Eric.)

1098
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,600
(Clean)

1099
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,759
- In one swing.
- That's a trimmer.

1100
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,469
This is no joke.

1101
00:49:13,669 --> 00:49:15,169
(He pulls something out
after cutting the grass.)

1102
00:49:15,169 --> 00:49:16,299
That's the root.

1103
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,239
(The root of the yuca is revealed.)

1104
00:49:20,109 --> 00:49:22,040
(Shaking)

1105
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,410
That's yuca.

1106
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:26,980
- They are root plants.
- Not to damage the roots.

1107
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:30,649
(Not to lose out to him,
Kian84 shows amazing power.)

1108
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:34,759
(They carry the crops on their shoulders.)

1109
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:38,230
- Okay, let's go home.
- Okay.

1110
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:40,399
We're doing a lot of cardio this morning
on an empty stomach.

1111
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:46,870
(They return home with yuca.)

1112
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,810
- We bring yuca for masato.
- Wait.

1113
00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:51,870
This is so long.

1114
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:55,109
(He groans as he's exhausted.)

1115
00:49:55,609 --> 00:49:57,109
We should have gotten more.

1116
00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:01,379
(Dirty)

1117
00:50:01,919 --> 00:50:04,950
(To chase away the heat,
he pours a bucket of water on him.)

1118
00:50:06,219 --> 00:50:08,290
(Dirty)

1119
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:11,259
(Rubbing)

1120
00:50:13,859 --> 00:50:14,899
This is cool.

1121
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,500
(He has a sip of water
after digging out the yuca.)

1122
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:28,509
Gosh. It was so tough to harvest the yuca.

1123
00:50:29,779 --> 00:50:31,049
That's not a one-man's job.

1124
00:50:33,850 --> 00:50:35,980
(Sprawling out)

1125
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,319
(His socks have turned dark.)

1126
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:41,489
Gosh. Living in the Amazon isn't easy.

1127
00:50:43,489 --> 00:50:45,790
(Packing)

1128
00:50:46,359 --> 00:50:49,230
Gosh. I don't have shorts in this big bag.

1129
00:50:49,759 --> 00:50:52,299
I'll cut out your pants with the machete.

1130
00:50:52,629 --> 00:50:53,669
- Kian84.
- Yes?

1131
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:57,609
I'm sorry. I don't want to live like you.

1132
00:50:57,710 --> 00:50:59,609
Then buy a pair.

1133
00:50:59,609 --> 00:51:00,879
(They started off the trip
very differently.)

1134
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,810
(As they chat in the room...)

1135
00:51:04,109 --> 00:51:06,310
(Sizzling)

1136
00:51:07,149 --> 00:51:10,450
(They are busy in the kitchen
cooking breakfast.)

1137
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:14,759
(Chopping)

1138
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,660
We'll have breakfast.

1139
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:20,859
- If you want some, come with me.
- Okay. Thank you.

1140
00:51:21,259 --> 00:51:23,230
- Hello.
- Hello.

1141
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:26,069
- Okay. We have...
- Yes.

1142
00:51:26,069 --> 00:51:27,399
fried eggs.

1143
00:51:27,569 --> 00:51:28,939
- Yes. That's an American breakfast.
- American breakfast.

1144
00:51:28,939 --> 00:51:30,540
- The city man must like that.
- Coffee.

1145
00:51:30,739 --> 00:51:33,140
- We have butter and bread too.
- Okay.

1146
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,580
And bananas.

1147
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:35,879
(It would be a shame
to leave out the bananas.)

1148
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,009
Okay. Dig in.

1149
00:51:38,009 --> 00:51:40,319
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1150
00:51:41,549 --> 00:51:45,890
We woke up and helped them at the farm.

1151
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,520
- And they cooked breakfast for us.
- One, two...

1152
00:51:48,219 --> 00:51:51,330
It's universal all over the world
that people have three meals a day.

1153
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:53,899
All right. I'll eat my breakfast now.

1154
00:51:55,299 --> 00:51:56,700
Eat a lot.

1155
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:00,939
(This city man is happy to see food
he's familiar with.)

1156
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,109
Sometimes,
they served hamburgers in the military.

1157
00:52:04,339 --> 00:52:07,080
I used to spread jam like this
on my burgers.

1158
00:52:07,609 --> 00:52:08,739
- Like this?
- Yes.

1159
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:09,910
Like this. And that's it.

1160
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:11,310
(The military-style burger in the Amazon)

1161
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:13,680
- That looks good.
- It was good.

1162
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,149
(The food in the Amazon
was shocking to this city man.)

1163
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,790
(Hesitant)

1164
00:52:21,259 --> 00:52:22,359
(Picking at his food)

1165
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,660
(Si Eon had a hard time
eating the local meals.)

1166
00:52:27,129 --> 00:52:28,759
It's been a while
since you enjoyed your food.

1167
00:52:28,759 --> 00:52:30,730
- That was my first meal.
- I'm glad.

1168
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,399
(Munching)

1169
00:52:35,969 --> 00:52:38,310
Hey, this is slightly refreshing.

1170
00:52:38,310 --> 00:52:39,310
- It's good.
- You know?

1171
00:52:40,739 --> 00:52:43,040
(The family is happy
to see him enjoy his food.)

1172
00:52:43,439 --> 00:52:45,109
It was really tasty.

1173
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,580
I'm glad.

1174
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,850
- I loved it.
- It was an American-style breakfast.

1175
00:52:47,850 --> 00:52:50,419
Right. I was wondering
if they cooked that for us.

1176
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:51,950
- But that's their typical breakfast.
- That's their breakfast.

1177
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:54,020
- That's their typical breakfast.
- That's what they eat for breakfast.

1178
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:56,089
(Enjoying the meal)

1179
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,430
(Chuckling)

1180
00:53:01,629 --> 00:53:03,060
(Why are they laughing?)

1181
00:53:06,399 --> 00:53:08,299
(A cup of masato)

1182
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:10,739
- I'm good.
- Me too.

1183
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:12,540
- I'm okay.
- I'm okay.

1184
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,379
- Okay.
- No, thanks.

1185
00:53:14,379 --> 00:53:15,410
Okay.

1186
00:53:15,879 --> 00:53:18,109
No. Do you want some more of this?

1187
00:53:19,049 --> 00:53:20,149
Why?

1188
00:53:20,149 --> 00:53:21,450
(He laughs it off to turn it down.)

1189
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:24,589
- He was the only one who cracked up.
- Why?

1190
00:53:24,589 --> 00:53:25,819
(Let me know if you want more.)

1191
00:53:26,049 --> 00:53:28,120
But we harvested a lot this morning.

1192
00:53:28,589 --> 00:53:31,390
Masato is their staple here.

1193
00:53:32,529 --> 00:53:35,830
I had fun yesterday.

1194
00:53:36,399 --> 00:53:38,100
We fished,

1195
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,640
screamed, and shook the canoe.

1196
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:43,770
It was so fun.

1197
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:45,870
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1198
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:47,939
Thank you.

1199
00:53:48,009 --> 00:53:50,279
You guys became close
after spending only one day.

1200
00:53:50,279 --> 00:53:52,810
Eric. You...

1201
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,120
Machete.

1202
00:53:56,279 --> 00:53:57,819
- An ax.
- An ax.

1203
00:53:57,890 --> 00:54:00,219
- That's "ax" in English.
- He said that in Korean.

1204
00:54:00,219 --> 00:54:01,989
- "Ax?"
- Yes.

1205
00:54:01,989 --> 00:54:04,060
You were bad at fishing.

1206
00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:05,759
(We weren't lucky that day.)

1207
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:07,299
I started to crack jokes.

1208
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,500
Tell him we should go fishing again. Go.

1209
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,529
(I can catch fish this time.)

1210
00:54:11,529 --> 00:54:12,569
Go.

1211
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:15,799
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1212
00:54:17,069 --> 00:54:18,109
Picture.

1213
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:22,009
Father. Picture together?

1214
00:54:22,279 --> 00:54:24,149
- Okay.
- Yes.

1215
00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:25,710
- Outside.
- Yes.

1216
00:54:26,009 --> 00:54:27,049
Go.

1217
00:54:27,049 --> 00:54:29,279
(As Eric's family doesn't have
a family picture,)

1218
00:54:30,419 --> 00:54:32,890
(Si Eon wants to take their family picture
with his instant camera.)

1219
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:33,989
Be careful.

1220
00:54:34,919 --> 00:54:35,919
Be careful.

1221
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:37,960
House in the back.

1222
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:39,359
House in the back?

1223
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,960
- House.
- House.

1224
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:43,500
(Stand in line here.)

1225
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,129
- Okay.
- Should they stand there?

1226
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:47,069
- So I get their house in the picture.
- Okay.

1227
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,370
- Right.
- It was an instant camera.

1228
00:54:51,009 --> 00:54:54,109
Hey, do you want to be in the photo too?

1229
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:55,779
I should be.

1230
00:54:55,779 --> 00:54:57,040
Don't ruin their family picture.

1231
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,379
- Let's take one for the family first.
- What?

1232
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,719
Okay.

1233
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,419
One, two...

1234
00:55:04,589 --> 00:55:05,850
(Clicking)

1235
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:08,219
- Okay.
- Stay.

1236
00:55:08,759 --> 00:55:10,359
- Okay. Come on.
- Kian84, get in the picture.

1237
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:12,489
- Let me join you.
- That was for us.

1238
00:55:12,489 --> 00:55:13,660
Right.

1239
00:55:13,759 --> 00:55:16,830
(Kian84 walks over
to take a picture with the family.)

1240
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:23,700
- You stood right next to her.
- One, two...

1241
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,069
- The spots...
- But you didn't draw her.

1242
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:27,109
three.

1243
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:28,239
(He met them in the Amazon by accident.)

1244
00:55:28,239 --> 00:55:30,140
- That's a great picture.
- That's a good picture.

1245
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,310
(But the family gave them
an unforgettable memory.)

1246
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:35,419
(Thanks for the family photo,
Uncle Si Eon.)

1247
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,549
- I'm glad you brought that.
- Yes.

1248
00:55:37,549 --> 00:55:38,819
- I'm so glad.
- Yes.

1249
00:55:38,819 --> 00:55:41,089
I had an instant camera
and a film camera too.

1250
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:42,890
You were fully prepared.

1251
00:55:43,859 --> 00:55:46,060
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1252
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:47,359
(They took pictures with the family.)

1253
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,160
I'll give it to you.

1254
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:52,200
Can you draw me?

1255
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,040
Okay.

1256
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,569
Okay.

1257
00:55:56,239 --> 00:55:58,439
She wants me to draw her.
I promised last night.

1258
00:55:58,439 --> 00:55:59,509
Okay?

1259
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:01,339
(He confidently grabbed his pen to draw.)

1260
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:02,939
(Tell her...)

1261
00:56:02,939 --> 00:56:04,850
(that it's hard to draw her
because she's pretty.)

1262
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,750
(The portrait drawing class
was postponed.)

1263
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,020
- She must have looked forward to it.
- Right.

1264
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,080
Okay.

1265
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,290
(Artist Kian84 grabs a log.)

1266
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:12,520
I'm nervous.

1267
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:16,660
You sit here.

1268
00:56:18,689 --> 00:56:19,730
Okay.

1269
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:22,330
What's that? A spoon?

1270
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,770
I didn't have a drawing board.
So I used that instead.

1271
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:27,600
(He sits down right in front of her.)

1272
00:56:28,439 --> 00:56:30,540
(Flapping his lips)

1273
00:56:32,109 --> 00:56:34,239
Okay. You look there.

1274
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:37,850
(He gives it another try to draw Sharon.)

1275
00:56:38,879 --> 00:56:40,109
(Drawing)

1276
00:56:41,279 --> 00:56:43,319
(He only has a piece of paper
and a pencil.)

1277
00:56:43,819 --> 00:56:45,950
(But he's fully focused.)

1278
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:48,589
(Last night,
they went out to pick off bananas.)

1279
00:56:48,589 --> 00:56:52,759
There are a lot of snakes at night.
So be careful when you walk.

1280
00:56:52,759 --> 00:56:54,460
- She told you to be careful.
- Okay.

1281
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,700
In Korea... Snakes...

1282
00:56:56,930 --> 00:56:59,600
Me... Young...

1283
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:01,439
- Country...
- "Mi Young?"

1284
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,069
- Or Young Mi?
- He said names. Mi Young and Young Mi.

1285
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:05,669
"I lived in the countryside
when I was young."

1286
00:57:05,669 --> 00:57:08,009
- I see. When you were young.
- I see.

1287
00:57:08,009 --> 00:57:09,980
Gosh. That long sentence
turned into two words?

1288
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:11,210
Yes, it did.

1289
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:16,279
(They weren't able to communicate...)

1290
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:18,120
Right here.

1291
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,549
(But they formed a friendship
while picking off the bananas at night.)

1292
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:22,390
Gosh. I bet you won
like 200 brownie points with Sharon.

1293
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:27,230
(He draws Sharon's face with care.)

1294
00:57:27,799 --> 00:57:29,899
(As a model,
she concentrates on her posture.)

1295
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:31,899
(Scratching)

1296
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:34,239
(Scratching)

1297
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,640
(They keep...)

1298
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:38,710
(scratching themselves.)

1299
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:41,339
(They scratch themselves everywhere
while facing each other.)

1300
00:57:41,879 --> 00:57:44,149
(Is it taking too long?)

1301
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:45,879
Just one minute.

1302
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,680
It must be difficult
because of the mosquitoes.

1303
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:49,719
Yes.

1304
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:53,120
This will make the mosquitoes stay away.

1305
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:54,160
(Flapping)

1306
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,890
You should fan her.

1307
00:57:57,330 --> 00:57:59,390
(Volunteering for the model)

1308
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,799
Hang in there for a while, Solar.

1309
00:58:01,799 --> 00:58:03,930
Usually, it's difficult.

1310
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:05,500
- Her name is Sharon.
- Sharon.

1311
00:58:06,029 --> 00:58:07,230
I'm sorry, Sharon.

1312
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,469
- He called her Solar.
- Solar is a MAMAMOO member.

1313
00:58:09,469 --> 00:58:10,500
Right.

1314
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:14,210
Because of the flies
that suck blood from you,

1315
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,040
my skin stung so much.

1316
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,180
I still did the best I could.

1317
00:58:18,779 --> 00:58:21,620
That's when I got all the bug bites.

1318
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,180
His legs got bitten all over.

1319
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:24,790
- Oh, no.
- The camera director went...

1320
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:26,419
to the hospital because of the sandflies.

1321
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:27,419
- What?
- Because he got bitten so much?

1322
00:58:27,419 --> 00:58:28,960
- He got bitten a lot.
- Who is he?

1323
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,620
He's a city boy.

1324
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:34,230
You mean the director
who's wearing a sweater vest?

1325
00:58:34,629 --> 00:58:36,799
(While struggling against sandflies,)

1326
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:41,169
(he tries his best to draw well.)

1327
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:45,410
(He doesn't straighten up even once.)

1328
00:58:45,969 --> 00:58:47,040
To...

1329
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:49,439
- Sharon.
- Sharon.

1330
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,609
How is it spelled? Sharon.

1331
00:58:56,419 --> 00:58:57,489
Here.

1332
00:58:57,489 --> 00:58:59,419
Here you go.

1333
00:58:59,419 --> 00:59:00,719
(Staring)

1334
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:02,189
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

1335
00:59:02,189 --> 00:59:03,290
(Thank you.)

1336
00:59:03,489 --> 00:59:05,629
Do you like it?

1337
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:07,129
Yes, it's very pretty.

1338
00:59:07,129 --> 00:59:08,230
Thank you.

1339
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,100
- She must be moved.
- Seriously.

1340
00:59:10,299 --> 00:59:13,730
He made a drawing of me.
It looked really nice,

1341
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:16,169
so I will keep it.

1342
00:59:16,439 --> 00:59:18,739
I did it suddenly in the middle of a meal.

1343
00:59:18,739 --> 00:59:21,580
I used a pen on a small notebook,
so I couldn't draw well.

1344
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,310
Today, the paper was bigger.

1345
00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:25,279
I used a pencil, so it was much better.

1346
00:59:25,279 --> 00:59:26,379
(He feels proud of it.)

1347
00:59:27,149 --> 00:59:28,350
(You seem especially nice to Sharon.)

1348
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:29,520
No.

1349
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:32,589
I feel like her older cousin.

1350
00:59:32,589 --> 00:59:36,359
I hope that she'll meet a kind man
in Iquitos.

1351
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:37,730
Sharon.

1352
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:38,730
(All of a sudden)

1353
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:40,859
Meet a good man,
and don't get your heart broken.

1354
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:44,770
(Drawing that he made
from the heart of her older cousin)

1355
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:46,469
"The heart of her older cousin?"

1356
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:49,600
(After some drawing
in the peaceful Amazon)

1357
00:59:51,169 --> 00:59:52,540
(Exclaiming)

1358
00:59:52,540 --> 00:59:54,839
I only used a toothbrush
from this heavy backpack.

1359
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,480
(Silence)

1360
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:58,509
Let's go.

1361
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:05,319
Kian84. Do you want to stay longer?

1362
01:00:05,319 --> 01:00:07,120
- You look quite sad to leave.
- No.

1363
01:00:08,489 --> 01:00:10,060
- We should go.
- Are you okay?

1364
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:13,129
(Trudging)

1365
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,859
Time passes by too fast.

1366
01:00:16,859 --> 01:00:17,899
I know.

1367
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:23,270
(As intense as it was,
the time passed by fast.)

1368
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,509
Thank you for coming.

1369
01:00:26,109 --> 01:00:29,540
- Thank you.
- Hope to see you again.

1370
01:00:30,279 --> 01:00:35,819
Feel free to come next time
like it was your home.

1371
01:00:35,819 --> 01:00:37,180
Come to Korea.

1372
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,819
The whole family. Come to Korea.

1373
01:00:38,819 --> 01:00:41,919
Of course.

1374
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,960
(Kian84 stays quiet.)

1375
01:00:44,529 --> 01:00:45,830
He seems sad.

1376
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:47,560
It was sad to leave after one night.

1377
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,629
They probably grew on you.

1378
01:00:48,629 --> 01:00:49,899
- Of course.
- It was a bit sad.

1379
01:00:49,899 --> 01:00:51,870
- He gets attached easily.
- He does.

1380
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:52,870
No.

1381
01:00:52,870 --> 01:00:54,700
(Kian84 stays quiet.)

1382
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:57,710
Follow my Instagram.

1383
01:00:58,469 --> 01:01:01,310
- Instagram.
- Instagram.

1384
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:03,180
Do you have a pen?

1385
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:05,180
Give him a pen.

1386
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:06,950
Here you go.

1387
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:08,649
Instagram?

1388
01:01:09,350 --> 01:01:11,219
You shouldn't write on your hand.
Write on hers.

1389
01:01:11,219 --> 01:01:13,189
(It was almost worse than not writing.)

1390
01:01:13,189 --> 01:01:14,290
On your hand.

1391
01:01:16,259 --> 01:01:18,089
- Your ID.
- My ID?

1392
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:20,259
- Can I write in Korean?
- No.

1393
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,529
That's...

1394
01:01:22,529 --> 01:01:23,560
I'm sorry.

1395
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,330
(Trying not to laugh)

1396
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:27,469
- K-I-A.
- A.

1397
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:30,799
- I don't think this is it.
- A-N.

1398
01:01:31,069 --> 01:01:33,109
It's Kim Hee Min.

1399
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,180
I'm sorry.

1400
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:37,480
- I'm sorry.
- Write on her other hand.

1401
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,609
I'm sorry.

1402
01:01:38,609 --> 01:01:41,480
- I'm sorry.
- Write on here.

1403
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,950
I'll write here.

1404
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:47,189
(After a long attempt)

1405
01:01:47,189 --> 01:01:49,489
Okay, this is my Instagram.

1406
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:51,689
- Please follow.
- Okay.

1407
01:01:51,689 --> 01:01:53,689
(He forgot to write the number.)

1408
01:01:54,399 --> 01:01:56,299
Oh, my.

1409
01:01:56,299 --> 01:01:58,100
Did you become friends with her
on Instagram?

1410
01:01:58,100 --> 01:02:00,029
When we arrived in the city,
she hadn't contacted me.

1411
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,469
That's unfortunate.

1412
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:05,609
- Bye.
- Bye.

1413
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,480
(It's time to leave.)

1414
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,210
I don't feel good about leaving...

1415
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,180
after just one day.

1416
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:16,779
It feels touching like visiting relatives.

1417
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:19,790
I don't get to see my relatives often.

1418
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,790
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1419
01:02:24,859 --> 01:02:26,430
- Bye.
- Bye.

1420
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:28,930
Eric.

1421
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:30,660
Eric.

1422
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:33,330
(The family members wave their hands.)

1423
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:35,000
- Bye.
- Bye.

1424
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,140
She keeps holding the drawing.

1425
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:40,239
I didn't want to come to the Amazon,

1426
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:45,350
but when would I get to go deep
into the Amazon again...

1427
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:48,219
and share a meal and talk with the locals?

1428
01:02:48,219 --> 01:02:50,620
We did a lot including axing...

1429
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,149
and fishing on a boat.

1430
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:54,419
You don't get a chance to do this.

1431
01:02:55,319 --> 01:02:56,359
It was great.

1432
01:02:57,219 --> 01:03:00,330
I expected sensibility to dry out
as you get old,

1433
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:02,660
but it hasn't completely dried out in me.

1434
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,930
You have something pure in you.

1435
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:06,770
- Now...
- There's something humid.

1436
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:08,739
Humid?

1437
01:03:08,939 --> 01:03:10,439
(He means that it hasn't dried out.)

1438
01:03:10,439 --> 01:03:11,739
What do you mean by humid?

1439
01:03:12,739 --> 01:03:14,480
Are you heading to the airport?

1440
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,680
When we get to the airport,
we'll head to Lima.

1441
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:17,750
- Lima?
- Thank you.

1442
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:21,480
(There's no overland route
to the exterior.)

1443
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:25,250
(They head to the airport to fly.)

1444
01:03:26,189 --> 01:03:28,089
- Do you want some ice cream?
- Ice cream?

1445
01:03:28,089 --> 01:03:29,120
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1446
01:03:30,259 --> 01:03:31,359
Ice cream.

1447
01:03:31,790 --> 01:03:32,830
What's this?

1448
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:34,930
Is this like the Baskin Robbins of Peru?

1449
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:38,730
(Small happiness found on the street)

1450
01:03:39,730 --> 01:03:40,830
Iquitos.

1451
01:03:40,969 --> 01:03:43,640
(Iquitos Airport)

1452
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:46,939
(On the front yard of the airport,)

1453
01:03:47,469 --> 01:03:50,040
(the running fanatic starts to run.)

1454
01:03:50,879 --> 01:03:54,319
- Why is he running?
- I wonder.

1455
01:03:54,649 --> 01:03:57,279
We have a lot of waiting time.

1456
01:03:57,279 --> 01:03:58,919
I didn't get to work out today.

1457
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:00,319
(But still...)

1458
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:03,189
It's about 28°C right now.

1459
01:04:03,189 --> 01:04:05,359
(Actually, it's 34°C.)

1460
01:04:05,359 --> 01:04:07,129
I think it's about 28°C.

1461
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,930
(He runs in the tropical heat wave.)

1462
01:04:11,129 --> 01:04:15,040
I feel bad about making
the camera directors turn on...

1463
01:04:15,469 --> 01:04:16,669
their cameras.

1464
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:19,770
Please take a break.

1465
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:22,779
(After running, they flew
for an hour and 45 minutes.)

1466
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:25,810
(They arrived at Lima Airport.)

1467
01:04:27,509 --> 01:04:31,549
Everyone, from Lima Airport,

1468
01:04:31,549 --> 01:04:35,660
we'll go to the south to a place
called Cusco.

1469
01:04:35,919 --> 01:04:37,759
After a layover here,

1470
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:42,359
I'll film again when we get to Cusco.

1471
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:44,600
Kian84.

1472
01:04:46,029 --> 01:04:47,200
Aren't you tired?

1473
01:04:47,569 --> 01:04:49,000
No, I'm completely awake.

1474
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:50,540
(Laughing)

1475
01:04:50,540 --> 01:04:52,239
Where are you taking me?

1476
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:54,540
- We'll be going to Cusco.
- Yes.

1477
01:04:55,109 --> 01:04:58,509
It's about 3,000m above sea level.

1478
01:04:58,509 --> 01:05:00,049
That information is important.

1479
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:02,080
You have to take this.
You'll get altitude sickness.

1480
01:05:02,080 --> 01:05:03,819
- Take one pill.
- Right.

1481
01:05:03,819 --> 01:05:05,689
I'll take care of you
if you get altitude sickness.

1482
01:05:05,689 --> 01:05:06,850
- Okay.
- Take it.

1483
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:08,020
I hope they won't suffer.

1484
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:10,560
I think medicine is necessary to pack.

1485
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,989
- Right.
- It's a must.

1486
01:05:11,989 --> 01:05:13,830
I died without it.

1487
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:15,160
How long is the flight?

1488
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:16,830
- It's an hour and a half.
- An hour and a half?

1489
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,230
I should hurry.

1490
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:20,100
For our lodging,

1491
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:22,640
I have to make a reservation now
with the owner.

1492
01:05:22,899 --> 01:05:23,969
The lodging?

1493
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:26,839
- Is the owner Korean?
- Yes.

1494
01:05:27,669 --> 01:05:29,109
That's good.

1495
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,480
(Making a real-time reservation
of the lodging at the airport )

1496
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,980
- He's dependable.
- Yes.

1497
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:33,980
Si Eon.

1498
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:35,219
(You can count on me, Kian84.)

1499
01:05:35,219 --> 01:05:37,819
If I didn't reserve it,
we would have slept on the street.

1500
01:05:37,819 --> 01:05:40,549
It's convenient when
your traveling buddy likes to plan.

1501
01:05:40,549 --> 01:05:41,589
Right.

1502
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:45,430
Suddenly, they're calling people
going to Cusco.

1503
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:47,129
The camera got lowered all of a sudden.

1504
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:48,799
- The screen...
- It means that he's in a hurry.

1505
01:05:50,259 --> 01:05:53,529
(They arrive in Cusco
after flying an hour and a half.)

1506
01:06:01,239 --> 01:06:03,509
Hello, Kian84 TV viewers.

1507
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,379
We finally arrived...

1508
01:06:05,379 --> 01:06:08,319
- We arrived in Cusco.
- We arrived in Cusco.

1509
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:10,950
Symptoms of altitude sickness should
appear...

1510
01:06:10,950 --> 01:06:15,060
starting from now.

1511
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:16,919
How do you feel?

1512
01:06:16,919 --> 01:06:20,560
My ears are slightly muffled
now that I got off the airplane.

1513
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:24,569
The route from here
to Uyuni Salt Flat will continue...

1514
01:06:24,569 --> 01:06:26,830
to get higher.

1515
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:28,939
Do you get...

1516
01:06:28,939 --> 01:06:32,370
altitude sickness
when you go to a place...

1517
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:35,040
- of a high altitude?
- Yes.

1518
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:38,810
How high should the altitude be
to get altitude sickness?

1519
01:06:38,810 --> 01:06:40,710
Do Yeon will explain.

1520
01:06:41,419 --> 01:06:42,680
I mean...

1521
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,419
- Jang Do Yeon.
- Yes?

1522
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:48,689
When you reach a place with an altitude
over 2,000m to 3,000m,

1523
01:06:48,689 --> 01:06:51,790
you get altitude sickness
as you run out of oxygen...

1524
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:54,600
and feel uncomfortable.

1525
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:57,730
Some of the symptoms are headaches,
nausea,

1526
01:06:57,730 --> 01:06:59,569
vomiting, hypothermia,

1527
01:06:59,569 --> 01:07:02,000
and difficulty in breathing.

1528
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:04,569
Mount Baekdu has an altitude of 2,700m.

1529
01:07:04,569 --> 01:07:06,270
I heard that Cusco has...

1530
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:08,040
an altitude of 3,000 to 3,500m.

1531
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,180
You know well.

1532
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,450
When you take a plane up there...

1533
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:13,680
- I asked that question.
- Me too.

1534
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,250
There's a control of air pressure
on the plane.

1535
01:07:15,250 --> 01:07:17,549
- A control?
- If that breaks,

1536
01:07:17,549 --> 01:07:18,919
everyone will pass out.

1537
01:07:18,919 --> 01:07:20,350
There has been an accident...

1538
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:21,989
- because everyone passed out.
- It broke.

1539
01:07:21,989 --> 01:07:23,020
Gosh.

1540
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:24,890
Tell them about Pani Bottle.

1541
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:27,560
By the way, where is Pani Bottle?

1542
01:07:27,560 --> 01:07:29,830
- He is...
- Is he the one who's filming you?

1543
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,830
He's traveling.

1544
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:33,230
I really want to meet him.

1545
01:07:33,399 --> 01:07:35,939
Kian84, you should put on something thick.

1546
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:37,439
You'll be cold.

1547
01:07:37,439 --> 01:07:38,810
Everyone is wearing a padded jacket.

1548
01:07:38,810 --> 01:07:40,140
It's not cold at all right now.

1549
01:07:40,469 --> 01:07:41,710
You put it on.

1550
01:07:42,680 --> 01:07:44,210
For me, this isn't cold.

1551
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:45,310
(Real men wear short-sleeved T-shirts
no matter the temperature.)

1552
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:47,750
I should put it on.

1553
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:49,919
- I'm sorry.
- He's putting it on right away.

1554
01:07:49,919 --> 01:07:51,319
- He is.
- It was cold.

1555
01:07:51,319 --> 01:07:52,549
My love, corduroy.

1556
01:07:52,549 --> 01:07:53,649
(He puts on a jacket
that fits him perfectly.)

1557
01:07:53,649 --> 01:07:55,719
I've had this jacket for a long time.

1558
01:07:55,859 --> 01:07:57,960
Is this altitude sickness?
It's hard to breathe.

1559
01:07:58,259 --> 01:07:59,759
That's altitude sickness.

1560
01:08:00,629 --> 01:08:02,600
This is...

1561
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:04,259
- It feels like...
- It's because of the backpack.

1562
01:08:04,259 --> 01:08:06,000
Even if I breathe deeply,

1563
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,100
it doesn't feel completely refreshing.

1564
01:08:10,339 --> 01:08:11,870
In this case,

1565
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:13,870
we should inhale through the nose
and exhale through the mouth.

1566
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,580
(Inhaling)

1567
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:16,640
- Really?
- Yes.

1568
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:17,779
Is it effective?

1569
01:08:17,779 --> 01:08:19,609
It's definitely effective.

1570
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:20,980
Taxi?

1571
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:23,620
Yes, taxi.

1572
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:24,850
Where are you going, my friend?

1573
01:08:24,919 --> 01:08:26,750
He's catching a taxi.

1574
01:08:27,989 --> 01:08:30,060
Please go to Calle Recoleta.

1575
01:08:30,219 --> 01:08:31,830
I knew it.

1576
01:08:31,830 --> 01:08:34,560
- He's prepared.
- He's all prepared.

1577
01:08:35,029 --> 01:08:36,600
Okay. Did you see that?

1578
01:08:38,029 --> 01:08:40,169
- How long will it take?
- Ten minutes.

1579
01:08:40,169 --> 01:08:41,799
- Twenty minutes?
- Ten minutes.

1580
01:08:41,799 --> 01:08:43,040
- Okay.
- Ten?

1581
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,939
- Okay, thank you very much.
- Ten minutes.

1582
01:08:46,469 --> 01:08:49,540
(They load the taxi with their luggage.)

1583
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:50,939
Thank you very much.

1584
01:08:51,379 --> 01:08:52,410
Get in.

1585
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:55,049
Si Eon, I couldn't breathe
because my bag was too heavy.

1586
01:08:55,049 --> 01:08:56,319
I thought so.

1587
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:58,890
- That's a relief.
- My bag got heavier...

1588
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:00,089
because I packed a lot.

1589
01:09:00,489 --> 01:09:02,620
Wait, where's the meter?

1590
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:03,790
Right.

1591
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:07,689
Taxi, meter?

1592
01:09:07,689 --> 01:09:09,859
- Meter?
- Meter?

1593
01:09:09,859 --> 01:09:11,899
- Price.
- That's the Korean pronunciation.

1594
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:13,529
Price. How much is it?

1595
01:09:13,529 --> 01:09:16,200
It's 30 soles.

1596
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:18,640
- Twenty?
- No, 30.

1597
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:21,379
Thirty soles? Okay.

1598
01:09:21,680 --> 01:09:23,379
- Okay.
- Okay?

1599
01:09:23,379 --> 01:09:28,620
We paid 20 soles for a tuk-tuk ride.

1600
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:32,520
Thirty soles sounds about right.

1601
01:09:33,489 --> 01:09:36,419
(They figured out the taxi price in Peru.)

1602
01:09:37,290 --> 01:09:41,189
(The streets at night appear unfamiliar
in the new city.)

1603
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:43,700
Si Eon, look at the view outside.

1604
01:09:44,870 --> 01:09:48,200
It looks different from Iquitos.

1605
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,670
It's completely different.

1606
01:09:49,670 --> 01:09:50,670
(The view of Cusco has a different charm
from Iquitos.)

1607
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,769
(Cusco, the last capital city
of the Inca Empire)

1608
01:09:53,769 --> 01:09:54,910
Look at the view at night.

1609
01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:57,179
I really want to visit there.

1610
01:09:57,179 --> 01:09:58,580
(An altitude of 3,399m)

1611
01:09:58,580 --> 01:09:59,910
It looks amazing.

1612
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,519
This is one of the hot places.

1613
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:05,649
I really want to go there.

1614
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:08,120
It looks completely different.

1615
01:10:09,519 --> 01:10:12,630
(Blended with its ancient history)

1616
01:10:13,689 --> 01:10:17,130
(A cultural heritage where traces
of two civilizations exist)

1617
01:10:22,599 --> 01:10:25,510
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1618
01:10:25,609 --> 01:10:27,569
(Very tired)

1619
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:30,309
(Current location, they must
get to an alley from the avenue.)

1620
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:31,479
Let's go.

1621
01:10:32,149 --> 01:10:33,250
Isn't it this house?

1622
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:34,609
We have to look at the location.

1623
01:10:34,609 --> 01:10:36,420
Looking at the image will be confusing.

1624
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:39,550
They built it recently. Take a look.

1625
01:10:40,019 --> 01:10:41,460
This is it.

1626
01:10:42,859 --> 01:10:44,290
Did they repaint it?

1627
01:10:44,889 --> 01:10:45,889
(The exterior looks too clean.)

1628
01:10:45,889 --> 01:10:48,059
- What?
- It's not this way.

1629
01:10:48,229 --> 01:10:50,029
- This isn't it.
- It's that one.

1630
01:10:50,559 --> 01:10:53,370
- This is it.
- Yes, let's go up. This way.

1631
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:54,840
(They found something.)

1632
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,010
It's not it.

1633
01:11:00,109 --> 01:11:01,710
Si Eon, what's the name of the lodging?

1634
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,340
Comma Cusco.

1635
01:11:03,479 --> 01:11:04,750
Comma Cusco.

1636
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:06,580
(They look for the lodging again.)

1637
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:08,010
It's a little frustrating.

1638
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:10,550
(He doesn't know how to read the map.)

1639
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:13,519
Si Eon, can I look at the map?

1640
01:11:14,420 --> 01:11:15,620
I'll take a look.

1641
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:17,590
You shouldn't just look at the image.

1642
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,229
Google Maps doesn't show the destination.

1643
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:22,099
(Those with a bad sense of direction can't
tell where the destination is.)

1644
01:11:22,099 --> 01:11:23,229
Hold on.

1645
01:11:24,099 --> 01:11:25,269
It's like this.

1646
01:11:25,769 --> 01:11:27,529
- It's this way.
- Thank you.

1647
01:11:27,529 --> 01:11:29,170
(He's thankful for everything.)

1648
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:31,139
- Is it that way?
- Si Eon, I think I can find it.

1649
01:11:32,769 --> 01:11:34,569
(Following)

1650
01:11:34,809 --> 01:11:37,540
(Kian84 - He doesn't plan,)

1651
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:39,309
(but he's good at reading the map.)

1652
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:42,050
(Si Eon - He has plans,)

1653
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:43,679
(but he can't read the map.)

1654
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:45,750
This is it.

1655
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,389
It's this way.

1656
01:11:48,989 --> 01:11:50,960
(Their relationship is
definitely symbiotic.)

1657
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,689
- This is it.
- It's unfamiliar to see him...

1658
01:11:52,689 --> 01:11:55,559
lead the way with the map.

1659
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:57,399
I found it.

1660
01:11:57,599 --> 01:12:00,929
It's Korean. It's the only Korean place.

1661
01:12:00,929 --> 01:12:02,700
Let's take a photo here.

1662
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:04,970
- Let's take a photo in front of "Comma."
- Okay.

1663
01:12:05,569 --> 01:12:07,109
I can't capture the sign.

1664
01:12:08,109 --> 01:12:11,010
"Comma" doesn't show.

1665
01:12:11,279 --> 01:12:13,450
- It doesn't matter.
- Let's go in first.

1666
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:15,149
- Hello.
- Hello.

1667
01:12:15,149 --> 01:12:17,179
- There's ramyeon.
- Hello.

1668
01:12:17,179 --> 01:12:19,849
- Hello.
- Hello.

1669
01:12:19,849 --> 01:12:21,960
You're the first Koreans we met in Peru.

1670
01:12:22,559 --> 01:12:24,460
I'm glad to meet you.

1671
01:12:24,559 --> 01:12:25,960
Seriously.

1672
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:29,000
This place is...

1673
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,130
run by sisters.

1674
01:12:31,130 --> 01:12:32,800
Are three of you sisters?

1675
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,970
- Yes, we're sisters.
- Really?

1676
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:37,439
Would you like to check in?

1677
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:39,410
Who made the reservation?

1678
01:12:39,639 --> 01:12:41,109
Please come this way.

1679
01:12:41,109 --> 01:12:42,540
That's amazing.

1680
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:44,710
It's not easy for sisters to run
a lodging abroad.

1681
01:12:44,710 --> 01:12:46,510
Usually, the check-in is at 2 p.m.,

1682
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:48,580
but since you came late,
you can check in right away.

1683
01:12:48,580 --> 01:12:51,080
If you leave us your laundry,

1684
01:12:51,080 --> 01:12:52,889
it takes about half a day.

1685
01:12:52,889 --> 01:12:54,689
If you give us your shoes...

1686
01:12:54,689 --> 01:12:57,160
Yes, we have to wash everything.

1687
01:12:57,359 --> 01:12:59,989
Si Eon, what's important is,
how many nights will we spend here?

1688
01:12:59,989 --> 01:13:02,260
For now, I reserved two days,
tonight and tomorrow night.

1689
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:03,359
- Tomorrow night too?
- Yes.

1690
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:05,470
- Are we sharing a room?
- Yes.

1691
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:06,769
Could you separate us?

1692
01:13:07,470 --> 01:13:08,970
- Separate?
- He wants a separate room.

1693
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:10,739
- Can we get a separate room?
- Really?

1694
01:13:10,739 --> 01:13:12,170
- Then...
- Do what you'd like.

1695
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:13,569
One of you can sleep in the bathroom.

1696
01:13:13,569 --> 01:13:15,939
- Send him to the bathroom.
- Come on.

1697
01:13:15,939 --> 01:13:18,080
We will go upstairs...

1698
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,349
and bring down our laundry.

1699
01:13:20,349 --> 01:13:22,420
- We have to eat dinner too.
- Okay.

1700
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:24,279
Si Eon, we should pay first.

1701
01:13:24,279 --> 01:13:26,720
The dormitory is 15 dollars per night.

1702
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:29,290
For two people and two nights,
the total is 60 dollars.

1703
01:13:29,290 --> 01:13:30,760
- Sixty dollars.
- Yes.

1704
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,290
- That's nice.
- How much is a bottle of soju?

1705
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:35,059
It's 30 soles.

1706
01:13:35,130 --> 01:13:36,460
Isn't it more expensive than lodging?

1707
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:40,130
It costs about 10,000 won
when you're abroad.

1708
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:44,500
Can we get soju and ramyeon?

1709
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:47,010
I'll buy them for you. Wait. Go upstairs.

1710
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:49,210
- Take a look at the room first.
- First...

1711
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:51,010
- Wait.
- Okay.

1712
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,580
I was talking to the dog.

1713
01:13:53,450 --> 01:13:56,880
It's been only two days
since you arrived in Peru,

1714
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:59,090
- but you crave soju and ramyeon already.
- Right.

1715
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:01,620
- It felt like it had been two months.
- In the Amazon...

1716
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:04,319
It had been only one day,
but I was happy to see it.

1717
01:14:04,319 --> 01:14:06,760
- Ramyeon after a shower.
- Yes.

1718
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,300
- I was happy to see it.
- Ramyeon is the best.

1719
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:11,099
- You make some ramyeon.
- I was really looking forward to it.

1720
01:14:12,429 --> 01:14:13,599
Go slowly.

1721
01:14:13,599 --> 01:14:16,040
We're at a high altitude,
so you should climb up slowly.

1722
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,569
- That way, you won't feel sick.
- At a high altitude,

1723
01:14:18,569 --> 01:14:21,069
isn't it dangerous...

1724
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:23,679
- if you run out breath?
- Yes.

1725
01:14:23,679 --> 01:14:25,580
You feel a bit dizzy.

1726
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:26,880
Is it because my bag is heavy?

1727
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:27,979
Gosh.

1728
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:30,080
- I don't think I can go up farther.
- I see.

1729
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:31,750
Do you feel sick...

1730
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:34,450
- even inside?
- I felt sick since that moment.

1731
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:39,429
It feels different.

1732
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:43,099
- Welcome.
- It looks nice.

1733
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:46,269
- It looks really nice.
- Put down your bags.

1734
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:48,840
- Wait a minute.
- Go ahead and sit down.

1735
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,639
(Dizzy)

1736
01:14:50,639 --> 01:14:52,670
- He looks completely pale.
- Oh, no. He looks sick.

1737
01:14:52,670 --> 01:14:54,069
My ears are so muffled.

1738
01:14:54,979 --> 01:14:57,340
- The oxygen...
- Like on top of a mountain.

1739
01:14:57,609 --> 01:14:58,779
Right.

1740
01:14:58,950 --> 01:15:01,510
This is the room that you will use.

1741
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:02,620
It's a four-person dormitory,

1742
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:04,550
but no one is using it right now.

1743
01:15:04,550 --> 01:15:06,620
You can share this bunk bed.

1744
01:15:06,620 --> 01:15:07,819
- Like this?
- Yes.

1745
01:15:07,819 --> 01:15:09,920
Here are the lockers.

1746
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,729
You can keep your backpacks here.

1747
01:15:11,729 --> 01:15:13,260
He lost weight in an instant.

1748
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:15,729
- His face is getting worse.
- Oh, no.

1749
01:15:15,729 --> 01:15:18,029
It was really difficult.

1750
01:15:18,029 --> 01:15:21,269
You'll find small pots here...

1751
01:15:21,269 --> 01:15:22,870
to make simple meals like ramyeon.

1752
01:15:22,870 --> 01:15:25,040
I can't see clearly.

1753
01:15:25,239 --> 01:15:26,540
- Isn't this it?
- Yes.

1754
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:28,910
You might get the chills at night.

1755
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:31,540
I keep seeing her afterimage as she moves.

1756
01:15:31,609 --> 01:15:32,710
Hot water.

1757
01:15:32,710 --> 01:15:34,309
- Is that how it appears?
- Yes.

1758
01:15:34,309 --> 01:15:35,620
- Seriously.
- If it gets cold?

1759
01:15:35,620 --> 01:15:37,450
- You can keep it in your arms.
- Just use the sleeping bag.

1760
01:15:37,450 --> 01:15:39,189
- Thank you.
- That's all.

1761
01:15:39,189 --> 01:15:42,120
We'll bring down our laundry.

1762
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,389
Okay.

1763
01:15:43,389 --> 01:15:45,260
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1764
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:49,229
Kian84, I feel a bit dizzy.

1765
01:15:49,229 --> 01:15:50,660
(Dizzy)

1766
01:15:51,929 --> 01:15:53,269
Will you be able to wash up?

1767
01:15:53,970 --> 01:15:55,139
You can wash up, right?

1768
01:15:55,139 --> 01:15:56,870
- Will you wash me?
- Shall I?

1769
01:15:57,439 --> 01:15:59,170
I'm afraid that you'll pass out.

1770
01:15:59,170 --> 01:16:02,439
Can you put the shoes by the entrance?

1771
01:16:02,439 --> 01:16:03,479
These?

1772
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:07,609
Gosh.

1773
01:16:07,609 --> 01:16:09,720
(With the fragrance
from the Amazon sealed inside)

1774
01:16:11,849 --> 01:16:13,550
Did the owner bring...

1775
01:16:13,550 --> 01:16:16,260
It's strange. I feel like I'm tipsy.

1776
01:16:16,260 --> 01:16:17,359
Right.

1777
01:16:17,359 --> 01:16:20,389
When you drink a lot,
you get a hangover the next day.

1778
01:16:20,389 --> 01:16:21,689
It feels similar to that.

1779
01:16:21,689 --> 01:16:23,059
You saved money on alcohol.

1780
01:16:23,899 --> 01:16:26,970
- That's a good way to think about it.
- You don't have to drink.

1781
01:16:26,970 --> 01:16:28,500
The power of positivity.

1782
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,840
That's too positive.

1783
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,540
There's one positive side.

1784
01:16:31,809 --> 01:16:33,569
- I'll take a shower.
- Go ahead.

1785
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,979
Gosh, I feel strange.

1786
01:16:38,239 --> 01:16:40,910
I hope that he'll get better.

1787
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:43,920
- Do you feel refreshed?
- Yes.

1788
01:16:44,519 --> 01:16:46,689
(Tired)

1789
01:16:46,889 --> 01:16:48,660
(His mouth might tear.)

1790
01:16:48,660 --> 01:16:51,019
I feel really refreshed.

1791
01:16:51,929 --> 01:16:53,189
(Scratching)

1792
01:16:53,189 --> 01:16:54,389
I should take a shower.

1793
01:16:54,389 --> 01:16:55,830
I'll go and wash up.

1794
01:16:57,330 --> 01:17:00,000
(Kian84 goes to take a shower.)

1795
01:17:02,739 --> 01:17:04,599
(Si Eon brings out the laundry.)

1796
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,210
That startled me.

1797
01:17:07,210 --> 01:17:08,309
Slowly.

1798
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:14,510
This is tiring.

1799
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,250
(Struggling)

1800
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:22,319
Yes?

1801
01:17:24,989 --> 01:17:26,489
(You can't help but laugh
when you see him.)

1802
01:17:26,489 --> 01:17:28,559
You take good care of your skin.

1803
01:17:29,529 --> 01:17:30,559
- I can take that.
- Yes.

1804
01:17:30,559 --> 01:17:32,470
We'll have it done tomorrow.

1805
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:34,429
You can give it to us.

1806
01:17:34,429 --> 01:17:35,769
(He takes something to the kitchen.)

1807
01:17:35,769 --> 01:17:37,099
What is he taking?

1808
01:17:38,200 --> 01:17:39,340
Is he going to cook?

1809
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:41,769
- It was a special day.
- Really?

1810
01:17:41,939 --> 01:17:43,710
- That's why.
- Are you preparing for it?

1811
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:49,319
Today is Kian84's birthday.

1812
01:17:49,819 --> 01:17:51,019
(Goodness.)

1813
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:52,720
Oh, dear.

1814
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:55,090
What a good friend he is.

1815
01:17:55,090 --> 01:17:57,920
I prepared Gijang seaweed
for his birthday.

1816
01:17:58,830 --> 01:18:00,760
Gijang seaweed and dried pollack.

1817
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:03,500
- I got the best quality.
- I brought it from Korea.

1818
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,800
Really?

1819
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,599
It must've been heavy to carry it around.

1820
01:18:07,599 --> 01:18:09,500
(Can you get me some beef for soup?)

1821
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,269
(Yes. We'll try.)

1822
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:13,210
(A little bit of soy sauce too.)

1823
01:18:13,210 --> 01:18:15,279
(We have soy sauce.)

1824
01:18:15,510 --> 01:18:16,710
My goodness, Si Eon.

1825
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:19,450
- That's what I did.
- Oh, my. Si Eon.

1826
01:18:20,679 --> 01:18:23,950
(He quickly prepares ingredients
while Kian84 is taking a shower.)

1827
01:18:24,279 --> 01:18:26,189
I already practiced at home.

1828
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:28,450
I won't try to be funny.

1829
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:31,260
I'll make delicious seaweed soup for him.

1830
01:18:32,660 --> 01:18:35,529
- You haven't seen it yet, then.
- No. I didn't know he was cooking.

1831
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:38,359
(He stir-fries seaweed in perilla oil.)

1832
01:18:39,029 --> 01:18:40,599
It's a lot of beef.

1833
01:18:42,269 --> 01:18:43,899
(He'll stir-fry beef too.)

1834
01:18:43,899 --> 01:18:45,139
You should cut it.

1835
01:18:45,139 --> 01:18:47,139
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1836
01:18:47,139 --> 01:18:49,380
(Flustered)

1837
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:51,279
(Oh, dear.)

1838
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:52,580
I haven't cut meat.

1839
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:57,750
(He starts cutting the meat with a knife.)

1840
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,519
(I'm a little worried.)

1841
01:19:01,220 --> 01:19:02,760
He's quite fast.

1842
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:03,760
Yes.

1843
01:19:05,489 --> 01:19:07,229
(The masked man...)

1844
01:19:07,229 --> 01:19:09,229
(gives his full attention to the seaweed.)

1845
01:19:09,599 --> 01:19:10,599
(Cutting)

1846
01:19:10,599 --> 01:19:12,200
Dried pollack seaweed soup.
It must be good.

1847
01:19:13,529 --> 01:19:17,170
I won't try to be funny.
I'll just be serious.

1848
01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:19,540
(Looking around)

1849
01:19:22,679 --> 01:19:27,380
(He gets some water in a bowl
and comes back to the pot.)

1850
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:29,080
How touching this is.

1851
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:32,389
It wasn't even in Korea.
He made it for you overseas.

1852
01:19:32,389 --> 01:19:34,220
(He cuts meat at the same time!)

1853
01:19:35,019 --> 01:19:37,489
(His practice is paying off.)

1854
01:19:37,489 --> 01:19:39,790
(Flowing)

1855
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,700
(Floundering)

1856
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:48,840
(Lost)

1857
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:50,870
I spilled some water.

1858
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:52,139
- What?
- I'm sorry.

1859
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:54,109
That's okay.

1860
01:19:54,670 --> 01:19:56,010
(Laughing)

1861
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:57,210
It's all right.

1862
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:00,550
(He was a little clumsy,
but he continues cooking.)

1863
01:20:01,179 --> 01:20:03,819
(Will his seaweed soup be okay?)

1864
01:20:04,950 --> 01:20:07,950
The key to making good seaweed soup is
to simmer it.

1865
01:20:11,460 --> 01:20:12,929
(Laughing)

1866
01:20:13,929 --> 01:20:15,529
It sounds like I'm adding poison.

1867
01:20:15,729 --> 01:20:17,830
It's almost done.

1868
01:20:19,670 --> 01:20:20,870
(Kian84 came out of the shower.)

1869
01:20:20,870 --> 01:20:22,200
I'm hungry.

1870
01:20:22,899 --> 01:20:24,399
He's going down.

1871
01:20:24,939 --> 01:20:25,970
No way.

1872
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:28,639
Do you have instant rice?

1873
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:30,010
No, we don't.

1874
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:33,880
(Will his surprise party be ruined
like this?)

1875
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,779
(He's just roaming around
after taking a shower.)

1876
01:20:37,779 --> 01:20:39,179
I'm hungry.

1877
01:20:39,179 --> 01:20:40,720
He's going down.

1878
01:20:41,319 --> 01:20:42,319
No way.

1879
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:44,620
Do you have instant rice?

1880
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,220
No, we don't.

1881
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:47,989
It sold out.

1882
01:20:48,489 --> 01:20:50,059
- You don't have rice.
- No.

1883
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,559
Kian84 would love ramyeon too.

1884
01:20:53,529 --> 01:20:56,800
(As he's in a rush,
he buys 2 packages of ramyeon instead.)

1885
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:00,340
He said he wanted to have ramyeon.

1886
01:21:02,370 --> 01:21:04,880
(The seaweed soup is now boiling.)

1887
01:21:05,809 --> 01:21:08,080
(Is it cooked well?)

1888
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:10,349
Why isn't the water for ramyeon
boiling yet?

1889
01:21:11,380 --> 01:21:13,649
It's at a high altitude,
so water doesn't boil easily.

1890
01:21:14,519 --> 01:21:15,989
- I can imagine.
- Right.

1891
01:21:15,989 --> 01:21:17,420
- It's not easy.
- The heat is low.

1892
01:21:17,420 --> 01:21:18,819
(Sighing)

1893
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:20,489
I'll just add it.

1894
01:21:22,929 --> 01:21:25,800
(The water hasn't boiled,
but he adds noodles to it.)

1895
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,729
What was Kian84 doing in the meantime?

1896
01:21:27,729 --> 01:21:28,830
- He was sleeping.
- Me?

1897
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:29,870
Were you sleeping?

1898
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:32,370
I didn't even think about eating.

1899
01:21:32,370 --> 01:21:34,040
I was just resting after a shower.

1900
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,069
He was tired.

1901
01:21:35,069 --> 01:21:36,739
I was scared to go down.

1902
01:21:36,739 --> 01:21:38,210
- Once I go down,
- It's not easy to come back up.

1903
01:21:38,210 --> 01:21:40,109
- It's so hard.
- It's like I should be prepared...

1904
01:21:40,109 --> 01:21:42,510
to come up about ten floors.

1905
01:21:42,510 --> 01:21:45,080
You had to cook
while suffering from altitude sickness.

1906
01:21:45,080 --> 01:21:47,420
It must've been hard.

1907
01:21:47,420 --> 01:21:48,420
(It was rough.)

1908
01:21:49,789 --> 01:21:52,359
(Gosh.)

1909
01:21:52,590 --> 01:21:54,630
- Kian84.
- Yes, Si Eon.

1910
01:21:54,630 --> 01:21:56,460
(He came all the way up to take Kian84.)

1911
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,899
Let's have some soju.

1912
01:21:58,899 --> 01:22:00,430
- What?
- Did you bring it?

1913
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,869
- I was going to drink downstairs.
- Really?

1914
01:22:02,869 --> 01:22:04,539
- Shall we go down?
- We can come up.

1915
01:22:04,539 --> 01:22:07,039
- Okay.
- He's going to surprise him.

1916
01:22:07,039 --> 01:22:08,409
How sweet.

1917
01:22:08,539 --> 01:22:10,579
I was nervous
that he might not want to go down.

1918
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:13,850
It's not easy to go up
once you're downstairs.

1919
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:15,649
Look how tired they are.

1920
01:22:15,649 --> 01:22:17,079
It was so tiring.

1921
01:22:17,779 --> 01:22:18,779
(Soju bottles are here.)

1922
01:22:18,779 --> 01:22:20,149
- I also made ramyeon.
- Oh, my.

1923
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:22,119
That's good.

1924
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,390
Gosh. The smell. It smells so good.

1925
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:29,029
Do we have kimchi?

1926
01:22:29,029 --> 01:22:30,930
- No. Don't come.
- Just sit down.

1927
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:31,930
Okay.

1928
01:22:33,130 --> 01:22:35,970
- He listened.
- Is it Korean style?

1929
01:22:40,939 --> 01:22:42,340
(The seaweed soup
will finally be revealed.)

1930
01:22:42,340 --> 01:22:43,409
Kian84.

1931
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:45,850
- What is it?
- Happy birthday.

1932
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:47,979
- Yes!
- Seaweed soup.

1933
01:22:47,979 --> 01:22:50,220
- Thank you.
- I made it.

1934
01:22:52,079 --> 01:22:54,250
- Seriously.
- Hey.

1935
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:55,420
Try it.

1936
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,720
I brought the ingredients from Korea.

1937
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:00,359
It's so touching.

1938
01:23:01,029 --> 01:23:03,159
(Moved)

1939
01:23:03,460 --> 01:23:04,529
Goodness.

1940
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:08,770
Thank you, Si Eon.

1941
01:23:10,369 --> 01:23:11,970
You didn't have to.

1942
01:23:12,140 --> 01:23:13,439
Thank you for the soup.

1943
01:23:15,939 --> 01:23:18,140
- Kian84.
- Yes?

1944
01:23:18,810 --> 01:23:20,750
It's too late, but happy birthday.

1945
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:22,520
Okay. Thank you.

1946
01:23:22,520 --> 01:23:24,420
(Laughing)

1947
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:26,149
How should I react to this?

1948
01:23:27,289 --> 01:23:28,449
All right.

1949
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:30,390
I'll take it as a birthday wish
for next year.

1950
01:23:30,390 --> 01:23:31,789
(A birthday wish by accident)

1951
01:23:32,460 --> 01:23:34,689
I'm tearing up.

1952
01:23:34,689 --> 01:23:35,800
(Proud)

1953
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:38,199
- Thank you.
- Try the seaweed soup.

1954
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:40,729
You really didn't have to do this.

1955
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:42,369
Thank you so much.

1956
01:23:43,939 --> 01:23:47,840
(He takes a sip of the soup.)

1957
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:49,939
(Slurping)

1958
01:23:52,039 --> 01:23:53,609
Just say it's good.

1959
01:23:53,609 --> 01:23:55,149
(Is he enjoying it?)

1960
01:23:56,979 --> 01:23:58,220
(He also serves ramyeon quickly.)

1961
01:23:58,220 --> 01:23:59,250
How is it?

1962
01:23:59,949 --> 01:24:01,350
- The taste is...
- It's not good?

1963
01:24:01,350 --> 01:24:03,560
- It's the thought that counts.
- They said it was good.

1964
01:24:03,819 --> 01:24:05,289
It tastes healthy.

1965
01:24:07,159 --> 01:24:08,760
I added dried pollack and shrimp.

1966
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:11,899
- I bought the shrimp on Ganghwa Island.
- Oh, my.

1967
01:24:11,899 --> 01:24:14,000
- Really?
- He got the best ingredients.

1968
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
I thought you'd drink, so I added shrimp.

1969
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:17,939
Let me sing "Happy Birthday."

1970
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,010
(Happy birthday to you)

1971
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:21,109
(Happy birthday, Dear Hee Min)

1972
01:24:21,109 --> 01:24:23,039
(Happy birthday to you)

1973
01:24:23,409 --> 01:24:24,979
Here's a birthday gift.

1974
01:24:25,409 --> 01:24:26,449
Si Eon!

1975
01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:29,079
Si Eon!

1976
01:24:29,350 --> 01:24:32,180
I criticized you a lot
in the interview earlier.

1977
01:24:32,180 --> 01:24:33,689
- It's a designer brand.
- I feel bad now.

1978
01:24:33,689 --> 01:24:35,090
It's a wallet.

1979
01:24:35,289 --> 01:24:37,260
- It's a high-end wallet.
- Yes.

1980
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:41,659
I actually got a birthday gift for him.

1981
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:44,899
- I bought a wallet.
- A wallet?

1982
01:24:46,869 --> 01:24:48,800
His wallet is worn out.

1983
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,539
(He knew Kian84 had an old wallet.)

1984
01:24:52,100 --> 01:24:53,239
My gosh.

1985
01:24:53,239 --> 01:24:55,310
(He's just thankful that Si Eon
remembered a small thing about him.)

1986
01:24:55,710 --> 01:24:58,979
He can be quite sweet.

1987
01:24:59,609 --> 01:25:02,880
(He nags Kian84 as soon as he sees him.)

1988
01:25:03,449 --> 01:25:05,550
(They always bicker.)

1989
01:25:06,520 --> 01:25:08,489
(He's grumpy on the outside.)

1990
01:25:08,619 --> 01:25:10,890
He doesn't really cook,

1991
01:25:11,090 --> 01:25:12,960
but he's been carrying it
in his heavy backpack.

1992
01:25:12,960 --> 01:25:16,529
(Si Eon brought his bag
all the way from Korea.)

1993
01:25:17,300 --> 01:25:19,829
(It's over 20kg.)

1994
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:22,470
(Sunblock)

1995
01:25:22,470 --> 01:25:25,170
(Padded jackets)

1996
01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:27,109
(Sleeping bags)

1997
01:25:27,439 --> 01:25:30,510
He nags him because he cares for him.

1998
01:25:30,510 --> 01:25:32,239
Right. Of course.

1999
01:25:32,609 --> 01:25:34,250
You do that
when you care about the person.

2000
01:25:35,079 --> 01:25:38,119
When you made Kian84 seaweed soup,

2001
01:25:38,119 --> 01:25:40,489
how did you like his reaction?

2002
01:25:40,489 --> 01:25:42,989
As you already know,

2003
01:25:43,289 --> 01:25:46,130
he's not really good at showing gratitude.

2004
01:25:46,130 --> 01:25:47,130
He's shy.

2005
01:25:47,130 --> 01:25:49,930
I think I've never seen him
being that thankful before.

2006
01:25:50,930 --> 01:25:52,670
Honestly, I thought he'd complain...

2007
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:54,930
and say he didn't like seaweed soup
or something.

2008
01:25:54,930 --> 01:25:57,000
If he did that there,
he wouldn't be a decent person.

2009
01:25:57,399 --> 01:25:59,609
- Right.
- Your expectations were so low.

2010
01:25:59,609 --> 01:26:01,569
I'm not that horrible.

2011
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:03,380
- Right.
- I'm not evil.

2012
01:26:03,380 --> 01:26:05,479
He'd be a jerk
if he complained in the alpine region.

2013
01:26:06,649 --> 01:26:08,810
I could see how touched he was.

2014
01:26:08,810 --> 01:26:10,619
I felt so good.

2015
01:26:10,619 --> 01:26:12,420
I was so proud.

2016
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:14,989
It was worth preparing for the surprise.

2017
01:26:16,220 --> 01:26:18,159
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you, Si Eon.

2018
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:19,289
(Si Eon gives him a drink
to celebrate his birthday.)

2019
01:26:19,489 --> 01:26:20,930
We're here...

2020
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:23,199
in Feru to celebrate your...
Is it with a P?

2021
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,630
- Peru.
- We celebrate it in Peru.

2022
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:27,399
- Go, Inca.
- Inca.

2023
01:26:27,399 --> 01:26:28,529
(Cheers.)

2024
01:26:28,529 --> 01:26:30,439
(Drinking up)

2025
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,569
It was so good.

2026
01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:35,039
Kian84, it also has beef.

2027
01:26:35,210 --> 01:26:36,380
Oh, my.

2028
01:26:37,479 --> 01:26:38,739
Seriously, Si Eon.

2029
01:26:39,479 --> 01:26:41,550
Do you know you get sweeter every time?

2030
01:26:41,550 --> 01:26:42,880
He's grumpy and also sweet.

2031
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:44,380
Why do you become nicer?

2032
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:47,319
When you get old, you become mellow.

2033
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:50,920
I can't eat the ramyeon
because of the seaweed soup.

2034
01:26:51,489 --> 01:26:54,529
(He loves the seaweed soup.)

2035
01:26:57,159 --> 01:26:58,159
It's good.

2036
01:26:58,159 --> 01:26:59,430
- Right?
- Yes.

2037
01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:02,869
It would've been better
if I had boiled a little longer.

2038
01:27:02,869 --> 01:27:04,300
I love seaweed soup.

2039
01:27:05,569 --> 01:27:08,210
(How is the ramyeon?)

2040
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:09,579
It must be so good.

2041
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:12,279
- Gosh.
- I wish I was there with them.

2042
01:27:12,279 --> 01:27:13,949
It's driving me crazy.

2043
01:27:16,050 --> 01:27:17,350
(Si Eon inhales his food
as if he's been starving.)

2044
01:27:17,350 --> 01:27:18,979
It looks so good.

2045
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:21,149
It must be delicious.

2046
01:27:21,850 --> 01:27:23,359
(I'm hungry.)

2047
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:26,430
(They're only licking their lips.)

2048
01:27:26,630 --> 01:27:28,090
(Well...)

2049
01:27:28,659 --> 01:27:30,500
You're all hungry, aren't you?

2050
01:27:30,500 --> 01:27:31,930
Yes, I'm a little hungry.

2051
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:34,670
- Me too.
- I knew you would, so I brought this.

2052
01:27:34,670 --> 01:27:35,930
You brought something for us?

2053
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:37,340
Aren't you hungry?

2054
01:27:37,340 --> 01:27:38,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

2055
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,109
Here.

2056
01:27:40,109 --> 01:27:41,810
- It's not that much.
- Is it...

2057
01:27:42,210 --> 01:27:44,210
- All right.
- It's a famous brand.

2058
01:27:44,210 --> 01:27:45,579
Yes. It's well-known.

2059
01:27:45,579 --> 01:27:47,579
I like basic porridge.

2060
01:27:47,579 --> 01:27:49,079
- Red bean porridge.
- It's red bean porridge.

2061
01:27:49,649 --> 01:27:52,020
Dongji is right around the corner.

2062
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:54,750
Well, it's a holiday.

2063
01:27:55,189 --> 01:27:56,890
We eat red bean porridge on Dongji.

2064
01:27:56,890 --> 01:27:58,319
- Right.
- Is it a holiday?

2065
01:27:58,319 --> 01:27:59,560
It is not.

2066
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:01,960
On Dongji, we eat red bean porridge...

2067
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:05,560
to remove bad luck and bring happiness.

2068
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:08,829
- You know a lot about it.
- How considerate Kian84 is.

2069
01:28:09,229 --> 01:28:10,670
He's indeed thoughtful.

2070
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:11,869
I know.

2071
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:14,369
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2072
01:28:14,369 --> 01:28:16,680
- It's good.
- It's tasty. It has rice cake balls too.

2073
01:28:16,680 --> 01:28:18,340
The portion is big too.

2074
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:20,079
- It's delicious.
- It is?

2075
01:28:21,710 --> 01:28:24,380
Everyone, since we had
porridge for Dongji,

2076
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:25,880
let's be happy next year.

2077
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,489
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2078
01:28:27,489 --> 01:28:29,319
- Go away, bad luck!
- Full of happiness.

2079
01:28:32,890 --> 01:28:34,130
(They had been missing
Korean spicy foods.)

2080
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:35,859
It's so good.

2081
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,560
I feel like we're back in Korea.

2082
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:41,500
- This seaweed soup...
- Isn't it good?

2083
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,569
I like it better than the ramyeon.

2084
01:28:43,569 --> 01:28:44,840
(They're getting even closer tonight.)

2085
01:28:46,869 --> 01:28:52,439
(They started traveling in Cusco
in a good mood without any plans.)

2086
01:28:54,409 --> 01:28:55,510
(But that mood didn't last long.)

2087
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:57,020
(Don't do it.
Take a picture of this first.)

2088
01:28:57,020 --> 01:29:00,149
(Si Eon, can we drop by
the cathedral later?)

2089
01:29:00,149 --> 01:29:01,520
(Hold on.)

2090
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:04,159
(They start to disagree
with each other...)

2091
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:06,329
(little by little.)

2092
01:29:06,329 --> 01:29:07,789
(How about we make a fire...)

2093
01:29:07,789 --> 01:29:08,829
(and sleep on the street once?)

2094
01:29:08,829 --> 01:29:10,899
I'm a little worried
about the staff, though.

2095
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:12,460
(So you want to sleep outside.)

2096
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:15,170
(- Whether it's a tent...
- But we don't have a tent.)

2097
01:29:15,170 --> 01:29:16,840
(You build a fire and sleep.)

2098
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:19,840
(Kian84, we can't sleep like that.)

2099
01:29:21,340 --> 01:29:24,710
(They begin to hurt
each other's feelings.)

2100
01:29:25,779 --> 01:29:28,579
(You shock me
whenever you say things like that.)

2101
01:29:29,079 --> 01:29:31,149
(Don't say that again.)

2102
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:33,489
(I don't deserve to hear that from you.)

2103
01:29:36,619 --> 01:29:39,760
(To be honest,
I felt a little frustrated at the time.)

2104
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:42,090
(He doesn't seem to have a plan either.)

2105
01:29:42,090 --> 01:29:44,300
(Thinking about it makes me mad again.)

2106
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,699
(He knew he wouldn't do it
and it wouldn't work.)

2107
01:29:46,699 --> 01:29:48,130
(Why does he even suggest it?)

2108
01:29:48,670 --> 01:29:51,100
(I couldn't really talk to him anymore.)

2109
01:29:52,300 --> 01:29:55,840
(I thought we might stop
being friends at this rate.)

2110
01:29:57,939 --> 01:29:59,340
(Kian84, let's stop.)

2111
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:02,649
(It might have been a hint.)

2112
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:07,350
(How they felt
when they almost ruined their friendship)

2113
01:30:07,350 --> 01:30:09,619
(To save the guys' friendship,)

2114
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:11,460
(Pani Bottle is here.)

2115
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,689
(As they don't speak foreign languages,)

2116
01:30:14,829 --> 01:30:16,729
(he'll be their translator.)

2117
01:30:16,729 --> 01:30:17,729
(He's so cool.)

2118
01:30:18,029 --> 01:30:20,029
(He also eases the tension
between the two...)

2119
01:30:20,029 --> 01:30:23,000
(as the life of the party.)

2120
01:30:23,470 --> 01:30:25,239
(If you mess with them,)

2121
01:30:25,239 --> 01:30:27,569
(I, Chihuahua, won't stay still.)

2122
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:29,810
(Look forward to Pani Bottle's role.)

2123
01:30:30,039 --> 01:30:31,039
(Adventure by Accident)
