1
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:12,299
(This house feels
like grandma will be waiting...)

2
00:00:12,999 --> 00:00:15,639
(out front with her arms open for a hug.)

3
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:17,100
It's Lunar New Year's Day today, right?

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,200
Yes, that's right.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,110
Should we all do a bow?

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,370
- Sure.
- That sounds good.

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,379
- Let's all bow.
- One, two, three.

8
00:00:23,379 --> 00:00:26,149
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

9
00:00:26,149 --> 00:00:28,849
(Cramped)

10
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:31,480
Happy New Year, everyone.

11
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,619
- Happy New Year.
- Thank you.

12
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:35,290
- Happy New Year.
- The holidays are so nice.

13
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:37,489
- Happy New Year.
- Give me allowance, please.

14
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,759
The concept for today
is visiting Kian84's relatives.

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,930
(They found a place in the Amazon
that felt like Kian84's relative's house.)

16
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,969
(He mentioned his old relative's house
in Bolivia as well.)

17
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:50,939
Is this similar, Kian84?

18
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:54,140
- Yes, that's right. It must be.
- So that's the concept for today.

19
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,240
It has an old, homey mood.

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,079
Everyone. You can't see outside right now,
but it has that old, homey feeling.

21
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:01,049
My grandma's old house
was really similar to this.

22
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:02,380
- It was made of red clay.
- Oh, really?

23
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,680
The floors are the same.
It's all very similar.

24
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,420
So we met last year.

25
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,790
Adventure by Accident, which is receiving
lots of love this year as well,

26
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,519
will have its last journey today.

27
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,559
Instead of Seung Hoon,
we're joined by Pani Bottle today.

28
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:17,899
Yes. Thankfully, I got back to Korea
from overseas just two days ago.

29
00:01:17,899 --> 00:01:20,169
You'll fill
Seung Hoon's shoes today, right?

30
00:01:20,169 --> 00:01:21,470
I'll try my best.

31
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:23,300
Or fill his bottle?

32
00:01:24,899 --> 00:01:26,369
You're the king of puns.

33
00:01:26,839 --> 00:01:31,210
How has the response been
since you've been on this show?

34
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,580
My relatives...

35
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,249
contacted me a lot. It felt like I got
the top score in Korea on some test.

36
00:01:36,249 --> 00:01:39,249
When I was doing YouTube,
they just said I got a bit famous.

37
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:41,949
I went to the MBC Entertainment Awards
because of Adventure by Accident.

38
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,119
(Stealing our attention...)

39
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:47,059
(from behind the Saint Yu)

40
00:01:47,229 --> 00:01:49,100
I kept being shown on camera
from behind Mr. Yu Jae Seok.

41
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,059
My friends contacted me a lot
because of that.

42
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:53,930
- I see.
- Those kinds of things were different.

43
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,699
- You're a good son.
- You really are.

44
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:56,699
Right.

45
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,121
Right now, I'm walking over
from Porfi's house...

46
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,690
to the starting point of the zipline.

47
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:06,530
If there was no zipline,

48
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,771
the kids would have to walk all this way.

49
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,271
(A cliff)

50
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,111
When I first went, Porfi came with me.

51
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,310
He did so the first time, but I felt bad.

52
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,641
So I told him to go ahead
and said I would go on my own.

53
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:23,910
I'm gasping for breath
because it's tiring.

54
00:04:24,451 --> 00:04:27,780
It would be impossible
to walk two hours to go to school.

55
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:33,021
Gosh. Was it this far last time?

56
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:35,660
Gosh. I'm sweating so much.

57
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:36,991
Oh, no.

58
00:04:37,231 --> 00:04:39,461
I can see why they need the zipline.

59
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,931
There's no other choice.

60
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:43,600
(Gasping)

61
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,201
I walked so much
that my hat got completely drenched.

62
00:04:47,241 --> 00:04:48,271
Can you see?

63
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:49,410
(Drenched in sweat)

64
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:50,810
- It's completely drenched.
- So when you...

65
00:04:51,111 --> 00:04:52,810
walk down this way,

66
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,081
you can see the friend who likes Messi.

67
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,910
This is Porfi Junior's elementary school.

68
00:04:57,981 --> 00:04:59,581
- Is this a school?
- Yes.

69
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:01,451
I wanted to take Porfi Junior out...

70
00:05:01,451 --> 00:05:02,891
for a meal.

71
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:04,090
Go downtown.

72
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,961
There are dogs everywhere in Bolivia.

73
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,290
So cute.

74
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:09,491
(Hello.)

75
00:05:09,931 --> 00:05:13,060
I think this is the teachers' room.

76
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,600
(A teachers' room
in a Bolivian elementary school)

77
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:15,970
They're in class right now.

78
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,570
(Class is still going on.)

79
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,371
(Tiptoeing)

80
00:05:20,671 --> 00:05:23,070
(Peaking in)

81
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:25,111
I'll wait for their class to end.

82
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:29,081
I can't disturb their class.

83
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:31,280
(Is he waiting too?)

84
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,151
What is that guy doing?
Why isn't he in class?

85
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:34,651
I think he forgot to bring
his school supplies.

86
00:05:34,651 --> 00:05:36,151
I think he was standing outside
as punishment.

87
00:05:36,151 --> 00:05:37,590
- He's being punished.
- I think he was being punished.

88
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,690
Hey. Why do you have something
on your face?

89
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,130
(Wiping it off)

90
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:46,461
(Ignoring)

91
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:48,361
(Slowly walking away)

92
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,130
(Embarrassed)

93
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:55,100
(His lonely wait continues.)

94
00:05:56,671 --> 00:05:57,741
Porfi.

95
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:58,741
(Finally, Porfi Junior
comes out of class.)

96
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,581
Okay. Let's go.

97
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:02,280
Their class ended early.

98
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,880
So I took Porfi Junior downtown.

99
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,320
(A trip downtown with Porfi Junior,
who is now done with class)

100
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,981
Wait for me, Porfi.

101
00:06:08,081 --> 00:06:09,220
(Spinning)

102
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,551
Let's ride in the car.

103
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:13,790
(They can ride in a car from here.)

104
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:15,660
We should put on our seat belts.

105
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:19,100
What is this?

106
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:20,901
(Struggling)

107
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,531
(Laughing out of surprise)

108
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:23,801
The seat belt has no buckle.

109
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,171
What do you do if there's no buckle?

110
00:06:26,371 --> 00:06:27,801
Hold it, Porfi.

111
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:29,471
(He found the buckle.)

112
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,241
(Trying hard)

113
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,810
I guess they just don't use seat belts.

114
00:06:34,981 --> 00:06:35,981
Gosh.

115
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:38,411
They don't really put on their seat belts.

116
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:40,281
Right. We saw a lot of seat belts
that didn't work.

117
00:06:41,181 --> 00:06:42,181
Okay.

118
00:06:42,791 --> 00:06:44,250
Good.

119
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,760
They don't call that place
Death Road for no reason.

120
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,491
Yes. You must put on your seat belt.

121
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,431
(Communicating through a translation app)

122
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,760
Read it.

123
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,541
I'm going to buy you a gift
before I leave.

124
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:03,710
Yes. I want to buy you a gift
before I leave.

125
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:07,111
- Okay? Do you like that?
- You're a good uncle.

126
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:09,911
Write what you want.

127
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:13,051
(Staring)

128
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,991
(Porfi Junior has a hard time
writing something down.)

129
00:07:15,991 --> 00:07:18,450
Present.

130
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:20,791
Something you want.

131
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:22,390
Tell me your wish.

132
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,900
- Why are you rapping suddenly?
- I thought you were rapping.

133
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,900
Tell me your wish

134
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:32,171
A present that you want.

135
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:33,400
Write it down.

136
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,200
(Understood.)

137
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,210
His desires?

138
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,411
(What does
a Bolivian elementary school kid desire?)

139
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:39,940
What will it be? I'm curious.

140
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,080
A gaming device?

141
00:07:43,111 --> 00:07:44,150
Book?

142
00:07:44,851 --> 00:07:46,320
You're going to be successful.

143
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,721
Books? Notebook?

144
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:50,291
- A book?
- He wants a book.

145
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:52,250
(A praiseworthy answer
that none of them expected)

146
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:53,390
What a good kid.

147
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,291
I was going to buy you something nice.
Why a notebook?

148
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,291
(Kian84 is not satisfied
with the academic item.)

149
00:07:57,431 --> 00:07:58,731
What about a gaming device or something?

150
00:07:58,991 --> 00:08:00,101
Okay. Let's go.

151
00:08:00,101 --> 00:08:01,731
I wanted to buy something nice.

152
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:03,101
(Porfi's house, Destination)

153
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:06,241
(One hour)

154
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:07,940
(One hour)

155
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:11,310
It took almost two hours
for us to come around.

156
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:15,181
When Porfi gets here,

157
00:08:15,181 --> 00:08:18,210
we'll go buy a gift for Porfi Junior
before I leave.

158
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:20,421
I don't want to say goodbye with nothing.

159
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:22,150
(He's planning to go shopping downtown
with Porfi and Porfi Junior.)

160
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,291
Porfi!

161
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:28,890
(Shaking the zipline)

162
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,931
(Hurry)

163
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:32,500
They send signals that way.

164
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,000
- Does it work?
- Yes. If you hit it,

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,460
the sound gets sent to the other side.

166
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,070
- Really?
- Oh, my.

167
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,200
- It's like the paper cup...
- Right.

168
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,741
(The movement of sound waves
we learned about as kids)

169
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:41,841
That's really interesting.

170
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,510
Porfi!

171
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:46,341
(Quiet)

172
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:47,341
Is he coming?

173
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:50,580
He's coming.

174
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,281
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

175
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,781
(Did you call me, Kian84?)

176
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:54,921
He's like Superman.

177
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:56,820
(Porfi's house, Destination, 20 seconds)

178
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,791
Porfi is a master.

179
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:00,921
He doesn't stop in the middle.
He can cross in one go.

180
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,731
(You admit this is nice, right?)

181
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,791
(I admit it.)

182
00:09:07,101 --> 00:09:08,200
Kian84.

183
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,931
Hello, Kian84.

184
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:12,231
Let's go to Coroico.

185
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,101
Let's go.

186
00:09:21,051 --> 00:09:22,221
Gosh, it's hot.

187
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:26,531
(They take off to Coroico
with Porfi and Porfi Junior.)

188
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:31,830
Coroico. Finish. Lunch?

189
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,371
(Lunch? Okay.)

190
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,200
Hungry.

191
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,640
You two became close just after one night.

192
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,341
It looks like an amusement park.

193
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:46,950
(Downtown comes into view.)

194
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:49,080
We're almost at Coroico.

195
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,020
Gosh. This is nice.

196
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,861
Gosh. That view.

197
00:09:56,861 --> 00:10:00,460
(Driving for 30 minutes from
Porfi's zipline, they arrive downtown.)

198
00:10:01,491 --> 00:10:04,161
Coroico is 1,700m above sea level,

199
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:07,200
and it's in the middle of the Andes.

200
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,741
Tourists that come to Death Road
stop by this town.

201
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:12,140
That's why it's called "Tourist Town."

202
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:14,971
It looks so cool from afar.

203
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:16,111
(Coroico, a garden in the sky
that's hugging a snowy mountain)

204
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:17,210
It's so cool.

205
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,051
We should've gone there.

206
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,551
We just fought with some lady.

207
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:25,281
Don't touch our camera.

208
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:28,221
So is that the Andes?

209
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:29,260
Yes.

210
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,591
That's the Andes?

211
00:10:30,591 --> 00:10:32,231
That's the Andes?

212
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:33,460
Really?

213
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,060
So that's what we saw there?

214
00:10:36,301 --> 00:10:38,460
We went to the Andes.

215
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,101
You remember seeing the Andes, right?

216
00:10:40,101 --> 00:10:41,971
- I remember seeing it.
- Right.

217
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:43,971
We're guys who went to the Andes.

218
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:46,341
- How impressive.
- I'm jealous.

219
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:48,471
We arrived in Coroico.

220
00:10:48,471 --> 00:10:50,241
It took three hours to get here.

221
00:10:50,241 --> 00:10:52,081
- Coroico.
- Right, we're in Coroico.

222
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:53,981
Since we're hungry, let's eat.

223
00:10:53,981 --> 00:10:55,311
- Hungry.
- Yes.

224
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,520
(Is it my turn?)

225
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,150
We're in Coroico.

226
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:03,561
Coroico is the old capital,
and there used to be lots of silver.

227
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:05,020
(Doesn't understand)

228
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:12,400
That church you see over there
is Coroico's church of Saint Pedro.

229
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,371
So, everyone,

230
00:11:14,701 --> 00:11:15,941
- Porfi...
- Coroico.

231
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:17,500
is very talkative.

232
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:20,811
(A natural tour guide)

233
00:11:20,811 --> 00:11:21,910
He...

234
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:25,481
- is so...
- He wants to tell you a lot of things.

235
00:11:25,481 --> 00:11:26,481
talkative.

236
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:29,221
What about the present?

237
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,081
How about this?

238
00:11:31,221 --> 00:11:34,691
- Porfi.
- I'm going to buy you a gift, so pick.

239
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,321
There's a stationery store.

240
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,991
He must like soccer balls.

241
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:39,660
What about a soccer ball?

242
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,961
(The first thing he picks)

243
00:11:41,961 --> 00:11:43,561
- Pen.
- Pen?

244
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,900
Pen? Okay.

245
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,331
Give us that and some watercolor paint.

246
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,471
- Oh, paint.
- Or crayons?

247
00:11:49,941 --> 00:11:52,101
Because Junior...

248
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:54,841
likes drawing.

249
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:56,010
He's good.

250
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,581
(Opening the showcase)

251
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:58,811
Paint?

252
00:11:59,581 --> 00:12:01,211
Or crayons?

253
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,981
I should get him some crayons.

254
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,691
These will be good.

255
00:12:07,321 --> 00:12:09,091
He said he needed notebooks.

256
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:10,160
Note?

257
00:12:11,461 --> 00:12:13,331
The owner probably sold enough
for the whole day.

258
00:12:13,461 --> 00:12:15,561
- All?
- Yes, all.

259
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,231
What a nice uncle.

260
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,701
Pick more. What do you need?

261
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,300
(Hesitating)

262
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:23,300
What about this?
Don't you need something like this?

263
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,741
(Porfi Junior is hesitating)

264
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:28,270
This? Okay. Nice.

265
00:12:28,371 --> 00:12:30,711
All of the notebooks here are lined.

266
00:12:30,711 --> 00:12:32,280
Ones without lines are better.

267
00:12:35,451 --> 00:12:39,650
(I feel so happy.)

268
00:12:39,721 --> 00:12:41,191
(He's suddenly singing?)

269
00:12:41,191 --> 00:12:43,621
Suddenly? I thought this was a musical.

270
00:12:43,621 --> 00:12:46,890
I don't think Porfi likes silent moments.

271
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,930
(Make some noise.)

272
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:51,130
(I'm so happy that you came.)

273
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,270
- Porfi.
- Yes?

274
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,331
Okay. I see.

275
00:12:54,331 --> 00:12:55,670
(Hugging, Touched)

276
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:57,571
It feels good.

277
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,341
I'm tired.

278
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,540
He must be the expressive type.

279
00:13:01,941 --> 00:13:03,611
How much in total?

280
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,280
It's 236 bolivianos.

281
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,680
This must be pretty expensive
since it's imported.

282
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,780
(Expensive imported color pencils)

283
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,750
Thank you.

284
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,951
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

285
00:13:14,951 --> 00:13:16,121
Sure. Thank you.

286
00:13:16,121 --> 00:13:17,591
(Hugging)

287
00:13:17,591 --> 00:13:18,691
Let's go buy a soccer ball.

288
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:20,491
He's cute like a nephew.

289
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:22,561
You want to buy everything for him
if he's cute.

290
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:26,000
(They finish stationery shopping.)

291
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,300
Watch out for the cars.

292
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,701
There's a car coming.

293
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,971
Porfirio. Soccer.

294
00:13:34,371 --> 00:13:36,581
The shopping isn't over yet.

295
00:13:37,611 --> 00:13:38,711
Excuse me.

296
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,750
Soccer...

297
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:43,121
Soccer ball.

298
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,851
(For the second son...)

299
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:48,721
(who likes soccer and is a fan of Messi,)

300
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:51,920
(he wants to buy a soccer ball.)

301
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:53,991
They have a lot of good stuff here.

302
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,101
Is this real?

303
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,170
Or is it a copy?

304
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,371
- No.
- No?

305
00:14:00,371 --> 00:14:01,430
A copy?

306
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,071
It's okay. It's the same when you use it.

307
00:14:04,071 --> 00:14:05,400
You have no choice.

308
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,670
This is cool. Do you want to try it on?

309
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:10,040
Try it on.

310
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,311
(He tries the Nike bag.)

311
00:14:14,111 --> 00:14:15,280
(It suits him perfectly.)

312
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,581
Good. It looks nice.

313
00:14:17,351 --> 00:14:20,250
Let's buy one for his brother too.

314
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,020
Should we buy the red bag for his brother?

315
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,920
The red bag looks nice.

316
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:29,130
(He only brought one bag with him,)

317
00:14:29,731 --> 00:14:33,571
(but he takes care
of the brothers attentively.)

318
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:35,300
I could understand...

319
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,770
why uncles give allowances and buy stuff
for their nephews and nieces.

320
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:41,170
Hold on.

321
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:43,211
(She notices a big spender
and prepares one more.)

322
00:14:44,611 --> 00:14:46,410
No. I'll buy this Nike bag.

323
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:49,520
I know what the kids like.
I should buy Nike.

324
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,680
Of course. They like branded bags.

325
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,150
This one, this one, and...

326
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,621
There are a lot
of good soccer balls inside.

327
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,991
I'm going to buy Porfi's present
before I leave.

328
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,861
Is this real?

329
00:15:05,701 --> 00:15:07,331
- Yes.
- Really?

330
00:15:07,331 --> 00:15:09,900
- That must be genuine.
- The balls look like genuine products.

331
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,800
Did she lie when it's fake?

332
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,040
This is genuine.

333
00:15:14,471 --> 00:15:15,640
It's genuine?

334
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,611
- Is it the mark for genuine products?
- It really is genuine.

335
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:20,280
This costs around 30 dollars.

336
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,050
I'll have one, please.

337
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:25,680
(That one.)

338
00:15:27,721 --> 00:15:30,061
The ball is genuine.

339
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:32,361
You can't kick a fake ball.

340
00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:35,731
It's 275 bolivianos, okay.

341
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:36,900
(2 bags and 1 soccer ball cost
275 bolivianos, about 50 dollars.)

342
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:38,430
(Surprised)

343
00:15:38,831 --> 00:15:41,900
Here. I'm short five bolivianos.

344
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,371
Can you give me a discount?

345
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,040
- Five bolivianos?
- Okay.

346
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,211
- Can you give me a discount?
- Okay.

347
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,670
Okay? Okay, thank you.

348
00:15:48,971 --> 00:15:50,111
Five bolivianos.

349
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,811
Yes.

350
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,711
(Kicking)

351
00:15:54,851 --> 00:15:56,880
- You like the ball, right?
- He must like it.

352
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,221
- He keeps kicking it.
- He likes it.

353
00:15:58,981 --> 00:16:00,520
Okay. Let's go eat.

354
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,091
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

355
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:03,420
Let's go eat.

356
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,390
You must've felt proud.

357
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,461
Let's go.

358
00:16:07,461 --> 00:16:09,701
(They finish shopping
with both hands full.)

359
00:16:09,701 --> 00:16:10,760
Porfi.

360
00:16:11,201 --> 00:16:13,270
(Kicking)

361
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,701
He loves it.

362
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:17,101
This is the most expensive ball.

363
00:16:17,741 --> 00:16:19,071
I feel so proud.

364
00:16:19,071 --> 00:16:20,571
(I'll use it well, Uncle.)

365
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:21,640
So cute.

366
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:24,010
He must love it. He keeps kicking it.

367
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,581
- Thank goodness I bought it for him.
- My goodness.

368
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:30,050
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

369
00:16:30,981 --> 00:16:33,750
"Pizzeria?"

370
00:16:34,351 --> 00:16:36,260
Pizza?

371
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,321
Okay, let's go.

372
00:16:37,321 --> 00:16:38,390
- Pizza.
- Let's go.

373
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,491
Pizza sounds good.

374
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,260
- One vegetable pizza.
- One vegetable pizza.

375
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,530
Omelet.

376
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,561
- Omelet.
- Yes.

377
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:46,000
One, and for drinks...

378
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,871
- Three.
- Three.

379
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,800
Is there a pencil?

380
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,371
It's a pen. A pencil.

381
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,341
- You want to draw for him?
- Yes.

382
00:16:57,341 --> 00:16:59,550
I'll sketch you.

383
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,650
I'll draw your portrait.

384
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,020
Porfirio, see here.

385
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,591
(Look over there.)

386
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,221
And stay still, okay?

387
00:17:09,221 --> 00:17:11,121
Okay. Don't move.

388
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,030
(Frozen)

389
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:16,000
He's so cute, doing what he's told.

390
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,130
Endure it for a bit.
It's hard to be a model.

391
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,331
He's cute.

392
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,430
(Trembling)

393
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:24,540
Since it's hard for you, let's do this.

394
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:26,571
Wait.

395
00:17:27,241 --> 00:17:28,971
I'll draw you properly.

396
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,581
I'll take a picture of you.

397
00:17:31,311 --> 00:17:32,951
Look.

398
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:35,451
Smile.

399
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,920
(Laughing)

400
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,390
He's nervous. So cute.

401
00:17:39,691 --> 00:17:40,890
Look here.

402
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:42,390
(Laughing)

403
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,821
That's right.

404
00:17:44,821 --> 00:17:46,461
Okay. He smiled.

405
00:17:47,491 --> 00:17:49,601
(Pineapple juice is served first.)

406
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:50,731
Three.

407
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,770
It's no joke.

408
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,231
- He took pictures.
- That's a lot.

409
00:17:54,971 --> 00:17:57,670
Hold on. I'll draw comfortably.

410
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:04,081
(In a pizza restaurant in Coroico,)

411
00:18:04,481 --> 00:18:07,311
(a man is setting his artistic soul
on fire.)

412
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,821
(Adding a spoonful of passion...)

413
00:18:09,821 --> 00:18:12,221
(onto the boy's face)

414
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:14,821
- You're the best uncle.
- I should've taken a photo of his face...

415
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:15,851
to draw from the beginning.

416
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:17,821
(Meanwhile, the food is served first.)

417
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:20,991
That's the omelet.

418
00:18:21,691 --> 00:18:23,130
It looks good.

419
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:25,630
- Let's eat, Kian84.
- Okay.

420
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,601
You guys eat first.

421
00:18:28,101 --> 00:18:29,231
(Quite an old-fashioned way of saying)

422
00:18:29,231 --> 00:18:30,571
"You guys eat first."

423
00:18:30,571 --> 00:18:33,910
- Kian84. You ordered.
- You guys eat first.

424
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:35,611
Okay.

425
00:18:35,611 --> 00:18:37,380
(His hands are moving separately
from his mouth.)

426
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,451
- Gosh, they must be hungry.
- They're waiting for him.

427
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,981
Exactly. They finished the juice.

428
00:18:40,981 --> 00:18:43,621
They want to eat with him.

429
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,180
Eat first. Why aren't you eating?

430
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,020
We'll eat when you come here.

431
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,020
Eat first.

432
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,621
(He joins them only then.)

433
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:50,660
Eat.

434
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:52,660
Eat up.

435
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,130
(He serves Porfi Junior first.)

436
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:56,430
- Enjoy your food.
- I'm hungry.

437
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:58,331
- It looks good.
- Thank you.

438
00:18:58,331 --> 00:18:59,331
(He takes a big bite.)

439
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:03,140
(After seeing Kian84 eat,)

440
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,601
The seasoning is less strong.

441
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:07,910
(Porfi Junior starts eating comfortably.)

442
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,981
Do you like pizza?

443
00:19:10,981 --> 00:19:12,280
- Yes.
- You like pizza?

444
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,220
(Since I saw you eat well, I'll be off.)

445
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:17,920
His passion.

446
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,220
(He shoves everything in at once
and goes back to his work table.)

447
00:19:20,621 --> 00:19:22,960
(Fascinated)

448
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,960
- He wants to complete it no matter what.
- That's right.

449
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,390
He's nice.

450
00:19:29,801 --> 00:19:30,930
Porfi.

451
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,400
(How's the end product?)

452
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:35,031
(His portrait is finally complete.)

453
00:19:35,031 --> 00:19:36,900
It's my present. This is you.

454
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,371
(Looking carefully)

455
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:39,740
Porfi, let's hold it and take a photo.

456
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,571
Yes, hold it and take a photo.

457
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:43,980
(It looks exactly like him.)

458
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,541
- My goodness.
- You drew well.

459
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,180
How nice.

460
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:49,650
I did everything I could do for him.

461
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:52,081
(Pinching)

462
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,751
You're so cute.

463
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:54,920
(Grinning)

464
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,890
He likes it. His face lit up.

465
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,490
(The first portrait in his life)

466
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,230
You're an uncle with a lot of talents.

467
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,761
This is my autograph.

468
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,900
Kian84. My autograph...

469
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,771
- to Porfirio.
- Porfirio.

470
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:12,640
October 26, 2022.

471
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,341
- Make sure to keep it, okay?
- Thank you.

472
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:16,740
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

473
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,541
- Thank you.
- It's a happy moment.

474
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,011
(This is a happy moment!)

475
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:21,511
Happy moment. Let's go.

476
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,420
(They filled up their stomachs as well.)

477
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,150
Porfi, soccer?

478
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,561
- Now, that place is...
- The soccer field is managed well.

479
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:38,031
I played soccer with him for the last time
before I left.

480
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:40,970
South Americans are always serious
when it comes to soccer.

481
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,200
- That's right.
- They always have grass fields.

482
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,240
Conduct the opening ceremony.

483
00:20:46,071 --> 00:20:49,111
Porfi unwraps the ball.

484
00:20:49,111 --> 00:20:50,680
(He unwraps the new soccer ball himself.)

485
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,910
It's a new ball.

486
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,751
Porfi, want to play a game of soccer?

487
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:57,051
- A game of soccer?
- Sure.

488
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,551
Okay.

489
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:02,821
(A soccer match beyond age and borders)

490
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,220
Porfirio. Shoot the ball.

491
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:11,960
(Bolivia's little Messi's...)

492
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,271
(strong shooting)

493
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,371
(It could be their first
and last time playing together,)

494
00:21:17,371 --> 00:21:20,341
(but Uncle Kian84 plays with him
as much as he can.)

495
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:25,341
He's a friend who is of the same age
as me on the other side of the world.

496
00:21:27,081 --> 00:21:29,081
(The meeting of two people...)

497
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:32,021
(whose countries
and languages are completely different)

498
00:21:33,051 --> 00:21:37,291
(Despite that, they're friends
of the same age who get along well.)

499
00:21:37,821 --> 00:21:39,630
(Thanks to that,
since the first day they met,)

500
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:42,690
(they had a heart-to-heart talk.)

501
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,531
(The world of my friend...)

502
00:21:45,531 --> 00:21:48,470
(which is very different from mine)

503
00:21:49,301 --> 00:21:52,541
(The world which is very humane)

504
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,581
(Thank you for letting me experience it.)

505
00:21:56,811 --> 00:22:00,180
If you have good energy,

506
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:03,321
things will work out well.

507
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:06,390
One day, I want to go...

508
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:10,761
and meet Kian84 in a joyous manner.

509
00:22:11,261 --> 00:22:13,960
Porfi must've been very sad when you left.

510
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,960
It was nice getting to know
and spending time with Kian84.

511
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,531
I hope this becomes a good memory for you.

512
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,700
I'll root for you.

513
00:22:23,271 --> 00:22:24,771
- I'll never forget you.
- Yes.

514
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,210
(High-five)

515
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,111
He asked first.

516
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:33,011
He must've really liked you.

517
00:22:33,011 --> 00:22:35,180
(A sad farewell at the end of meeting)

518
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,751
Bye.

519
00:22:38,251 --> 00:22:40,021
He waves for you until the end.

520
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:44,720
It feels rather odd.

521
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,190
It feels odd.

522
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:50,160
To think that I can't see him anymore...

523
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,160
(He's different from me,
but he's like me.)

524
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:55,970
(My friend on the other side of the earth.
Porfi, goodbye!)

525
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,101
I really hope he comes to meet you.

526
00:22:58,101 --> 00:22:59,440
Porfi, come in!

527
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,210
He's here.

528
00:23:02,571 --> 00:23:04,581
Is that why we're shooting here?

529
00:23:04,581 --> 00:23:06,281
"Korea by Accident."

530
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:08,150
He'll come in saying "thank you."

531
00:23:09,011 --> 00:23:13,720
The best experiences
of the trip were things like that.

532
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,261
Communicating with the locals.

533
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:20,960
Following the fixed route...

534
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,130
and visiting tourist spots are good too,

535
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:24,900
but I got absorbed into their culture.

536
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,400
That's right.

537
00:23:26,501 --> 00:23:29,230
You must miss him. Say a word to Porfi.

538
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,670
Yes, a video message.

539
00:23:30,841 --> 00:23:33,940
Yes. Porfi, how are you doing?

540
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:37,880
I think you're really mature and cool.

541
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,541
I'll root for you.

542
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:40,851
We only live once.

543
00:23:41,511 --> 00:23:42,910
Let's live without regrets.

544
00:23:43,281 --> 00:23:45,281
Why are you already thinking of dying?

545
00:23:46,121 --> 00:23:47,190
Thank you.

546
00:23:47,791 --> 00:23:48,851
It's really good.

547
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:52,220
The lodging was the best.

548
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,261
I slept really well too.

549
00:23:53,261 --> 00:23:55,160
That was great.

550
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:57,801
- I like cable cars.
- Are we taking it again?

551
00:23:58,561 --> 00:24:01,301
(They head to the city center of La Paz.)

552
00:24:01,601 --> 00:24:03,740
- Since today is my birthday,
- That day was?

553
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,440
- That's right, it was his birthday.
- why don't we go to a Korean restaurant?

554
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:07,710
Do as you wish.

555
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,210
And I want to do a live stream.

556
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:10,680
I do a live stream on my birthday.

557
00:24:11,011 --> 00:24:13,551
(A live stream is a must-do event
on his birthday.)

558
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,950
(Every year on his birthday
around the world,)

559
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:20,220
(Pani Bottle did a live stream.)

560
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:22,821
We'll go back...

561
00:24:23,591 --> 00:24:26,591
to the city we were in yesterday
and look for a Korean restaurant.

562
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:29,531
There's a couple over there.
A Bolivian couple.

563
00:24:30,061 --> 00:24:31,601
They're hugging tight.

564
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:33,501
They're very open-minded.

565
00:24:33,801 --> 00:24:36,170
They show affection on the streets.

566
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,900
Don't Koreans also do that much?

567
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,041
I've never done it before.

568
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:41,511
(Confucian ideals formed
from the lack of experience)

569
00:24:41,511 --> 00:24:42,571
I've never done it before.

570
00:24:42,571 --> 00:24:44,341
Since it's your birthday today,

571
00:24:44,341 --> 00:24:45,940
I'll hug you tight.

572
00:24:46,081 --> 00:24:47,851
- Will you do it?
- Of course.

573
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,220
- It's not that great.
- Stay still and don't move.

574
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:51,880
Got it?

575
00:24:53,251 --> 00:24:54,920
- Hello.
- Hello.

576
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,021
Are you a couple?

577
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,420
There are a lot of couples here.

578
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,061
- There are a lot...
- They're students.

579
00:25:00,061 --> 00:25:02,130
- of young couples.
- How dare young people date?

580
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,561
(He suddenly becomes mean.)

581
00:25:03,561 --> 00:25:04,960
You don't know how old they are.

582
00:25:05,761 --> 00:25:06,871
We're almost there.

583
00:25:07,001 --> 00:25:08,531
- This...
- There it is.

584
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,071
We already passed by it.

585
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:15,511
I'm back in La Paz.

586
00:25:16,611 --> 00:25:18,640
You guys don't know,

587
00:25:18,781 --> 00:25:22,311
but I drove for another eight hours.

588
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:25,751
It was all edited out,
but I drove for eight hours.

589
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,920
The smell of exhaust fumes
of La Paz is rather welcoming.

590
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:33,960
Today must be Pani Bottle's birthday.

591
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,801
"Don't give me birthday presents."

592
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,160
Then for his birthday present...

593
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,371
(He found out about his birthday
from his messenger's profile.)

594
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,001
I get to watch
a famous YouTuber's live stream.

595
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:45,670
I just started.

596
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:46,940
- You started?
- Yes.

597
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,341
Can you hear me?

598
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,541
- Can you hear me?
- You looked like a professional then.

599
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:53,180
Yes. He has 1.4 million subscribers.

600
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,210
Yes.

601
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:56,351
It's a birthday live stream
for the first time in a while.

602
00:25:56,781 --> 00:25:57,821
I'm getting disconnected?

603
00:25:58,351 --> 00:26:00,720
Is that so? I'm getting disconnected?
That's bad.

604
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,291
This is a Korean restaurant.

605
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,660
This is a Korean restaurant.

606
00:26:05,091 --> 00:26:06,930
I have a lot on my schedule.

607
00:26:07,291 --> 00:26:09,091
I need to shoot videos for YouTube,

608
00:26:09,091 --> 00:26:10,230
but I have no time.

609
00:26:10,531 --> 00:26:11,761
I look handsome?

610
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,301
You guys are so mean.

611
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,200
It's really funny and nice.

612
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:19,501
- It's comfortable and...
- Happy birthday

613
00:26:20,071 --> 00:26:22,011
Happy birthday, dear Pani Bottle

614
00:26:22,511 --> 00:26:25,210
- Happy birthday!
- Thank you.

615
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:27,611
- Happy birthday!
- My gosh.

616
00:26:28,081 --> 00:26:30,950
I told Kian84 to prepare in advance.

617
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,380
My gosh.

618
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,821
(Happy birthday to you)

619
00:26:37,861 --> 00:26:41,390
(The subscribers wish him
a happy birthday too.)

620
00:26:43,831 --> 00:26:45,460
You need to know this.

621
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:46,970
The live stream has bad resolution
from the slow Internet,

622
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,371
so they don't know who you are.

623
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:51,501
They don't know who you are.
"Who are they?" The resolution is...

624
00:26:51,501 --> 00:26:53,271
Hold on. How many people are watching?

625
00:26:53,271 --> 00:26:55,271
There are 1,600 people since it's morning.
Normally, more people join.

626
00:26:55,271 --> 00:26:57,511
- It's only 7:30 a.m.
- It's too early in the morning.

627
00:26:57,511 --> 00:27:00,051
It's 7:30 a.m.,
but 1,600 people are watching?

628
00:27:00,051 --> 00:27:01,351
It's disconnected again.

629
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:03,480
A lot of people will leave.

630
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,720
They come back in.

631
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:06,450
They come back in
even if it's disconnected.

632
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,220
Did you see the psychological warfare
of two famous YouTubers?

633
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,920
"A lot of people will leave."
"They come back in."

634
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:12,890
- "A lot will leave." "They come back in."
- No.

635
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,531
- This is...
- What's that?

636
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:17,160
"A small-scale businessman."

637
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,400
It is small.

638
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,230
At least make the logo big.

639
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,170
- It's not working well.
- What should we do about the Internet?

640
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:28,541
(They quickly went out and finished it.)

641
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:31,341
Pani Bottle, eat up.
This is your birthday dinner.

642
00:27:31,341 --> 00:27:32,940
- Thank you.
- What is this?

643
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:34,650
You do a lot of events in South America.

644
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,111
You're a birthday meal expert.

645
00:27:36,111 --> 00:27:37,220
This is Korean rice too.

646
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,851
I didn't know their birthdays were
so close to each other.

647
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:42,751
- Exactly.
- He just sets up birthday meals.

648
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,861
The chef cooks well.

649
00:27:44,861 --> 00:27:45,920
(Familiar taste in a foreign country)

650
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,730
The kimchi tastes really good.

651
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,861
(It tastes amazing.)

652
00:27:48,861 --> 00:27:52,361
The sodium
in kimchi is somewhat different.

653
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:55,331
It's nice.

654
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:56,801
What did you eat?

655
00:27:57,341 --> 00:28:00,170
Chicken grilled on rocks...

656
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,970
and grilled banana.

657
00:28:02,611 --> 00:28:05,910
People in this country grill bananas.

658
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,311
Kian84, don't go on solo trips now.

659
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,410
Of course.

660
00:28:09,581 --> 00:28:11,551
You don't have anywhere else to go.
It's the last trip.

661
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:12,950
How many days are left?

662
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:14,321
- Two days.
- Tomorrow is the last day.

663
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,190
Tomorrow night is the last night.

664
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,420
Yes.

665
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,791
(The last leg of their trip is
around the corner already.)

666
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:22,561
As I said yesterday, it's a shame.

667
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:23,960
It's a shame to see the last day come...

668
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
because I don't think
I can come here again.

669
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
Yes.

670
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,400
I went to South America
thinking that every time.

671
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,071
I went there three times. I didn't know.

672
00:28:30,071 --> 00:28:31,700
How is it? Do you keep thinking about it?

673
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,670
The first time I went, it was great.

674
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,710
The 2nd time I went, I thought
it wasn't as great as the 1st time.

675
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,180
Because you don't have altitude sickness.

676
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,281
(He doesn't have altitude sickness
at all.)

677
00:28:38,281 --> 00:28:40,051
- The icon of altitude sickness.
- That's why I went there three times.

678
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,410
Just the thought of going there is hard
for me because of altitude sickness.

679
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,180
Next time you go there,
you might bleed from your ears.

680
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,480
(We hope it ends with a nosebleed.)

681
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,091
- You traveled a lot.
- Yes.

682
00:28:49,091 --> 00:28:51,261
Do you have a country you want
to visit again?

683
00:28:51,261 --> 00:28:53,791
I like Egypt.

684
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:55,561
I went there twice,
and I want to go again.

685
00:28:55,561 --> 00:28:56,831
Where is Egypt?

686
00:28:56,831 --> 00:28:58,301
In Africa.

687
00:28:58,301 --> 00:28:59,361
- Egypt is in Africa?
- Yes.

688
00:28:59,361 --> 00:29:00,930
It's in Africa, but its culture is
considered the middle east.

689
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,031
- Egypt...
- Pyramids.

690
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:03,501
That's right.

691
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:04,900
- Egypt is in Africa?
- Yes.

692
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,541
- Really?
- Why would I lie about it?

693
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,170
Okay.

694
00:29:09,341 --> 00:29:11,880
- Did you know?
- I didn't, that's why I'm staying silent.

695
00:29:13,281 --> 00:29:15,511
- I'm just listening.
- She's just smiling.

696
00:29:15,851 --> 00:29:18,150
You can just smile.
Why would you keep asking him?

697
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,251
- Okay. Egypt is in Africa.
- Yes.

698
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:21,390
She said to just smile.

699
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,190
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

700
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,720
Thank you for the food.

701
00:29:24,821 --> 00:29:26,761
How do you call a taxi here?

702
00:29:26,761 --> 00:29:29,031
Do you just stop it with your hand?

703
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,730
- I'm planning to do that. But... Taxi.
- There's a taxi over there.

704
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,160
Hello.

705
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,331
Do you go to the terminal?

706
00:29:37,301 --> 00:29:38,940
It costs 25 bolivianos?
It's 25. I think it's fine.

707
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,640
- Okay.
- Okay.

708
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,511
Finally,

709
00:29:44,081 --> 00:29:46,111
our last destination.

710
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,950
I think 70 percent of people
who come to South America come...

711
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,180
- to go to the Uyuni Salt Flats.
- That's right.

712
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,490
And they visit other places
on the way there.

713
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,851
When I came here, my main goal was...

714
00:29:55,851 --> 00:29:57,761
the Uyuni Salt Flats as well.

715
00:29:58,091 --> 00:30:01,130
I'm looking forward to it so much.

716
00:30:02,561 --> 00:30:04,630
Guys, we're here.

717
00:30:05,301 --> 00:30:06,561
Thank you.

718
00:30:06,831 --> 00:30:09,400
- Gosh, hey.
- It's so pretty.

719
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,301
(No matter how many times they see it,
the night view of La Paz is amazing.)

720
00:30:12,301 --> 00:30:13,371
Look at that.

721
00:30:13,371 --> 00:30:15,841
(They save this moment
that won't come back in their eyes.)

722
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:16,980
Did you not see this before?

723
00:30:19,311 --> 00:30:21,910
We have to buy the ticket today
to go to the Uyuni Salt Flats.

724
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:25,781
I'll go to the counter that says "Uyuni"
and ask.

725
00:30:27,591 --> 00:30:29,091
- Who is he?
- Suddenly?

726
00:30:29,091 --> 00:30:30,321
- What's that?
- What's that?

727
00:30:30,321 --> 00:30:31,660
Over there.

728
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,490
Do you have a ticket to Uyuni?

729
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,490
- At 9:45 p.m.
- Okay.

730
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,930
- Thank you.
- thank you.

731
00:30:38,331 --> 00:30:41,230
(They load their bags.)

732
00:30:42,531 --> 00:30:44,001
What's the name of the town?

733
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,101
Naraba?

734
00:30:46,101 --> 00:30:48,311
La Paz, goodbye.

735
00:30:48,811 --> 00:30:50,611
I thought you were saying goodbye
to someone.

736
00:30:50,611 --> 00:30:52,081
We got good seats.
All the way at the back.

737
00:30:53,111 --> 00:30:54,980
- It's really nice.
- Was it like this last time?

738
00:30:55,111 --> 00:30:58,380
No. Last time,
I rode a bus like a Korean city bus.

739
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,251
This is better than the limousine
to Incheon Airport.

740
00:31:01,251 --> 00:31:03,561
- Guys, that bus...
- It's so good.

741
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,190
- It was really good.
- It's business class.

742
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,361
Seriously...

743
00:31:08,761 --> 00:31:11,031
I was worried about traveling nine hours
on the bus.

744
00:31:11,031 --> 00:31:12,301
But if it's this good...

745
00:31:13,361 --> 00:31:14,801
It's super luxurious.

746
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:16,301
(Luxurious night bus)

747
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,271
We're going to Uyuni Town first.

748
00:31:19,271 --> 00:31:22,011
We booked a salt hotel in Uyuni Town.

749
00:31:22,011 --> 00:31:23,640
- Really?
- I booked yesterday.

750
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:28,511
(He booked a salt hotel for Kian84.)

751
00:31:28,751 --> 00:31:30,680
I should brush my teeth
with the Uyuni Salt Flats tomorrow.

752
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,650
- Tomorrow, you know tequila.
- Yes.

753
00:31:33,751 --> 00:31:35,950
Let's drink tequila and eat the salt.

754
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:37,490
- That sounds good.
- Right?

755
00:31:37,591 --> 00:31:39,261
Squeeze lemon.

756
00:31:39,261 --> 00:31:40,791
I'll get pickled in salt tomorrow.

757
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:42,490
I won't eat salt because I'll get edema.

758
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,101
My face swells.

759
00:31:44,101 --> 00:31:45,331
- Hey.
- Isn't it swollen already?

760
00:31:45,561 --> 00:31:47,071
(Swollen)

761
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:49,430
Sleep now.

762
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,970
- I'll sleep. Goodnight, Pani Bottle.
- Okay.

763
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,541
Let's talk tomorrow.

764
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:55,170
Okay. Goodnight.

765
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,380
(This unplanned trip
that they went through messily)

766
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,180
(When they wake up,
it will be the last day.)

767
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,091
(On the foreign land they arrived in
after leaving Korea,)

768
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:10,990
(he met his best friend
and went to the Amazon.)

769
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,920
- It feels so long ago.
- It looks like a story from long ago.

770
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,261
It really feels like it was long ago.

771
00:32:14,261 --> 00:32:16,430
(And in Cusco, the city of Inca,)

772
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,861
(a familiar friend appeared
as a surprise.)

773
00:32:19,301 --> 00:32:22,130
(The three of them became one
and went on a romantic motorcycle tour.)

774
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:23,230
That was fun.

775
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:26,700
(They suffered from altitude sickness...)

776
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,571
(and got sick of each other.)

777
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:31,841
(They crossed the border on foot
from Peru to Bolivia.)

778
00:32:32,111 --> 00:32:34,980
We went to a lot of places.

779
00:32:36,311 --> 00:32:40,321
(The true joy of traveling
they felt in those moments)

780
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:46,720
(Embracing all of these,
they head to the last destination.)

781
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:51,200
(The ten-day trip they went on
by accident)

782
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,101
Gosh, we went to a lot of places.

783
00:32:57,041 --> 00:33:00,371
(The total distance traveled. 2,948km)

784
00:33:02,011 --> 00:33:05,180
(And the morning
of their last day breaks.)

785
00:33:07,210 --> 00:33:08,611
(Are we there?)

786
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:15,821
- I got really itchy at this point.
- Why?

787
00:33:15,821 --> 00:33:16,821
- I see. That?
- Because of sandflies?

788
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:18,361
- Yes.
- My gosh.

789
00:33:18,361 --> 00:33:20,591
- They are worse than mosquito bites.
- So much worse.

790
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:22,490
(Tormented)

791
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:25,660
Sandfly bites are lasting pretty long.

792
00:33:25,861 --> 00:33:27,571
(Awful sandfly bites)

793
00:33:27,571 --> 00:33:28,730
They are still itchy.

794
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,700
(They arrive at Uyuni Town.)

795
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,940
Let's go. Let's get off.

796
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:36,470
Everyone. At last.

797
00:33:37,511 --> 00:33:39,011
We're here at last.

798
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:42,051
- Uyuni Salt Flats.
- It's cold.

799
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:43,380
- The weather was so different.
- Was it cold there?

800
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,450
- Was it winter there?
- It was cold there.

801
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,860
We're at Uyuni Salt Flats.

802
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,199
Should we go over there and take a look?

803
00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:00,840
Gosh. This town...

804
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,900
How should I say it? It's...

805
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,810
This is a desolate city.

806
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,110
I loved houses like that.

807
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:11,409
- And this.
- They look pretty cool.

808
00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:14,150
- Doesn't it look like a cool town?
- It does.

809
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,620
(It took 9 hours on the bus
from La Paz to Uyuni.)

810
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,719
(Uyuni Salt Flats)

811
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:21,360
(Uyuni Town is
right next to the salt flats.)

812
00:34:21,689 --> 00:34:25,360
(It used to be a bustling town
with tourists every year.)

813
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:29,400
(But due to COVID-19,
the town has gotten pretty quiet.)

814
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,729
As soon as you got off the bus,

815
00:34:30,729 --> 00:34:33,330
what was your first impression
of Uyuni Town?

816
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,400
In the cartoon, "Galaxy Express 999,"

817
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,209
- Maetel and Chul arrive in a city.
- Yes.

818
00:34:38,209 --> 00:34:39,669
- And the city was bleak and deserted.
- Right.

819
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:42,040
- Yes.
- I was reminded of that scene.

820
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,080
But I loved it.

821
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,509
- This is a rare sight for us.
- Right. I liked it.

822
00:34:45,509 --> 00:34:48,080
It felt like the most exotic town
during my trip.

823
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,150
- Uyuni Town?
- Yes. That town.

824
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,150
I love Uyuni.
And I was happy to be there with them.

825
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:56,959
Being in such a cool place
with other people...

826
00:34:56,959 --> 00:35:00,030
and being able to share what I was feeling
was great.

827
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,630
- You're so eloquent.
- Gosh, Pani Bottle.

828
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,469
- A YouTuber with 1.4 million subscribers.
- I really liked it.

829
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:04,729
- Seriously.
- I really liked it.

830
00:35:04,729 --> 00:35:06,530
- Popular YouTubers are very different.
- I liked it.

831
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,610
Let's see if this town is covered in salt
like we've heard.

832
00:35:11,469 --> 00:35:13,709
- It's time to check.
- Wait. Will you taste it?

833
00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:16,040
- Not there.
- I wanted to taste it.

834
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,909
You can't lick that.

835
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:19,580
(Poking)

836
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:22,620
(Licking)

837
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:26,550
It's a bit... Is my finger salty?

838
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,519
Or is the street salty?
Something is salty.

839
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:32,729
- Isn't that a cement road?
- Yes, it is.

840
00:35:32,729 --> 00:35:34,259
Why did you taste the cement road?

841
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:36,229
I had been excited about this
the whole ride there.

842
00:35:36,229 --> 00:35:37,300
It's not good for your health.

843
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,600
On our way to the town,
it started to look white.

844
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,739
Seriously. You're crazy.

845
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,269
Was it salty because
you didn't wash your hands?

846
00:35:43,269 --> 00:35:44,570
- I think so.
- That's why...

847
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,610
- But I thought the town...
- He thinks so.

848
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,179
and all the buildings
were made of salt at first.

849
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:53,050
- I see. Like a town made of crackers?
- Yes.

850
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:56,580
So I was a bit disappointed at that moment
because it wasn't what I expected.

851
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,650
It wasn't salty
because you tasted the asphalt road.

852
00:35:58,650 --> 00:35:59,650
But...

853
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,959
You should have tasted the car
in the back too.

854
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,729
I thought salt might have flown in the air
and penetrated into the road.

855
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,060
(After licking the cement road...)

856
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,199
Kian84!

857
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:09,100
Aren't you cold?

858
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,370
I'm okay so far.

859
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:14,640
You should have pulled down your shirt.

860
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,269
I wasn't in any situation...

861
00:36:18,269 --> 00:36:20,110
- to worry about how I looked.
- His back pocket was inside out.

862
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:22,540
- The sandfly bites were so itchy.
- My goodness.

863
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,249
- It was because of the sandfly bites.
- Gosh.

864
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:28,419
- Sandfly bites.
- I always feel bad for you.

865
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,950
By the way...

866
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:32,889
(They're on their way to book
the Uyuni Salt Flats tour.)

867
00:36:32,889 --> 00:36:35,160
- it's kind of cold here.
- Yes.

868
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,389
So the air feels fresher.

869
00:36:37,389 --> 00:36:39,160
You really like cold weather.

870
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,099
Yes. It feels refreshing.

871
00:36:41,459 --> 00:36:43,729
By the way, the town seems really bleak.
This is like...

872
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,930
Really? I like it.

873
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,240
- You like it?
- Yes.

874
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,840
The drinks must be cold too.

875
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,070
- Hey, look at that. Isn't this beautiful?
- What?

876
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,579
- It's beautiful.
- How is this beautiful?

877
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,979
(From the first day in the Amazon...)

878
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:58,450
(When would we have the chance
to try the alligator meat?)

879
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,780
(I won't eat it. You eat it.)

880
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,019
(Or what about a leg?)

881
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:02,249
- I won't eat it.
- Every time I watch it...

882
00:37:02,249 --> 00:37:05,119
I really had a hard time
in the first city.

883
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:06,990
But Uyuni was good for me.

884
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:10,829
(The man of Uyuni has localized
perfectly toward the end.)

885
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:13,459
- That's a tour agency.
- But it's closed.

886
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,269
- There's another one on the left.
- We arrived too early.

887
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:18,999
- Tour.
- There's another one at the corner.

888
00:37:20,669 --> 00:37:23,769
Hey, there's a tour like that too.
You can sail or something.

889
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:26,369
- That looks nice.
- What's that?

890
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,240
Hey, that looks nice. You can surf.

891
00:37:29,639 --> 00:37:30,680
I've never seen that before.

892
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,450
- Let's try that.
- Let's try that.

893
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,950
- What's that?
- Hey, this is amazing.

894
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,820
- Goodness. What's this?
- Gosh.

895
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,950
(Land sailing grabbed their attention.)

896
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:39,849
No way. I've never seen this before.

897
00:37:39,849 --> 00:37:41,889
- You've never seen this before?
- No.

898
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,789
Hey, this must be new. This is it.

899
00:37:43,789 --> 00:37:46,389
But we need another agency.
This agency is closed.

900
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:49,829
But I don't think we can try this activity
only at this agency.

901
00:37:50,030 --> 00:37:51,229
Let's get going.

902
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:52,970
- Wait, Do Yeon.
- Yes.

903
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:56,269
- I suddenly got a question.
- What is it?

904
00:37:56,269 --> 00:37:58,970
Can't they go on their own
without a tour guide?

905
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:02,939
Like Som Dominic...

906
00:38:02,939 --> 00:38:04,979
- "Som Dominic?"
- "Som Dominic?"

907
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:07,550
- Did you yawn?
- No.

908
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:09,519
- "Like Som Dominic..."
- No.

909
00:38:09,849 --> 00:38:13,220
Like Simon Dominic, people who like
to do things on their own...

910
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,590
must be curious
if hiring a tour guide is necessary.

911
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:16,820
I knew you would be curious.

912
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,590
- I'll share a few rules to keep in mind.
- Okay.

913
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,559
Public safety in Uyuni is not as good.

914
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:24,229
So you must especially be careful...

915
00:38:24,229 --> 00:38:25,499
not to get your belongings stolen...

916
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:27,099
- and keep a close eye on your belongings.
- I see.

917
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:30,070
And your vehicles can easily...

918
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,840
- Hold on.
- What is it?

919
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,740
It hurts my pride
that I mispronounced his name.

920
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,309
I always pay special attention
to my pronunciation.

921
00:38:36,309 --> 00:38:38,150
- You're funny. "Som Dominic."
- No.

922
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:39,780
And your vehicles can easily be flooded...

923
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:41,849
or frequently flip over in accidents.

924
00:38:41,849 --> 00:38:44,419
You're recommended to use a tour agency...

925
00:38:44,419 --> 00:38:46,320
- when traveling.
- Right. They told us that.

926
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,519
Not here.

927
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:48,760
(The three of them set out
to find travel agencies that are open.)

928
00:38:49,289 --> 00:38:50,959
(This agency is closed as well.)

929
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,789
- Oh, no. Everyone is closed.
- No one is open.

930
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,130
- We were there too early.
- We were too early.

931
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:55,160
Gosh.

932
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,669
- The three of you wanted the tour.
- Right.

933
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,030
He's out here.

934
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,099
- Hi.
- Hello.

935
00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:03,570
- Hello.
- Good morning.

936
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,209
- How are you?
- Yes.

937
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:07,380
Do you have tours for Uyuni?

938
00:39:07,709 --> 00:39:08,780
Yes.

939
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:12,450
Hey, let's ask him about the sailing tour.

940
00:39:13,209 --> 00:39:14,720
My name is Jony.

941
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:16,619
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

942
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:18,519
- And...
- My name is Sean.

943
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:19,590
- Sean.
- Okay.

944
00:39:20,919 --> 00:39:22,789
(Presenting the tour program)

945
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,660
From 10:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.

946
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,490
- There were a lot of options.
- To 6:30 p.m.

947
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,099
That's way too early.

948
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,630
Let's ask him about that.

949
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,200
Excuse me.

950
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:37,539
- We saw a photo.
- Windsurfing.

951
00:39:37,539 --> 00:39:40,439
- There's a bicycle with...
- Windsurfing.

952
00:39:40,709 --> 00:39:42,180
What's "mainsail" in English?

953
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,539
- Mainsail.
- A yacht.

954
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:45,950
- He doesn't know.
- He has no idea.

955
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,950
Then which tour did you choose?

956
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,180
We did the one-day activity.

957
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,050
We booked a tour program
that transported us...

958
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:54,019
to the salt flats
to look at the sunset and the stars.

959
00:39:54,389 --> 00:39:56,789
How much is it for three people?

960
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:59,590
- Just three?
- Yes.

961
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:03,099
- Just three.
- We really wanted the tour.

962
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,430
That's 180 dollars.
That's almost 250,000 won.

963
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:07,340
- Right.
- But that's for three people.

964
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,740
- For three people?
- This might be a fair price.

965
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,869
- For three people?
- Yes.

966
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:10,910
- Then it's okay.
- It's okay.

967
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,209
I thought that was for one person.

968
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:14,280
So what time do you have to...

969
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:19,050
- I'll pick you up at 10 a.m.
- Okay.

970
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,519
Let's rest up at a hotel.

971
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:21,720
- Okay. Let's go.
- Okay.

972
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:25,150
(They're done making a reservation
for Uyuni Salt Flats.)

973
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,559
- How far is our hotel?
- It's only seven minutes away.

974
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:28,919
- Seven minutes? Let's go.
- Yes.

975
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:31,729
(To find their hotel
that's only 7 minutes away,)

976
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,660
(the three of them walk quickly.)

977
00:40:35,059 --> 00:40:38,200
There it is. Casa de Sal.

978
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,530
- Casa de Sal.
- That looks nice.

979
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,099
- Let's go.
- Okay.

980
00:40:42,939 --> 00:40:44,340
That's not made of salt.

981
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,039
- But...
- The exterior isn't.

982
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:49,439
(Another activity on Kian84's bucket list)

983
00:40:49,439 --> 00:40:54,019
(A salt hotel)

984
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,320
(I'm finally going to the salt hotel.)

985
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,189
(I want to brush my teeth
with salt from Uyuni Salt Flats.)

986
00:40:59,419 --> 00:41:01,619
- Ring the bell.
- It's open.

987
00:41:02,619 --> 00:41:03,789
- Hello.
- Hello.

988
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:08,599
(How does the inside
of the salt hotel look?)

989
00:41:08,930 --> 00:41:10,930
- We have a reservation.
- It's clean.

990
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:12,470
Tonight and tomorrow.

991
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,200
- That's salt under the counter.
- Yes.

992
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,669
- That's salt?
- Yes.

993
00:41:17,269 --> 00:41:18,769
Salt is on the wall too.

994
00:41:19,169 --> 00:41:20,269
(Licking the salt wall)

995
00:41:20,269 --> 00:41:22,110
It's salt. This is a salt wall.

996
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,110
Did you brush your teeth there?

997
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,809
My goodness.

998
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,720
What a genius. Goodness.

999
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,289
- He's crazy.
- What a genius.

1000
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:35,019
- Why?
- I wanted to try that.

1001
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:37,229
- He brushed his teeth.
- Gosh.

1002
00:41:37,229 --> 00:41:40,030
My breath stank for nine hours.

1003
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,300
- You're so clean.
- I've seen people sprinkle it on food.

1004
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,630
- My stomach hurts.
- He's so clean.

1005
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,930
Actually, a lot of people sprinkle it
on their meat.

1006
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,869
- Gosh.
- But no one brushed their teeth like him.

1007
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:48,869
- Right.
- Yes.

1008
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:50,169
- Is that salt?
- Yes.

1009
00:41:50,169 --> 00:41:51,669
(He's removing layers of plaque
with his finger.)

1010
00:41:51,669 --> 00:41:53,809
- Hey, Kian84.
- Three.

1011
00:41:53,809 --> 00:41:54,840
- What?
- Yes.

1012
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:56,610
Okay. Use that to brush your teeth then.

1013
00:41:57,079 --> 00:41:59,050
- My breath stinks so bad.
- You know...

1014
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,619
That must be why you have healthy teeth.

1015
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:02,749
(He proves he has healthy teeth.)

1016
00:42:03,749 --> 00:42:04,950
He used that salt.

1017
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,419
- I had no idea he was brushing...
- Who would have thought?

1018
00:42:07,419 --> 00:42:09,160
- his teeth with the salt from the wall
- Look.

1019
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,530
- But...
- I have no idea.

1020
00:42:10,959 --> 00:42:12,090
It was salty.

1021
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,559
- Hey, Wi-Fi...
- Yes?

1022
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:16,729
- Wi-Fi. Thank you.
- Wi-Fi.

1023
00:42:18,099 --> 00:42:20,200
(There's another customer.)

1024
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,400
- It's salt.
- Right? It is.

1025
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:26,410
I'm trying to check off some boxes
on my bucket list.

1026
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,939
If Kian84 were to live there,
a wall would collapse.

1027
00:42:30,479 --> 00:42:32,249
- He would come down and do it every day.
- Right.

1028
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:34,380
- Kian84.
- Gosh. My stomach.

1029
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:36,579
- How was it? Was it like regular salt?
- Right.

1030
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:38,050
- I'm curious.
- It was so salty.

1031
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,950
- It's just salty?
- It was pretty intense.

1032
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:43,019
- Like coarse salt?
- The intensity of the salt was higher.

1033
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,389
- Was it concentrated?
- Right.

1034
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,530
- It was pretty intense.
- The salt there was firm.

1035
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,700
- I see.
- It was highly concentrated.

1036
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:49,530
Hot water?

1037
00:42:50,059 --> 00:42:52,200
- Yes. Hot water is available all day.
- For showers.

1038
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,200
Twenty-four hours.

1039
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,769
- It's available 24 hours a day.
- Gosh.

1040
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,570
- Good.
- Hey.

1041
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:59,139
- Good. Go.
- This is a high-end hotel.

1042
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,309
(2 nights in a salt hotel for 3 people,
169.20 dollars)

1043
00:43:01,309 --> 00:43:03,439
- Gosh.
- At last.

1044
00:43:04,479 --> 00:43:07,419
We're here at a salt hotel
I've been looking forward to.

1045
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,450
That's the salt chair.

1046
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:11,789
- Salt.
- It's very firm.

1047
00:43:11,919 --> 00:43:15,360
- The interior design of the hotel...
- It's pretty classy, right?

1048
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:19,289
- The hotel was built with salt.
- It's incredible.

1049
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:20,630
- Everything must be made of salt.
- Right.

1050
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,700
- Only the frame isn't made of salt.
- Right.

1051
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:25,930
- Everything else is made of salt.
- Right.

1052
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:27,240
- That's so cool.
- That too.

1053
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:28,269
- This is fancy.
- Yes.

1054
00:43:28,269 --> 00:43:30,340
- The salt chair.
- The chair is made of salt too.

1055
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:32,439
Gosh. That's so interesting.

1056
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:33,939
Hey, this is nice.

1057
00:43:35,939 --> 00:43:39,309
However, the tiles aren't made of salt.

1058
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:44,650
Realistically speaking,
they couldn't build everything with salt.

1059
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,260
Look at the framework.

1060
00:43:49,889 --> 00:43:54,459
They used concrete for the frame,
the most important part of the hotel.

1061
00:43:55,059 --> 00:43:58,970
And then they built the rest with salt.

1062
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:01,599
This is your room.

1063
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:02,700
Ta-da.

1064
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:05,669
This is huge.

1065
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:07,439
It's huge.

1066
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:08,709
Very nice!

1067
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:10,479
(The room is as good as
a room from a 5-star hotel.)

1068
00:44:10,479 --> 00:44:12,180
It was very nice. Seriously.

1069
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:13,809
- That's a beautiful, spacious room.
- Excellent.

1070
00:44:13,809 --> 00:44:16,280
The bed is made of salt.

1071
00:44:17,019 --> 00:44:18,150
The salt bed.

1072
00:44:18,590 --> 00:44:19,749
Nice.

1073
00:44:19,749 --> 00:44:20,990
(He loves it.)

1074
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,689
Beautiful.

1075
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,329
I wonder if the tub is made of salt.

1076
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:29,260
Then the salt would melt.
They couldn't have used salt, right?

1077
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,669
Kian84, does the toilet have a lid?

1078
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,769
- Yes.
- It has a lid.

1079
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,669
- Showers...
- That's important for you.

1080
00:44:40,269 --> 00:44:43,680
(He likes the toilet too.)

1081
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:47,950
This is the most luxurious hotel
we've stayed in.

1082
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,389
(Sprawling)

1083
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:52,490
This is nice.

1084
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:53,820
(They finally get a proper hotel room.)

1085
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,889
Then we should take showers one at a time.

1086
00:44:55,889 --> 00:44:57,930
- Right.
- I'll take a shower first.

1087
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:01,300
- Hello.
- Hello.

1088
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,599
Good morning. Okay.

1089
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,070
Let's go, friends. Come here.

1090
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:06,499
It was the market day.

1091
00:45:06,499 --> 00:45:07,539
- It opens up only once a week.
- It was.

1092
00:45:07,539 --> 00:45:09,800
And the market opened up
when we were there.

1093
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,209
- Are they sunglasses?
- Yes.

1094
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,470
- Here. Sunglasses.
- I see.

1095
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:14,979
- There.
- Where? They are right here.

1096
00:45:14,979 --> 00:45:16,510
- Gosh. Amazing.
- Toward the end of the trip.

1097
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:18,309
Will they block out the UV light?

1098
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:19,479
(He puts them on first.)

1099
00:45:19,579 --> 00:45:20,880
- Gosh. Hey.
- They look pretty nice.

1100
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:22,979
They look good on me.

1101
00:45:22,979 --> 00:45:24,919
- This pair.
- Throw out the old ones.

1102
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:26,450
- Yes. How much?
- They are expensive.

1103
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,220
(In the beginning of their trip,
Si Eon advised him to buy sunglasses.)

1104
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,189
(But Kian84 didn't like buying things.)

1105
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,530
(But he buys them
without giving it much thought now.)

1106
00:45:33,590 --> 00:45:35,099
- Twenty-five.
- It fell. Gosh.

1107
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,829
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1108
00:45:36,959 --> 00:45:38,630
- Okay?
- Okay. Let's go.

1109
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:40,939
- For here.
- Okay.

1110
00:45:40,939 --> 00:45:42,470
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1111
00:45:42,999 --> 00:45:45,139
- You're ready. No?
- Ready.

1112
00:45:45,139 --> 00:45:46,639
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1113
00:45:46,769 --> 00:45:48,709
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1114
00:45:48,709 --> 00:45:50,180
Let's go.

1115
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,510
- They used that camera?
- Gosh. What's that?

1116
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:54,280
- They use that camera for music videos.
- Yes.

1117
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:55,419
(Where will they stop first
on their tour?)

1118
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:57,889
- Where are we going first?
- To the Train Cemetery.

1119
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,389
Gosh. Seriously.

1120
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,419
- We'll film "Galaxy Express 999."
- Right.

1121
00:46:01,419 --> 00:46:02,590
(The Train Cemetery
is only 9 minutes away.)

1122
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,329
The street is a little bit bumpy.

1123
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,130
- Bumpy.
- Yes.

1124
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,829
He speaks some Korean.

1125
00:46:09,829 --> 00:46:11,530
A lot of Korean tourists go there.

1126
00:46:11,729 --> 00:46:13,630
By the way, it's already our last day.

1127
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,869
It was pretty short.

1128
00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:17,840
- It was shorter than I thought.
- Two weeks wasn't long

1129
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:21,780
Thinking about our time in the Amazon
makes me think we've been here long.

1130
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,309
It feels like only two days ago
Pani Bottle joined us.

1131
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:26,010
- Two weeks in South America...
- Pani Bottle...

1132
00:46:26,010 --> 00:46:27,680
- Pani Bottle joined us two days ago.
- is really short.

1133
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,780
- This is my 6th day. Yes.
- This is your 6th day?

1134
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,550
This is the 9th day for you,
and 8th day for me.

1135
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:34,360
Then...

1136
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,289
The sun is so strong today. This is crazy.

1137
00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:38,130
We'll get to see a lot of stars tonight.

1138
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,829
- There are no clouds.
- Right.

1139
00:46:39,829 --> 00:46:41,999
We got so lucky with the weather.

1140
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,459
Hey, the sky is spinning.

1141
00:46:43,459 --> 00:46:45,970
- This is the Train Cemetery.
- What's that?

1142
00:46:46,269 --> 00:46:47,539
- Look at that.
- This train...

1143
00:46:48,039 --> 00:46:50,340
It's the factory for England and France.

1144
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,410
Right.

1145
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:55,079
The trains were powered by steam.

1146
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:57,780
I see. Steam. Steam locomotives.

1147
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:01,180
Okay. You can walk here.

1148
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:05,090
You can visit the train,
take pictures, and go up.

1149
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:07,860
Gosh. Very nice.

1150
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,930
(Impressed)

1151
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:14,200
This is the first stop on the Uyuni tour.

1152
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,530
Train Cemetery.

1153
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,930
A graveyard for trains.

1154
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,400
- They used the trains...
- I liked the Train Cemetery.

1155
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,900
- to transport minerals.
- It was so cool.

1156
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:27,240
By the way...
I see. The trains are all dead.

1157
00:47:28,209 --> 00:47:29,979
This is cool.

1158
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,110
- This is so cool.
- Yes.

1159
00:47:32,110 --> 00:47:35,680
(It has become the Train Cemetery.)

1160
00:47:37,749 --> 00:47:39,349
The train track is so cool.

1161
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:41,260
Gosh. So no one comes here.

1162
00:47:41,689 --> 00:47:44,289
You can take a picture here.

1163
00:47:44,289 --> 00:47:45,990
The guide knew all the photo spots.

1164
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:47,660
- Like this.
- He knew where photos came out nicely.

1165
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:48,900
- That's a photo spot.
- Yes.

1166
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,829
- I'll take the picture from below.
- I see.

1167
00:47:50,829 --> 00:47:52,200
- Okay.
- Okay.

1168
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,099
I'll stand in the back.

1169
00:47:54,099 --> 00:47:55,570
I'm the shortest.

1170
00:47:56,769 --> 00:47:57,809
Can he see me?

1171
00:47:57,809 --> 00:47:59,740
(They pose as the guide instructed them.)

1172
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,479
- It will be the photo of their lifetime.
- Okay.

1173
00:48:02,539 --> 00:48:03,639
- Move back.
- I'll move back.

1174
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:05,510
- My goodness.
- He was so passionate.

1175
00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:06,780
I'm so grateful.

1176
00:48:07,209 --> 00:48:08,820
Move back.

1177
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,019
- Okay. One.
- Hurry!

1178
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:14,389
One, two, three.

1179
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:17,289
- By the way, it looks bizarre.
- That's cute.

1180
00:48:17,289 --> 00:48:18,889
- He tried really hard to take the photo.
- That's nice.

1181
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,360
- That suits you.
- Up?

1182
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:23,860
(The oldest member
is especially enthusiastic today.)

1183
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,430
- Be careful.
- Yes.

1184
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:28,369
(He's super excited.)

1185
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:29,769
(Amazed)

1186
00:48:29,769 --> 00:48:32,010
- That's the steam locomotive.
- Gosh.

1187
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:34,639
Kian84.

1188
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:38,309
(Acting cool)

1189
00:48:38,309 --> 00:48:40,180
- In 1, 2... Should I take it like this?
- That looks pretty good.

1190
00:48:40,579 --> 00:48:41,979
In 1, 2, 3.

1191
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:44,519
Si Eon loves taking pictures as usual.

1192
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:45,650
(He's feeling sentimental
thanks to the great view.)

1193
00:48:47,789 --> 00:48:49,490
(Struggling)

1194
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,260
(He even jumps from the narrow gap.)

1195
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:52,990
Si Eon loved that.

1196
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:54,930
- Right.
- He loves stuff like that.

1197
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:56,329
- He loves machines.
- He loved them.

1198
00:48:56,329 --> 00:48:58,700
- That was the bucket for the coals.
- This is nice.

1199
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,400
To make steam.

1200
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:02,700
(The youngest struggles to go up.)

1201
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,970
Can you take a picture of us?

1202
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:07,110
Pani Bottle, wasn't it better to go there
with us than to go there alone?

1203
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,610
- Of course.
- Yes.

1204
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,749
It was lonely to go there alone.
The view is already bleak.

1205
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:13,180
- Right.
- Yes.

1206
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,680
(The photo of the entire gang)

1207
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,919
In 1, 2, 3.

1208
00:49:17,689 --> 00:49:20,050
My gosh, this is incredible.
I'm loving it here.

1209
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:21,519
Hey.

1210
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:24,990
Pani Bottle. There's a tornado!

1211
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:27,289
- Right.
- Really?

1212
00:49:27,289 --> 00:49:28,800
- Gosh.
- A tornado!

1213
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:31,229
My dream was to stand
in the tornado before I died.

1214
00:49:31,229 --> 00:49:32,369
Hey.

1215
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:33,900
Before you died?
Then that must be your last moment.

1216
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,970
No. That's doable.

1217
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:36,740
- Wouldn't you die from it?
- You would die!

1218
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:40,709
- A bearable tornado.
- Right before that?

1219
00:49:40,979 --> 00:49:42,280
No. That's doable.

1220
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:44,240
I can go in and out.

1221
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:46,510
Wait. I think it might come over here.

1222
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:48,220
Come here!

1223
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,619
- My eyes sting. Why do they sting?
- Is that dangerous?

1224
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:53,720
- No.
- It's not dangerous.

1225
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,459
Right. I can go in and out.

1226
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:57,320
But that's too far.

1227
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,959
- Do you want to go?
- Can I go and come back?

1228
00:49:58,959 --> 00:50:00,630
Yes. Do you think you can come back?

1229
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:01,800
That's too far.

1230
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,300
- It's farther than you think.
- And...

1231
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,229
Kian84, it's gone. It dissipated.

1232
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:10,169
My bucket list is getting longer now.

1233
00:50:10,169 --> 00:50:11,970
You have so many things
you want to do before you die.

1234
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:13,809
But there's a tour for that in the US.

1235
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:15,840
- Right.
- There's a tour, chasing tornados.

1236
00:50:15,939 --> 00:50:17,010
How do you go in there?

1237
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:19,550
You have to make a reservation
a year in advance.

1238
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:21,079
- So I couldn't do it.
- Let's do that.

1239
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:23,349
- It's much bigger than that.
- That could be the last thing you do.

1240
00:50:23,349 --> 00:50:26,749
- The five of us can hold hands.
- All of us.

1241
00:50:26,749 --> 00:50:29,189
We can spin around together.
Imagine how cool it will be.

1242
00:50:29,189 --> 00:50:31,160
- Let's just go to Wolmi Island.
- Like a movie?

1243
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:33,260
Let's go to Wolmi Island
and ride Disco Pang Pang.

1244
00:50:33,729 --> 00:50:36,829
The DJ there spins people around
when he's excited.

1245
00:50:37,329 --> 00:50:39,030
(He's smiling, but he's scared.)

1246
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,700
Are there a lot of tornados here?

1247
00:50:43,139 --> 00:50:44,869
- Yes.
- Tornados?

1248
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:47,240
Yes.

1249
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,809
I would have gone in there
if the tornado was closer.

1250
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,349
But it was far.

1251
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,919
I saw a really big one
when I was in high school.

1252
00:50:55,550 --> 00:50:58,019
It was in my schoolyard.

1253
00:50:58,019 --> 00:50:59,889
A tornado started there.

1254
00:50:59,889 --> 00:51:02,760
It happened during class.
I still regret not going in there.

1255
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:04,430
Where in Korea did you grow up?

1256
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:07,459
- There was a small tornado.
- Part Two of his countryside home.

1257
00:51:07,459 --> 00:51:08,900
- Texas.
- The weather was similar too.

1258
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,360
Let's meet up at your school next time.

1259
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,599
(The countryside home was in the Amazon,
and he went to school in Uyuni.)

1260
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,400
- Thank you very much.
- Okay.

1261
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:18,539
- My eyes are stinging a lot.
- Are we going to the salt flats now?

1262
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:22,380
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1263
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:25,079
Gosh. I had so much fun.

1264
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:26,410
(They leave the Train Cemetery
and set out to the next spot.)

1265
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:28,579
This was sort of dreamy.

1266
00:51:28,579 --> 00:51:30,780
Right. It was dreamy.
I love places like this.

1267
00:51:32,019 --> 00:51:34,349
(As they leave the Train Cemetery,)

1268
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:37,320
(a brown sand field
stretches before them.)

1269
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:40,030
- It began to get white.
- Right.

1270
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,160
(The field begins
to show more of white hues.)

1271
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,400
Hey, that's the island
in the middle of the salt flats.

1272
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,829
No. That's not it.

1273
00:51:44,829 --> 00:51:46,070
That's how it looks from a distance.

1274
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:48,240
By the way, it looks like
Daebu Island from here.

1275
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:50,439
- It looks like it's floating on water.
- Right.

1276
00:51:50,439 --> 00:51:51,610
But that's an optical illusion.

1277
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:53,110
- What is it then?
- That's not water.

1278
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,610
- That's not water?
- It's salt.

1279
00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:57,410
- It looks like water.
- Right.

1280
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:58,510
I see.

1281
00:51:58,979 --> 00:52:00,809
Is this the entrance that you mentioned?

1282
00:52:00,809 --> 00:52:01,820
That's correct.

1283
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,220
(You can see the white horizon
from far away.)

1284
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:07,249
This is amazing.

1285
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:10,189
Okay.

1286
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,760
- This is the Uyuni Salt Flat.
- Finally.

1287
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:15,360
Kian84, it looks really beautiful
on screen.

1288
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,070
We're entering the Uyuni Salt Flat.

1289
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:20,930
Starting from here, the sand...

1290
00:52:21,869 --> 00:52:24,840
About equal amounts
of salt and sand are mixed.

1291
00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:28,209
The mountains in the front are...

1292
00:52:28,209 --> 00:52:30,340
Andes Mountains.

1293
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:32,079
- Where?
- The mountains in the front.

1294
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:35,220
It used to be the sea.

1295
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:37,349
Then the land rose.

1296
00:52:37,749 --> 00:52:39,990
(In the past,
the Uyuni Salt Flat was the sea.)

1297
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:45,389
(Due to movements in the Earth's crust,
the sea rose up.)

1298
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,329
(A huge lake was formed.)

1299
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,630
(The dry climate made
the water evaporate,)

1300
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:55,369
(and only salt crystals remain.)

1301
00:52:56,499 --> 00:52:59,970
(He simply exclaims.)

1302
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,039
It's like we're on a different planet.

1303
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:05,150
It's 12,000km.

1304
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:07,579
That jacket serves so many purposes.

1305
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:10,150
It looks like a different planet.

1306
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:12,590
(A huge desert
that spreads out infinitely)

1307
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,959
It doesn't feel like...

1308
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,990
we're on Earth.
It's like a different planet.

1309
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:19,660
My gosh.

1310
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:22,559
(They enter
the mysterious Uyuni Salt Flat.)

1311
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,760
This is...

1312
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:27,200
The concentration of sand and salt...

1313
00:53:27,869 --> 00:53:31,309
(From 20 percent of salt,)

1314
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,740
(dirt disappears little by little.)

1315
00:53:36,309 --> 00:53:37,709
That looks amazing.

1316
00:53:37,709 --> 00:53:38,780
(Magically, the land turns
into 100 percent salt.)

1317
00:53:39,209 --> 00:53:40,450
My goodness.

1318
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,880
I'm speechless.

1319
00:53:43,919 --> 00:53:45,889
(I really want to visit...)

1320
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,889
(Uyuni Salt Flat before I die.)

1321
00:53:49,789 --> 00:53:51,990
(He finally arrives where he dreamed of.)

1322
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:54,289
This is our last destination for a reason.

1323
00:53:54,289 --> 00:53:55,400
(The final destination of their trip)

1324
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,660
It's really wide.

1325
00:53:57,030 --> 00:53:58,570
(Uyuni Salt Flat)

1326
00:53:58,570 --> 00:53:59,769
This is...

1327
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:01,869
It looks great.

1328
00:54:01,869 --> 00:54:03,499
(There are about 10 billion tons of salt.)

1329
00:54:04,369 --> 00:54:06,309
My gosh. Look at the sky.

1330
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,439
This is our last destination for a reason.

1331
00:54:09,439 --> 00:54:11,780
- It's the best.
- It's so picturesque.

1332
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,349
This looks incredible.

1333
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,689
(They feel amazing.)

1334
00:54:20,689 --> 00:54:24,119
You can't go on this path
however you want.

1335
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:26,660
- Here?
- You could fall in the water...

1336
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,059
when the salt breaks, like the glaciers.

1337
00:54:29,059 --> 00:54:32,030
- Do you have to take a designated path?
- Yes.

1338
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:33,700
Only those who know can drive here.

1339
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:35,570
By the way,

1340
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,570
- I keep getting surprised.
- Yes.

1341
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:41,510
At this point,

1342
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:44,010
I'd like to know more
about Uyuni Salt Flat.

1343
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:46,280
- Do Yeon?
- Yes.

1344
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,919
Since Simon Dominic is curious,
I'll tell you about it.

1345
00:54:50,050 --> 00:54:53,650
Uyuni Salt Flat is
the biggest salt desert in the world.

1346
00:54:53,889 --> 00:54:56,490
In Bolivian indigenous language,

1347
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:59,160
"uyuni" means a place
with a fence around it.

1348
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,160
- A fence?
- A place with a fence around it.

1349
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:02,999
What kind of place?

1350
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,459
That desert?

1351
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,800
- I wonder...
- Yes.

1352
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,539
Its dry season is from April to November.

1353
00:55:10,539 --> 00:55:13,570
Its rainy season is from December
to March.

1354
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:16,240
During the rainy season,
the desert is filled with water.

1355
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,579
You can see the familiar view
of the sky touching the land.

1356
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:24,050
You can see a white field of salt
during the dry season.

1357
00:55:24,849 --> 00:55:27,119
You entered the desert now.

1358
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,519
Isn't there a final destination
in the desert?

1359
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:32,229
We didn't go there
during the rainy season.

1360
00:55:32,229 --> 00:55:34,590
- It was the dry season.
- Right, when it doesn't rain a lot.

1361
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:36,459
The driver was determined...

1362
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:39,369
to take us to a place where there's water.

1363
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:40,570
- A puddle of water?
- That's why...

1364
00:55:40,570 --> 00:55:42,999
- we're heading over there.
- To a puddle of water?

1365
00:55:42,999 --> 00:55:44,039
Yes.

1366
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,010
- Look at the sky.
- It looks great.

1367
00:55:47,639 --> 00:55:49,809
- Six points, right?
- Yes.

1368
00:55:49,809 --> 00:55:53,510
Is it called a hexagonal crystal?

1369
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,919
- You can see that. It's fascinating.
- In that case,

1370
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:58,189
- is it hexagonal instead of heptagonal?
- They're all hexagonal.

1371
00:55:58,189 --> 00:55:59,849
That's fascinating.

1372
00:55:59,849 --> 00:56:01,360
- Do you see the hexagons?
- Yes.

1373
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,459
- These are all hexagonal.
- This is fascinating.

1374
00:56:03,459 --> 00:56:04,590
You're right.

1375
00:56:04,729 --> 00:56:06,430
- Really?
- Can we take...

1376
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:08,660
There's one that's rectangular.

1377
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:10,860
Wait.

1378
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:13,700
Generally, they're hexagonal.

1379
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,439
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1380
00:56:16,439 --> 00:56:18,439
This is insane!

1381
00:56:20,769 --> 00:56:22,439
- Everyone.
- It's far away.

1382
00:56:22,439 --> 00:56:23,579
It's insane.

1383
00:56:24,439 --> 00:56:27,479
There is Uyuni.

1384
00:56:27,479 --> 00:56:29,579
(There's Uyuni?)

1385
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:34,959
Each form is hexagonal.

1386
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,519
I'll count.

1387
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,559
One, two, three, four.

1388
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:41,360
It's pentagon.

1389
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,059
It's not a hexagon.

1390
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:46,729
One, two, three, four, five, six.

1391
00:56:46,729 --> 00:56:48,970
- They're generally hexagonal.
- Generally?

1392
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:50,400
(They're generally hexagonal.)

1393
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,639
It's similar to a three-leaf clover.

1394
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:53,669
Gosh.

1395
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:56,539
Many people take photos
of optical illusion.

1396
00:56:56,539 --> 00:56:58,450
- Pretending to be a dinosaur?
- Yes.

1397
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:01,050
- A dinosaur eating something.
- Like this?

1398
00:57:02,019 --> 00:57:04,720
- I will taste it.
- He should lick it.

1399
00:57:05,019 --> 00:57:07,590
Kian84. Goodness.

1400
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,260
Gosh, it might damage his teeth.

1401
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,829
- That's too much. It'd be salty.
- You should taste it.

1402
00:57:13,689 --> 00:57:16,660
Si Eon, don't show your tongue.

1403
00:57:16,829 --> 00:57:18,369
Bite it off with your teeth.

1404
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,939
Don't stick your tongue out.

1405
00:57:22,269 --> 00:57:23,999
Bite it off with your teeth.

1406
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:26,669
You look like someone on a pilgrimage.

1407
00:57:27,209 --> 00:57:29,110
I'll try some with my teeth.

1408
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:30,139
(Biting)

1409
00:57:30,139 --> 00:57:31,450
Doesn't he look great?

1410
00:57:33,979 --> 00:57:37,919
Your teeth would never rot
in Uyuni Salt Flat.

1411
00:57:38,519 --> 00:57:40,289
We can't eat it.

1412
00:57:40,289 --> 00:57:41,959
(Screaming)

1413
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,860
He has healthy-looking teeth.

1414
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:45,430
His teeth are straight.

1415
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,729
I got dental laminates.

1416
00:57:46,729 --> 00:57:48,729
- Did you?
- Yes.

1417
00:57:48,729 --> 00:57:50,430
- Did you get dental laminates?
- My teeth are usually yellow.

1418
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:52,099
- Did you get dental laminates?
- Yes.

1419
00:57:52,099 --> 00:57:53,430
- When?
- Laminates?

1420
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:55,169
In Gangnam.
Do you want to know which clinic?

1421
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,510
I got them at the same place as Hyun Moo.

1422
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:00,169
That's why my front teeth look
exactly like his.

1423
00:58:01,939 --> 00:58:04,309
(Healthy teeth brothers)

1424
00:58:04,309 --> 00:58:06,349
Let me know if you have problems
with your teeth.

1425
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:07,479
All right.

1426
00:58:07,479 --> 00:58:09,180
(He's cute.)

1427
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:11,550
(Screaming)

1428
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:13,320
- You must've been excited.
- I was excited.

1429
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:14,990
The place makes you excited.

1430
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:17,119
(Hopping)

1431
00:58:18,059 --> 00:58:19,160
It's so beautiful.

1432
00:58:20,229 --> 00:58:22,430
You got one of the things done
on your bucket list.

1433
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:25,300
This is insane.

1434
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:28,900
I could understand why this is one
of the things on people's bucket list.

1435
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:29,999
(Let's take photos.)

1436
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,309
Everyone, be healthy.

1437
00:58:34,709 --> 00:58:37,180
Wasn't all of this the sea in the past?

1438
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,950
What's this?

1439
00:58:38,950 --> 00:58:40,180
- This is it.
- Hey.

1440
00:58:40,650 --> 00:58:42,579
- Yes.
- From now on...

1441
00:58:42,579 --> 00:58:44,479
- An optical illusion.
- I saw it on social media.

1442
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:45,590
What's that?

1443
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,650
It's a toy that the guide brought.

1444
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,660
- There's a way to take the photo.
- Okay.

1445
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,860
- I'm taking another photo.
- He's so cute.

1446
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:54,689
The guide...

1447
00:58:54,689 --> 00:58:55,760
(They're in their own world.)

1448
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:57,829
He's been a guide for a long time...

1449
00:58:57,829 --> 00:58:59,900
that he knows how to take unique photos.

1450
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:02,039
(Screaming)

1451
00:59:02,669 --> 00:59:04,369
(A necessary photo zone
in Uyuni Salt Flat)

1452
00:59:04,369 --> 00:59:05,470
That looks cute.

1453
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:08,280
Shim Hyung Rae used to make movies
like this.

1454
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,579
- "Yonggary Claws."
- Yes, it looks like this.

1455
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:12,510
No, it's "Tirano's Claws."

1456
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:15,550
- "Yonggary Claws?"
- "Yonggary Claws?"

1457
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,119
I thought about chicken nuggets.

1458
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,650
"Yonggary."

1459
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:20,650
One, two, three.

1460
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,320
Okay.

1461
00:59:22,459 --> 00:59:25,030
(One man who does things alone)

1462
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:27,360
He's into it again.

1463
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:28,860
Listen to the sound.

1464
00:59:30,030 --> 00:59:32,099
(Crunch)

1465
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:34,669
- He's getting emotional.
- He is.

1466
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:37,840
Look at them.

1467
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:39,769
- What are they doing?
- They're very different.

1468
00:59:39,769 --> 00:59:41,169
- They're so different.
- What are they doing?

1469
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:45,209
(They're running away
with all their might.)

1470
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:48,519
I'm very tired.

1471
00:59:48,519 --> 00:59:50,720
That's why they were so tired.

1472
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,789
(Quickly exhausted)

1473
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,090
Is he still...

1474
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,959
The genre is very different.

1475
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:57,160
I was a bit drunk.

1476
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,789
(Lying down)

1477
00:59:59,860 --> 01:00:02,030
"The skies?"

1478
01:00:05,369 --> 01:00:07,729
I'm sorry for seeing
this great view alone.

1479
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:10,999
- It's insane.
- The music is superb.

1480
01:00:11,369 --> 01:00:12,439
Kian84!

1481
01:00:12,439 --> 01:00:13,470
(They notice him only now.)

1482
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,309
You should come here once.

1483
01:00:16,309 --> 01:00:18,209
He lies down everywhere.

1484
01:00:18,209 --> 01:00:19,709
(Comfortable)

1485
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,479
Gosh, you startled me.

1486
01:00:24,019 --> 01:00:26,220
- It's very hard.
- Seriously.

1487
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,849
I wanted to put some salt on you.

1488
01:00:27,849 --> 01:00:29,860
My mouth keeps getting contorted
from lying here.

1489
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,860
The salt crystals are beautiful.

1490
01:00:31,860 --> 01:00:33,729
They sparkle like gems.

1491
01:00:33,729 --> 01:00:35,459
I'll give you a salt pack.

1492
01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:38,930
It's picturesque.

1493
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,639
I can't believe
there's a place like this on Earth.

1494
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,669
The city man doesn't like to lie down.

1495
01:00:47,669 --> 01:00:50,280
The sky was so beautiful over there.

1496
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,579
That's incredible.

1497
01:00:55,579 --> 01:00:57,419
I should come here again before I die.

1498
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,919
- There's a place prettier than here.
- This is insane.

1499
01:01:02,389 --> 01:01:05,130
- This is insane!
- I'm in my 40s.

1500
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:06,990
(In a trance)

1501
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:08,530
It's because they're young.

1502
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:09,900
(The man in his 40s is coming.)

1503
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,369
(Jumping)

1504
01:01:12,930 --> 01:01:14,970
(Almost like a water strider)

1505
01:01:18,939 --> 01:01:21,410
I can't open my eyes without sunglasses.

1506
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:23,180
It hurts my eyes.

1507
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,840
- I mean...
- Protect the eyes.

1508
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,950
what's interesting is that
the land is brighter than the sky.

1509
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:27,979
Gosh.

1510
01:01:27,979 --> 01:01:30,180
- Okay? Ready?
- Okay. Let's go.

1511
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:31,320
(The land is more brilliant than the sky.)

1512
01:01:32,349 --> 01:01:34,490
- Can we ride motorcycles here?
- Yes.

1513
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:35,559
(It's possible.)

1514
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:38,660
Riding the motorcycle here would
make me go crazy.

1515
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,530
Usually, there are many puddles,
but I don't see any.

1516
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,660
Doesn't it look like an eye?

1517
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,470
Someone dug out the hole.

1518
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:48,700
- Someone dug it out?
- Yes.

1519
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:51,200
- This is...
- There are many.

1520
01:01:51,740 --> 01:01:52,809
(Many holes)

1521
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:54,539
There are so many.

1522
01:01:55,439 --> 01:01:57,139
Some puddles are big.

1523
01:01:57,510 --> 01:01:59,950
- Why did they dig them out?
- Was it for the salt?

1524
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,510
Why did someone dig these out?

1525
01:02:01,510 --> 01:02:03,519
To mine the crystals.

1526
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,650
They dug them out to take out crystals.

1527
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:06,789
Over here.

1528
01:02:07,749 --> 01:02:09,019
It's a water puddle.

1529
01:02:09,019 --> 01:02:10,689
- This is fascinating.
- Shall we take a look?

1530
01:02:10,689 --> 01:02:12,030
(They get out to take a look.)

1531
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,760
(Salt crystals sparkle.)

1532
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:19,229
Look at this.

1533
01:02:19,229 --> 01:02:21,329
- Underneath is the sea.
- Do you see the water below?

1534
01:02:21,329 --> 01:02:23,599
- There's water underneath.
- It's the sea.

1535
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,010
- What? It's water.
- Come over here.

1536
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:31,610
Wait, inside here is...

1537
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:35,579
- You should wash your face with it.
- What's this?

1538
01:02:35,579 --> 01:02:37,619
- Is it warm?
- It's cold.

1539
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:39,349
- Isn't it salty?
- It's salty.

1540
01:02:39,419 --> 01:02:40,650
- Gosh.
- It's extremely salty.

1541
01:02:40,650 --> 01:02:42,360
I can feel it with my whole body.

1542
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,519
Later, there will be white stuff
on your arm.

1543
01:02:44,619 --> 01:02:47,189
- If you fall inside, don't you die?
- Is this hole natural?

1544
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:49,829
(Tasting)

1545
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,700
(Moaning)

1546
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:52,900
(Spitting out)

1547
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,070
It's extremely salty.

1548
01:02:54,599 --> 01:02:56,400
My hand turned white right away.

1549
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,510
The salt will get solid.
It will taste salty.

1550
01:02:59,070 --> 01:03:00,209
Do you want to taste it?

1551
01:03:01,809 --> 01:03:02,979
(Licking)

1552
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:05,110
He got too close.

1553
01:03:05,249 --> 01:03:06,309
I was only joking.

1554
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:10,050
Yes, it must be extremely salty.

1555
01:03:10,479 --> 01:03:12,019
- It's almost white.
- It's white.

1556
01:03:12,019 --> 01:03:14,220
Can you take a photo of this?
This is no joke.

1557
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,720
It's sparkling.

1558
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:19,059
Is this river 20m deep?

1559
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,289
- There are seven meters of salt.
- Seven meters?

1560
01:03:21,289 --> 01:03:22,729
- And here?
- Twenty meters of water.

1561
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:27,030
- If this breaks,
- No.

1562
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:29,400
- will the car splash?
- No.

1563
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,470
Isn't the surface strong?

1564
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:32,869
- It's very strong.
- It won't happen...

1565
01:03:32,869 --> 01:03:35,039
- because it's very strong.
- Really?

1566
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:37,479
- Salt falling in looks nice.
- It looks amazing.

1567
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:40,150
(Salt falls like snow.)

1568
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,950
- Nice.
- Hey, that's mine.

1569
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:45,220
- Really?
- I have one more.

1570
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:47,490
- We can pick more. Something's coming up.
- It's okay.

1571
01:03:47,849 --> 01:03:49,559
It looks like carbonated water.

1572
01:03:50,519 --> 01:03:53,160
It closes after the rainy season.

1573
01:03:54,329 --> 01:03:56,829
It opens in other places.

1574
01:03:56,829 --> 01:03:58,669
It's because the water moves.

1575
01:04:00,669 --> 01:04:03,070
- Okay, we'll eat here.
- Okay.

1576
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:05,070
Will he prepare us food?

1577
01:04:05,070 --> 01:04:06,110
(Lunch in the middle of a salt desert?)

1578
01:04:07,209 --> 01:04:10,180
(He puts a table together in an instant.)

1579
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:12,610
Are you going to eat there?

1580
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,650
It's difficult
since we're at a high altitude.

1581
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:20,519
He packed food.

1582
01:04:21,419 --> 01:04:24,389
This is part of the tour.

1583
01:04:25,630 --> 01:04:26,829
It hurts my eyes.

1584
01:04:27,689 --> 01:04:29,860
- You need to put on more sunscreen.
- Right?

1585
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:31,229
I'm worried about you.

1586
01:04:31,229 --> 01:04:33,130
Use it as much as you want.

1587
01:04:34,599 --> 01:04:35,769
The light hurts my eyes.

1588
01:04:35,769 --> 01:04:37,800
(Rubbing their faces hard with sunscreen)

1589
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,139
That was necessary.

1590
01:04:39,639 --> 01:04:41,510
Wait, that's too much.

1591
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:43,610
(He loves it.)

1592
01:04:44,209 --> 01:04:46,450
(An optical illusion mask)

1593
01:04:47,249 --> 01:04:48,410
You should put more on.

1594
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:52,349
- I should put on a lot like you.
- Yes, go ahead.

1595
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:53,789
- My face stings...
- It shouldn't touch.

1596
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,919
because I have salt on my hands.

1597
01:04:55,919 --> 01:04:58,189
- My face stings too. Maybe I got burnt.
- Right?

1598
01:04:58,189 --> 01:05:01,360
People might think that we have salt
on our faces.

1599
01:05:01,860 --> 01:05:04,559
(Thanks to them,
we made a bizarre poster.)

1600
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:06,599
(Curious)

1601
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:08,300
- What's this?
- Thank you.

1602
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,800
I thought these were fingers.

1603
01:05:10,099 --> 01:05:11,539
- I thought they were larvae.
- I thought they were fingers.

1604
01:05:11,539 --> 01:05:13,769
They really look like giant fingers.

1605
01:05:13,769 --> 01:05:15,510
- This?
- It's beef.

1606
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:17,439
It's pork.

1607
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:20,680
- Rice.
- Rice? Gosh.

1608
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:22,180
It's vegetables.

1609
01:05:22,349 --> 01:05:24,050
It's a salad.

1610
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,220
What a feast.

1611
01:05:26,189 --> 01:05:27,349
- The food looks good.
- Okay?

1612
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:28,689
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1613
01:05:28,689 --> 01:05:30,459
I'll move the car a little to protect you
from the wind.

1614
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:31,660
- Okay.
- Okay.

1615
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:32,860
- It's covering him.
- Hey.

1616
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:34,329
- What could this be?
- Do you want water?

1617
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:36,300
It looks like potatoes.

1618
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,530
- Potatoes?
- Yes.

1619
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:39,070
- I'll just look at it.
- Rice.

1620
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:40,099
(He's worried, but he tastes it first.)

1621
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:43,039
It's a combination of potatoes
and sweet potatoes.

1622
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,639
Potatoes and sweet potatoes?

1623
01:05:44,639 --> 01:05:46,110
It's slightly sweet and sour.

1624
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:48,410
What kind of meat is it?

1625
01:05:48,410 --> 01:05:50,010
- It's pork.
- Pork?

1626
01:05:50,010 --> 01:05:51,780
- Enjoy your food.
- He's cutting a steak.

1627
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:53,550
- It was so luxurious.
- This is nice.

1628
01:05:55,349 --> 01:05:57,720
(Eating a lot)

1629
01:05:58,919 --> 01:06:00,450
I really wanted to do this.

1630
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:03,490
- Are you dipping it in salt?
- Yes.

1631
01:06:04,459 --> 01:06:06,160
As a joke,

1632
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,200
people scrape off the salt
and add it to their food.

1633
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,360
They say, "It's salty."

1634
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:11,660
I thought about that too.

1635
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:13,499
- You can do it.
- I want to dip meat in it.

1636
01:06:13,499 --> 01:06:14,869
It's possible,

1637
01:06:15,030 --> 01:06:17,769
but when you get there,
you won't want to do it.

1638
01:06:17,769 --> 01:06:19,240
- Why?
- The salt is a little dirty.

1639
01:06:19,669 --> 01:06:21,639
People stepped on it for a long time.

1640
01:06:21,939 --> 01:06:23,939
Hey, there's dirt in it.

1641
01:06:23,939 --> 01:06:25,039
(He doesn't care about the dirt.)

1642
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,820
(Getting some salt)

1643
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:32,519
(Adding 95 percent of salt
and 5 percent of dirt)

1644
01:06:33,249 --> 01:06:35,760
(Si Eon also gets salt from the ground.)

1645
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:39,490
We're dipping it in Uyuni.

1646
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,760
(He copies the others
and takes a pinch of salt.)

1647
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:46,130
(Pani Bottle said that he wouldn't do it.)

1648
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,470
It's hard to put on a lot.

1649
01:06:48,169 --> 01:06:49,939
- I just sprinkled some.
- It's hard to put it on.

1650
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,840
You said that you wouldn't do it.

1651
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:53,970
It's okay to eat dirt.

1652
01:06:54,209 --> 01:06:55,410
It's sweet and salty.

1653
01:06:55,479 --> 01:06:57,479
Try this finger potato.

1654
01:06:58,849 --> 01:07:01,280
(Salt is a must.)

1655
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:03,419
Won't it be too salty?

1656
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:05,320
I can adjust the amount.

1657
01:07:05,919 --> 01:07:08,189
(Showering with salt)

1658
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,959
The salt is as hard as asphalt.

1659
01:07:11,419 --> 01:07:15,030
I broke a piece with my hand
and sprinkled it.

1660
01:07:15,329 --> 01:07:17,829
I added too much. It was very salty.

1661
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,470
I think I consumed ten packets
of ramyeon soup powder today.

1662
01:07:23,099 --> 01:07:25,340
- It's unusual.
- It doesn't look nice.

1663
01:07:25,510 --> 01:07:27,240
It looks like a larva.

1664
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,809
(Eating more salt
than recommended per day)

1665
01:07:28,809 --> 01:07:30,110
- Isn't it delicious?
- Yes.

1666
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:31,510
- This is really tasty.
- Really?

1667
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:34,280
People eat potatoes with salt.

1668
01:07:35,349 --> 01:07:36,419
The taste is between potatoes...

1669
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:37,650
- and sweet potatoes.
- Right?

1670
01:07:38,889 --> 01:07:39,990
It's fascinating.

1671
01:07:39,990 --> 01:07:40,990
(He rolls it on the floor.)

1672
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:42,419
(Tasting)

1673
01:07:42,619 --> 01:07:43,689
It's unusual.

1674
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:49,760
Everyone is becoming like Kian84.

1675
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:51,930
When you're near Kian84,
you become like him.

1676
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:53,269
They're becoming like him.

1677
01:07:53,499 --> 01:07:55,169
It's so tasty. I must have been hungry.

1678
01:07:55,570 --> 01:07:57,570
Change your boots.

1679
01:07:57,570 --> 01:07:59,910
- Boots?
- He said it in Korean.

1680
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:03,139
Kian84, size 43.

1681
01:08:03,139 --> 01:08:04,410
Yes, size 43.

1682
01:08:04,979 --> 01:08:06,579
When it's filled with water
during the rainy season,

1683
01:08:06,579 --> 01:08:09,680
the light reflects on the water,
and it looks dreamlike.

1684
01:08:09,979 --> 01:08:11,849
We went there during the dry season,

1685
01:08:11,849 --> 01:08:13,789
so we might not be able to see it.

1686
01:08:14,349 --> 01:08:15,419
Shoes here.

1687
01:08:15,419 --> 01:08:17,360
(They change into boots.)

1688
01:08:18,019 --> 01:08:19,160
I'm running out of breath.

1689
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,860
(They move to where the water is.)

1690
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:23,260
I had too much salt, so I'm sleepy.

1691
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:24,800
I feel sleepy too.

1692
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,630
My whole body feels salted.

1693
01:08:26,630 --> 01:08:28,869
In this neighborhood,
beautiful places are always difficult.

1694
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,539
You're right.

1695
01:08:33,169 --> 01:08:35,639
(After eating, they take off again.)

1696
01:08:37,309 --> 01:08:41,010
(This time, they head to water puddles
in the desert.)

1697
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:44,550
How far will we go?

1698
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,419
(While driving through the empty
and vast Uyuni Salt Flat...)

1699
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:53,990
I see something over there.

1700
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:55,030
(A blue puddle seen from far away)

1701
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:56,660
- There's something.
- It's here.

1702
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:59,430
I see some kind of water.

1703
01:09:01,229 --> 01:09:04,470
(In the middle of the white salt desert)

1704
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:08,110
- It's water.
- It's wet over there.

1705
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:09,880
The color is different.

1706
01:09:12,849 --> 01:09:15,780
The land is slightly wet.

1707
01:09:15,780 --> 01:09:18,619
- Right?
- Yes, it looks wet.

1708
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:21,689
- I can hear the wet sound.
- The sound...

1709
01:09:21,689 --> 01:09:24,360
The salt became soft.

1710
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:27,289
It's hard to tell.

1711
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:32,769
The water must flow over here.

1712
01:09:32,769 --> 01:09:34,099
(The van runs over a thin layer of water.)

1713
01:09:34,099 --> 01:09:37,639
It looks like after the rain.

1714
01:09:38,939 --> 01:09:40,269
Can the car go in?

1715
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,180
Okay.

1716
01:09:45,579 --> 01:09:47,050
Unbelievable.

1717
01:09:48,919 --> 01:09:51,650
(Splashing)

1718
01:09:51,849 --> 01:09:53,019
The water is so clear.

1719
01:09:57,519 --> 01:09:58,990
(The sky is reflected on the clear water.)

1720
01:09:58,990 --> 01:10:01,130
It looks completely different
from the salty ground.

1721
01:10:10,269 --> 01:10:12,610
It looks like there's no border
between the land and the sky.

1722
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:14,669
Over there.

1723
01:10:16,439 --> 01:10:18,079
It looks beautiful on this side.

1724
01:10:18,439 --> 01:10:20,309
There's no border
between the land and the sky.

1725
01:10:21,479 --> 01:10:23,450
It looks great when you run alone
across it.

1726
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:25,380
- Pani Bottle, you should run.
- Me?

1727
01:10:25,749 --> 01:10:27,349
Like this.

1728
01:10:28,119 --> 01:10:31,059
(Hopping)

1729
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,829
You don't look so great.

1730
01:10:34,059 --> 01:10:36,430
You look like a frilled lizard
that jumps over the water.

1731
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:39,500
(Excited frilled lizard)

1732
01:10:41,429 --> 01:10:42,540
Gosh.

1733
01:10:43,099 --> 01:10:45,910
I can't believe that I went there.
It feels like a dream.

1734
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:48,509
We saw both the dry and the rainy season.

1735
01:10:48,509 --> 01:10:50,210
You were so lucky.

1736
01:10:50,339 --> 01:10:51,780
Pani Bottle, do you like Tekken?

1737
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,549
- Tekken? I know what it is,
- Yes.

1738
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:55,620
- but I don't play it.
- Tekken has a background like this.

1739
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,450
- Really?
- Was it on Tekken Seven?

1740
01:10:57,450 --> 01:10:59,120
It was.

1741
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,549
It's on my favorite game, Tekken.

1742
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:02,219
They advance like this.

1743
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:07,830
Si Eon, do you want to imitate Tekken?

1744
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:10,759
- Which character do you want to play?
- I'll play Heihachi.

1745
01:11:10,759 --> 01:11:12,469
- What about you? Paul?
- I'll play Paul.

1746
01:11:12,469 --> 01:11:13,929
Pani Bottle, can you film us?

1747
01:11:13,929 --> 01:11:15,670
- Hold on.
- We'll do the same.

1748
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:16,900
(How people in their 40s enjoy
Uyuni Salt Flat)

1749
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,170
Ready, fight.

1750
01:11:19,769 --> 01:11:22,009
Gosh, it's the same background.

1751
01:11:22,009 --> 01:11:23,610
(Hyper realistic step)

1752
01:11:24,139 --> 01:11:25,139
(He attacks first.)

1753
01:11:26,509 --> 01:11:27,509
(He fails to punch.)

1754
01:11:29,950 --> 01:11:31,650
(While Kian84 steps,
Si Eon attacks twice.)

1755
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:32,849
(Grunting)

1756
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:36,059
You should use techniques.

1757
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:37,860
- Wave.
- Military power.

1758
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,530
Gosh, I'm tired.

1759
01:11:39,629 --> 01:11:40,830
He ran out of energy...

1760
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:42,729
- because he got tired.
- This is funny.

1761
01:11:43,030 --> 01:11:44,660
Thank you for saving this.

1762
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:45,969
That's impressive.

1763
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:47,629
I can't believe it.

1764
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,799
- I'll take your photos.
- Okay.

1765
01:11:49,799 --> 01:11:52,570
Let's take photos.

1766
01:11:52,570 --> 01:11:53,570
(It's time to take photos.)

1767
01:11:54,309 --> 01:11:55,410
Together.

1768
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:56,610
(The guide tells them to strike a pose.)

1769
01:11:57,179 --> 01:11:59,379
He asks for boring poses.

1770
01:11:59,379 --> 01:12:01,280
One, two, three.

1771
01:12:01,979 --> 01:12:03,179
No, it's boring.

1772
01:12:03,179 --> 01:12:07,549
(Common photos of tourists)

1773
01:12:07,549 --> 01:12:08,790
What is this pose?

1774
01:12:09,889 --> 01:12:11,259
Shall we think out of the box?

1775
01:12:11,259 --> 01:12:12,389
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

1776
01:12:12,389 --> 01:12:14,259
How about we stack our heads?

1777
01:12:14,629 --> 01:12:15,929
- I got it.
- Okay.

1778
01:12:15,929 --> 01:12:18,129
- I'll sit like this.
- It's been too boring.

1779
01:12:18,599 --> 01:12:19,700
(I'm not sure.)

1780
01:12:21,370 --> 01:12:23,670
They should be higher.
Kian84, raise your hands higher.

1781
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:26,040
(Bizarre)

1782
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:29,179
(Anyway, it's a new pose.)

1783
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:30,410
Come up with something new.

1784
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:32,910
I want one too.

1785
01:12:32,910 --> 01:12:34,250
(Peekaboo)

1786
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:37,049
- I want to redo it.
- It's so lame.

1787
01:12:38,150 --> 01:12:39,650
I said a bad word
in a beautiful place like this.

1788
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:42,420
Look how cool that car looks.

1789
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:44,360
- I want a picture alone.
- We should be creative.

1790
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,129
Everyone takes a photo with their car
in Uyuni Salt Flats.

1791
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:48,389
- Really?
- Let's not do what other people do.

1792
01:12:48,389 --> 01:12:49,660
- We skip it?
- Yes.

1793
01:12:50,330 --> 01:12:52,259
One, two, three.

1794
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:54,729
- Let's look at each other and smile.
- Okay.

1795
01:12:55,469 --> 01:12:57,099
One, two, three.

1796
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,240
Poop, boogers.

1797
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,979
Goodness. How childish he is.

1798
01:13:03,309 --> 01:13:05,210
(Look how childish they are.
They're 39.6 years old on average.)

1799
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:06,479
What is he saying?

1800
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:08,280
Wipe your nose and you see boogers.

1801
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,420
Let's go.

1802
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,150
(We even made a poster out of it.)

1803
01:13:13,150 --> 01:13:15,049
- It made it on the poster.
- They took a good picture.

1804
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,589
Right.

1805
01:13:18,860 --> 01:13:20,059
I was so into it at the moment.

1806
01:13:20,059 --> 01:13:22,530
He gets immersed easily wherever he goes.

1807
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:24,030
He's a sensitive artist.

1808
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:26,370
- He knows how to enjoy a trip.
- Right.

1809
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:28,229
(He takes off his sunglasses.)

1810
01:13:29,799 --> 01:13:30,969
It's so sunny.

1811
01:13:30,969 --> 01:13:32,070
(He enjoys Uyuni Salt Flats
with his bare eyes.)

1812
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:33,740
Do you see this?

1813
01:13:34,210 --> 01:13:36,309
I'm not sure
if the camera can capture this.

1814
01:13:38,410 --> 01:13:41,479
I don't know
if I can come back here again.

1815
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:45,750
You must visit this place if you can.

1816
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:49,960
I'm sorry
I'm enjoying this stunning view alone.

1817
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,689
(He wants to share the view with people.)

1818
01:13:51,689 --> 01:13:52,860
It's so beautiful.

1819
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:54,889
- I felt bad seeing this view alone.
- I'm so jealous.

1820
01:13:54,889 --> 01:13:56,629
Anyway, it was so much fun.

1821
01:13:57,629 --> 01:13:59,170
We went through a lot too.

1822
01:13:59,929 --> 01:14:02,170
You have to go to the trouble...

1823
01:14:02,170 --> 01:14:03,799
to see an amazing view like this.

1824
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,500
Si Eon was right.

1825
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,710
When you eat something
expensive and delicious,

1826
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:10,110
- you feel bad for your friends.
- They come to mind.

1827
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:12,450
I felt like I shouldn't be seeing
the great view alone.

1828
01:14:12,450 --> 01:14:14,309
- I felt a little guilty.
- It's a shame.

1829
01:14:14,679 --> 01:14:16,019
That's why we recorded it.

1830
01:14:16,979 --> 01:14:18,219
So that we can see it together.

1831
01:14:18,219 --> 01:14:19,620
To share it with everyone.

1832
01:14:19,889 --> 01:14:21,650
If you can find an opportunity,

1833
01:14:22,219 --> 01:14:24,420
- you must visit that place.
- I want to go there.

1834
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:26,259
It must take about 40 hours to get there.

1835
01:14:26,259 --> 01:14:29,330
If you want to fly there,
you should transfer five times.

1836
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:32,629
I'll just enjoy it with my eyes here.

1837
01:14:32,629 --> 01:14:33,700
(Glaring)

1838
01:14:34,099 --> 01:14:36,139
How about we run to catch the camera?

1839
01:14:36,939 --> 01:14:38,000
One, two...

1840
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:40,870
(The beautiful view makes them forget
about how tired they are.)

1841
01:14:41,469 --> 01:14:42,580
(They're more excited than ever.)

1842
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:43,710
They're having fun.

1843
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,740
(Wait for me.)

1844
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:49,049
(Hopping)

1845
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:51,920
You might fall.

1846
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:54,620
He's worried that our kid might fall.

1847
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:57,689
- How sweet.
- I'm so tired.

1848
01:14:57,689 --> 01:15:00,330
The salt stings us overall.

1849
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:04,700
You have to endure the pain
to enjoy this great view.

1850
01:15:07,269 --> 01:15:08,400
(They endured their skin
stinging from the sun and the salt.)

1851
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,099
It was more touching
because it was difficult to get there.

1852
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:16,839
(To the destination of their Uyuni tour)

1853
01:15:19,650 --> 01:15:20,849
(Salt hotel)

1854
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:23,150
- We're here.
- Many people visited here.

1855
01:15:25,379 --> 01:15:26,549
- What's that?
- There's a Korean flag.

1856
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:28,389
I see the Korean language too.

1857
01:15:28,389 --> 01:15:31,120
Tourists hung their flags there.

1858
01:15:31,389 --> 01:15:33,860
(The first salt hotel)

1859
01:15:34,490 --> 01:15:36,360
(Sources: Dakar YouTube channel)

1860
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:39,030
(A Death Race was held
in the middle of Uyuni Salt Flats.)

1861
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:40,530
I didn't know about that.

1862
01:15:40,530 --> 01:15:44,469
(A Death Race was held
in the middle of Uyuni Salt Flats.)

1863
01:15:44,469 --> 01:15:45,639
A Death Race. Goodness.

1864
01:15:45,639 --> 01:15:49,210
(It's one of the main courses
of the Dakar Rally.)

1865
01:15:50,309 --> 01:15:51,410
Everyone,

1866
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:56,150
we arrived at the final destination
of our trip.

1867
01:15:56,519 --> 01:16:01,349
We're going to draw something on a shirt
instead of hanging a flag.

1868
01:16:02,389 --> 01:16:03,719
Do you see that?

1869
01:16:03,719 --> 01:16:07,160
We'll draw and hang our T-shirt there.

1870
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:09,400
(What will they draw?)

1871
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:10,830
You'll leave your shirt there?

1872
01:16:11,299 --> 01:16:13,429
We thought
we could make it more meaningful...

1873
01:16:13,429 --> 01:16:16,469
by drawing something
rather than hanging the Korean flag.

1874
01:16:16,469 --> 01:16:19,540
You start your trip with an art diary.

1875
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:21,939
You also wrap up the trip by drawing.

1876
01:16:21,939 --> 01:16:24,809
- Can you hang it without permission?
- Is that okay?

1877
01:16:24,809 --> 01:16:28,809
You can hang whatever you want there.

1878
01:16:28,809 --> 01:16:30,780
That's why we decided to hang a shirt.

1879
01:16:31,549 --> 01:16:34,349
All right. Let's start drawing.

1880
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:36,059
Okay.

1881
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:39,929
- Acrylic.
- Acrylic paint.

1882
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:42,960
We came to the market near our lodging.

1883
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:45,629
(Kian84 asked them
to buy paint and brushes.)

1884
01:16:45,629 --> 01:16:46,700
(- Please get acrylic paint.
- Okay.)

1885
01:16:47,099 --> 01:16:48,269
(Si Eon and Pani Bottle got them
at the market the day before.)

1886
01:16:48,269 --> 01:16:49,799
It's acrylic paint.

1887
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,809
How about this?

1888
01:16:52,809 --> 01:16:54,439
Look.

1889
01:16:54,439 --> 01:16:57,110
We draw a rectangle like a flag.

1890
01:16:57,110 --> 01:17:00,009
Pani Bottle takes charge of one part,
I take the second part,

1891
01:17:00,009 --> 01:17:01,750
- and Si Eon takes the last part.
- Okay.

1892
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:02,950
How do we divide the three parts?

1893
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:04,450
Do we draw the three words
from Adventure by Accident?

1894
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:06,719
- Let's shorten it to MAA.
- MAA?

1895
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:08,189
- Adventure by...
- AA...

1896
01:17:08,189 --> 01:17:09,490
Hold on.

1897
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:10,990
Isn't it ABA, then?

1898
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:12,790
Adventure by Accident.

1899
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:14,059
MAA is easier to pronounce.

1900
01:17:14,059 --> 01:17:15,290
- MAA.
- MAA.

1901
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:17,599
You need to put an M
to make the word popular.

1902
01:17:17,599 --> 01:17:20,030
- Where is that M coming from?
- Where did you get the M?

1903
01:17:20,030 --> 01:17:21,170
It doesn't have an M.

1904
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:22,330
Let's say it's from "Narco-Saints."

1905
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:24,070
- It doesn't have an M, though.
- Wait. What does the M mean?

1906
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:26,339
We don't have an M
in the name of the show.

1907
01:17:26,339 --> 01:17:28,139
Adventure by Accident. ABA.

1908
01:17:28,139 --> 01:17:30,210
- By Accident...
- By Accident?

1909
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,479
- ABA.
- Adventure...

1910
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:34,080
by Accident.

1911
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:38,049
How about we call it
Advemture by Accident?

1912
01:17:39,049 --> 01:17:40,689
Advemture?

1913
01:17:41,849 --> 01:17:43,920
- Advemture by...
- It's the altitude sickness talking.

1914
01:17:44,120 --> 01:17:45,589
- How about just AB?
- No.

1915
01:17:45,589 --> 01:17:47,990
- It must sound similar to "Narco-Saints."
- How about this?

1916
01:17:47,990 --> 01:17:50,559
- We should follow the trend.
- It doesn't have an M.

1917
01:17:50,559 --> 01:17:52,559
- What?
- We don't have an M in the name.

1918
01:17:52,559 --> 01:17:54,170
Advemture.

1919
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,670
Men's Adventure by Accident.

1920
01:17:56,170 --> 01:17:57,540
- That's it.
- Right!

1921
01:17:57,540 --> 01:17:59,170
- It makes sense.
- MAA.

1922
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:01,269
That makes sense.

1923
01:18:01,269 --> 01:18:02,439
You changed the title.

1924
01:18:02,439 --> 01:18:03,610
- Okay.
- MAA.

1925
01:18:03,610 --> 01:18:04,879
Si Eon is indeed good.

1926
01:18:05,240 --> 01:18:06,610
I'm good at coming up with names.

1927
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:08,849
- Adventure...
- Let me draw the sections.

1928
01:18:08,849 --> 01:18:09,979
- Okay.
- Okay.

1929
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,650
(He divides sections first.)

1930
01:18:14,049 --> 01:18:15,250
We'll draw vertically.

1931
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:18,019
We can't draw at the same time
if it's horizontal.

1932
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:19,559
So it starts from the left?

1933
01:18:19,559 --> 01:18:22,229
We just changed the title, right?

1934
01:18:22,229 --> 01:18:24,059
I'll just give you one section each.

1935
01:18:24,059 --> 01:18:26,530
Draw whatever you want there.

1936
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:27,530
Okay.

1937
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:30,540
Get the colors you want and start drawing.

1938
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:32,839
I had fun riding a motorcycle.

1939
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,210
I love the flats too.

1940
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:37,009
Why do I remember the Amazon so much?

1941
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:39,710
(The food was too difficult
for the city man to eat.)

1942
01:18:39,710 --> 01:18:42,009
For some reason,
I kept thinking about the Amazon a lot.

1943
01:18:42,349 --> 01:18:44,349
(I want to go home.)

1944
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:47,189
(It was a dream come true to Kian84,)

1945
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:52,219
(but Si Eon was shocked by the culture.)

1946
01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:55,759
- Draw the Amazon.
- Draw the Amazon, then.

1947
01:18:55,759 --> 01:18:56,799
Okay.

1948
01:18:56,799 --> 01:18:58,759
- What are you going to draw, Pani Bottle?
- I'm practicing.

1949
01:18:59,299 --> 01:19:00,370
He's good.

1950
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:02,500
- I can feel it already.
- He's a good artist.

1951
01:19:03,070 --> 01:19:05,469
(Actually,
Pani Bottle went to art school.)

1952
01:19:05,799 --> 01:19:09,610
Pani Bottle wanted to draw webcomics.

1953
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:10,809
(Webcomics drawn by Pani Bottle)

1954
01:19:10,809 --> 01:19:12,979
- Wait.
- What? Did you draw that?

1955
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:14,280
Wait.

1956
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:15,780
(What? Did you draw that?)

1957
01:19:16,009 --> 01:19:18,049
- My goodness.
- It looks good in a way.

1958
01:19:18,049 --> 01:19:20,620
"I'm a mosquito." What is that about?

1959
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:22,189
And you said you went to art school?

1960
01:19:22,189 --> 01:19:23,990
Were you going to become
a webcomic artist...

1961
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:26,189
when you drew like that?

1962
01:19:26,389 --> 01:19:28,759
- Really?
- How did they find that?

1963
01:19:28,759 --> 01:19:30,629
Did you enter the school
with English skills?

1964
01:19:30,929 --> 01:19:33,700
- Look at your drawing skills.
- It has a good story.

1965
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:35,170
You can't brag about that.

1966
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:37,570
- I wasn't a good artist.
- I was impressed when I heard...

1967
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:39,809
- That's it, right?
- Yes.

1968
01:19:40,740 --> 01:19:42,979
What should I draw in the center?

1969
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:45,309
(Kian84 feels a lot of pressure.)

1970
01:19:46,179 --> 01:19:49,519
You have put an animal in the middle
to make it look cool.

1971
01:19:49,519 --> 01:19:50,620
An alligator.

1972
01:19:50,920 --> 01:19:52,849
(An alligator?)

1973
01:19:52,849 --> 01:19:54,290
(Piranhas?)

1974
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:57,589
(Kian's favorite, alpacas?)

1975
01:19:57,589 --> 01:19:58,990
(Alpacas which Si Eon didn't let him
take photos with?)

1976
01:19:58,990 --> 01:20:01,129
(He committed the worst sin.)

1977
01:20:01,129 --> 01:20:02,729
It's having a hard time under the sun.
Let's take a picture with it.

1978
01:20:03,059 --> 01:20:05,400
I didn't let him take pictures with it.

1979
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:06,469
- With the alpaca.
- With the alpaca.

1980
01:20:06,469 --> 01:20:07,969
- Did it keep bothering you?
- My wife...

1981
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:10,799
scolded me about it at home.

1982
01:20:11,099 --> 01:20:12,370
She asked why I didn't let him.

1983
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:14,769
- Poor him.
- So she knitted an alpaca.

1984
01:20:14,769 --> 01:20:16,009
- An alpaca?
- An alpaca?

1985
01:20:16,009 --> 01:20:17,740
- It's handmade.
- Oh, dear.

1986
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:19,240
- It's adorable.
- She made it herself?

1987
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:21,809
- She knitted every single stitch.
- Really?

1988
01:20:21,809 --> 01:20:23,479
- How did she make this?
- Seriously.

1989
01:20:23,479 --> 01:20:24,879
- She didn't buy this?
- Didn't she buy this?

1990
01:20:24,879 --> 01:20:25,920
- No.
- Oh, my.

1991
01:20:26,349 --> 01:20:27,620
- That's impressive.
- She bought the thread.

1992
01:20:27,620 --> 01:20:30,519
She bought a ball of yarn to make this.

1993
01:20:30,519 --> 01:20:33,889
- It looks so cute.
- How handy she is.

1994
01:20:33,889 --> 01:20:36,360
- Oh, dear.
- She knitted it for you.

1995
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:38,360
She nagged me a lot...

1996
01:20:38,360 --> 01:20:39,629
because I didn't let you
take photos with it.

1997
01:20:39,629 --> 01:20:42,129
- I hope she scolds you again.
- Now that he's with an alpaca,

1998
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:43,500
- take a photo of him.
- Right.

1999
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:44,639
I'll take a photo.

2000
01:20:45,769 --> 01:20:47,139
She's amazing.

2001
01:20:47,839 --> 01:20:50,339
- In 1, 2, 3.
- It suits him.

2002
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:52,040
I feel like I'm in Cusco.

2003
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:53,710
(I finally met my precious alpaca.)

2004
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:55,809
That's good.

2005
01:20:55,809 --> 01:20:57,219
(I adore you.)

2006
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:59,490
Please take good care of it.

2007
01:20:59,990 --> 01:21:02,019
Since he didn't take pictures
with an alpaca,

2008
01:21:02,019 --> 01:21:04,360
- He has to draw that.
- he might draw one.

2009
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,360
- Can I go over to your side?
- No.

2010
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:10,160
I'll try my best not to.

2011
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:12,460
- Let me take a little space.
- Okay.

2012
01:21:12,460 --> 01:21:13,469
I'm sorry.

2013
01:21:13,469 --> 01:21:15,700
- It's okay.
- Pani Bottle, I keep going over the line.

2014
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:17,339
It's not because I'm greedy.

2015
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:18,939
- You should've done it alone, then.
- I want it to look perfect.

2016
01:21:18,939 --> 01:21:20,939
The one in the center should be big.

2017
01:21:20,939 --> 01:21:22,469
The rest of us will be down here.

2018
01:21:22,469 --> 01:21:24,879
- I'll draw mine here.
- No, it's okay.

2019
01:21:24,879 --> 01:21:26,280
- I'm sorry, Pani Bottle.
- It's all right.

2020
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:28,809
The chicken is getting bigger.

2021
01:21:29,049 --> 01:21:30,379
The one that kept waking you up.

2022
01:21:30,379 --> 01:21:33,150
(A chicken kept him awake...)

2023
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:35,250
(in the Amazon.)

2024
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:37,790
- He said he wanted to kill it.
- The chicken jerk.

2025
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:39,160
(As loud as it was, it's big.)

2026
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,229
I could've drawn Porfi, Eric,

2027
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:43,000
piranhas, and other things.

2028
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,330
I couldn't cram them in there.

2029
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:49,599
I thought the chicken could represent
a longer time.

2030
01:21:49,599 --> 01:21:52,469
I wouldn't have chosen it
if it had cried only in the morning.

2031
01:21:52,469 --> 01:21:54,070
It cried 24 hours a day.

2032
01:21:54,070 --> 01:21:56,110
That's why I drew that.

2033
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:58,410
I'll rip off its wings.

2034
01:21:59,339 --> 01:22:01,049
Let me take some of your space.

2035
01:22:01,179 --> 01:22:02,780
It looks like I'm fighting
with the chicken.

2036
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:04,750
- No.
- It becomes a story.

2037
01:22:05,849 --> 01:22:10,519
(Si Eon drew the moment
when Kian84 swam in the Amazon.)

2038
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:13,360
- This is me and Kian84.
- He's good at drawing.

2039
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:14,490
- It has a story.
- He's good.

2040
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:15,759
Really. It surprised me.

2041
01:22:15,759 --> 01:22:17,960
- That's a good detail.
- Pani Bottle is flying to us.

2042
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,129
He's a good drawer.

2043
01:22:19,599 --> 01:22:22,429
Pani Bottle approaches it
in three dimensions.

2044
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,769
Pani Bottle is doing well.

2045
01:22:25,570 --> 01:22:28,610
(He went on a bike tour
with Si Eon and Kian84.)

2046
01:22:29,710 --> 01:22:34,150
(He can't forget the moment
when they rode at 4,000m.)

2047
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:36,650
If you don't travel,
you're living the wrong life.

2048
01:22:36,879 --> 01:22:39,349
- It even has a blue bag.
- He draws well.

2049
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,490
Inca Kola.

2050
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:42,960
- I got the color.
- That's good.

2051
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:47,290
(Kian84 was lonely on his first night.)

2052
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:49,759
(What am I doing alone in this big room?)

2053
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:53,599
(Darn it, I feel lonely.)

2054
01:22:54,969 --> 01:22:58,269
(Inca Kola helped him get
through the lonely night.)

2055
01:22:58,969 --> 01:23:00,769
- It looks a little weird.
- Is that you?

2056
01:23:00,769 --> 01:23:01,939
Si Eon with a hat.

2057
01:23:02,110 --> 01:23:03,509
- It's Si Eon?
- Yes.

2058
01:23:03,509 --> 01:23:05,210
- It's a good drawing.
- He drew it well.

2059
01:23:05,210 --> 01:23:06,450
It looks like me.

2060
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:10,120
It doesn't look complete
if there's an empty space.

2061
01:23:10,549 --> 01:23:12,420
It's fully colored.

2062
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:13,650
It should be fully covered.

2063
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:15,549
I'll use blue since it's the sky.

2064
01:23:15,549 --> 01:23:16,660
Okay.

2065
01:23:16,889 --> 01:23:19,519
I think we should have one person write
for consistency.

2066
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:21,490
The first word is "tae," right?

2067
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:23,559
Is it "tae?"

2068
01:23:23,960 --> 01:23:26,259
- Yes. It's "tae."
- It's "tae."

2069
01:23:27,070 --> 01:23:28,570
(Assistant Pani Bottle lost his temper
on the last day of the trip as well.)

2070
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:29,769
It's because he has altitude sickness.

2071
01:23:29,769 --> 01:23:31,469
That's okay. It happens
when you spend some time with him.

2072
01:23:31,469 --> 01:23:33,410
Pani Bottle started to clench his teeth.

2073
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:37,110
(Clenching his jaw)

2074
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:39,280
- Hold on.
- By the way, Pani Bottle,

2075
01:23:39,509 --> 01:23:41,509
- you started to get mad at me.
- No.

2076
01:23:43,019 --> 01:23:44,019
Eo.

2077
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:46,389
Na and an N.

2078
01:23:48,490 --> 01:23:50,019
It really hurts my pride.

2079
01:23:51,290 --> 01:23:52,460
- Gye.
- Gye.

2080
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,860
It's g, y, and e.

2081
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:56,259
- Gye.
- As in chicken, right?

2082
01:23:56,259 --> 01:23:57,530
- Right.
- Correct.

2083
01:23:57,530 --> 01:24:00,170
Interestingly, it can also mean chicken.

2084
01:24:00,299 --> 01:24:02,769
That's true. Gye.

2085
01:24:02,769 --> 01:24:04,670
- This is enough.
- It's not neat, but it looks good.

2086
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:06,570
- We could remove this, though.
- It's good.

2087
01:24:06,570 --> 01:24:08,740
(The drawing is finally done.)

2088
01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:11,439
I love it.

2089
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:13,479
- The wings got cut off.
- We drew our own memories.

2090
01:24:13,479 --> 01:24:15,250
- The chicken's wings got cut.
- They were removed.

2091
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:16,950
It has all kinds of memories.

2092
01:24:18,179 --> 01:24:19,450
The sun is setting now.

2093
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:21,250
(While they were drawing,
the sun started to set.)

2094
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:24,689
(The sun is sinking
on the Uyuni Salt Flats.)

2095
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,460
(Dashing)

2096
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:32,759
Like this. It's okay, right?

2097
01:24:32,759 --> 01:24:35,330
Si Eon, we stained the flag.

2098
01:24:35,900 --> 01:24:37,740
- Oh, no.
- No way.

2099
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:38,769
Wait.

2100
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:42,939
- How does it look, Pani Bottle?
- It's good.

2101
01:24:42,939 --> 01:24:44,240
(The shirt is hung among many flags.)

2102
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:45,809
All right. I'm taking pictures.

2103
01:24:45,809 --> 01:24:47,250
Si Eon, can you spread this?

2104
01:24:48,179 --> 01:24:49,820
"Chicken from the fiery pit?"

2105
01:24:50,349 --> 01:24:52,780
Is it still there?

2106
01:24:52,950 --> 01:24:55,790
I hope someone confirms it's still there
if they're going there.

2107
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:57,860
- I know.
- Please let us know.

2108
01:24:58,759 --> 01:24:59,990
Let's say a few words each.

2109
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:01,790
Okay. First of all,

2110
01:25:01,790 --> 01:25:05,200
I was so happy and tired on the way here.

2111
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:06,830
I also got mad and irritated,

2112
01:25:06,830 --> 01:25:09,530
but I made great memories here.

2113
01:25:09,599 --> 01:25:11,769
It was good to meet Pani Bottle.

2114
01:25:11,769 --> 01:25:14,540
It also felt great...

2115
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:17,040
to fight with Kian84 again
after two years.

2116
01:25:17,139 --> 01:25:18,439
I said everything I wanted to say.

2117
01:25:18,439 --> 01:25:20,809
I wasn't mad or angry.

2118
01:25:20,809 --> 01:25:22,009
I just had so much fun.

2119
01:25:22,009 --> 01:25:23,320
I want to travel again.

2120
01:25:24,979 --> 01:25:26,420
I hope we get high ratings...

2121
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,450
and shoot Season Two.

2122
01:25:28,450 --> 01:25:30,089
- Then I will...
- Okay!

2123
01:25:30,259 --> 01:25:31,660
(Its Season 2 production was confirmed
on the day of the shoot.)

2124
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:33,189
Your dream came true.

2125
01:25:33,189 --> 01:25:34,629
It came true.

2126
01:25:34,629 --> 01:25:35,990
- It's incredible.
- It's perfect.

2127
01:25:35,990 --> 01:25:37,830
Whatever you say comes true.

2128
01:25:38,259 --> 01:25:41,229
(He hoped Messi won the World Cup...)

2129
01:25:41,229 --> 01:25:43,099
(and they shot
Adventure by Accident Season 2.)

2130
01:25:43,469 --> 01:25:45,439
Kian84, you bring good luck.

2131
01:25:45,439 --> 01:25:46,509
- Yes.
- He has good energy.

2132
01:25:46,509 --> 01:25:47,670
He has good luck this year.

2133
01:25:47,839 --> 01:25:49,809
It was an honor to travel with you guys.

2134
01:25:49,809 --> 01:25:51,910
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

2135
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:53,349
(They toast, feeling good energy.)

2136
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:57,049
(They take a bite of sour lime...)

2137
01:25:59,019 --> 01:26:01,150
(and pinch some salt from the ground.)

2138
01:26:02,219 --> 01:26:03,990
I want to try that too.

2139
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:06,189
It was like a dream
to eat the salt off my hand.

2140
01:26:06,189 --> 01:26:07,759
I really want to join them for that.

2141
01:26:08,259 --> 01:26:11,629
- Adventure by Accident!
- Adventure by Accident!

2142
01:26:11,629 --> 01:26:14,929
(They arrived at their final destination,
Uyuni Salt Flats, in one piece.)

2143
01:26:17,269 --> 01:26:20,170
The color started to change every minute.

2144
01:26:20,170 --> 01:26:21,740
It was so beautiful.

2145
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:25,710
(They can't get over how stunning it is.)

2146
01:26:27,379 --> 01:26:30,650
This is crazy. It's getting crazier.

2147
01:26:30,879 --> 01:26:33,250
It looks different from the back.

2148
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:36,389
- It was so dreamy.
- I can imagine.

2149
01:26:36,389 --> 01:26:39,559
I feel like being there was a dream.

2150
01:26:39,559 --> 01:26:41,490
It keeps changing. It gets darker.

2151
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:44,229
I've never seen anything like this
in my life.

2152
01:26:44,229 --> 01:26:45,729
(They stayed in the sunset for a while.)

2153
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,129
It's so beautiful.

2154
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:49,500
I have to record this.

2155
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:50,870
(They start to leave.)

2156
01:26:53,339 --> 01:26:56,540
(Kian84 still stands there alone.)

2157
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,339
Everyone.

2158
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:00,910
I was going to turn off the camera
and leave,

2159
01:27:01,710 --> 01:27:03,519
but the sunset is too beautiful...

2160
01:27:03,519 --> 01:27:06,920
for me to turn off the camera.

2161
01:27:11,160 --> 01:27:12,219
I...

2162
01:27:14,290 --> 01:27:15,830
always dreamed of coming here.

2163
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:20,400
Thank you so much
for helping my dream come true.

2164
01:27:28,809 --> 01:27:30,639
(He dreamed of escaping...)

2165
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:34,879
(and having a 2nd chapter in his life.)

2166
01:27:35,610 --> 01:27:39,250
(Kian84 wanted to go
to an unfamiliar place...)

2167
01:27:40,689 --> 01:27:44,389
(where nobody knew him.)

2168
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,689
(He went on a trip,
looking for new encounters.)

2169
01:27:51,729 --> 01:27:54,129
(He made friends more quickly
than we thought in Iquitos.)

2170
01:27:54,769 --> 01:27:57,070
(He met Sharon...)

2171
01:27:57,070 --> 01:28:00,240
(and Eric's family in the Amazon.)

2172
01:28:00,839 --> 01:28:04,280
(He also met a friend his age
on the other side of the world, Bolivia.)

2173
01:28:05,139 --> 01:28:08,679
(He hit it off with a little boy
named Porfi Junior.)

2174
01:28:09,250 --> 01:28:11,849
(Many people welcomed him like family.)

2175
01:28:12,879 --> 01:28:15,889
(His friends were with him
on the entire journey.)

2176
01:28:17,490 --> 01:28:19,889
(The last stop of their journey)

2177
01:28:20,860 --> 01:28:24,599
(He's in Uyuni Salt Flats
which he always dreamed of.)

2178
01:28:26,830 --> 01:28:28,330
We...

2179
01:28:28,769 --> 01:28:29,870
live only once.

2180
01:28:30,469 --> 01:28:33,139
Let's be happy and have no regrets.

2181
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:43,879
That was just unsolicited advice from me.

2182
01:28:46,379 --> 01:28:47,920
Good luck in 2023.

2183
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:50,889
Good luck to everyone
who was born in 1984.

2184
01:28:52,059 --> 01:28:53,429
Anyone born in 1982, let's go!

2185
01:28:53,429 --> 01:28:55,689
- Anyone born in 1985.
- Those who were born in 1987.

2186
01:28:55,689 --> 01:28:58,330
- Go, anyone born in 1984.
- Good luck, Kian84.

2187
01:28:58,799 --> 01:28:59,860
Good work.

2188
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:01,769
Good luck, everyone.

2189
01:29:07,240 --> 01:29:09,610
(He dreams of leaving
to go somewhere again.)

2190
01:29:10,509 --> 01:29:14,349
(The first adventure
of Adventure by Accident ends.)

2191
01:29:14,379 --> 01:29:15,950
(We have post-credit scenes.)

2192
01:29:16,549 --> 01:29:17,750
Oh, my gosh.

2193
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:19,650
- That's the Milky Way.
- The Milky Way.

2194
01:29:21,549 --> 01:29:22,689
Our next travel destination is...

2195
01:29:23,490 --> 01:29:24,490
The North Pole.

2196
01:29:24,920 --> 01:29:26,689
I want to go to North Korea.

2197
01:29:28,589 --> 01:29:29,689
Can't we go to North Korea?

2198
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:36,700
(When the first episode aired,)

2199
01:29:37,339 --> 01:29:40,070
(surprisingly, he still drank
and talked on the floor.)

2200
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:42,570
So, where do you want to go next?

2201
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:44,879
Next time I want to go to...
