1
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,779
(Day 4 of the trip, Cusco, Peru)

2
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:14,610
(The first cozy night in Cusco
comes to an end.)

3
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,050
I was so excited when morning came.

4
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,819
(9:30 a.m., Cusco, Peru)

5
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:25,959
(The locals
energetically start their day.)

6
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,389
(What about the happy
South American brothers?)

7
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,630
(Quiet)

8
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,299
(Evidence of last night)

9
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,369
(What about Kian84, the birthday boy?)

10
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,299
(Rubbing)

11
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,409
(Scratching)

12
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,040
(He starts his birthday
by scratching his whole body.)

13
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,409
(Suddenly getting up)

14
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,979
(Where is this? Who am I?)

15
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,449
(On the other hand,
Si Eon is very still in his sleep.)

16
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,420
(Wiggling)

17
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,229
(He barely gets up
while rubbing his face.)

18
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:03,729
Gosh. Doesn't your head hurt?

19
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,100
My head feels a little heavy.

20
00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:08,500
Gosh.

21
00:02:09,269 --> 00:02:11,839
- You guys slept in.
- Since it's a high-altitude location,

22
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:13,910
it was hard to feel rested...

23
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,109
even after sleeping.

24
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:17,109
- There wasn't enough oxygen.
- Our heads kept hurting.

25
00:02:17,109 --> 00:02:18,139
- Right.
- I see.

26
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:19,609
- It felt a bit suffocating.

27
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:21,180
It's kind of like this.

28
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,779
Apparently, some people say
that when you're on a mountain,

29
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:25,050
it feels like breathing through a straw.

30
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,449
- Oh, that's right.
- It feels suffocating.

31
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:28,820
- Exactly.
- That's right.

32
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,520
That's a good way to put it.

33
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,559
You're good at expressing things.

34
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,389
Doesn't something feel
different today, everyone?

35
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:36,460
- We didn't say hello.
- That's right.

36
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,869
A member of the Ki line left,
and a new member has come.

37
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:40,869
- Nice.
- Hello.

38
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,240
The rotation is really fast.

39
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,999
MINO's schedule won't work going forward.

40
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,109
I came in MINO's place.

41
00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:49,369
I'm Lee Seung Hoon of Winner.
Nice to meet you.

42
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,740
- Oh, my.
- Welcome.

43
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,809
Yes. Welcome.

44
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:54,680
I watched the first episode.

45
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,020
I like going on trips with no plans,
just like Kian84.

46
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,419
Do you also only take
one or two pairs of underwear?

47
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:02,449
For three nights and four days,

48
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,059
I take two sets.

49
00:03:04,059 --> 00:03:05,059
- Two sets?
- Underwear?

50
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,729
One cool set of clothes
and one comfortable set of clothes.

51
00:03:06,729 --> 00:03:07,889
What about for ten nights?

52
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:09,830
For ten nights,
I'd take three sets of clothes.

53
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:12,130
- I see.
- That's a good stance.

54
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,169
Is this good enough for the Ki Line?

55
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:15,869
- Gosh. He's very welcome.
- Please take good care of me.

56
00:03:15,869 --> 00:03:17,469
- Of course.
- Thank you.

57
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,510
Since you came to my house,
I'll prepare something for you.

58
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,210
Honey.

59
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,640
Really?

60
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,849
(Is it really her?)

61
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:29,409
Wait. She's not here.

62
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,879
She left early.

63
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,020
- She went back home.
- Back to her family, I see.

64
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:35,249
I'm so thankful.

65
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,260
What are we going to do today?

66
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,029
Until the next day,
we did everything according to my plan.

67
00:03:40,029 --> 00:03:41,390
- In Si Eon's style?
- Yes.

68
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:43,300
Should we go to the supermarket?

69
00:03:43,659 --> 00:03:45,629
- To buy some things.
- Sure.

70
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:48,069
We only had to go to the bike shop
by 5 p.m.

71
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:50,740
So we had time to enjoy Cusco.

72
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,469
You can see the city by walking around.

73
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:56,110
Let's just try going, Kian84.

74
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,240
(Gosh.)

75
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,779
Going down the stairs makes me dizzy.

76
00:04:00,809 --> 00:04:01,809
(Goodness.)

77
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:03,379
(Goodness.)

78
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,020
(Goodness.)

79
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,020
Oh, my head hurts.

80
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,119
Your physical condition is so important
while traveling.

81
00:04:08,119 --> 00:04:09,490
Gosh. I'm so dizzy.

82
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:12,319
Everyone.

83
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,430
Si Eon. Is your head okay?

84
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:17,059
Oh, my. He's having a hard time.

85
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:18,529
I'm dizzy. However,

86
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,999
if I keep walking more
at a time like this,

87
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:22,800
I'll feel worse, right?

88
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,900
What are you saying?

89
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,999
Cusco.

90
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,069
- Start.
- Start.

91
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:28,210
Cusco, start.

92
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:31,740
Oh, my. That's amazing.

93
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,010
The temperature difference
between day and night is very big.

94
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,749
The sidewalk is quite small.

95
00:04:38,749 --> 00:04:40,789
(Kian84 is closely observing the city.)

96
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,589
Hey.

97
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:44,460
"Exchange."

98
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:46,020
They, this is...

99
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,230
(Suddenly walking over)

100
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:51,300
This must be
Peruvian traditional clothing.

101
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,499
It must be.

102
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,869
Please look at the huayruro seeds.
They're very pretty.

103
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,400
(Huayruro seeds,
They are believed to bring luck in Peru.)

104
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,569
(They are made and worn as accessories.)

105
00:04:58,569 --> 00:04:59,599
(Bracelets)

106
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:00,670
This?

107
00:05:00,969 --> 00:05:02,439
Since she's here...

108
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:03,779
How much? This?

109
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,580
How much?

110
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:09,309
- How much?
- Fifteen soles.

111
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,950
- Fifteen?
- Oh, she said fifteen.

112
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,520
Ten.

113
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,189
Ten.

114
00:05:14,849 --> 00:05:16,960
- Ten soles?
- Fifteen soles.

115
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,920
- Fifteen?
- Fifteen.

116
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,760
The grandma couldn't speak English.

117
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,630
(Scrunched up)

118
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,770
Hey. That's 100 soles.

119
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:28,799
Right. Could I get change?

120
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,270
- She doesn't have change.
- Right.

121
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,839
Grandma. Please write the numbers.

122
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:34,510
(Cell phone calculator)

123
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,940
This one.

124
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,940
Total.

125
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:41,679
It's ten soles for one, 15 soles for two.

126
00:05:41,679 --> 00:05:42,880
Right. So, how much?

127
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:45,820
(Looking off into the distance)

128
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,250
(The never-ending 15 circle)

129
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,589
Fifteen?

130
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:49,589
You?

131
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:50,589
(They're about to die of frustration
from trying to buy one thing.)

132
00:05:50,589 --> 00:05:53,190
Five? Oh, five.

133
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,890
I think she's saying 50.

134
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,659
If it's 50 soles,

135
00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:00,799
it's about 15 dollars.

136
00:06:01,929 --> 00:06:03,570
Oh, okay. This.

137
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,440
Then she'll give us 50 soles in change.

138
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,570
Right.

139
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,609
(Change)

140
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,679
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

141
00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:14,510
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

142
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,080
Is it right?

143
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,549
(More change)

144
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:19,779
Why?

145
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:21,950
No. Let's just give it back to her.

146
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,520
Sounds good. Let's do that.

147
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,859
- No.
- No. Okay?

148
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:26,260
- Thank you.
- Yes. Thank you.

149
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,789
Thank you.

150
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:28,989
Thank you.

151
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:31,359
- It was still like ten dollars.
- Right.

152
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:32,359
(He doesn't know.)

153
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:34,570
Since I gave her coins,
she gave me more change.

154
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,570
She's so nice.

155
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,969
That's what you're wearing now, right?

156
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,770
- Yes. This is it.
- I see.

157
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:40,739
- It feels like Peru.
- Fifteen soles.

158
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,339
Wait. Let's learn one thing.

159
00:06:43,339 --> 00:06:45,380
- What?
- How to say "Excuse me" in Spanish.

160
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:47,510
I know it.

161
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,810
(They truly felt
the important of communication.)

162
00:06:49,549 --> 00:06:51,020
"Excuse me" is "Perdon."

163
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,489
It says it's "Disculpe."

164
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,589
It says "Perdon" for me.

165
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,260
"Disculpe." Excuse me.

166
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:00,729
Zero. One. Two.

167
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:02,630
Three. Four. Five.

168
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,700
(The 457-month-old learning numbers)

169
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,070
This is the most important one.
"How much is it?"

170
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,229
Right. "How much is it?"

171
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:10,969
Let's keep going.

172
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:12,640
(They learn the important phrases
last minute.)

173
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,210
That church is very impressive.

174
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,979
(The two spot a church.)

175
00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:20,409
We should do some research.

176
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:22,510
What is this? We should look into it.

177
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,049
We should see what church this is.

178
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,320
(Looking in awe)

179
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,919
It looks like a church from an RPG.

180
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,120
(Ta-da)

181
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,260
Gosh. Look at the back.

182
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,859
(Plaza de Armas in the center of Cusco)

183
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:38,799
(And next to it, Cusco Cathedral)

184
00:07:38,799 --> 00:07:40,299
I really want to go there.

185
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:44,669
(It took 100 years to complete.)

186
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:46,599
(The most beautiful church in Peru)

187
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,440
It really looks like Europe.

188
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,739
(The starting point of the Cusco trip)

189
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:55,409
I wonder what it'd feel like
to see it in person.

190
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,750
- Kian84. Let's take a picture.
- Okay.

191
00:07:58,419 --> 00:07:59,750
(They don't know what church it is,
but they take a picture first.)

192
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,250
This. Get this in the back.

193
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,320
- Pictures last forever.
- Right. You should take pictures.

194
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,830
Si Eon. Let's take a film photo.
I'll take one for you.

195
00:08:08,929 --> 00:08:11,659
Get the church and the mountain
in the back.

196
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:13,630
Could you go back a little bit more?

197
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:16,000
- Oh, how cute.
- Oh, my.

198
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,070
- It's a llama.
- How cute.

199
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:21,270
(Oh, my goodness)

200
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,270
- You should take one together.
- The alpaca is so cute.

201
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,609
Oh, my. It's so cute.

202
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,640
Oh, my goodness.

203
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:28,880
Baby alpaca.

204
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,820
- Let's take a picture.
- I think we'll have to pay...

205
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,080
if we take a picture with the alpaca.

206
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,789
- Wait.
- No, it's okay.

207
00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:36,120
- You're welcome.
- Sorry.

208
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,620
One picture. How much?

209
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,330
Don't do it. Just take this first.

210
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,089
- But the alpaca...
- First...

211
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,260
- The alpaca?
- It's working hard. Let's take one.

212
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:46,900
We can't think like that.
Then we'll have to help everyone.

213
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,000
One.

214
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,469
How much? Picture.

215
00:08:50,469 --> 00:08:52,140
It's up to you.

216
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:54,640
- How much?
- It's up to you.

217
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,469
You can choose.

218
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,640
I didn't understand that.

219
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,650
How much is it?

220
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,849
It's up to you.

221
00:09:01,849 --> 00:09:03,210
- What?
- It's up to you.

222
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,750
- What?
- It's up to you.

223
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,950
It's up to you.

224
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,549
I don't know what she's saying.

225
00:09:07,549 --> 00:09:09,489
Let's forget it.
Let's first take a picture.

226
00:09:09,489 --> 00:09:11,219
- Okay.
- Okay. Sorry.

227
00:09:11,589 --> 00:09:13,690
(They leave the alpaca behind.)

228
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,390
Kian84. Go over there.
I'll take one for you.

229
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,429
Me?

230
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:19,760
Can I take one with the alpaca?

231
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,429
I want to take one with the alpaca.

232
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:24,739
They said it was expensive.

233
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:26,200
(Si Eon talks Kian84 out of it
in case they get charged too much.)

234
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,039
It's expensive? Okay.

235
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,370
(Feeling sad)

236
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,810
(Kian84 listens to Si Eon well.)

237
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:38,250
(Disappointed)

238
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:40,720
(He longs for the alpaca
as if it's his first love.)

239
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,319
The alpaca is so cute, though.

240
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,289
(Staring)

241
00:09:46,659 --> 00:09:47,860
Alpaca...

242
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,659
Wait. A picture with the alpaca.

243
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,569
He can't take his eyes off them.

244
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:56,929
(The pitiful ex-boyfriend of the alpaca)

245
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,270
You should've just let him take one.
He really wanted to.

246
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,640
I know you're a nice person...

247
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,510
I do want to take one
with the mountain behind me.

248
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,240
But you do need to know how to be cold.

249
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,480
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's go for now.

250
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:10,779
(They walk over to the Cusco market.)

251
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,090
Thankfully, they don't seem to sell
things like alligator meat here.

252
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,659
Oh, my. Look at this.

253
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,789
It's a chessboard.

254
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:20,120
(Chessboard, Cusco version)

255
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,689
- Gosh.
- It must be the Cusco version of chess.

256
00:10:22,689 --> 00:10:23,900
- Right.
- I really want to buy one.

257
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:26,329
Gosh. Isn't this one cool?

258
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:27,569
Yes. It's cool.

259
00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:28,829
(He doesn't care about anything
other than the alpacas.)

260
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,000
- Chess?
- Chess.

261
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,600
- Oh, it's chess.
- Yes. This is a chessboard.

262
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,110
Oh, it's the same. There's a horse there.

263
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,209
Right. Inca.

264
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,980
They changed it
into the indigenous people and Spain.

265
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:40,579
I want to buy that.

266
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:43,949
I guess the Incas fought on alpacas.

267
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,880
These are horses.

268
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,520
How much?

269
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,919
(How much? Please type here.)

270
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:51,959
Thirty-five?

271
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,689
Thirty-five?

272
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:55,760
This is cheap. Thirty-five is cheap.

273
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:57,100
I'm going to buy this.

274
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,760
This is 35?

275
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,829
(He's completely changed his stance
from earlier.)

276
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:02,569
- Same?
- Yes.

277
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,500
This one. I'll pay.

278
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,699
(He buys it right away
after hearing the exact price.)

279
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,240
- Do you like it?
- It's so pretty.

280
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,169
I've always wanted a chessboard.

281
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,539
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

282
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:14,709
It's so cheap for something handmade.

283
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,779
(Chessboard, Cusco version, 35 soles,
Approximately 12 dollars)

284
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,850
Hello.

285
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,919
(His mood has lifted.)

286
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:20,049
I was so happy.

287
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:21,990
Where are we going, by the way?

288
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,520
Let's just go...

289
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:25,890
where our feet take us.

290
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,959
(They restart their Cusco city tour.)

291
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,659
Oh, Tuscani is here.

292
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:31,260
It was my old car.

293
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:33,000
- Seriously. His old car.
- Oh, really?

294
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,400
- Tuscani.
- How nice to see it.

295
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,569
Yes. That car.

296
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,199
- Gosh. In Peru.
- They're really going fast.

297
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,939
I guess the cars
that went out of commission in Korea...

298
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:43,909
were roaming around Peru.

299
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:47,150
They were living their second lives
in Peru.

300
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,610
- They're living well.
- Seriously.

301
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:51,620
We just have to go get the bikes...

302
00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:53,419
by 5 p.m.

303
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:55,419
I wrote down the address.

304
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:56,919
The place where we rent the bikes?

305
00:11:56,919 --> 00:11:58,090
- Just have to get there by 5 p.m.
- Let's head that way.

306
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,720
Honestly, I had a plan,

307
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,659
but it wasn't any grand plan.

308
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,490
I was just going
to look around the neighborhood.

309
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:05,559
- This is part of traveling, right?
- Right.

310
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,600
- Right.
- Of course.

311
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:08,299
Pull to the side.

312
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:10,770
We have to make a cross.

313
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,069
Okay.

314
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,240
Si Eon. Let's have fruit juice too.

315
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:16,510
Do you want some?

316
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:18,939
Have a taste.

317
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,850
(Oh, my)

318
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,980
(Sipping)

319
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,189
(Handsome guy)

320
00:12:28,189 --> 00:12:29,250
Oh, it's sour.

321
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,590
- Is it fake leather?
- No. Real.

322
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,590
Real alpaca?

323
00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:36,559
Moo.

324
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,159
There are some alpacas again.

325
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,730
We came to a place with a lot of art.

326
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:45,069
This place seems to be famous for alpacas.

327
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:46,600
- Touch?
- Alpaca.

328
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:48,010
It's made of stone.

329
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,709
(He finally bought an alpaca keyring.)

330
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,279
(He's planning to keep it on...)

331
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,110
(like a part of his body...)

332
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,880
(until the end of the journey
through the mountains and rivers.)

333
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,850
(The alpaca keyring guy)

334
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,590
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- You were so cold.

335
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:08,490
Let's go to Daegwallyeong Pass
and take a picture with some sheep.

336
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:13,260
(They continue their Cusco city tour
with no breaks.)

337
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,900
(Walking around 3,399m above sea level)

338
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:19,000
Gosh. My head hurts.

339
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:21,409
My head hurts.

340
00:13:21,409 --> 00:13:23,340
Gosh. My head hurts so much. What is this?

341
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,809
Gosh. Why is the pressure so strong?

342
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:26,880
(Their altitude sickness symptoms
keep getting worse.)

343
00:13:27,909 --> 00:13:29,750
Let's go under the shade.

344
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:30,750
(They end up taking a break.)

345
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,819
Gosh. I'm tired.

346
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,449
I think I've gotten a bit
used to the altitude sickness.

347
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,490
Me too.

348
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,829
(Lying down as is)

349
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,659
Gosh. The stones are warmed up. It's nice.

350
00:13:47,029 --> 00:13:48,329
(A real stone bed)

351
00:13:48,329 --> 00:13:50,230
- It's a stone bed.
- That must be nice.

352
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,140
- Si Eon.
- What?

353
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,110
- Should we play a game of chess?
- I am already.

354
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:56,939
You found something to do there.

355
00:13:56,939 --> 00:13:57,939
(There's nothing to do,
so they play a game of chess.)

356
00:13:58,409 --> 00:13:59,779
Is this the one that jumps over?

357
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,250
The horse jumps over.

358
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,250
(The two brothers
end up getting absorbed.)

359
00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:12,760
(Focused in silence)

360
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,260
(Cusco, the heart of the Inca Empire)

361
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,829
- Gosh. Alpacas.
- These aren't llamas.

362
00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:20,100
They're alpacas.

363
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,699
Gosh. What is that?

364
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,500
(This place is full of famous spots
like Machu Picchu.)

365
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,110
There are so many famous spots,
but they're just playing chess.

366
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:32,279
(So honest)

367
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,279
Honestly, I'm a bit tired of it.

368
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:36,209
You were trying not to be obvious, right?

369
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,880
That's why
you were avoiding the famous spots?

370
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,819
Machu Picchu is like...

371
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:41,890
It's like going to the restaurant
right next to the most famous one.

372
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,620
No. I'm not going to go there.

373
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,990
I clearly said
that I came to ride a motorcycle.

374
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,120
- True.
- Yes, you did.

375
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,029
We really didn't do anything...

376
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:50,289
until riding the motorcycles.

377
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,329
(Boring)

378
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,770
Let's forget it.

379
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:59,100
Should we end the game? Okay.

380
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:01,669
Let's wrap up and think about what to do.

381
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:04,539
(All of a sudden?)

382
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:07,980
(They only planned
to slowly tour the city of Cusco...)

383
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:12,520
(until the bike shop opens at 5 p.m.)

384
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,650
(They just sit still with nothing to do.)

385
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,590
(There's nothing to do...)

386
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:25,900
(and nothing to say.)

387
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,400
(Sighing)

388
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:33,240
(Staring)

389
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:38,939
Si Eon.

390
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,409
I don't think you have a plan.

391
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:44,949
No. We're feeling the city of Cusco.

392
00:15:45,579 --> 00:15:47,990
Look, Si Eon. We went to the church,

393
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,720
then to the market. There's nothing here.

394
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,689
We just have to keep walking here.

395
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,860
Let's decide first before going somewhere.

396
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:03,329
(Their words slightly show
their irritated moods.)

397
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:05,569
I like being spontaneous,

398
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,870
but our styles are a bit different.

399
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,010
When I'm traveling, I focus on healing.

400
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:16,880
(Even in the first city, Iquitos,)

401
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,120
(If Si Eon thought
it was worth remembering...)

402
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,990
(Taking a picture)

403
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:25,620
(He recorded his memories
that he could look back on...)

404
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:32,459
(by taking a picture wherever he went.)

405
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,270
(The healing-style traveler, Si Eon)

406
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,510
(They traveled in Si Eon's style
in Cusco as well.)

407
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,439
(However, with Kian84...)

408
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,949
(Should we buy 1kg of alligator
and try eating it?)

409
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:52,049
(He eats,)

410
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:55,120
(smells,)

411
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,890
(and touches.)

412
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:02,090
(Action is always first with him.)

413
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,500
(Kian84 is an action-first guy...)

414
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,329
(who enjoys each moment of travel
with his whole body.)

415
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,569
Honestly, it wasn't that fun.

416
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:13,000
(The healing-style of traveling
wasn't fun for the action-first traveler.)

417
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,770
Let's look over there.

418
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,539
I feel like we just went there to look.

419
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:20,409
Also, if I try to do as I want,

420
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:22,049
he'll say, "Why would you do that?"

421
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,750
"Si Eon. Let's pray in the church."

422
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,750
"Why? I'm religious."

423
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,390
(Even when he wanted
to take a picture with the alpaca...)

424
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,150
(Don't do it. Just take this first.)

425
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:31,990
(Can I take one with the alpaca?)

426
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,490
(Shaking his head)

427
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:37,329
(Why do I keep wanting
to go into the church?)

428
00:17:37,329 --> 00:17:39,159
(But you're Buddhist.)

429
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:41,900
(Their start to have
differences in opinion...)

430
00:17:42,699 --> 00:17:44,770
(and begin clashing.)

431
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,939
I knew we wouldn't get along.

432
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:50,610
I did as much as I could...

433
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,209
Nothing. I want to use pretty words.

434
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,250
I won't swear.

435
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,179
(Laughing)

436
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,850
It's hard to travel with someone
who has a different style from you.

437
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:03,289
Even people who are really close
end up fighting.

438
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,890
Right. Something very small
could make them fight.

439
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,730
I splurged and went
to a very nice hot spring...

440
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,560
with my mother and father.

441
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,070
- You know how you get a course meal?
- Yes.

442
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:17,499
After they finished eating,
they said they enjoyed it.

443
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:20,969
I thought they were sleeping,
but they were eating Korean cup noodles...

444
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:23,909
as if they'd been starving for a week.

445
00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:25,909
Gosh.

446
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:27,580
I felt so bad.

447
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:31,550
(The two haven't made any progress.)

448
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,590
- Should we get a cup of coffee first?
- Coffee?

449
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,120
Let's go into a pretty place
and have a cup of coffee.

450
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
Okay.

451
00:18:40,489 --> 00:18:41,659
Did we come from over there?

452
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,130
Right. We came from over there.

453
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,199
Let's go.

454
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:47,830
(After walking for a while,
they arrive at a cafe.)

455
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,530
- Iced Americano?
- Yes.

456
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,439
- Hi. Do you speak Spanish?
- Thank you.

457
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,370
Would you like to pay inside?

458
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,269
- Yes. Do you want to pay here?
- Get out?

459
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,509
- Get out.
- Get out.

460
00:18:58,509 --> 00:18:59,939
- Go away.
- Go away.

461
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,209
I'm sure she understood what I meant.

462
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:06,249
- Get out?
- No, it's okay. Thank you.

463
00:19:08,449 --> 00:19:11,719
(They hurriedly recharge with caffeine.)

464
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:15,360
Si Eon. There's something inside.

465
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:18,100
(A coffee bean inside)

466
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,330
- It was a little bit like...
- Did they not grind it enough?

467
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:23,199
they did it on purpose. Like sikhye.

468
00:19:23,199 --> 00:19:25,439
Is it to prevent stomachaches
from drinking too much?

469
00:19:25,439 --> 00:19:27,499
- Like putting a leaf on top.
- Like putting a leaf on top?

470
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,540
(A whole coffee bean instead
of a willow leaf to prevent stomachaches)

471
00:19:29,739 --> 00:19:30,769
Is it a coffee bean?

472
00:19:33,939 --> 00:19:36,179
Gosh. They put a whole coffee bean inside.

473
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,080
That's kind of cool,
putting a whole coffee bean inside.

474
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:44,320
It's a bit awkward between them.

475
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,519
- It's silent again.
- Because they fought once.

476
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,489
He's suddenly excited.

477
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:50,590
A song played.

478
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,530
(They have nothing to do again.)

479
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:57,669
It was better to just stay in the Amazon.

480
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:01,310
I'm going to the bathroom.

481
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:02,969
You want to poop? Come back quickly.

482
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,780
(Si Eon leaves his seat
after getting permission.)

483
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,320
(Kian84 is left alone.)

484
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,249
Where did it come from?

485
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,290
It looks peaceful.

486
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,189
(It comes back to keep him company.)

487
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:25,800
It's here to keep him company.

488
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,530
(Tapping)

489
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:34,269
(Even the dog leaves.)

490
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,739
(Taking out)

491
00:20:38,409 --> 00:20:40,479
(Rubbing)

492
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,909
- Are you washing your hands?
- Yes.

493
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,280
(He wipes his hands with ice
instead of wet wipes.)

494
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,820
The dog didn't shower.

495
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,219
I see.

496
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,989
(Simply wiping his hands)

497
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:58,659
(A man in the middle of Cusco
who has nowhere to go)

498
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:03,699
Guys, we got back our energy
and are heading to...

499
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,199
- Limbus Bar.
- Limbus Bar.

500
00:21:06,939 --> 00:21:08,110
Cusco's...

501
00:21:08,969 --> 00:21:10,110
- Most popular place.
- most popular place.

502
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,810
That's good. Yes.

503
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,880
I asked the owner of the lodging
because I was so frustrated.

504
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,380
He recommended this place to us.

505
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,850
At least you have a destination set now.

506
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,479
I'm already tired.

507
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:23,850
Altitude sickness is...

508
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,159
- Hey.
- Yes?

509
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:28,530
I suddenly feel dizzy.

510
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,060
Walk slowly. It's okay.

511
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,130
Did you not have altitude sickness
in Busan?

512
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,199
(Did you not have altitude sickness
in Busan?)

513
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:34,929
It's only 300m above sea level.

514
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:36,030
Three hundred meters.

515
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:40,400
It should be about 3,400 to 3,500m here.

516
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:44,380
(They arrive at a slope.)

517
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,540
From what I've eaten in Peru, KFC...

518
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:48,249
I'm so tired.

519
00:21:48,249 --> 00:21:49,709
Look at how steep it is.

520
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,780
(I can't go.)

521
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,350
Your stamina became poorer,
altitude sickness aside.

522
00:21:55,489 --> 00:21:57,390
Altitude sickness is not related
to stamina.

523
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,219
You weren't this bad before.

524
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:00,560
Before, I would've run.

525
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,459
But I don't think I can run
with altitude sickness.

526
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:05,400
I had a lot of worries
even before I went there.

527
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,729
- Why?
- The place was even higher.

528
00:22:06,729 --> 00:22:08,300
That's right.

529
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,699
All popular places are on higher grounds.

530
00:22:11,699 --> 00:22:14,199
- There's none on lower grounds.
- Popular places.

531
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:17,340
(A difficult walk to the popular place)

532
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,780
It must've been really hard.

533
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:20,979
(Groaning)

534
00:22:20,979 --> 00:22:23,880
Peruvian Generation MZ has...

535
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,019
such good stamina?

536
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:30,590
I can see an alpaca over there.

537
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,290
Hello.

538
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,890
How cute.

539
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:36,630
He must've wanted to take pictures
with it badly.

540
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,360
- That's right.
- I'm sorry.

541
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:44,570
(Panting)

542
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,800
It was so hard.

543
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,540
Si Eon, it looks like...

544
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,409
a spot for a magazine photo shoot.

545
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:51,479
We...

546
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:54,610
We're about to faint
from altitude sickness,

547
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,679
- but let's take a picture.
- He's taking it.

548
00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:58,050
Stand here.

549
00:22:58,419 --> 00:22:59,820
- I'll...
- Take me.

550
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:00,880
- take your picture.
- Okay.

551
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,090
He looks very sick.

552
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,120
Take one before I pass out. Stop there!

553
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,259
- I...
- Stop.

554
00:23:05,259 --> 00:23:07,290
Take one with my pet camera.

555
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:11,330
He still takes pictures of him with love.

556
00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:13,659
How stunning.

557
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,400
Altitude sickness struck you too hard.

558
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:18,370
I lost my mind a bit here.

559
00:23:19,169 --> 00:23:20,370
Gosh.

560
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,810
- It looks nice.
- That's a nice picture.

561
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:24,509
- This looks really good. An A cut.
- This is nice.

562
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,209
Okay, cut.

563
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,550
Shall we try something outside the box?

564
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,610
Okay.

565
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,280
Dart your tongue in and out.

566
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,380
More! Stick it out!

567
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,150
(Sticking his tongue out)

568
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,590
The title is "Altitude Sickness."

569
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:40,590
You expressed altitude sickness.

570
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,060
(The view is amazing.)

571
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,259
It's so nice.

572
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,199
How cute.

573
00:23:47,699 --> 00:23:50,070
I didn't know you liked alpacas so much.

574
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:52,669
- Where...
- It's quite near.

575
00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:53,669
(Cusco Main Square to Limbus Bar)

576
00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:56,239
It's quite near. Just a bit more.

577
00:23:57,239 --> 00:23:58,939
My ears feel muffled.

578
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,580
Goodness.

579
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:03,650
(In her embrace)

580
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,280
- What's that?
- A baby alpaca.

581
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,449
Gosh, it's so cute.

582
00:24:07,449 --> 00:24:08,590
(Laughing)

583
00:24:09,719 --> 00:24:11,620
That alpaca is so cute.

584
00:24:12,219 --> 00:24:14,060
You liked alpacas so much, Kian84.

585
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,060
Yes.

586
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,489
I couldn't take my eyes off of alpacas
whenever I saw one.

587
00:24:18,759 --> 00:24:20,499
(Eyes on alpacas)

588
00:24:20,499 --> 00:24:23,330
Alpacas here are like dogs.

589
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,800
(Alpacas here are like dogs.)

590
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:27,699
(Far away)

591
00:24:27,969 --> 00:24:29,340
- Kian84.
- Yes.

592
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,209
It said it was a ten-minute walk.

593
00:24:33,209 --> 00:24:34,239
We're almost there.

594
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,709
Right,
the map said it was a ten-minute walk.

595
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,580
- We walked for about 30 minutes.
- Yes, we walked for about 30 minutes.

596
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,479
We're here.

597
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:42,590
- Are we here?
- We just need to make a turn here.

598
00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:44,189
We're here.

599
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,919
- Here?
- This way.

600
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,830
(Panting)

601
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,659
You look really bad.

602
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:53,429
(Turn around the corner,)

603
00:24:53,429 --> 00:24:55,769
(and it's another alley.)

604
00:24:55,769 --> 00:24:58,239
That time... I have pretty good stamina,

605
00:24:58,239 --> 00:24:59,439
- but that time...
- You had it really bad.

606
00:24:59,439 --> 00:25:01,340
Altitude sickness was really bad.

607
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,669
I think this is it.

608
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:06,409
- Limbus. It's here.
- Limbus.

609
00:25:06,409 --> 00:25:07,439
Finally.

610
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:10,310
- This is...
- The popular place.

611
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,380
Goodness.

612
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,080
(The city is down there.)

613
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,790
My gosh.

614
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:17,449
(Heave-ho)

615
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:19,820
- He's so strong.
- Nice guy.

616
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,159
I got so shocked when I saw him.

617
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,360
- Shall we go in?
- Let's go.

618
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,429
- Okay.
- Let's go.

619
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
I think I overcame altitude sickness.

620
00:25:31,439 --> 00:25:35,269
Hello. Did you make a reservation?

621
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,610
- First.
- Four?

622
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:41,080
Two people.

623
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,810
- Two people?
- Yes.

624
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:46,219
(After wandering around for a long time,
they enter the popular place.)

625
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,719
Nice view. Gosh!

626
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,890
What is it?

627
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,989
(Surprised)

628
00:26:09,189 --> 00:26:10,429
(Outdoor terrace with a cool view)

629
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:11,530
It's so nice.

630
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,830
It's outdoors.

631
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,130
Everyone.

632
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,499
It's nice.

633
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,570
Si Eon, let's take pictures.

634
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,040
It's so nice there.

635
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,110
It's worth going there.

636
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,040
It was a great choice to go there, right?

637
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:28,780
This is amazing.

638
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,179
(The view of the city in the high mountain
in the daytime)

639
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:32,749
It would be cooler at night.

640
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:34,580
(It has a fantastic night view.)

641
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,650
It's so cool.

642
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:37,890
This place has a great night view.

643
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:43,489
This is Cusco's most popular place.

644
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:46,189
Peruvian Generation MZ comes here.

645
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:49,429
You can look down on the downtown
of Cusco at once.

646
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,900
It's so nice.

647
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,300
It'll be good for hip-hoppers to go.

648
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,499
- That's right.
- Since they're open-minded.

649
00:26:54,499 --> 00:26:57,239
Every hip-hop man
in Cusco probably hangs around there.

650
00:26:57,239 --> 00:26:58,909
"Hip-hop man in Cusco."

651
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,140
(Pretty hip choice of words)

652
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,939
- Hip-hop man in Cusco.
- It sounds...

653
00:27:01,939 --> 00:27:04,080
- so uncool.
- It's so old-fashioned.

654
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,949
- I'm so embarrassed.
- "Hip-hop man."

655
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,479
- Boss.
- "Boss."

656
00:27:08,979 --> 00:27:11,590
- Over here.
- He's a bit hyped up.

657
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,060
I'll choose first.

658
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,159
(They order food first.)

659
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:17,890
(It's all in Spanish.)

660
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:20,330
Sir! Excuse me.

661
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,570
Beef steak?

662
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,929
Yes. Would you like to order?

663
00:27:24,929 --> 00:27:26,469
- Beef?
- Yes, beef.

664
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:27,600
(Moo)

665
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,739
Yes.

666
00:27:28,739 --> 00:27:30,469
That's such a primitive way.

667
00:27:30,469 --> 00:27:32,209
(Primitive way of ordering)

668
00:27:32,209 --> 00:27:33,280
- That's all.
- Okay.

669
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,610
(Moo steak costs 48 soles,
which is about 16 dollars.)

670
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,409
And whiskey?

671
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,280
Yes, we have local whiskey.

672
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,050
- How...
- He has local whiskey.

673
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:42,719
- Local whiskey?
- Yes.

674
00:27:42,719 --> 00:27:44,120
Two shots.

675
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,590
(They misunderstand him
and order happily.)

676
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:47,519
One shot, one shot.

677
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:49,219
Ice.

678
00:27:49,219 --> 00:27:50,929
Drinking alcohol...

679
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:52,890
while looking at that view is fantastic.

680
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,830
It's quite similar all around the world.

681
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:58,330
When you go to Mount Nam...

682
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:01,169
I've left a couple of padlocks
on Mount Nam too.

683
00:28:01,739 --> 00:28:02,840
But guys,

684
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:07,479
putting up padlocks doesn't mean
you won't break up.

685
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:09,179
Si Eon.

686
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,550
Shall we put one up too?

687
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:15,719
You know this, right?
It proves love and friendship.

688
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:16,719
Okay.

689
00:28:17,249 --> 00:28:18,350
I got it.

690
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:22,390
I didn't climb that many stairs,
so why am I out of breath?

691
00:28:24,189 --> 00:28:26,030
Kian84 and Si Eon forever.

692
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,759
I'll write your name. You write mine.

693
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:30,300
Let's write, "Don't betray each other."

694
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,830
In Korean?

695
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:33,999
(Instead of promising love,
they promise not to betray each other.)

696
00:28:35,199 --> 00:28:37,769
(They write each other's names carefully.)

697
00:28:38,669 --> 00:28:40,780
(Kian84, Si Eon)

698
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:41,840
(Betrayal means...)

699
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,949
- "Betrayal means death."
- "Betrayal means death."

700
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:45,179
(Death)

701
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:48,780
Isn't that foreshadowing?

702
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,919
The death of your relationship.

703
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,219
(The death of their relationship
after the trip)

704
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:55,360
- Here?
- Careful. If you drop it...

705
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,229
(Kian84, Si Eon, death)

706
00:28:58,229 --> 00:29:00,459
If I ever go to Cusco,
I must take a picture of that.

707
00:29:00,699 --> 00:29:02,060
- Local whiskey.
- Yes.

708
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,199
Local whiskey.

709
00:29:04,199 --> 00:29:05,870
(They have a glass
of what they think is local whiskey.)

710
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,469
Kian84, isn't it nice to come
on an overseas trip together?

711
00:29:09,469 --> 00:29:10,540
It's nice.

712
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,939
(They forgot about fighting
and getting upset.)

713
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:17,880
(After hanging a lock,
they are friendly again.)

714
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,009
It's the best.

715
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:21,449
(Laughing)

716
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:24,019
Gosh, it's nice.

717
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,919
(Beef steak they ordered is here.)

718
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,830
Gosh, it looks amazing.

719
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,189
Oil is dripping.

720
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:33,499
It's amazing.

721
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,800
This is yuca.

722
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:37,870
- Yuca?
- Yes.

723
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,969
(The yellow deep-fried food
that came out together)

724
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,100
It's what we pulled out from the ground.

725
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,239
It's that.

726
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:45,739
It's this.

727
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,509
Masato.

728
00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:48,580
Masato.

729
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:52,810
It's like potatoes there.

730
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:55,179
Exactly. It feels so different.

731
00:29:56,449 --> 00:29:58,050
We get to eat yuca.

732
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,860
They wouldn't have chewed this, right?

733
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,429
The auntie needs to rest too.

734
00:30:04,959 --> 00:30:06,360
Cheers.

735
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:09,030
(He takes a bite of the steak first.)

736
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,199
- Is it good?
- Yes. It's really good.

737
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:12,330
It looks good.

738
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:15,269
(They enjoy the beauty of a free trip
in the restaurant they came on a whim.)

739
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:17,640
Over there, no matter what you eat,
it would taste good.

740
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:21,840
(Humming)

741
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,949
Why? It's not to his liking?

742
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:31,749
It has unique spices, right?

743
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:32,949
Yes.

744
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,489
It smells like armpit.

745
00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:37,929
Is it the pungent taste?

746
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,689
What do you mean armpit?

747
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,759
It's a luxurious dish.

748
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:43,130
Apologize.

749
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,429
I'm sorry.

750
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:47,100
That snack was good.

751
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,800
(He nitpicks, but he eats well.)

752
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,070
I don't really like steaks,

753
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,280
but I like this.

754
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,909
It's slightly spicy and nice.

755
00:30:58,449 --> 00:31:00,120
- Si Eon, we...
- Take a nap on the floor.

756
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,219
We ride motorcycles, and...

757
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,719
But look.
I'm going to ride a motorcycle tomorrow,

758
00:31:04,719 --> 00:31:06,919
but if you have a place you want
to visit...

759
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:09,060
or take a rest in between,
tell me anytime.

760
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:11,290
Si Eon, the sleeping bag you prepared.

761
00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:14,759
Is it for trekking?

762
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:15,860
No.

763
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,469
When you travel, it's cold.

764
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,169
Shall we try that?

765
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:23,810
- Tomorrow, on our way,
- Do whatever you want.

766
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:26,239
- let's make a bonfire...
- Okay.

767
00:31:26,239 --> 00:31:27,479
and sleep.

768
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:30,580
(That's a bit...)

769
00:31:30,949 --> 00:31:32,209
For real.

770
00:31:32,909 --> 00:31:34,979
Then the place to sleep...

771
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:36,550
So you want to sleep outdoors, right?

772
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,419
We can tell the staff to go sleep indoors.

773
00:31:38,419 --> 00:31:40,360
So you want to sleep in a tent, right?

774
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,189
- It can be a tent or...
- But we don't have a tent.

775
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:47,300
People just sleep around a fire.

776
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:50,530
You can't sleep like that, Kian84.

777
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,630
Is that so?

778
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,439
- You can't sleep like that even in Korea.
- Okay.

779
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,739
He has his dream,
but it's hard to achieve in real life.

780
00:31:56,739 --> 00:31:58,110
(Their opinions don't match at all.)

781
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,140
It's not about our opinions matching.
He's saying something impossible!

782
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,540
Does this make sense?

783
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,949
We can start a fire and sleep.

784
00:32:03,949 --> 00:32:05,479
- On the beach!
- He didn't know.

785
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:08,550
It's like walking on the beach
and him saying, "I want to catch a whale."

786
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,290
- Kian84.
- We can start a fire and sleep!

787
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,290
You guys didn't fight then,
so why are you fighting now?

788
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:15,120
You can catch a whale.

789
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,659
But we don't have the equipment.

790
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:19,290
That's right. I understood right away.

791
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,159
(The mood gets down in the silence)

792
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,370
(Shaking his head)

793
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:25,900
- Shaking his head.
- He said...

794
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:28,100
he prepared it,

795
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,800
so I decided to follow him.

796
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:32,269
But from what I can see,
he doesn't have much of a plan either.

797
00:32:32,269 --> 00:32:34,340
Thinking about it makes me pissed again.

798
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,949
What frustrates me the most is...

799
00:32:36,949 --> 00:32:39,150
why he insists on doing something...

800
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,719
that's impossible and we won't do.

801
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:42,919
Why sleep on the mountainside?

802
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:44,790
When he knows that we can't sleep there?

803
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:46,890
Okay.

804
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,390
But let's start a bonfire on our way.

805
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,530
Starting a fire is easy.

806
00:32:53,999 --> 00:32:55,229
Let's see how it goes,

807
00:32:55,229 --> 00:32:57,330
and you can try sleeping
in a sleeping bag.

808
00:32:57,669 --> 00:33:01,400
I think I said stuff like that
because I wanted to just try it myself.

809
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:05,969
(They were happy and friendly just now.)

810
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,509
(Now, they're silent
as if they're frozen.)

811
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:13,719
(The mood changes so quickly
that you cannot expect it.)

812
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,390
Remember I told you
about the 12-angled stone?

813
00:33:20,489 --> 00:33:21,919
- What?
- The 12-angled stone.

814
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:22,959
I talked about it since yesterday.

815
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,459
- The 12-angled horn?
- Yes.

816
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,999
The stone has 12 angles.

817
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:28,729
What's 12-angled horn?

818
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:30,570
Isn't this the road we walked past?

819
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,699
What are you saying?

820
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:35,199
Anyway, there was something I wanted
to see, and we passed by that.

821
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:36,340
Amazing.

822
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,540
I thought we had a smooth communication.

823
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:40,780
What's that over there?

824
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,550
- What is it?
- They're camping over there.

825
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:46,310
I don't know. Shall we go check it out?

826
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,820
Honestly, I was a bit frustrated then.

827
00:33:50,449 --> 00:33:51,590
I was frustrated.

828
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:54,790
We started speaking
on different wavelengths.

829
00:33:55,489 --> 00:33:57,189
He won't respond to me
and say something else instead.

830
00:33:58,189 --> 00:34:01,600
We kept talking about something else...

831
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,159
in different worlds.

832
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:07,769
Kian84 and I have been friends
for about ten years.

833
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:12,209
I thought that we might end up
not seeing each other anymore.

834
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:16,949
On the way down,
let's see the 12-angled brick...

835
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:20,050
that we saw just now. We passed by
when it was right beside me.

836
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,120
Really?

837
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,550
(On the way to the restaurant,)

838
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:26,519
(the Inca costume that caught their eyes)

839
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:28,620
It's cool.

840
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,560
That's the 12-angled stone.

841
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,890
(They just passed by.)

842
00:34:32,890 --> 00:34:33,999
They passed by.

843
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,929
They just piled up stones,
and it didn't collapse.

844
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,199
- It has a history.
- I'll explain when we get there.

845
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,300
Okay.

846
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,739
(They set off to find the 12-angled stone
that they missed.)

847
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:43,810
Let's go.

848
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,439
Now that I came down, my head hurts again.

849
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,749
Altitude sickness comes and goes.

850
00:34:51,709 --> 00:34:52,850
Hey.

851
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:54,979
This is the 12-angled stone.

852
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,350
- What is?
- This.

853
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:57,949
It was on the way down.

854
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,459
It has 12 angles. Look.

855
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,390
- Two, three,
- Like that?

856
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:06,530
four, five, six,

857
00:35:07,229 --> 00:35:08,400
seven...

858
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,870
(Is it a 7-angled stone?)

859
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,070
You said it had 12 angles.

860
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,739
One, two, three,

861
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,439
four, five, six, seven.

862
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:19,610
They don't have 12 angles.

863
00:35:21,009 --> 00:35:23,979
Are these only seven angles
because they're older?

864
00:35:23,979 --> 00:35:25,580
Did you guys come to an agreement
with the seven-angled stones?

865
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,919
If I'd talked about it,
it would've led to another fight.

866
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,249
- But...
- You said it was 12-angled,

867
00:35:30,249 --> 00:35:31,789
so why are there only seven angles?

868
00:35:31,789 --> 00:35:34,160
Why are there only seven?
I could have become like this.

869
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,660
I thought about it wrongly.

870
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,889
I thought all stones had 12 angles,

871
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:39,459
- but only 1 had 12 angles.
- Just 1?

872
00:35:39,459 --> 00:35:40,630
I see.

873
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:43,260
We almost had a fight over the angles.

874
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:45,900
- It didn't collapse over 2,000 years.
- Hey, look.

875
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,369
They're taking pictures. That must be it.

876
00:35:48,539 --> 00:35:50,169
(An extraordinary stone
that greets tourists)

877
00:35:50,169 --> 00:35:52,669
- Thank you. Where?
- This is it.

878
00:35:52,669 --> 00:35:54,579
This is the 12-angled stone. Look.

879
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,280
One, two, three, four, five, six,

880
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,349
seven, eight, nine, ten,

881
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:00,950
eleven, twelve.

882
00:36:01,249 --> 00:36:02,650
One, two, three, four,

883
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:04,820
- five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...
- That's the twelve-angled stone.

884
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,119
(A stone carved elaborately into 12 angles
which shows the peak of Inca stonework)

885
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,590
It's really detailed.

886
00:36:08,289 --> 00:36:10,889
(Inca Empire, Peru,)

887
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:13,189
(which had advanced skills
in elaborate stone architecture)

888
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:17,300
What's amazing is,
if this was built 2,000 years ago,

889
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,729
- Look at that guy's body.
- it was...

890
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:21,340
- before Gung Ye became the king.
- Look at that guy's body.

891
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,200
Look at his body.

892
00:36:23,809 --> 00:36:25,039
"Look at that guy's body."

893
00:36:25,269 --> 00:36:27,309
That guy is almost 12-angled now.

894
00:36:27,539 --> 00:36:29,740
"That guy is 12-angled."

895
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,050
- Look at that guy's body.
- It was...

896
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,579
His muscles are 12-angled.

897
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,380
(Cusco's 12-angled muscles)

898
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:38,519
- Can you listen when I speak?
- Okay.

899
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,260
Why do you always talk
about something else when I speak?

900
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,789
- What about Gung Ye?
- It's nothing.

901
00:36:44,789 --> 00:36:47,729
Gung Ye seized power...

902
00:36:47,729 --> 00:36:49,860
in year 1,500 of Goryeo Dynasty.

903
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,800
Since it's during Goryeo Dynasty,

904
00:36:52,329 --> 00:36:53,939
is it year 500 or 1500?

905
00:36:53,939 --> 00:36:55,269
(Goryeo Dynasty is
from years 918 to 1392.)

906
00:36:55,269 --> 00:36:56,340
My goodness.

907
00:36:58,309 --> 00:36:59,970
What he said...

908
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:02,539
- You were 600 years off.
- Nothing I said was correct.

909
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:05,610
- That's wrong information.
- They're several centuries apart.

910
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:09,550
Coming down is really fast.

911
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,820
Si Eon, let's make some small change.

912
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,619
Change money, hi.

913
00:37:14,889 --> 00:37:16,059
Change 400 dollars.

914
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:19,329
- How much? Four hundred USD.
- Four hundred.

915
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:25,999
This is the biggest tourist city in Peru,

916
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:29,070
so there are currency exchanges
throughout the city.

917
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,139
(The boss calculates
using her calculator.)

918
00:37:34,939 --> 00:37:38,610
(He doesn't know how much 400 dollars is
in soles.)

919
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,820
For 400 dollars...

920
00:37:44,419 --> 00:37:48,490
What's 140 dollars times 4?

921
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:51,829
Four times four is sixteen. Fifty-six.

922
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:54,030
Since it's 560,000 won,

923
00:37:54,829 --> 00:37:56,329
in soles...

924
00:37:57,169 --> 00:37:59,400
It's 36,000 dollars for 100 soles.

925
00:37:59,729 --> 00:38:01,599
Then how much do we need to get in soles?

926
00:38:03,809 --> 00:38:04,910
What?

927
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,979
A hundred soles is...

928
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:09,380
36,000 won.

929
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:12,680
That's not it.

930
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,919
We need to know how much ten soles are
in dollars.

931
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,450
It's 36,000 won for 100 soles.

932
00:38:19,019 --> 00:38:20,519
Isn't it 3,600 won for 10 soles?

933
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:22,689
So how much is 36,000 won in soles?

934
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,530
One hundred soles.

935
00:38:24,729 --> 00:38:26,229
- One hundred soles?
- Yes.

936
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,999
- Is that so?
- It's confusing.

937
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:29,329
What? Ten soles...

938
00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:30,700
It's 3,600 won for 10 soles?

939
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:34,769
It's 36,000 won for 10 soles.
I feel like I'd hear it again in my dream.

940
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:37,410
Hold on, 100 soles...

941
00:38:37,939 --> 00:38:39,470
It's 360,000 won for 1,000 soles.

942
00:38:40,010 --> 00:38:41,280
Then for 2,000 soles...

943
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:43,809
That's about 720,000 won.

944
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:47,479
I think we need to get about 170 soles.

945
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,180
Gosh. I meant 1,700 soles.

946
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,820
One, two, three.

947
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:53,419
She gave me 1,560 soles.

948
00:38:53,419 --> 00:38:54,820
- Then...
- That means 100 soles...

949
00:38:55,189 --> 00:38:57,030
That's 36,000 won.

950
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,689
- That's so hard.
- Yes.

951
00:38:58,689 --> 00:39:01,760
The owner must be really frustrated too.

952
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:04,729
(Our brains can't function.)

953
00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:06,400
(I can see that.)

954
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,099
They are frustrated by each other.

955
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,570
Si Eon, let me calculate this.

956
00:39:11,669 --> 00:39:12,769
Watch.

957
00:39:13,709 --> 00:39:14,740
Sorry.

958
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,740
- Sorry.
- It's okay. No problem.

959
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,880
One fifty. Sixteen hundred. Then...

960
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,720
One hundred fifty-six.

961
00:39:21,249 --> 00:39:22,479
- I think she gave us a fair price.
- Multiply that...

962
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,289
by 36,000 won.

963
00:39:24,289 --> 00:39:25,419
(That's about 560,000 won
which is equivalent to 400 dollars.)

964
00:39:25,419 --> 00:39:27,260
- She gave us a fair price.
- Right? Okay.

965
00:39:27,419 --> 00:39:29,720
(His calculation method was messy,
but he reached an answer.)

966
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:32,660
How did you figure out
1,560 soles was 400 dollars?

967
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:34,930
Here's how I calculated.

968
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:38,269
- I changed 400 dollars into Korean won.
- Yes.

969
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:42,369
Then I changed that into soles.

970
00:39:42,369 --> 00:39:43,400
- I see.
- Okay.

971
00:39:43,669 --> 00:39:46,340
If you're going to Peru, I'll tell you
how to calculate that in private.

972
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,610
(He gives up on explaining it.)

973
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:49,539
Did we calculate it correctly?

974
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:51,050
- Yes. We did.
- Really?

975
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,479
- He's so smart.
- You got better at this.

976
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:54,019
His EQ is pretty high.

977
00:39:54,019 --> 00:39:56,019
(Feeling smug)

978
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,689
Okay.

979
00:39:57,689 --> 00:39:58,889
(It's finally over.)

980
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:03,490
By the way, Kian84 is considered
smart among my friends.

981
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,760
What kind of friends
do you keep around you?

982
00:40:06,059 --> 00:40:09,499
By the way, my IQ might be low,
but my EQ is pretty high.

983
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,530
- Right.
- Her facial expression is so funny.

984
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:13,700
(Dumbfounded)

985
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:17,269
Right. You're not lacking in many ways.

986
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,610
Gosh. Great job, Kian84.

987
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,680
- Okay.
- Yes.

988
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,579
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

989
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,849
Exchanging the currency
was quite challenging.

990
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:29,450
- That wasn't easy.
- That was hard.

991
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:31,090
Let's go to the bike shop now.

992
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:35,789
By the way, I feel safe
now that we have a lot of cash.

993
00:40:37,229 --> 00:40:38,329
That's...

994
00:40:39,689 --> 00:40:40,800
Excuse me.

995
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,660
- Hello.
- Hello.

996
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,999
All right.

997
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:45,900
Motorcycle rentals.

998
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,800
- Yes.
- Two bikes.

999
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,340
- Cool. Yes. Perfect.
- Two bikes.

1000
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,439
Yes. I have everything you need.

1001
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:57,010
(There are many motorcycles...)

1002
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,450
(that will excite them.)

1003
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:03,820
This has been my dream. My fantasy.

1004
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,389
- Is there anything you want to do?
- I want to ride a motorcycle.

1005
00:41:06,389 --> 00:41:07,490
(He named riding the motorcycle
as an activity he wanted.)

1006
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,220
- I see.
- It must have been about 500km.

1007
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,459
- Was it a 4-day trip?
- I drove about 200km or 400km with that.

1008
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:17,369
I really dreamed
of driving a motorcycle abroad.

1009
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:19,599
You know the movie,
"The Motorcycle Diaries?"

1010
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,300
"The Motorcycle Diaries?"
I loved the poster.

1011
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:27,840
That's why I bought an old bike.

1012
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,209
Of course, it was a tiny one.

1013
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:32,050
But the mileage on that tiny bike
went up to 30,000km.

1014
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:35,249
I had been to every city in Korea on that.

1015
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:36,919
Seriously. I drove that thing everywhere.

1016
00:41:38,919 --> 00:41:40,990
I'm sure other people
also want to do the same.

1017
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:44,430
Anyone who drives a motorcycle
has this kind of fantasy.

1018
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,530
It's like a dream.

1019
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,229
That's a dream for every biker.

1020
00:41:49,229 --> 00:41:50,329
- Right.
- Yes.

1021
00:41:50,329 --> 00:41:52,400
When you drive it abroad,
you feel so liberated.

1022
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,430
- Right.
- Yes.

1023
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,599
- It's different from cars.
- Yes.

1024
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:57,240
Hold on. Where is our destination?

1025
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,139
Maximum finish.

1026
00:41:59,139 --> 00:42:00,439
- The distance?
- Yes.

1027
00:42:00,439 --> 00:42:02,439
Okay. To Puno.

1028
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,249
- Puno.
- Puno.

1029
00:42:04,249 --> 00:42:06,680
- Have you seen Puno?
- Peru... I don't know.

1030
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,720
- We're here.
- Yes.

1031
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,079
Puno is here.

1032
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,519
- I see. That's 300km.
- That's 390km.

1033
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:13,050
Thirty-nine...

1034
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:16,619
Gosh. Look at that!

1035
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:17,930
(The plateau, elevated at 3,000m
to 4,000m, stretches out endlessly.)

1036
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,689
There's a reason why people do this there.

1037
00:42:19,689 --> 00:42:22,530
(This trail preserved the beautiful
scenery of the Inca Empire.)

1038
00:42:23,329 --> 00:42:24,700
(It's also called the Route of the Sun.)

1039
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,030
- Gosh.
- That looks amazing.

1040
00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:27,740
"The Route of the Sun."

1041
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,499
- All right. The Route of the Sun...
- Yes.

1042
00:42:29,499 --> 00:42:31,539
is known as the most beautiful route
in South America.

1043
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:34,780
So for the travelers in South America,

1044
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:37,010
everyone wants to check this out.

1045
00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:38,910
That's how famous this route is.

1046
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:40,249
- It's a popular route.
- Yes.

1047
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,119
Beautiful roads. Beautiful.

1048
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:44,950
Yes.

1049
00:42:45,289 --> 00:42:47,090
- Asphalt?
- Yes.

1050
00:42:47,289 --> 00:42:48,820
How much for one day?

1051
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,530
One day. For that one,

1052
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,829
- eighty dollars today.
- Eighty dollars.

1053
00:42:53,999 --> 00:42:55,760
- This here.
- It's less than that.

1054
00:42:55,999 --> 00:42:57,530
Fifty dollars.

1055
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:59,130
And I have...

1056
00:42:59,869 --> 00:43:02,840
the other one. Sixty-five dollars.

1057
00:43:03,169 --> 00:43:05,110
He gave you the prices in dollars
when you already exchanged dollars.

1058
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:06,510
He gave us prices in dollars.

1059
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:08,180
- We exchanged dollars.
- You already exchanged the money.

1060
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,380
- We did.
- But he wants dollars.

1061
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,450
After all that trouble
exchanging dollars to soles.

1062
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,010
It was so hard to calculate it.

1063
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:15,119
Another bike?

1064
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:17,450
Another bike? Let's go in.

1065
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:19,050
- Let me show you.
- Go ahead and take a look.

1066
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,150
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

1067
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,289
I have...

1068
00:43:21,289 --> 00:43:22,289
(They excitedly look at motorcycles.)

1069
00:43:22,289 --> 00:43:24,189
By the way, these are big.

1070
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:26,689
- We can't rent them.
- One.

1071
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,660
I have a bike in Korea.

1072
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,130
Kawasaki W800.

1073
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,240
- Yes.
- A beautiful bike.

1074
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,139
- A beautiful bike.
- He recognizes it.

1075
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:37,610
(Laughing)

1076
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,209
Why are you bragging about your bike
all of a sudden?

1077
00:43:39,209 --> 00:43:40,470
- I'm bragging.
- Gosh.

1078
00:43:41,139 --> 00:43:42,740
My bike...

1079
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,709
- Benly from Honda.
- You know Benly from Honda?

1080
00:43:44,709 --> 00:43:46,410
- Okay.
- He rides that.

1081
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,050
Will this work? Can I start the engine?

1082
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,820
- Yes.
- I'm...

1083
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:52,590
(Vrooming)

1084
00:43:53,019 --> 00:43:54,360
It sounds nice.

1085
00:43:54,889 --> 00:43:56,660
Hold on. That one...

1086
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,490
- Do you want to start this?
- Yes.

1087
00:43:58,490 --> 00:43:59,530
Yes.

1088
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,999
(Vrooming)

1089
00:44:01,999 --> 00:44:03,229
(This is it.)

1090
00:44:04,669 --> 00:44:06,099
- Good sound.
- Yes.

1091
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:07,700
(The sound of the engine
makes his heart beat fast.)

1092
00:44:08,499 --> 00:44:10,039
I made my choice. This one.

1093
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:11,610
- This?
- Yes.

1094
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:12,709
Awesome.

1095
00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:15,039
- I'll go with that.
- Sure. Do that.

1096
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:16,340
What else?

1097
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,309
- Helmets.
- Yes.

1098
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:22,380
(The owner takes out big helmets.)

1099
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:28,389
Small.

1100
00:44:28,389 --> 00:44:29,919
- This is small.
- Small?

1101
00:44:29,919 --> 00:44:31,829
I have a big head.

1102
00:44:32,229 --> 00:44:34,200
- Okay. Sure.
- "Big head."

1103
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,729
(He changes it to a bigger helmet.)

1104
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:37,800
- No.
- No?

1105
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:39,470
- No.
- Yes.

1106
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:41,400
This is small.

1107
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,769
- That's small?
- Yes.

1108
00:44:42,769 --> 00:44:44,669
- Big head.
- Okay.

1109
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:47,070
- Gosh.
- Big.

1110
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,780
- Small.
- Small?

1111
00:44:49,939 --> 00:44:51,280
Do you have a big head too?

1112
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:52,849
Small.

1113
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:54,079
(They keep shouting "small.")

1114
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:55,419
- No.
- Is it small?

1115
00:44:55,919 --> 00:44:57,389
Gosh. This is small too.

1116
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,820
- Sorry. I have a big head.
- Big head.

1117
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:03,389
But when you put on the helmet,
it shouldn't shake.

1118
00:45:03,389 --> 00:45:04,530
- I see. That's why.
- It has to hold our head nicely.

1119
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:06,590
- It has to feel a bit tight.
- Yes.

1120
00:45:07,459 --> 00:45:08,459
(Groaning)

1121
00:45:08,459 --> 00:45:09,930
- That's my choice.
- Yes.

1122
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:12,269
(They are done
with choosing their helmets.)

1123
00:45:12,269 --> 00:45:13,300
Perfect.

1124
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,539
- One day.
- One day.

1125
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:15,570
- One day.
- One day.

1126
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:18,169
You can leave the bikes in Puno
if you want.

1127
00:45:18,169 --> 00:45:20,840
- We have an office in Puno...
- Yes.

1128
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,380
where you can leave the bikes.

1129
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,910
- Okay.
- If it takes longer, we can pay there.

1130
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:26,150
Okay.

1131
00:45:26,150 --> 00:45:28,419
- You don't have to return them in Cusco.
- That's right.

1132
00:45:28,419 --> 00:45:29,450
Okay?

1133
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,450
- Perfect.
- Okay.

1134
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:34,119
(The bikers from all over the world
agree on a contract.)

1135
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:35,720
- Thank you.
- See you tomorrow.

1136
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:37,860
- Yes. Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1137
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:39,990
- See you.
- See you.

1138
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,260
- Bye.
- Bye.

1139
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,800
- Kian84.
- Gosh. That was tiring.

1140
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,800
- Aren't you tired?
- Yes.

1141
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,599
- Let's go back in.
- Let's get a massage.

1142
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:48,400
- A massage?
- Yes. What do you think?

1143
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,700
Sure. Sounds good.

1144
00:45:50,939 --> 00:45:52,470
Hold on.

1145
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,639
- There were so many massage shops.
- Okay.

1146
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,439
- It's pretty close.
- We just go straight.

1147
00:45:56,439 --> 00:45:57,680
We'll be there soon.

1148
00:45:57,849 --> 00:46:00,820
Si Eon, I will take a break
if I get tired...

1149
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:03,479
during our 400m drive tomorrow.

1150
00:46:03,479 --> 00:46:04,650
Did you say 400m?

1151
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,990
- I heard it was 390m away.
- It's 390km.

1152
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:08,959
I might not be able
to finish 390km in 1 day.

1153
00:46:08,959 --> 00:46:10,720
- Reducing the distance by 1,000 times.
- We have to take a break.

1154
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:14,729
We should take a break if we get tired.
We can take more than a day to finish.

1155
00:46:14,729 --> 00:46:15,829
- Okay.
- Yes.

1156
00:46:16,999 --> 00:46:18,829
- Si Eon, this is the place.
- Is this the place?

1157
00:46:19,229 --> 00:46:21,970
- A massage shop.
- Massages. Yes?

1158
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:26,340
I had Thai massages before,
but not Incan massages.

1159
00:46:26,939 --> 00:46:29,610
You guys have to drive
the motorcycles tomorrow.

1160
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:31,479
- You should relax your muscles.
- Definitely.

1161
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:32,880
I see. Okay.

1162
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,450
(It's time for a massage to wash away
altitude sickness and fatigue.)

1163
00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:37,650
Please take off your clothes
and face the ceiling.

1164
00:46:38,249 --> 00:46:40,789
- Are you from Peru?
- Yes.

1165
00:46:40,789 --> 00:46:41,860
Peru.

1166
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,990
- Too strong?
- Strong.

1167
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:46,729
- I like...
- Is it okay? Or stronger?

1168
00:46:46,729 --> 00:46:48,499
- Strong.
- I like to be sick.

1169
00:46:49,499 --> 00:46:52,229
- "I like to be sick."
- "I like to be sick."

1170
00:46:52,229 --> 00:46:54,499
I meant to say
I wanted her to press harder.

1171
00:46:54,499 --> 00:46:56,300
He likes to be sick.

1172
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,639
I like to be sick.

1173
00:46:59,309 --> 00:47:01,380
I like sick massages.

1174
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,809
Gosh. My headache from altitude sickness
is going away.

1175
00:47:06,209 --> 00:47:08,479
(Stretching)

1176
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:10,650
- This feels so nice.
- Are you okay?

1177
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:11,720
Okay.

1178
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:13,349
Happy.

1179
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:14,789
(Chuckling)

1180
00:47:14,789 --> 00:47:17,419
- That must have felt really nice.
- Gosh. Thank you so much.

1181
00:47:18,229 --> 00:47:21,400
My muscles were so tense
after going to the Amazon.

1182
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:23,229
Didn't our legs hurt a lot?

1183
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,530
(Watching them work
brings a sense of relief.)

1184
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:29,340
- Please.
- Yes.

1185
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:31,439
- Flip?
- The other side.

1186
00:47:31,439 --> 00:47:32,510
- Yes.
- Okay.

1187
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:35,479
- Turn around.
- Flip.

1188
00:47:35,479 --> 00:47:37,340
(They flip over for the massage
on the other side.)

1189
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:40,180
(Peeking)

1190
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:43,019
(Crumpled)

1191
00:47:43,919 --> 00:47:45,519
- When I say, "three,"
- Yes.

1192
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:46,689
- come up.
- Up.

1193
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:47,760
Relax.

1194
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:50,189
One, two.

1195
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:52,160
Up.

1196
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:57,829
(Stretching)

1197
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,369
(Feeling stretched)

1198
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:06,910
(This time,
their backs are being massaged.)

1199
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,180
- Gosh. The bottoms of my feet feel great.
- Gosh.

1200
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,309
(Groaning)

1201
00:48:12,979 --> 00:48:14,320
The bottoms of my feet feel great.

1202
00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:17,720
(Si Eon's masseuse is massaging his feet.)

1203
00:48:18,389 --> 00:48:20,220
(Kian84's masseuse
is massaging his bottom.)

1204
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:23,860
(Moaning)

1205
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,260
(Slapping)

1206
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:27,860
(Groaning)

1207
00:48:28,430 --> 00:48:29,430
(Groaning)

1208
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:31,669
Why is she suddenly slapping my buttocks?

1209
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:34,700
The bottoms of my feet feel so nice.

1210
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:39,070
(A feigned smile)

1211
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:41,209
You and I must have
different massage routines.

1212
00:48:41,209 --> 00:48:42,380
It's weird.

1213
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,309
Why does she keep slapping my buttocks?
This is weird.

1214
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:47,349
(Chuckling)

1215
00:48:47,349 --> 00:48:49,650
I wonder if slapping
is part of the routine.

1216
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:52,550
- What?
- I think she just came up with that.

1217
00:48:52,919 --> 00:48:54,459
She's suddenly slapping me.

1218
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:56,389
- Wait.
- What?

1219
00:48:56,389 --> 00:48:57,419
(What's going on?)

1220
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:16,059
- I couldn't hold back my laughter.
- What?

1221
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:18,099
(Pani Bottle)

1222
00:49:18,369 --> 00:49:20,840
- Gosh. What? You got me.
- Goodness.

1223
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,499
(He's finally here!)

1224
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:25,910
I had been wondering
when he would join you guys.

1225
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:27,880
That's how he showed up?
Slapping your buttocks?

1226
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,849
- He's the number one travel YouTuber.
- Right.

1227
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:32,849
Now that Pani Bottle joined them,

1228
00:49:32,849 --> 00:49:34,419
- I'm a bit relieved.
- Yes.

1229
00:49:34,979 --> 00:49:37,150
(A man shows up instead of a masseuse.)

1230
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:39,950
Is he your friend?

1231
00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:42,820
He's my friend. This is Pani Bottle.

1232
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:44,689
- You...
- I couldn't stop laughing.

1233
00:49:44,689 --> 00:49:46,090
- Pani Bottle?
- Pani Bottle.

1234
00:49:46,289 --> 00:49:48,660
(He's the number 1 travel YouTuber
with 1.37 million subscribers.)

1235
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:50,329
He's the most popular YouTuber now.

1236
00:49:50,329 --> 00:49:51,630
He's the best.

1237
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:54,439
Well, he's a veteran traveler.

1238
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,669
(Traveling the Amazon on a cargo ship)

1239
00:49:57,669 --> 00:50:00,680
(Taking the last cart in India)

1240
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:03,479
Gosh. That's so cool.
I was totally surprised.

1241
00:50:03,479 --> 00:50:04,979
- I just got goosebumps.
- Right.

1242
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:09,079
(He's a backpacker who has
great chemistry with locals too.)

1243
00:50:10,689 --> 00:50:13,050
(On top of that, he wrote and directed
a web drama and debuted as a director.)

1244
00:50:13,289 --> 00:50:14,490
He was in "Damn Good Company?"

1245
00:50:14,490 --> 00:50:16,889
- He was the director.
- He was the director?

1246
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,329
- Really?
- I thought someone else was the director.

1247
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:21,930
- He wrote the scripts?
- Pani Bottle did?

1248
00:50:21,999 --> 00:50:23,999
- He was going to be a webtoon artist.
- No way.

1249
00:50:23,999 --> 00:50:26,400
He tried it.
And then he directed the drama.

1250
00:50:26,499 --> 00:50:27,939
And he had always been a traveler.

1251
00:50:27,939 --> 00:50:29,700
- I really loved "Damn Good Company."
- Same here.

1252
00:50:29,999 --> 00:50:31,669
("Damn Good Company" was well-received
and he was invited...)

1253
00:50:31,669 --> 00:50:33,470
(to the Cannes International
Series Festival.)

1254
00:50:33,709 --> 00:50:35,809
I didn't know Pani Bottle went to Cannes.

1255
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,010
It will be faster to pick countries
he hasn't been to.

1256
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:40,010
Right.

1257
00:50:40,209 --> 00:50:43,249
(Pani Bottle)

1258
00:50:43,979 --> 00:50:46,650
Just like I was carrying out
an assassination,

1259
00:50:46,749 --> 00:50:47,889
I didn't want to get caught.

1260
00:50:47,889 --> 00:50:50,059
I was very nervous.

1261
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:52,930
(While Kian84 and Si Eon
have their backs turned around,)

1262
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,829
(he gets a fake job as a masseur.)

1263
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:58,130
I see. That's how he did it.

1264
00:50:58,930 --> 00:50:59,970
Okay.

1265
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:02,039
(After quickly switching places,)

1266
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:04,269
(he naturally begins massaging Kian84.)

1267
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:08,079
- Gosh. That feels great.
- He was pretty good.

1268
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:09,209
(Clueless of his friend's arrival,
he enjoys the massage.)

1269
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:11,950
(He massages Kian84's shoulders
as hard as he can.)

1270
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:14,249
(That hurts a bit.)

1271
00:51:15,749 --> 00:51:18,019
(This is the sick massage Kian84 wanted.)

1272
00:51:18,019 --> 00:51:19,650
He made it painful on purpose.

1273
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:20,720
(He suddenly starts
smacking the buttocks.)

1274
00:51:21,019 --> 00:51:23,220
(Laughing)

1275
00:51:24,189 --> 00:51:25,660
(Kian84 can't catch on
no matter how hard Pani Bottle hits.)

1276
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:28,459
And the size of his hands
matched that of the masseuse's.

1277
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:31,970
- That's why you didn't know.
- I didn't.

1278
00:51:32,229 --> 00:51:33,570
I couldn't hold back my laughter.

1279
00:51:33,570 --> 00:51:35,369
What? What are you doing here?

1280
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:38,809
I hit you pretty hard.
How come you didn't know?

1281
00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:41,439
- My stomach hurts from laughing.
- I knew something was different.

1282
00:51:43,110 --> 00:51:45,010
My nose started to get runny
in the middle of the massage.

1283
00:51:45,209 --> 00:51:47,150
I saw you traveling somewhere.

1284
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,050
- I'm traveling here.
- Really?

1285
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:50,849
- You saw my Instagram post, right?
- Yes.

1286
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:52,220
- And that's here.
- Really?

1287
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,090
- Yes. I was in LA and Lima.
- Right.

1288
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:55,689
- I'm glad you're here.
- Why...

1289
00:51:55,689 --> 00:51:58,490
When you were asking me for advice,
I knew I would be here.

1290
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,160
But I pretended that I was going
somewhere else and wasn't coming here.

1291
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,599
- Really?
- Yes.

1292
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:03,999
(It was 2 weeks before his departure.)

1293
00:52:04,499 --> 00:52:07,229
(They met for the first time,
pretending to give advice.)

1294
00:52:07,769 --> 00:52:09,369
But I'm not going to South America.

1295
00:52:09,369 --> 00:52:11,639
- We should travel together if we can.
- He fooled you on purpose.

1296
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:13,139
Gosh. He's such a good actor.

1297
00:52:14,010 --> 00:52:16,010
(What is he doing here then?)

1298
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,680
I traveled alone in South America.
But I had been traveling...

1299
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,749
everywhere alone for a long time.

1300
00:52:21,749 --> 00:52:24,289
I had always been alone
while traveling for ten years.

1301
00:52:24,419 --> 00:52:27,450
But I think I'm in a rut
since I always go on trips alone.

1302
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:30,160
All these sceneries
of mountains or the oceans...

1303
00:52:30,490 --> 00:52:32,559
don't really impress me anymore.
"What am I doing?"

1304
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:33,990
Rather, I question myself.

1305
00:52:34,229 --> 00:52:37,930
But this time, I will be joining them.

1306
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:40,169
My travel companions should have fun.

1307
00:52:40,169 --> 00:52:43,240
And I should have been sharing
these good moments.

1308
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:45,139
But I didn't have that.

1309
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,939
So I'm looking forward to that
on this trip.

1310
00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:50,139
I was surprised Pani Bottle joined us.

1311
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,550
But he's reliable.

1312
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:54,150
He's a professional traveler.

1313
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:55,820
He likes adventures.

1314
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:58,150
And Kian84 wants
a taste of such adventures.

1315
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,150
I think the two of them
will have great chemistry.

1316
00:53:01,059 --> 00:53:03,059
When I think of him,
I think of "Damn Good Company."

1317
00:53:03,059 --> 00:53:04,959
- Right. My drama.
- That was excellent.

1318
00:53:04,959 --> 00:53:06,760
I can't believe he directed the drama.

1319
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,130
But why is your nickname Pani Bottle?

1320
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:09,229
That's an Indian name.

1321
00:53:09,229 --> 00:53:11,630
It means "water bottle."

1322
00:53:11,729 --> 00:53:13,030
I was on the train...

1323
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:14,669
when I first heard that word.
A merchant on the train...

1324
00:53:14,669 --> 00:53:17,340
was really loud
and kept saying, "Pani Bottle."

1325
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:19,039
- I remembered it when I made my nickname.
- In India?

1326
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:20,570
Yes. In India.

1327
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,880
By the way, we'll be riding
the motorcycles tomorrow.

1328
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,910
- You'll be joining us, right?
- Yes.

1329
00:53:25,209 --> 00:53:26,880
We'll drive the motorcycles.

1330
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,880
- There are big mountains and lakes.
- Right.

1331
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,419
- I see. That's great.
- Yes.

1332
00:53:30,419 --> 00:53:32,419
The path going to Lake Titicaca
is beautiful.

1333
00:53:32,419 --> 00:53:33,689
- Right?
- He already knows everything.

1334
00:53:33,689 --> 00:53:35,119
- Tiki-taka?
- Titicaca.

1335
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:36,559
Titicaca.

1336
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:37,959
That's our destination?

1337
00:53:37,959 --> 00:53:39,130
I'm not sure if we'll be going there.

1338
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:40,729
- I don't know anything.
- Titicaca.

1339
00:53:40,729 --> 00:53:42,459
Usually, other travelers...

1340
00:53:42,459 --> 00:53:45,700
go to Lake Titicaca via Puno.

1341
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:46,970
We rented the bikes to Puno.

1342
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,439
- Then you guys did it right.
- Yes.

1343
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:51,039
Trout is famous in Lake Titicaca.

1344
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:53,610
- They're called the rainbow trout.
- Don't they come back from the ocean?

1345
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:55,240
- There are some trout in the ocean too.
- You're thinking of salmon.

1346
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:57,280
- That's salmon?
- They swim against the ocean waves...

1347
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,280
and make it back to the river.

1348
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:01,150
Then trout don't go to the ocean?

1349
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,579
That's up to the trout.
They can go when they want to.

1350
00:54:03,579 --> 00:54:05,950
It's not about what the trout want.
They are different species.

1351
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,689
- They're fighting again.
- Why did you get mad?

1352
00:54:07,689 --> 00:54:08,990
Listen to their conversation.

1353
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,229
I should get used to this, right?
But I don't think I can.

1354
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:13,789
But you're enriching our conversation.

1355
00:54:13,789 --> 00:54:15,760
Anyway, it's delicious. Okay.

1356
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,599
- It's nice to meet you, Banana Bottle.
- Okay.

1357
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:20,130
- Then...
- "Banana Bottle?"

1358
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:23,539
- "Banana Bottle."
- I was welcoming him.

1359
00:54:23,539 --> 00:54:24,840
- It was the altitude sickness.
- Gosh.

1360
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,869
- It's nice to meet you, Banana Bottle.
- Okay.

1361
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:29,340
- Then should we go and eat?
- I'm so glad you're here.

1362
00:54:30,209 --> 00:54:31,979
- Should we get going first?
- Yes.

1363
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:33,950
- Yes. Since Pani Bottle is here...
- Yes.

1364
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:35,650
Pani People!

1365
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,579
He's feeling cheerful now.

1366
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:40,019
Pani Bottle, don't laugh
if it's not funny. You'll spoil him.

1367
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:42,160
He probably laughed because
it was ridiculous, not funny.

1368
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,320
It's both.

1369
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:46,260
- Let's go.
- Okay. Go.

1370
00:54:47,189 --> 00:54:49,160
(The trio is finally together.)

1371
00:54:49,729 --> 00:54:52,169
(They head to their lodging
after the massage.)

1372
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:57,200
Goodness.

1373
00:54:57,869 --> 00:54:58,910
No way.

1374
00:54:59,809 --> 00:55:01,380
- It's a dormitory.
- Yes.

1375
00:55:01,939 --> 00:55:03,709
- A momentary?
- A dormitory.

1376
00:55:03,709 --> 00:55:04,780
People call this a dormitory?

1377
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:07,110
- A large bedroom for students to share.
- I see.

1378
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:08,320
- This is the bed.
- Yes.

1379
00:55:08,849 --> 00:55:11,289
Let's have a meeting on the floor.

1380
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:16,090
- By the way, it will get colder now.
- Yes.

1381
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:19,289
- As you know, when you're on a bike,
- Yes.

1382
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:20,789
the sense of cold doubles.

1383
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:22,700
If it's cold now,
we'll freeze on the bikes.

1384
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,499
I should buy some clothes now.

1385
00:55:24,499 --> 00:55:26,930
- You can. But I brought a lot of clothes.
- Yes.

1386
00:55:27,269 --> 00:55:29,240
- You can wear the padded jacket.
- Yes.

1387
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,010
You didn't bring a helmet.

1388
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:32,840
- You can rent it at the shop.
- You can rent it there.

1389
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,709
- We can install walkie-talkie.
- Yes.

1390
00:55:34,709 --> 00:55:37,709
So the bike issue has been resolved.

1391
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:40,579
Since he's here,

1392
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,680
we should give him a welcome drink.

1393
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:46,820
- Gosh. You're serving him drinks.
- We have beer and water.

1394
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:48,660
A welcome drink. What's that?

1395
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,289
That's... Oh, this is kimchi.
The owner made it.

1396
00:55:51,789 --> 00:55:54,400
We'll have to travel together.
So have a drink.

1397
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,400
- Can I drop the honorifics?
- Yes, please. Sure.

1398
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,200
- Welcome.
- Nice to meet you.

1399
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,669
Welcome.

1400
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:03,039
(Taking a sip of the welcome drink)

1401
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,139
- That hits the spot.
- Right.

1402
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:09,979
Do you have some kind of goal?

1403
00:56:09,979 --> 00:56:12,410
- We have a destination. It's set.
- A goal.

1404
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:15,249
Personally, this is important to me.

1405
00:56:15,249 --> 00:56:17,050
It's the traveling style.

1406
00:56:17,050 --> 00:56:20,720
In my opinion,
he wants to follow an itinerary.

1407
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,260
Does your MBTI type end with J?

1408
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,389
I don't know my type.

1409
00:56:23,389 --> 00:56:26,090
But if we were in Korea,
I wouldn't have planned anything...

1410
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:27,360
because we speak the language.

1411
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,530
- And we can solve any problems in Korea.
- Yes.

1412
00:56:29,530 --> 00:56:32,130
But once I go abroad, this is how I think.

1413
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:34,599
When I'm traveling,
I want the trip to be therapeutic.

1414
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,700
I want my trip to be smooth, not taxing.

1415
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,169
I'm the opposite.

1416
00:56:38,169 --> 00:56:39,570
Yes. He's the opposite. I knew...

1417
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,139
- about his style.
- I want it to be challenging.

1418
00:56:41,139 --> 00:56:43,840
For example, let's say we're on our way.
But our bikes break down.

1419
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,410
And we don't have a place to sleep.

1420
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:46,849
We're forced to sleep outdoors.

1421
00:56:46,849 --> 00:56:48,519
I think that's so cool.

1422
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:50,019
That's the highlight of traveling.

1423
00:56:50,019 --> 00:56:51,619
Yes. I know.

1424
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,019
- We're traveling as a group.
- They are polar opposites.

1425
00:56:54,019 --> 00:56:56,189
I think we should be accommodating
to a certain degree...

1426
00:56:56,189 --> 00:56:58,030
I feel like I need to intervene already.

1427
00:56:58,189 --> 00:56:59,760
- I...
- Already.

1428
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,760
- Come on, Si Eon.
- I'm trying to be the bigger person.

1429
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,200
- But that's so romantic.
- That's cool.

1430
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:05,499
- It's...
- Hey, you two should go then.

1431
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:09,269
It must have been tough on him
to be in the middle of this.

1432
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:11,470
That might be why he's not here.

1433
00:57:11,709 --> 00:57:13,840
- Right. He's sick of them.
- Yes.

1434
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,740
- He's sick of them.
- He doesn't want to see them in Korea.

1435
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:17,340
- Right.
- He doesn't want to put up with them.

1436
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:20,380
Listen.
Since he's here, let's discuss this.

1437
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:22,380
- This is our route for tomorrow.
- Okay.

1438
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,519
- We're going to Puno, right?
- That's right.

1439
00:57:24,519 --> 00:57:26,519
- We'll drive the bike from Cusco.
- Yes.

1440
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:29,660
- We'll arrive in Puno through 3S.
- Yes.

1441
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:31,059
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

1442
00:57:31,059 --> 00:57:32,459
- Here's the goal.
- Okay.

1443
00:57:32,459 --> 00:57:33,490
- This is our goal.
- Puno.

1444
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:35,130
- Busan is 400km away from Seoul.
- What do you think?

1445
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:36,200
Right.

1446
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,200
- Going to Puno from Cusco is our goal.
- Okay.

1447
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,930
- Right.
- To arrive there...

1448
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,869
There's a place called La Raya.

1449
00:57:43,869 --> 00:57:45,010
Have you heard of it?

1450
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:48,309
It has an altitude of 4,335m.

1451
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:50,510
That's higher.

1452
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:53,910
It's the highest place
throughout this trip.

1453
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:54,950
I see.

1454
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:58,119
That's where you'll watch the sunset.

1455
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:01,320
(La Raya Observatory, altitude of 4,335m)

1456
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:04,090
You'll arrive in Puno late
at night tomorrow.

1457
00:58:04,090 --> 00:58:06,389
- Yes.
- Go to La Raya before the sunset.

1458
00:58:06,389 --> 00:58:08,099
We'll ride the motorcycles
all the way to La Raya.

1459
00:58:08,099 --> 00:58:10,329
What we eat and when we take
breaks will be up to us.

1460
00:58:10,329 --> 00:58:11,900
It's completely up to you.
I think it'd be better.

1461
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,900
Okay.

1462
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,570
That's enough for me.
All I need is the plans for motorcycling.

1463
00:58:15,570 --> 00:58:16,599
Okay.

1464
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:19,269
Everyone, finally...

1465
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:22,910
We have our new guest.

1466
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:27,510
It feels like welcoming
a new soldier in the military.

1467
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,249
Underneath is a sergeant
who will be discharged soon.

1468
00:58:32,189 --> 00:58:33,490
Go to bed.

1469
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:34,919
The new soldier is 36 years old.

1470
00:58:34,919 --> 00:58:36,389
The sergeant is 41.

1471
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:38,389
I'm in the middle.

1472
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:39,760
- No.
- Not yet.

1473
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,130
Tomorrow,

1474
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:45,499
the 3 of us will travel 380km.

1475
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,470
- It will be fun.
- Yes.

1476
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:50,970
I like our discussion on travel plans.

1477
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:52,809
I should brush my teeth.

1478
00:58:53,369 --> 00:58:54,709
- Kian84.
- The end.

1479
00:58:55,579 --> 00:58:56,780
(How will their motorcycle tour turn out?)

1480
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,610
The view looks amazing.

1481
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:00,249
Their hearts must've been fluttering.

1482
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:06,720
(The morning of their motorcycle tour)

1483
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,160
The cat looks cute.

1484
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:11,360
(Creaking)

1485
00:59:12,229 --> 00:59:14,130
Please be careful.

1486
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:15,829
Be careful.

1487
00:59:18,570 --> 00:59:19,669
Are they eating?

1488
00:59:20,329 --> 00:59:21,769
Determined to win

1489
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:23,639
Hello.

1490
00:59:23,639 --> 00:59:24,939
Are you leaving?

1491
00:59:25,209 --> 00:59:26,769
- We're leaving.
- Goodbye.

1492
00:59:26,769 --> 00:59:27,939
- Thank you.
- Please come back.

1493
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:30,139
- I hope you three will be happy.
- We are leaving.

1494
00:59:30,309 --> 00:59:31,380
- We'll get going.
- Bye.

1495
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:33,380
Goodbye.

1496
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:35,650
(Waving goodbye)

1497
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:37,380
(The back of the parents saying goodbye
to their children)

1498
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:40,220
They were worried about us.
I didn't see them from the back.

1499
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,689
Everyone. How long has it been?

1500
00:59:42,689 --> 00:59:45,630
- How long has it been?
- Today is our third day.

1501
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,430
- This is our new guest.
- Hello.

1502
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:49,630
I'm Pani Bottle.

1503
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:53,669
We'll finally take the motorcycles
that we rented yesterday.

1504
00:59:53,669 --> 00:59:55,470
I'm looking forward to this the most.

1505
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:57,639
- You mean the plan that I made?
- Yes.

1506
00:59:58,110 --> 00:59:59,439
They seem to have overcome
altitude sickness.

1507
00:59:59,439 --> 01:00:01,340
First of all,

1508
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,510
we'll rent a motorcycle for Pani.

1509
01:00:03,510 --> 01:00:06,050
Since he hasn't ridden a motorcycle
in a long time,

1510
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:07,709
- he'll practice for 15 minutes.
- I'll train myself.

1511
01:00:07,709 --> 01:00:08,979
It's been three years for him.

1512
01:00:08,979 --> 01:00:10,050
This is...

1513
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:11,450
- a shop...
- I'm scared.

1514
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:13,619
- whose owner has a nicely shaped head.
- Right.

1515
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:16,820
Among those I met in Peru so far,
he has the best looking head.

1516
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:19,760
Hi, friend.

1517
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,189
- Beautiful head.
- Hello.

1518
01:00:21,189 --> 01:00:23,260
- "Beautiful head?"
- How are you?

1519
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:24,400
I'm fine.

1520
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,200
I was waiting for you.

1521
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:27,829
I was waiting for you.

1522
01:00:27,829 --> 01:00:28,939
Oh, yes.

1523
01:00:28,939 --> 01:00:30,539
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1524
01:00:30,539 --> 01:00:31,570
It's a new friend.

1525
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:33,269
- A new friend? How are you?
- Yes.

1526
01:00:33,269 --> 01:00:34,439
Hello.

1527
01:00:34,439 --> 01:00:35,979
- Mr. Beautiful Head.
- He is...

1528
01:00:35,979 --> 01:00:38,650
the best traveling YouTuber in Korea.

1529
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:39,979
- Yes?
- Yes.

1530
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:42,619
He's a superstar traveler.

1531
01:00:42,619 --> 01:00:43,720
He's a superstar YouTuber.

1532
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,919
- He's the top celebrity.
- Did you already rent yours?

1533
01:00:45,919 --> 01:00:47,419
We rented ours.

1534
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,360
One bike rental.

1535
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,260
- Perfect.
- Actually, for me,

1536
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:55,059
I have very short legs.

1537
01:00:55,059 --> 01:00:57,559
- Okay.
- If I have a big...

1538
01:00:57,559 --> 01:00:59,269
- It's detailed.
- He speaks English well...

1539
01:00:59,269 --> 01:01:01,669
- because he's traveled a lot.
- It's long.

1540
01:01:01,669 --> 01:01:02,700
What?

1541
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,499
He's so good at speaking English.

1542
01:01:04,499 --> 01:01:06,639
I'd like a smaller one.

1543
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:07,769
- Okay.
- Yes.

1544
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:09,309
- I have this one.
- Low.

1545
01:01:09,309 --> 01:01:10,910
- This one?
- Yes, the same.

1546
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:13,050
You're so good at English.

1547
01:01:13,050 --> 01:01:15,079
- This is higher.
- Test the seat.

1548
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:16,320
- This one?
- Yes.

1549
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,320
Do you have a classic motorcycle?

1550
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:20,550
- Small.
- Smaller one.

1551
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:21,919
Smaller? No.

1552
01:01:21,919 --> 01:01:23,619
This is the smallest one I have.

1553
01:01:23,619 --> 01:01:24,729
Will this work?

1554
01:01:24,729 --> 01:01:27,459
(He's worried because of his short legs.)

1555
01:01:27,459 --> 01:01:29,329
It's 190cc.

1556
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:31,499
This one is okay.

1557
01:01:31,499 --> 01:01:33,200
- This will work.
- It's perfect.

1558
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,369
I have to raise my heels,
but this is okay.

1559
01:01:35,369 --> 01:01:37,840
- Nice.
- Okay. Yes.

1560
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,869
You want it with bags or without?

1561
01:01:40,869 --> 01:01:42,110
- Without.
- Without?

1562
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:44,510
It's because we have our backpacks.

1563
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:46,180
(Blinking)

1564
01:01:46,309 --> 01:01:47,309
I'm sorry.

1565
01:01:47,309 --> 01:01:48,720
- He can definitely...
- No problem.

1566
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,380
speak English.

1567
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:52,889
- Pani, did you do well...
- Yes?

1568
01:01:52,889 --> 01:01:54,349
on the English portion
of your college exams?

1569
01:01:54,349 --> 01:01:56,889
No, my grade was so-so.
I got a level three.

1570
01:01:56,889 --> 01:01:58,329
- Level three?
- Yes.

1571
01:01:58,889 --> 01:02:00,729
Then you're the smart one out of us.

1572
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,760
- I got a level four.
- You were pretty close too.

1573
01:02:03,999 --> 01:02:05,400
He's obsessed with grades.

1574
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:07,300
(Not only in English,)

1575
01:02:07,499 --> 01:02:08,800
(but he's also fluent in Spanish.)

1576
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,499
- He's amazing.
- He speaks Spanish too.

1577
01:02:10,499 --> 01:02:11,769
He's intelligent.

1578
01:02:12,269 --> 01:02:14,240
(He even takes care of Si Eon's bladder.)

1579
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,240
(Restroom)

1580
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:17,010
(Don't touch our camera.)

1581
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:18,849
(He's a problem-solver in South America.)

1582
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:20,180
(If Pani didn't join us,)

1583
01:02:20,410 --> 01:02:22,180
(we'd still be in the Amazon.)

1584
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:23,180
(Bright and innocent)

1585
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:25,389
(We can travel because Pani is with us.)

1586
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:28,820
(However...)

1587
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,919
(A padded jacket borrowed from Si Eon)

1588
01:02:30,919 --> 01:02:33,130
(I forgot my bathing suit.)

1589
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,160
(A professional traveler
who's always missing something)

1590
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,729
(What do you have?)

1591
01:02:36,729 --> 01:02:37,729
(Smiling)

1592
01:02:38,059 --> 01:02:39,329
- Are you finished?
- Yes.

1593
01:02:39,669 --> 01:02:40,900
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

1594
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:41,999
We're ready.

1595
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,039
- You take the bike and ride it.
- Okay.

1596
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:46,369
- Okay.
- Bikes out.

1597
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:49,240
Finally, our motorcycle diary will start.

1598
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,910
I'm looking forward to it very much,
you guys.

1599
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:54,280
You aren't leaving yet, right?

1600
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,919
- You aren't taking off, right?
- No, I'll stay here.

1601
01:02:57,450 --> 01:02:59,050
- First gear.
- First gear.

1602
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:00,050
- Second gear.
- Second gear.

1603
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:02,760
Raise it with force.
You're doing it too gently.

1604
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,229
- Why isn't it working?
- I was worried about him.

1605
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:08,459
A small mistake can result in an accident.

1606
01:03:08,459 --> 01:03:09,959
Since Si Eon planned it,

1607
01:03:09,959 --> 01:03:11,930
he must have been worried.

1608
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:13,099
Okay.

1609
01:03:13,769 --> 01:03:16,340
(He's checking his helmet.)

1610
01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:19,010
(Frowning)

1611
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:21,880
(Grunting)

1612
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,280
(Screaming)

1613
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,309
(Pulling)

1614
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:28,050
What's going on?

1615
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,220
- It doesn't fit.
- It doesn't fit him?

1616
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:33,019
- Did the helmet get smaller?
- You need to open it up.

1617
01:03:33,019 --> 01:03:35,860
Si Eon, I don't think I can wear it.

1618
01:03:36,419 --> 01:03:39,729
The helmet includes a walkie-talkie.

1619
01:03:39,729 --> 01:03:41,430
- A walkie-talkie.
- Exactly.

1620
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:43,030
It's so we can talk to each other.

1621
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:44,530
I see.

1622
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:45,900
- I see.
- The leader has to explain everything...

1623
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,300
including what's ahead
and warn the others.

1624
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,039
The walkie-talkie made the helmet smaller.

1625
01:03:50,039 --> 01:03:52,169
Does he have to say, "I'm sorry,
I have a big head?"

1626
01:03:53,139 --> 01:03:54,369
I don't think this will work for me.

1627
01:03:55,079 --> 01:03:57,139
- Really?
- I mean, it won't work.

1628
01:03:57,139 --> 01:03:58,249
My head won't go in.

1629
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:02,720
(Screaming)

1630
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,180
He's suffering so much.

1631
01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:05,519
- The helmet might break.
- I can't do it.

1632
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,419
Here's what you should do.

1633
01:04:07,419 --> 01:04:08,720
Open it up wide.

1634
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,419
I did, but it's already...

1635
01:04:12,229 --> 01:04:14,189
squeezing on my skull...

1636
01:04:14,189 --> 01:04:15,200
(Giving a sharp look)

1637
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:19,630
This would fit only the owner's head.

1638
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:22,900
I should change my helmet.

1639
01:04:24,139 --> 01:04:27,010
- Exchange?
- Yes, no problem.

1640
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:28,039
Yes.

1641
01:04:28,479 --> 01:04:30,539
(He puts the helmet on
after exchanging it.)

1642
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,550
(His head finally goes in.)

1643
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:34,349
It's the biggest helmet in Cusco.

1644
01:04:35,180 --> 01:04:36,650
Let's take a photo before leaving.

1645
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:37,880
Okay.

1646
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:43,059
(Thumbs-up)

1647
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,689
- Let's not get hurt.
- Let's go.

1648
01:04:46,389 --> 01:04:48,599
The moment before leaving is
the most exciting.

1649
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:50,059
- Do we follow you?
- Yes.

1650
01:04:50,059 --> 01:04:51,530
You should lead us.

1651
01:04:53,669 --> 01:04:56,769
(The eldest leads the way.)

1652
01:04:57,139 --> 01:04:58,139
Let's go.

1653
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:01,209
Gosh.

1654
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:05,979
(Their motorcycle tour starts.)

1655
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,209
(Potholes on the road)

1656
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,479
Be careful. The road has potholes.

1657
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:15,360
The road looks dangerous.

1658
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,689
- If something sparks...
- The road isn't paved.

1659
01:05:18,530 --> 01:05:21,700
While going slowly, fix your side mirrors.

1660
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:22,729
Okay.

1661
01:05:22,729 --> 01:05:24,200
Be careful of other cars.

1662
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,570
It's fun to travel while talking.

1663
01:05:27,570 --> 01:05:28,570
This is great.

1664
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:30,470
Walkie-talkies are necessary
when traveling in a group.

1665
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:31,809
Definitely.

1666
01:05:31,809 --> 01:05:33,340
It's for one's safety.

1667
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:34,340
(Glancing)

1668
01:05:34,709 --> 01:05:37,340
Cusco is 3,200m in altitutde.

1669
01:05:37,539 --> 01:05:38,610
Okay.

1670
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:41,150
I think I'm all right at 3,000m now.

1671
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:42,180
Yes.

1672
01:05:44,349 --> 01:05:45,650
(Clicking)

1673
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:49,289
Why can't I put it on neutral?

1674
01:05:49,619 --> 01:05:51,760
- Kian84.
- Neutral doesn't work.

1675
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:52,959
Half under the first gear.

1676
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,260
Move it about. Pull the handle a little.

1677
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:57,660
Try it while stepping on the gas.

1678
01:05:57,660 --> 01:05:59,769
Do it while stepping on the gas.

1679
01:05:59,769 --> 01:06:02,599
Do you know that it's different
from your motorcycle?

1680
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,439
I have to step on the gas first.

1681
01:06:06,139 --> 01:06:09,110
- The gears are different.
- The gears were in bad condition.

1682
01:06:09,110 --> 01:06:10,740
They were a little rough.

1683
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:12,450
(They enter an unpaved road.)

1684
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:14,349
- A place like that...
- They're in trouble.

1685
01:06:14,349 --> 01:06:15,479
That looks tough.

1686
01:06:15,479 --> 01:06:18,619
The road was quite dangerous.

1687
01:06:18,619 --> 01:06:20,220
(Rumbling)

1688
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:22,260
Goodness.

1689
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:23,760
(Pani and Kian84)

1690
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:24,959
Wait a little.

1691
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,630
(Carefully)

1692
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:29,930
(They finally escape.)

1693
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,430
Si Eon probably wanted to go fast,

1694
01:06:32,430 --> 01:06:34,300
but he waited for the others.

1695
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,970
He keeps checking on them.

1696
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:37,599
(I'm getting ahead.)

1697
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,510
Guys, can you speed up?

1698
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:40,570
Yes.

1699
01:06:40,869 --> 01:06:42,410
- Kian84.
- Yes?

1700
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:44,079
Can you get closer?

1701
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:46,749
Going at 60km per hour seems perfect
for me.

1702
01:06:46,749 --> 01:06:49,720
You should speed up because of other cars.

1703
01:06:50,249 --> 01:06:52,450
I'll speed up after I get adjusted to it.

1704
01:06:52,450 --> 01:06:54,389
All right. Then I'll go slowly.

1705
01:06:54,389 --> 01:06:56,959
I've been driving 50cc for a long time.

1706
01:06:56,959 --> 01:06:58,530
Going fast is scary, isn't it?

1707
01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:01,329
Yes, going slowly feels more comfortable.

1708
01:07:02,099 --> 01:07:04,660
Sure. There's no need to go fast.

1709
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,530
Actually, I get scared easily.

1710
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:09,300
It was only natural since you had
never ridden a big bike before.

1711
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:11,869
We're turning right.

1712
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,369
Okay.

1713
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:15,639
(The eldest starts
to lead them in earnest.)

1714
01:07:15,639 --> 01:07:17,639
- He's the leader.
- The leader.

1715
01:07:21,180 --> 01:07:22,650
We're turning left.

1716
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:24,249
Okay.

1717
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:29,689
(He's acting more like a leader today.)

1718
01:07:30,419 --> 01:07:32,729
(We're familiar with him...)

1719
01:07:33,459 --> 01:07:36,459
(being a picky eater when it comes
to food that he doesn't know.)

1720
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:39,229
(When the boat shook because of Kian84,)

1721
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:42,240
(he acted like a coward.)

1722
01:07:43,539 --> 01:07:45,809
(When he faced the truth
that he didn't expect)

1723
01:07:45,809 --> 01:07:47,709
That was very...

1724
01:07:47,709 --> 01:07:48,840
(Si Eon had a difficult time.)

1725
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:51,209
We're turning right.

1726
01:07:51,510 --> 01:07:53,209
We're turning left.

1727
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:55,650
- Okay.
- Okay.

1728
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:57,180
He's in control.

1729
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,650
- He looks like a bodyguard.
- Control.

1730
01:08:00,019 --> 01:08:02,519
(He's exploding with splendor.)

1731
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:04,789
It's unfamiliar to see you
acting as a leader.

1732
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:07,990
Kian84, wasn't it unfamiliar to see him
being the leader?

1733
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:11,459
Yes, but I liked that.

1734
01:08:11,559 --> 01:08:12,930
(Feeling proud)

1735
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:14,300
You can count on him.

1736
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,400
I wish he had been that way
since the day before.

1737
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:19,209
He was preparing himself
to be the leader that day.

1738
01:08:19,209 --> 01:08:21,439
It was impossible for him without plans.

1739
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:24,180
It's fine as long as I was good
for one day.

1740
01:08:25,209 --> 01:08:27,780
(They get out of the city
and start to move fast.)

1741
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:30,720
We have to stop by a big supermarket.

1742
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:34,289
Kian84, to keep the formation,
you should come to the right.

1743
01:08:34,550 --> 01:08:37,590
- I'll come closer to the right.
- Okay.

1744
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:40,059
Pani Bottle, get behind me.

1745
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:42,999
We had to be in a zig zag.

1746
01:08:42,999 --> 01:08:45,430
Even if one falls off,
the person behind him won't crush him.

1747
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:46,599
I see.

1748
01:08:47,329 --> 01:08:49,840
I can't believe we're riding
motorcycles in Peru.

1749
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,539
This is so much fun.

1750
01:08:53,539 --> 01:08:54,539
Right?

1751
01:08:54,669 --> 01:08:56,039
It's so much fun.

1752
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:58,079
It was really nice.

1753
01:08:58,380 --> 01:09:01,110
Si Eon kept saying,
"The road has potholes,"

1754
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:03,320
"we're turning left or right."

1755
01:09:03,579 --> 01:09:07,090
When he led us...

1756
01:09:07,619 --> 01:09:10,860
It was something that I couldn't do
without Si Eon,

1757
01:09:11,220 --> 01:09:14,289
so it was a lot of fun.

1758
01:09:16,599 --> 01:09:19,900
(Looking around)

1759
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:22,900
Gosh, the view is beautiful.

1760
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:25,340
Just looking at the view...

1761
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:27,439
Even the trash has swagger.

1762
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:29,439
- Swagger?
- Wow.

1763
01:09:32,749 --> 01:09:34,809
We're getting away from the city.

1764
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:38,479
Goodbye, Cusco.

1765
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:41,490
This is nice.

1766
01:09:42,919 --> 01:09:45,059
- It's picturesque.
- Their bike tour makes me...

1767
01:09:45,329 --> 01:09:47,760
- jealous.
- The weather is perfect for a ride.

1768
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:49,660
That will go on my bucket list.

1769
01:09:51,629 --> 01:09:53,200
This is incredible.

1770
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,939
(An incredible and thrilling speed)

1771
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:05,250
(They get out of the busy city.)

1772
01:10:07,349 --> 01:10:11,150
(The three of them run towards
a magnificent view of Peru.)

1773
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:17,589
(They enter a small village.)

1774
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:20,229
Aren't you hungry? I'm so hungry.

1775
01:10:20,389 --> 01:10:21,490
I'm hungry.

1776
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:24,660
- They're shaking something.
- They're touting.

1777
01:10:24,660 --> 01:10:25,929
They're beckoning us.

1778
01:10:25,929 --> 01:10:27,400
It's all bread. What do you think?

1779
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,900
It sounds good,
but there's no place to sit.

1780
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,509
- We'll eat while standing.
- All right.

1781
01:10:32,509 --> 01:10:33,570
Castro.

1782
01:10:34,469 --> 01:10:35,679
They must be baking in a fire pot.

1783
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:37,639
- It smells good.
- They're baking in a fire pot.

1784
01:10:39,410 --> 01:10:41,410
(Oropesa, a village where they bake bread)

1785
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:43,650
- They're known for their bread.
- Oropesa.

1786
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:44,920
That looks delicious.

1787
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:46,620
(Traditional bread baked in a fire pot)

1788
01:10:47,889 --> 01:10:50,059
That's good. They can get a bite to eat.

1789
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,689
- It's baked directly in a fire pot.
- I see.

1790
01:10:52,689 --> 01:10:53,889
It must taste light.

1791
01:10:53,889 --> 01:10:56,099
(Oropesa bread has
a plain and simple taste.)

1792
01:10:57,460 --> 01:11:01,099
(Full of savory bread smell)

1793
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:05,040
(The village of bread
that lives up to its name)

1794
01:11:05,099 --> 01:11:06,139
(They have 361km to go.)

1795
01:11:06,139 --> 01:11:08,040
- They still have 361km to go.
- They have a long way to go.

1796
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:09,639
We're at the beginning of the route.

1797
01:11:09,879 --> 01:11:10,910
What's this?

1798
01:11:11,479 --> 01:11:12,610
What is this called?

1799
01:11:12,979 --> 01:11:15,110
- Especial.
- Especial?

1800
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:17,979
It's special something. Especial.

1801
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,490
- What's inside?
- I don't know.

1802
01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:22,960
Bread in red beans?

1803
01:11:23,389 --> 01:11:25,290
"Bread in red beans?"

1804
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:27,629
- What does that mean?
- Is there red beans in it?

1805
01:11:28,160 --> 01:11:29,229
Red beans?

1806
01:11:29,929 --> 01:11:32,469
Is there jam in it?

1807
01:11:32,469 --> 01:11:34,330
Sugar beans?

1808
01:11:34,729 --> 01:11:37,000
Black beans.

1809
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:38,670
(Sugar beans, black beans, and red beans)

1810
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:39,870
(Red beans)

1811
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:42,309
I see. It's red beans.

1812
01:11:42,679 --> 01:11:43,809
Special.

1813
01:11:43,809 --> 01:11:46,210
(They buy a bag
that's as big as a sitting cushion.)

1814
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:49,080
- Let's eat something quick and go.
- That sounds good.

1815
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,750
- What do you think?
- That sounds good.

1816
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:53,490
I guess they eat it without anything.

1817
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:54,519
Is there any jam?

1818
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:58,189
Jam?

1819
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:02,229
Jam, caramel sauce, or something...

1820
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:03,900
to eat?

1821
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,729
You eat it plain.

1822
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,170
The more you chew it,
the more savory it gets.

1823
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,200
Why is this a specialty?

1824
01:12:11,799 --> 01:12:13,509
(He concentrates
on the natural taste of the bread.)

1825
01:12:13,509 --> 01:12:14,670
It's hard to swallow.

1826
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,280
It's almost...

1827
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:18,280
(Chewing)

1828
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,150
It's almost like chewing on cardboard.

1829
01:12:20,809 --> 01:12:22,549
(A bite of the cardboard)

1830
01:12:23,349 --> 01:12:25,519
However, this tastes good
when you're hungry.

1831
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:28,019
We still have to eat.

1832
01:12:28,019 --> 01:12:30,089
(He forces himself to eat.)

1833
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,960
After you eat it, you crave more.

1834
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:35,660
- It wasn't bad.
- I liked it.

1835
01:12:35,660 --> 01:12:37,129
It was nice and plain.

1836
01:12:37,129 --> 01:12:38,700
- Right.
- It was nice and plain.

1837
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:41,000
- Without technique.
- Nice and plain?

1838
01:12:41,599 --> 01:12:43,299
My skin is starting to get tanned.

1839
01:12:43,299 --> 01:12:45,040
Right? I should put something on.

1840
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,939
We're at a high altitude. Who wants some?

1841
01:12:47,639 --> 01:12:48,809
More.

1842
01:12:49,179 --> 01:12:50,839
- You want more?
- Yes.

1843
01:12:50,839 --> 01:12:52,110
It's a lot.

1844
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:53,450
(He rubs his hands...)

1845
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:54,849
(and covers his face with it.)

1846
01:12:55,110 --> 01:12:56,379
(Rubbing hard)

1847
01:12:56,379 --> 01:12:59,820
He cares a lot about his face
getting tanned.

1848
01:13:00,089 --> 01:13:01,790
What are you doing?

1849
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,660
Si Eon.

1850
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:04,960
- We have to put this much on.
- Is that stage makeup?

1851
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,360
No UV rays will go through.

1852
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,960
You have to put a lot on
because it's only SPF 50.

1853
01:13:09,059 --> 01:13:10,059
Really?

1854
01:13:11,099 --> 01:13:12,370
- I have some too.
- Can I have some more?

1855
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:16,639
- That much is...
- Wait.

1856
01:13:16,639 --> 01:13:17,839
It's too scary.

1857
01:13:17,839 --> 01:13:20,009
- It looks like foam cleanser.
- Isn't that from "Farewell My Concubine?"

1858
01:13:20,009 --> 01:13:21,839
Isn't there a child who looks like him
in "Ju-On?"

1859
01:13:21,839 --> 01:13:23,080
- Toshio?
- Toshio.

1860
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:24,080
All right.

1861
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:25,479
(They take off after applying sunblock.)

1862
01:13:31,549 --> 01:13:33,689
- Let's go.
- Instead of planning...

1863
01:13:33,689 --> 01:13:36,089
on where you would stop,

1864
01:13:36,089 --> 01:13:37,360
you just stopped anywhere, right?

1865
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,129
- Yes.
- There weren't many places to rest.

1866
01:13:39,129 --> 01:13:41,660
We stopped anywhere that had a nice view.

1867
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:42,660
That's nice.

1868
01:13:46,769 --> 01:13:48,670
The mountain looks interesting.

1869
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:53,110
How is it possible
that the mountain has so few trees?

1870
01:13:53,469 --> 01:13:54,809
Either people cut them down...

1871
01:13:54,809 --> 01:13:56,679
or it's part of the vegetation here.

1872
01:13:58,439 --> 01:13:59,910
Here's another village.

1873
01:13:59,910 --> 01:14:01,110
It looks beautiful.

1874
01:14:01,250 --> 01:14:05,450
The color of all the buildings
in this country is red clay.

1875
01:14:05,519 --> 01:14:07,019
They must like the color of red clay.

1876
01:14:08,519 --> 01:14:11,120
It's a different part of the world.

1877
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,229
Seriously.

1878
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:16,629
(On top of them is the blue sky.)

1879
01:14:16,629 --> 01:14:18,200
Look at the color of the sky.

1880
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:20,429
How can it be so blue?

1881
01:14:20,599 --> 01:14:22,000
There's no fine dust.

1882
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,040
Right.

1883
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,969
This is amazing. Gosh.

1884
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:33,280
- Look at that.
- What's that?

1885
01:14:33,450 --> 01:14:34,780
They are graves.

1886
01:14:34,780 --> 01:14:35,950
Graves?

1887
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:38,820
Graves look like houses.

1888
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:41,089
They look like a structure.

1889
01:14:41,589 --> 01:14:43,089
It's a lake.

1890
01:14:43,089 --> 01:14:45,660
(Another beautiful view behind it)

1891
01:14:47,259 --> 01:14:50,500
It would be amazing to fish here.

1892
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:53,870
I want to go there with a fishing rod.

1893
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:57,299
(Wherever they look is
a beautiful picture.)

1894
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:01,370
(Glancing)

1895
01:15:03,879 --> 01:15:06,009
(Compared to Si Eon who's riding fast,)

1896
01:15:06,509 --> 01:15:08,479
(the others fall behind.)

1897
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:11,019
- Kian84 and Pani Bottle.
- Yes?

1898
01:15:11,019 --> 01:15:12,889
You need to go at 70km per hour at least.

1899
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:16,960
Going fast has been scary for me.

1900
01:15:17,290 --> 01:15:20,089
I had been riding a small motorcycle
for a long time,

1901
01:15:20,089 --> 01:15:21,830
so it was difficult.

1902
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:23,729
Neither Kian84
nor Pani Bottle had ridden...

1903
01:15:23,729 --> 01:15:25,400
a big motorcycle before.

1904
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:26,599
I was quite worried.

1905
01:15:26,629 --> 01:15:28,670
(Second gear. Raise it higher.)

1906
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:30,839
(Tapping)

1907
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:33,040
(Creaking)

1908
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:34,509
(Awkward changing of the gears)

1909
01:15:34,740 --> 01:15:37,309
(Why isn't it getting to neutral?)

1910
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:40,809
(Si Eon was worried
about the others' safety.)

1911
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:43,719
Kian84, can we speed up?

1912
01:15:43,849 --> 01:15:45,049
All right.

1913
01:15:45,519 --> 01:15:47,349
(Adjusting to the others
who are warmed up,)

1914
01:15:47,349 --> 01:15:49,219
(the leader speeds up.)

1915
01:15:49,219 --> 01:15:51,059
Kian84 is keeping up fast.

1916
01:15:52,089 --> 01:15:53,559
Did you get used to the speed now?

1917
01:15:54,089 --> 01:15:56,860
Yes, I got used to it.

1918
01:15:57,559 --> 01:15:58,860
He's slightly nervous.

1919
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:01,129
I was grateful that he was leading us.

1920
01:16:01,129 --> 01:16:02,500
I felt comfortable by then.

1921
01:16:02,969 --> 01:16:04,200
Pani Bottle.

1922
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,839
I can keep up with you.

1923
01:16:06,439 --> 01:16:07,769
This is fun.

1924
01:16:07,769 --> 01:16:09,080
He's good at riding.

1925
01:16:09,910 --> 01:16:12,809
Pani Bottle seemed to enjoy the speed.

1926
01:16:14,009 --> 01:16:15,479
- Pani Bottle.
- Yes?

1927
01:16:15,479 --> 01:16:17,080
Do you want to go fast in the front?

1928
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:18,280
I will try.

1929
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,389
- In the front?
- Pass by me.

1930
01:16:20,389 --> 01:16:21,420
Okay.

1931
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,689
(Outrunning)

1932
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:24,689
That's amazing.

1933
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:27,759
- That looks really fun.
- It's really fun.

1934
01:16:27,759 --> 01:16:29,099
Speed up, Pani Bottle.

1935
01:16:30,059 --> 01:16:32,500
He's a good driver.

1936
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:34,599
(Excited)

1937
01:16:36,839 --> 01:16:38,370
It's refreshing.

1938
01:16:38,370 --> 01:16:40,110
I wonder how it feels when you speed up.

1939
01:16:40,370 --> 01:16:42,479
I got to the front and sped up.

1940
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:44,639
It was really refreshing.

1941
01:16:44,639 --> 01:16:47,780
I could feel the rush of adrenaline.

1942
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:48,879
This is nice.

1943
01:16:48,879 --> 01:16:51,950
Pani Bottle is speeding up instinctively.

1944
01:16:52,820 --> 01:16:54,519
Unlike in a car,

1945
01:16:54,519 --> 01:16:57,259
you feel the wind full force
on a motorcycle.

1946
01:16:57,389 --> 01:16:58,559
It would feel different.

1947
01:16:58,559 --> 01:17:01,360
Do Yeon, if you ever go there...

1948
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,059
I won't ask you that.

1949
01:17:03,259 --> 01:17:04,960
Would you want...

1950
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:06,530
- to ride a motorcycle?
- Motorcycle.

1951
01:17:06,530 --> 01:17:08,599
I'm just curious.

1952
01:17:08,599 --> 01:17:10,939
The road conditions are different
from Korea.

1953
01:17:10,939 --> 01:17:14,139
- I thought that it could be dangerous,
- Right.

1954
01:17:14,139 --> 01:17:16,479
but now that I see it,
I'd like to try it once in my life.

1955
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:17,679
Definitely.

1956
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,580
(Checking the altitude)

1957
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:21,780
The altitude is 3,100m.

1958
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:23,019
Okay.

1959
01:17:23,219 --> 01:17:24,650
Several trucks are coming our way.

1960
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,219
There's a lot of dust.

1961
01:17:29,889 --> 01:17:30,990
(Screaming)

1962
01:17:31,219 --> 01:17:32,960
The sand hit my face.

1963
01:17:33,490 --> 01:17:34,759
Are you okay, Kian84?

1964
01:17:34,929 --> 01:17:37,500
I don't like going at 80km per hour.

1965
01:17:37,830 --> 01:17:40,429
Going at 70km per hour is good for me.

1966
01:17:41,429 --> 01:17:43,639
- Pani Bottle, slow down.
- I will.

1967
01:17:43,639 --> 01:17:46,339
The sand is hitting my face like bullets.

1968
01:17:46,339 --> 01:17:47,370
I know.

1969
01:17:48,509 --> 01:17:50,879
It looks so cool on the left.

1970
01:17:51,509 --> 01:17:52,679
(On the left?)

1971
01:17:53,280 --> 01:17:54,379
(Thud)

1972
01:17:54,379 --> 01:17:58,049
A beetle just hit my eyelid.

1973
01:17:59,589 --> 01:18:03,019
I should get cheap sunglasses
or something.

1974
01:18:03,019 --> 01:18:05,219
- They could be in small supermarkets.
- Right.

1975
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:08,689
I feel like I can find them here.

1976
01:18:08,689 --> 01:18:10,559
- Let's check.
- Okay.

1977
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,830
It looks like a market.

1978
01:18:13,769 --> 01:18:15,129
I think that's a market over there.

1979
01:18:15,870 --> 01:18:17,670
Do they have sunglasses?

1980
01:18:17,939 --> 01:18:19,410
They must sell sunglasses at markets.

1981
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:22,910
I don't see sunglasses.

1982
01:18:22,910 --> 01:18:24,339
They don't have sunglasses.

1983
01:18:24,339 --> 01:18:26,479
- It looks like a stationery store.
- It was.

1984
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:27,549
Hello.

1985
01:18:27,809 --> 01:18:29,519
Let's ask if they have bathrooms.

1986
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:30,719
(We don't have sunglasses.)

1987
01:18:31,519 --> 01:18:32,889
(On the right)

1988
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:34,450
Thank you.

1989
01:18:34,450 --> 01:18:35,860
The bathroom is on the right.

1990
01:18:36,389 --> 01:18:37,920
We have to pay.

1991
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,330
You have to pay to use the bathroom.

1992
01:18:39,330 --> 01:18:41,290
- I just want to pee.
- You have to pay overseas.

1993
01:18:41,729 --> 01:18:44,000
Still, you have to pay. That's how it is.

1994
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,530
Do we pay the same
for number 1 and number 2?

1995
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:47,670
Yes. It's the same.

1996
01:18:48,129 --> 01:18:49,200
That's nice.

1997
01:18:50,170 --> 01:18:53,339
(They take a short break.)

1998
01:18:53,339 --> 01:18:55,710
Watch out for the cars that pass you.

1999
01:18:55,710 --> 01:18:56,740
Thank you.

2000
01:18:56,879 --> 01:18:59,049
- You only went to the bathroom.
- You used the bathroom and left.

2001
01:18:59,049 --> 01:19:00,080
They didn't have sunglasses.

2002
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:02,210
- You took care of an urgent issue.
- Yes.

2003
01:19:02,549 --> 01:19:04,719
- The view is really nice, though.
- I know.

2004
01:19:06,049 --> 01:19:07,450
(By the way)

2005
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:08,490
It's refreshing.

2006
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:10,259
(When can he get sunglasses?)

2007
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,030
It looks like a small town.

2008
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:14,689
Let's check if they have sunglasses.

2009
01:19:14,689 --> 01:19:16,830
Will this town have sunglasses?

2010
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:19,030
I feel like they won't.

2011
01:19:19,269 --> 01:19:21,570
Gosh. I said we should buy
sunglasses yesterday.

2012
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:23,700
- Yes. You should've listened to him.
- I know.

2013
01:19:25,170 --> 01:19:26,269
What is it?

2014
01:19:26,809 --> 01:19:28,009
What is this?

2015
01:19:28,610 --> 01:19:30,910
It's a market.

2016
01:19:31,210 --> 01:19:32,710
They might have them.

2017
01:19:33,110 --> 01:19:34,379
- Okay.
- Let's check here.

2018
01:19:35,049 --> 01:19:36,849
(Grunting)

2019
01:19:37,950 --> 01:19:39,150
My eyes hurt so much.

2020
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:41,820
My gloves are so new
that they hurt my hands.

2021
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,420
(Bloodshot eyes)

2022
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:46,790
- I felt like my eyes were popping out.
- My eyes are so red.

2023
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:48,830
Kian84, why don't you close your helmet?

2024
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:51,259
I can't see well when I close it.

2025
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,969
It's likely they have sunglasses.

2026
01:19:53,969 --> 01:19:55,570
(They're looking everywhere
for sunglasses.)

2027
01:19:55,570 --> 01:19:58,099
(Are they here?)

2028
01:19:58,099 --> 01:20:00,769
(Looking around)

2029
01:20:01,269 --> 01:20:02,610
They don't seem to sell them.

2030
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:05,639
Excuse me.

2031
01:20:06,549 --> 01:20:07,780
Sunglasses?

2032
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:10,150
- No sunglasses?
- No.

2033
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:11,849
- No? Okay.
- No.

2034
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,889
It looks like they have, but they don't.

2035
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:16,660
They should have sunglasses.

2036
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:18,259
- That's BTS.
- BTS.

2037
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:19,889
It's the countryside.

2038
01:20:20,429 --> 01:20:23,530
- Peru also loves BTS.
- It was such a small village.

2039
01:20:23,759 --> 01:20:26,000
Can we take a ten-minute break?

2040
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,200
- Okay. Let's rest.
- Let's take a break.

2041
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:28,400
I'm tired.

2042
01:20:28,969 --> 01:20:30,339
(Exhausted)

2043
01:20:30,339 --> 01:20:32,670
It takes more energy than I thought.

2044
01:20:32,670 --> 01:20:34,370
You must be tense all the time.

2045
01:20:34,370 --> 01:20:36,080
- Yes. You stay alert and everything.
- Right.

2046
01:20:36,509 --> 01:20:37,679
Kian TV.

2047
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:40,710
We've been riding for about two hours.

2048
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:42,780
First, my eyes hurt so much.

2049
01:20:43,349 --> 01:20:45,920
I guess I'm not really a fast rider.

2050
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:48,719
- He became a little weird.
- Take this.

2051
01:20:49,990 --> 01:20:51,189
He's snacking.

2052
01:20:51,490 --> 01:20:52,830
They sell snacks.

2053
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:54,660
- Is that a cookie?
- We got it from the supermarket.

2054
01:20:54,660 --> 01:20:56,099
(Take this too.)

2055
01:20:56,099 --> 01:20:58,299
- You eat it.
- Take the rest.

2056
01:20:58,629 --> 01:20:59,629
(Picking up)

2057
01:20:59,929 --> 01:21:01,599
(He blows on the cookie and eats it.)

2058
01:21:02,099 --> 01:21:04,400
(According to the 3-second rule,
it's safe.)

2059
01:21:04,969 --> 01:21:07,509
To be honest,
I need to rest for at least 30 minutes.

2060
01:21:08,370 --> 01:21:12,439
You and Pani Bottle protected your eyes
on the way.

2061
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,210
But my eyes were red the whole time.

2062
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:16,719
Close the helmet.

2063
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:19,519
- I kept riding with my red eyes.
- Close it.

2064
01:21:19,519 --> 01:21:21,089
- Why do you keep it open?
- If I close the helmet,

2065
01:21:21,089 --> 01:21:24,559
I can't see the beautiful view.

2066
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:28,389
(I get it.)

2067
01:21:28,389 --> 01:21:30,000
- That was why?
- Yes.

2068
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,599
You can't see well when it's open too,
can you?

2069
01:21:32,099 --> 01:21:34,830
My eyes feel dry, but I can see clearly.

2070
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:37,870
As soon as I close it,

2071
01:21:37,870 --> 01:21:39,910
I become a machine riding a motorcycle.

2072
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:41,439
- You don't want to miss the view.
- Exactly.

2073
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:43,979
- I get what you mean.
- Let me lie down for ten minutes.

2074
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:45,479
(Nodding)

2075
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:47,150
(Kian84 gets up.)

2076
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:48,150
It's our break.

2077
01:21:48,509 --> 01:21:50,150
I'll rest over there.

2078
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:54,990
- He was tired.
- I had no energy.

2079
01:21:55,849 --> 01:21:57,259
(What an interesting guy.)

2080
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:58,790
A photo?

2081
01:21:58,790 --> 01:21:59,889
Yes.

2082
01:21:59,889 --> 01:22:01,830
- She wants a picture.
- Okay.

2083
01:22:02,599 --> 01:22:04,729
(You can take a photo of him for free.)

2084
01:22:06,129 --> 01:22:08,000
(The news spread,
and more customers came.)

2085
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,870
Do you want a picture? Okay.

2086
01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:11,299
Do you want everything in it?

2087
01:22:11,299 --> 01:22:15,139
Kian84 doesn't care
and is still sleeping on the street.

2088
01:22:15,139 --> 01:22:16,679
(They're touched by his eagerness.)

2089
01:22:16,910 --> 01:22:18,379
Who is it? Who's taking a picture of me?

2090
01:22:18,379 --> 01:22:19,410
In 1, 2, 3.

2091
01:22:19,410 --> 01:22:20,580
(He makes a V even though he's tired.)

2092
01:22:21,349 --> 01:22:22,450
I took one.

2093
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:24,920
- They didn't recognize you, did they?
- No.

2094
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:26,589
Were they just surprised to see Koreans?

2095
01:22:26,589 --> 01:22:27,620
(Yes.)

2096
01:22:27,620 --> 01:22:31,120
We didn't see any Koreans
while we were there.

2097
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,460
I guess they found us fascinating.

2098
01:22:33,759 --> 01:22:36,259
(Rummaging)

2099
01:22:36,259 --> 01:22:38,259
Do you want to try these glasses?

2100
01:22:38,259 --> 01:22:40,299
(Since Kian84 couldn't buy sunglasses,)

2101
01:22:40,299 --> 01:22:41,870
(Pani Bottle gave him his glasses.)

2102
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:45,000
People say I look smart with glasses.

2103
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,870
- You look smart.
- Really?

2104
01:22:47,309 --> 01:22:48,769
Don't flatter him.

2105
01:22:48,769 --> 01:22:50,179
I can't even give him a small compliment?

2106
01:22:50,179 --> 01:22:52,139
- He looks intelligent.
- He looks good.

2107
01:22:52,139 --> 01:22:53,509
- They look good on him.
- I look sharp.

2108
01:22:53,509 --> 01:22:54,780
- Let's go.
- Okay.

2109
01:22:55,049 --> 01:22:56,150
Let me see.

2110
01:22:56,519 --> 01:22:57,519
(Good!)

2111
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:00,450
Let's go.

2112
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:01,950
(Let's get going.)

2113
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:03,860
Come on.

2114
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:09,700
It feels a lot better.

2115
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,370
(They're on the road again,
enjoying the breeze.)

2116
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:14,370
It's nice.

2117
01:23:14,370 --> 01:23:16,799
We had to go 390km like that.

2118
01:23:16,799 --> 01:23:18,500
- It's so beautiful.
- How nice.

2119
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:22,910
Guys, we won't take a break for an hour.

2120
01:23:22,910 --> 01:23:24,710
- Okay. Let's go.
- All right.

2121
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:27,210
(Impressed)

2122
01:23:27,849 --> 01:23:31,179
Look at the rocks in the mountains.
The ridges are rocks.

2123
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:35,120
The mountains look fascinating.

2124
01:23:36,519 --> 01:23:39,089
- The houses look so cool too.
- Yes.

2125
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:43,900
(They're riding
while looking at a stunning view.)

2126
01:23:44,059 --> 01:23:46,870
If we'd had more equipment like a tent,

2127
01:23:46,870 --> 01:23:48,429
- we could've slept on the street.
- Right.

2128
01:23:48,429 --> 01:23:49,900
You could've rested and taken a nap.

2129
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,710
It's dangerous without enough equipment.

2130
01:23:53,639 --> 01:23:55,769
Are we going higher?

2131
01:23:55,769 --> 01:23:57,080
It's 3,300m above sea level.

2132
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:59,780
- I think we're going higher.
- I think so.

2133
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:02,250
I see an elementary school.

2134
01:24:03,349 --> 01:24:06,219
There's a school in the countryside.

2135
01:24:06,689 --> 01:24:09,290
Korea looked like this in the 1990s.

2136
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:13,589
Older kids in the neighborhood
used to ride motorcycles too.

2137
01:24:13,589 --> 01:24:15,259
(Popular kids used motorcycles.)

2138
01:24:15,689 --> 01:24:18,729
It looks just like the countryside
in Korea.

2139
01:24:18,729 --> 01:24:20,269
My aunt's town looked like Peru.

2140
01:24:20,269 --> 01:24:22,000
(It's like he's visiting his aunt.)

2141
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,299
It looks the same.

2142
01:24:23,839 --> 01:24:25,639
He always talks about his aunt's place.

2143
01:24:25,639 --> 01:24:27,740
You said it was the Amazon before.

2144
01:24:28,339 --> 01:24:30,910
(Since he was in the Amazon,)

2145
01:24:31,479 --> 01:24:34,410
(he kept saying his aunt's village
looked like Peru.)

2146
01:24:34,610 --> 01:24:36,379
They had something like that.

2147
01:24:36,379 --> 01:24:38,979
- It looked just like that.
- It reminds him of his aunt everywhere.

2148
01:24:39,589 --> 01:24:43,519
(They keep riding.)

2149
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:47,490
(It's been 3 hours since they took off.)

2150
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:50,330
- We started to get exhausted.
- I can imagine.

2151
01:24:50,330 --> 01:24:51,960
- We were getting tired.
- You were tired.

2152
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:53,599
- That was hard. That's true.
- Your butt must hurt too.

2153
01:24:53,599 --> 01:24:54,969
- Right.
- The hard seat hurts your butt.

2154
01:24:56,469 --> 01:24:57,670
Goodness. My butt.

2155
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:01,110
(Going up and down)

2156
01:25:01,339 --> 01:25:03,540
I feel like the shape of my butt changed.

2157
01:25:04,939 --> 01:25:07,049
I stand up and stretch a little.

2158
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:09,950
- He's relaxed.
- I didn't know he was doing that.

2159
01:25:09,950 --> 01:25:11,750
- Oh, my.
- My gosh.

2160
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:12,750
He was twerking.

2161
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:15,389
(A lot of car exhaust)

2162
01:25:15,389 --> 01:25:18,120
- The exhaust.
- Right. The exhaust.

2163
01:25:18,120 --> 01:25:19,629
Right. It was tough.

2164
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,759
- Because of the cars in front of you?
- Yes.

2165
01:25:21,759 --> 01:25:22,759
Big cars.

2166
01:25:24,099 --> 01:25:26,370
I'm suddenly crying so much.

2167
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:29,469
There's so much exhaust here,
and the air quality is bad.

2168
01:25:29,469 --> 01:25:30,570
My eyes.

2169
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,009
I'm crying so much now.

2170
01:25:33,809 --> 01:25:35,040
I can't open my eyes.

2171
01:25:35,809 --> 01:25:37,240
It's driving me crazy. Gosh.

2172
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:38,479
Are you okay, Pani Bottle?

2173
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,580
Let me slow down. I can't open my eyes.

2174
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:43,650
My eyes are burning too.

2175
01:25:44,219 --> 01:25:45,280
It's crazy.

2176
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:47,290
Our eyes started to burn so much.

2177
01:25:47,589 --> 01:25:49,349
- Because of the exhaust?
- Even with the helmet on?

2178
01:25:49,349 --> 01:25:50,620
Shouldn't you take a break?

2179
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:51,620
(What's happening to my eyes?)

2180
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:53,889
Let's pull up and rest.

2181
01:25:53,889 --> 01:25:54,929
Okay.

2182
01:25:55,259 --> 01:25:56,660
You need a break.

2183
01:25:56,660 --> 01:25:58,700
(They stop for safety reasons.)

2184
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,299
The exhaust was horrible.

2185
01:26:01,599 --> 01:26:02,629
My eyes were hurting so much.

2186
01:26:02,629 --> 01:26:04,639
The exhaust almost got me.

2187
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:05,870
(Dizzy)

2188
01:26:05,870 --> 01:26:06,910
Oh, dear.

2189
01:26:07,839 --> 01:26:10,910
(They take care of their eyes
with wet wipes for now.)

2190
01:26:11,809 --> 01:26:13,679
I'm so out of it. I'm crying a lot.

2191
01:26:14,150 --> 01:26:16,250
My eyes hurt so much. My goodness.

2192
01:26:16,379 --> 01:26:18,320
Were they hurting before,
or it was painful all of a sudden?

2193
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:19,750
They suddenly hurt.

2194
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:22,150
You left eye is so red.

2195
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,589
- My eyes are red too, right?
- Yes.

2196
01:26:23,589 --> 01:26:25,160
- You two.
- They're bloodshot.

2197
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:26,160
The altitude is 3,411m.

2198
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:27,629
Let me see your eyes.

2199
01:26:27,629 --> 01:26:29,759
Your eyes are not red. Are they yellow?

2200
01:26:29,759 --> 01:26:31,759
(Your eyes are not red. Are they yellow?)

2201
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,469
Why are your eyes yellow?

2202
01:26:33,469 --> 01:26:34,469
(His face is yellow
as he's not feeling well.)

2203
01:26:34,469 --> 01:26:36,540
Shall we eat something?

2204
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:38,139
Yes. Eat something first.

2205
01:26:38,139 --> 01:26:40,240
You only had a little bit of bread.

2206
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:41,870
- I know.
- You haven't had a meal.

2207
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:43,509
All the restaurants are closed.

2208
01:26:43,879 --> 01:26:45,139
There's nothing open.

2209
01:26:45,379 --> 01:26:48,049
(All shops are closed.)

2210
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,719
(Peeking)

2211
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:51,820
It's closed.

2212
01:26:52,450 --> 01:26:54,150
(That's a shame.)

2213
01:26:55,420 --> 01:26:58,059
Many restaurants are in the square,
but they're all closed.

2214
01:26:58,990 --> 01:27:01,389
I'm so tired.

2215
01:27:04,059 --> 01:27:05,229
I'm exhausted.

2216
01:27:08,530 --> 01:27:09,599
Gosh.

2217
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:11,540
They've been riding to eat.

2218
01:27:11,540 --> 01:27:14,710
(He lies down on the bench
as he's fatigued.)

2219
01:27:16,439 --> 01:27:17,540
It was so hard.

2220
01:27:18,910 --> 01:27:21,210
At some point, I got so tired.

2221
01:27:22,349 --> 01:27:24,519
I felt like I was dying.
It was exhausting.

2222
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:29,960
You still have 200km to go.
How are you going to do that?

2223
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:31,759
- What time is it?
- We should get going now.

2224
01:27:31,759 --> 01:27:33,429
We don't have as much time as we think.

2225
01:27:33,429 --> 01:27:34,929
It's almost 3 p.m. now.

2226
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:42,870
Is the walkie-talkie working?

2227
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,099
Pani Bottle.

2228
01:27:47,809 --> 01:27:48,910
Pani Bottle.

2229
01:27:49,610 --> 01:27:51,110
- Pani Bottle.
- Pani Bottle.

2230
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:52,110
(The members keep calling his name.)

2231
01:27:52,110 --> 01:27:53,879
His walkie-talkie must not be working.

2232
01:27:55,009 --> 01:27:59,049
(They stop to check
Pani Bottle's walkie-talkie.)

2233
01:27:59,719 --> 01:28:00,920
Stay here for a moment.

2234
01:28:02,549 --> 01:28:04,019
(Yawning)

2235
01:28:08,889 --> 01:28:10,629
Why do I smell mint?

2236
01:28:12,429 --> 01:28:14,170
It smells like menthol.

2237
01:28:16,099 --> 01:28:18,500
(What is that smell?)

2238
01:28:23,110 --> 01:28:24,179
What?

2239
01:28:25,410 --> 01:28:27,549
(A staff member tries
to check his walkie-talkie.)

2240
01:28:28,110 --> 01:28:29,509
(Startled)

2241
01:28:29,509 --> 01:28:32,179
- What is that? Hey.
- What?

2242
01:28:35,589 --> 01:28:36,889
Are you all right?

2243
01:28:37,019 --> 01:28:40,030
I'm a little sleepy, but I'm not dying.

2244
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:41,790
I don't get altitude sickness. Really.

2245
01:28:42,490 --> 01:28:44,700
(He emphasized
that he didn't get altitude sickness.)

2246
01:28:45,299 --> 01:28:46,500
(The travel YouTuber
with 1.37 million subscribers...)

2247
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:47,570
(doesn't get altitude sickness.)

2248
01:28:48,370 --> 01:28:50,269
(He has the best survival skills.)

2249
01:28:50,269 --> 01:28:51,740
(Minus 3°C)

2250
01:28:52,299 --> 01:28:53,540
(I think I got scammed.)

2251
01:28:53,670 --> 01:28:55,110
(The bravest)

2252
01:28:55,110 --> 01:28:56,410
(Get out, you punk!)

2253
01:28:56,410 --> 01:28:57,710
(He keeps following me.)

2254
01:28:57,979 --> 01:29:00,479
(The strongest mental health)

2255
01:29:02,950 --> 01:29:05,179
(He's the best Korean traveler
with all kinds of survival skills.)

2256
01:29:06,389 --> 01:29:07,549
You have a nosebleed.

2257
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:09,759
You look like you're in bad condition now.

2258
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,160
Did you push yourself too hard?

2259
01:29:11,160 --> 01:29:13,389
(This trip even makes
an experienced traveler bleed.)

2260
01:29:14,129 --> 01:29:16,729
(Is it going to be okay like this?)

2261
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:19,059
(These stunning views...)

2262
01:29:19,059 --> 01:29:21,599
(keep them from stopping.)

2263
01:29:22,670 --> 01:29:23,670
(Let's keep going!)

2264
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:26,070
(It makes them continue riding.)

2265
01:29:26,099 --> 01:29:29,439
(I should've done it when I was younger.)

2266
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:31,580
(No. It's not too late now.)

2267
01:29:32,009 --> 01:29:34,610
(He realized why he should travel.)

2268
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:37,120
(They found a hot spring
at a high altitude.)

2269
01:29:37,120 --> 01:29:38,679
(- There's a hot spring.
- Shall we take a hot bath?)

2270
01:29:39,379 --> 01:29:41,089
(Splashing)

2271
01:29:41,589 --> 01:29:44,189
(He dived into the hot spring.)

2272
01:29:44,189 --> 01:29:45,759
(What an interesting man.)

2273
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:48,059
(He's pretending to be strong again.)

2274
01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:49,360
(Your face is so red.)

2275
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:50,629
(Your nose is bleeding!)

2276
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:51,860
(Again?)

2277
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:54,170
(It's so fun to mess with Pani Bottle.)

2278
01:29:54,530 --> 01:29:56,540
(They have to cross the border on foot?)

2279
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,139
(We have to take a bus.)

2280
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:02,339
(There will be many buses.)

2281
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:04,410
(You shouldn't be too sure about that.)

2282
01:30:04,410 --> 01:30:05,540
(Confident)

2283
01:30:05,540 --> 01:30:07,379
(Where is the entrance?)

2284
01:30:07,379 --> 01:30:08,780
(He was so confident,)

2285
01:30:08,780 --> 01:30:11,120
(but he can't even find the entrance.)

2286
01:30:11,679 --> 01:30:14,250
(Copacabana?)

2287
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:15,849
(He says it's not.)

2288
01:30:16,189 --> 01:30:18,490
(Kian84, this bus isn't it.)

2289
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:20,790
(Confused)

2290
01:30:21,889 --> 01:30:24,530
(They can't find their bus anywhere.)

2291
01:30:25,530 --> 01:30:27,229
(Did they miss it?)

2292
01:30:28,769 --> 01:30:30,670
(Will they cross the border
safe and sound?)

2293
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:31,799
What's going on?

2294
01:30:32,900 --> 01:30:33,939
(Adventure by Accident)
