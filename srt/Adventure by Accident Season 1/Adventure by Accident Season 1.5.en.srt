1
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:12,310
- Congratulations are in order.
- Yes.

2
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:13,940
Our Kian84...

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,379
won an award
at the 2022 MBC Entertainment Awards.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,919
(Kian84 on Adventure by Accident)

5
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,490
(Thank you.)

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,320
(He didn't expect
to win this amazing award.)

7
00:00:26,289 --> 00:00:28,059
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,690
Can you tell us what award you won
in case someone missed the ceremony?

9
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,699
It was the Multiplayer Award.

10
00:00:33,699 --> 00:00:35,030
The Multiplayer Award.

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,670
- So...
- Well...

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,929
What made them think
you were a multitasker?

13
00:00:37,929 --> 00:00:40,269
Have you been working in different fields?

14
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:42,539
I'm on "Home Alone..."

15
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:44,909
and Adventure by Accident too.

16
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:46,579
I'm like a midfielder.

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,409
That's great.

18
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:50,509
Also, Si Eon was a candidate...

19
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:53,119
for the Excellence Award
for Variety Show Category.

20
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,820
(Si Eon on Adventure by Accident)

21
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,250
(It was Si Eon!)

22
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,159
(Smiling from ear to ear)

23
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,659
A nominee for the Excellence Award.

24
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:02,060
- Right.
- What's interesting is...

25
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,329
he was nominated
only for three episodes...

26
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:07,560
- of Adventure by Accident.
- Right.

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,570
Honestly, I was so surprised.

28
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,270
It's unprecedented, right?

29
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,239
I'm not sure if it has happened before,

30
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,540
but I was so honored.

31
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,340
Why didn't you take photos
with the alpacas?

32
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:18,870
(Speechless)

33
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:22,909
(Kian84 wanted to take pictures
with alpacas so badly,)

34
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:25,209
(but Si Eon firmly rejected it.)

35
00:01:25,379 --> 00:01:27,180
(- How cold he is.
- Let him take photos with the alpacas.)

36
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,079
(Many people called Si Eon out.)

37
00:01:29,079 --> 00:01:33,120
Actually, it looked like
we were only fighting on the show.

38
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,989
Well, you made Kian84 seaweed soup...

39
00:01:34,989 --> 00:01:36,859
- for his birthday.
- Right.

40
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:39,260
It's normal to fight
when you're traveling with friends.

41
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,299
That's true.

42
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:41,359
(I love you, Si Eon.)

43
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,370
Did you also bicker in Bolivia?

44
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,540
We almost got physical in Bolivia.

45
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,269
(Again, I love you, Si Eon.)

46
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:54,209
(They rode motorcycles
on the Route of the Sun as Si Eon wanted.)

47
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:57,250
(They also relaxed in a hot spring.)

48
00:01:57,549 --> 00:01:59,519
(To me, today is the most touching day...)

49
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:00,819
(in Peru.)

50
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,750
(Kian84 bumped into his fans
and had a short meet-and-greet.)

51
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:05,750
(Making a V)

52
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,489
(Thank you!)

53
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:13,829
(They arrived in Puno
after riding for 15 hours.)

54
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,870
(The long ride made everyone exhausted.)

55
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,599
(Si Eon got his energy back
while talking to his wife.)

56
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,569
(Kian had alcohol
to recharge his batteries.)

57
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,610
(They looked for their bus
to cross the border the next day.)

58
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:28,780
(Where is the entrance?)

59
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,780
This is the wrong bus.

60
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,780
(What? It's not our bus?)

61
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,780
(Kian84, this is not our bus.)

62
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:35,990
(It wasn't easy to take off.)

63
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,419
(They finally cross the border
from Peru to Bolivia on foot.)

64
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,530
(The experience was surreal like a movie.)

65
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,789
(After going through immigration,)

66
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,830
(they embarked on a new journey!)

67
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:52,699
(Bolivia)

68
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:54,439
(It's higher and deeper.)

69
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:56,210
(The country with many unique aspects)

70
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:59,810
(From the Death Road
to the Uyuni Salt Flats)

71
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,280
(A prelude to chaos in Bolivia)

72
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,050
It was so rough in Bolivia.

73
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:06,979
- A lot.
- It couldn't be tougher.

74
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,819
(They're on the border between Peru
and Bolivia on the 7th day of the trip.)

75
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,719
(They'll travel for about 15 minutes
to Copacabana.)

76
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,860
(Then they'll take a bus to La Paz.)

77
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,860
(From Copacabana to La Paz)

78
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,330
(Kian84, Si Eon, and Pani Bottle arrived
in Copacabana.)

79
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:23,430
Let's look around the lake.

80
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,729
(They visited Lake Titicaca
before transferring.)

81
00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:26,770
Goodness.

82
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,939
If we had 2 or 3 more hours,
we could try a boat.

83
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:32,069
- It's a shame.
- It's 3,810m above sea level.

84
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:33,580
(They can feel Lake Titicaca up close.)

85
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,550
By the way, it's so stunning.

86
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:38,509
Lake Titicaca.

87
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:41,849
(It looks as beautiful as a beach.)

88
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:43,990
How can there be an ocean
somewhere that high?

89
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:46,219
- It's a lake.
- A lake.

90
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,960
- It does look like an ocean.
- I know. It looks like Naples.

91
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,900
- Have you been to Naples?
- No.

92
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,030
(No.)

93
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,629
What's with you, Seung Hoon?

94
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,300
How do you know
if it looks like Naples, then?

95
00:03:58,599 --> 00:03:59,639
Is there a bathroom?

96
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,870
It'll stop for a bathroom break
in an hour.

97
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,870
Everyone.

98
00:04:05,669 --> 00:04:08,580
We crossed the border to Bolivia.

99
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:14,280
We're on the way to La Paz,
the capital of Bolivia.

100
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:16,289
There it is. The town.

101
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:18,319
- Is that the place?
- Yes. Do you see the town?

102
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,659
Do we take a boat there?

103
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,629
(They arrived at the village with a dock.)

104
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:26,230
(Why are they suddenly getting off?)

105
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:28,029
- Look this way.
- Okay.

106
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:29,769
- There are ships.
- Yes.

107
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,800
We'll load a ship with our bus.

108
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:35,000
This is the place that he said...

109
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,269
we were going to stop on the way.

110
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,709
- That's what they did.
- They transport cars like that?

111
00:04:39,709 --> 00:04:41,980
They're crossing the river.

112
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,449
- On the boat?
- Yes.

113
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,949
(They cross the river on a fast boat.)

114
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,350
I wonder what kind of boat we'll take.

115
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,790
Our bus is on the way over there.

116
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,720
(They checked
if the bus was being transported.)

117
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:57,290
(Now, let's get on the boat ourselves.)

118
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,699
Let me take a photo of you two.

119
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,060
(They take pictures to remember
the moment on the boat.)

120
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:04,430
(This pretty decent picture...)

121
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,430
(was posted.)

122
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:06,800
(Our friendship is about to end.)

123
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,610
(With a shocking tag)

124
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,779
(Anyway, let's go.)

125
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:17,449
The water was so clear.

126
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:18,550
Gosh. The water.

127
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,620
- The color is beautiful.
- How clean it was.

128
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,120
I want to try the water.

129
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,160
(He takes a sip of the lake.)

130
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
(Tasting)

131
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,189
- How does it taste?
- It's good.

132
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:33,500
He should wash his face with the water.

133
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:35,500
(Let me try some too.)

134
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:37,930
It tastes good.

135
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,439
- It's not bad.
- The water tasted different.

136
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,699
Really?

137
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,740
(He passes the water by hand.)

138
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:43,740
(Slurping)

139
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,240
(Is it okay to drink it?)

140
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,480
Is it okay to do it?

141
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:49,750
Is it drinkable?

142
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,250
He says it's okay.

143
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,379
(It was short,)

144
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:59,120
(but it was an unforgettable moment...)

145
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,930
(of riding through
the blue currents of Lake Titicaca.)

146
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,129
(They arrived safely.)

147
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,000
- Kian84, will there be bathrooms?
- What?

148
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,730
Sir, where is the bathroom?

149
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,339
Do you know where it is?

150
00:06:13,339 --> 00:06:14,370
(Bathroom)

151
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,170
There it is.

152
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:19,410
I had to hold it for three hours.

153
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,079
(Wherever he went)

154
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,180
(Pani Bottle, where is the bathroom?)

155
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,779
(He always looked for bathrooms.)

156
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,180
(He's finally satisfied his basic needs.)

157
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,620
(Pleased)

158
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,160
I had a hard time using bathrooms there.

159
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,120
- You know our toilets have seats.
- Yes.

160
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,430
They don't have toilet seats in Bolivia.

161
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,430
- Do they only have toilets?
- Only toilets.

162
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,399
- What about the cover?
- They don't have covers.

163
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,370
- I'm used to it.
- So do you have to stand, then?

164
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,170
I tried squatting.

165
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,300
I didn't sit down.

166
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,439
- My back hurts.
- You'll show us?

167
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,910
I sat like this to do it.

168
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,310
So your butt is floating.

169
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,279
Some people get on the toilet like this...

170
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,480
like we used to do a long time ago.

171
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,449
But when you try it,
the toilet gets shaky.

172
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:03,720
I saw many foreigners leave
after seeing the toilet.

173
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,420
(Not everyone can dare to try it.)

174
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,389
(After a short bathroom break,
they get on the bus again.)

175
00:07:08,589 --> 00:07:11,089
For some reason,
even when I don't eat anything,

176
00:07:11,089 --> 00:07:13,060
I have to go to the bathroom
when I get on a bus for some reason.

177
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,399
- I think it's because I'm nervous.
- You must be anxious.

178
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,399
I'm curious about our destination.

179
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,170
- La Paz?
- La Paz.

180
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:20,439
I'm curious too.

181
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:22,740
The church on top of the hill
is so pretty.

182
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,769
(Church)

183
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,810
That's the prettiest building.

184
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,110
It's so pretty.

185
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,949
(A different scenery from Peru)

186
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,009
The interesting thing
about the buildings here was...

187
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:33,420
that they didn't have windows.

188
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:35,079
Kind of like Seongsu-dong?

189
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:38,490
(Seongsu-dong style unfinished concrete)

190
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:42,389
(Trying to take it all in
before they miss anything)

191
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,459
We were on our way to
the largest city and capital of Bolivia.

192
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:53,300
(They still haven't arrived.)

193
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,839
(Looking at the scenery)

194
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,980
Hey, Kian84.

195
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,779
- What? What's there?
- It's permanent snow.

196
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:05,680
- Over there.
- Oh, my.

197
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,750
(Permanent snow stretched out
before their eyes)

198
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,680
Gosh. That's crazy.

199
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,189
Look over there, Pani Bottle.
It's permanent snow.

200
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,790
- Gosh. Over there?
- There's more over there as well.

201
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,360
(It looks like a painting.)

202
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,860
What mountain is that, Pani Bottle?

203
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:19,290
- I'm not sure about that.
- A scenic mountain?

204
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,060
A cool mountain.

205
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,529
(Standing tall)

206
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:26,470
The altitude must be very high over there.

207
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:29,100
If where we are now
is about 3,500m above sea level,

208
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,670
how high is it over there?

209
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,870
It must be over 5,000m.

210
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,139
How high was that? About 6,000m?

211
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,879
- It's 6,000m?
- It was 6,000m.

212
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:38,350
Where we were was 3,800m.

213
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,120
- That's 6,000m?
- Yes.

214
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:41,679
That's so cool.

215
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,820
(I didn't think
we'd see this with our own eyes.)

216
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,899
(They almost arrive at La Paz
after driving for about 3 hours.)

217
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:55,659
This is like
the Gyeonggi Province of Bolivia.

218
00:08:55,759 --> 00:08:57,570
La Paz, the capital, is just up ahead.

219
00:08:58,299 --> 00:09:01,600
(They approach the city center.)

220
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,539
(Gasp)

221
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:06,779
Look at the scenery.

222
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:08,940
- Gosh.
- What is this?

223
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:14,720
(They can see the whole of La Paz.)

224
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,519
(Impressed)

225
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:19,250
Gosh. What is that?

226
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,090
(The city that touches the sky)

227
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,389
La Paz is the highest capital
in the world.

228
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:24,889
- Really?
- Yes.

229
00:09:24,889 --> 00:09:26,190
The highest capital.

230
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,330
That's crazy.

231
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,330
- How high was it?
- It was 3,600m.

232
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,600
(A city 3,600m above sea level
with a roof made of clouds)

233
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,970
Look at all of the buildings.

234
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,600
- It's so packed.
- Really.

235
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,970
(A magnificent view
both during the day and night)

236
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,879
(Their jaws drop
at a scene they've never seen before.)

237
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,139
(Oh, my.)

238
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:44,450
What a magnificent view.
Look at the permanent snow behind it.

239
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:47,419
Gosh.

240
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,750
- Oh, my.
- What is that?

241
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,690
- There are wild animals as well.
- That's right.

242
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,590
It's even better than the Han River view.

243
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,690
(Do Yeon gets her notepad out to explain.)

244
00:09:58,889 --> 00:09:59,960
(Looking around)

245
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,299
Wait a second.

246
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,860
- Do Yeon.
- Yes?

247
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,870
Looking at this makes me
very curious about La Paz.

248
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,700
- You're just in luck.
- Right.

249
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,700
- "You're just in luck."
- Since you're curious, I'll tell you.

250
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,240
La Paz is
the administrative capital of Bolivia,

251
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,340
with about 2.9 million residents.
This is a quarter of Bolivia's population.

252
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:17,679
Because it's the capital
with the highest altitude in the world,

253
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,279
it's called
the first capital under the sky...

254
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,750
or the capital
closest to the sky and stars.

255
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,490
- My curiosity has been quenched.
- Yes.

256
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,320
(Fascinated)

257
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:30,490
This is crazy.
I want to take pictures too.

258
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:32,960
(The best spot)

259
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,830
We should've sat on that side.

260
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,730
(Surprised beyond words)

261
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,200
It's my third time here,
but I'm still in awe.

262
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,500
It's so fascinating...

263
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,470
that there's such a large city
in the mountains.

264
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,470
- Are those clouds?
- Clouds.

265
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:47,379
How magical.

266
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,480
I don't think this kind of view
can be seen outside of South America.

267
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,049
Right? Definitely.

268
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:53,720
Was that a cable car that passed above?

269
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,519
- Yes, it was a cable car.
- A cable car.

270
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:57,419
They have cable cars
as a method of public transportation.

271
00:10:57,419 --> 00:10:58,789
- Cable cars?
- Yes.

272
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,559
(Like the subway, cable cars
connect the city with various lines.)

273
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:04,889
(Going to and from work in cable cars)

274
00:11:05,559 --> 00:11:06,799
(Fascinated)

275
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,600
It's so interesting that cable cars
are a mode of public transportation.

276
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,669
Right. It's so interesting.

277
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:14,399
- It's like the subway.
- Yes.

278
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:17,740
How exotic.

279
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:20,279
I've never seen this kind of scenery
in my life.

280
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:23,850
(Compared to the cable cars
that shoot straight forward)

281
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:26,350
I can see there are no traffic lights
with one look.

282
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,950
There are no marked lanes,

283
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,019
and the roads are narrow.

284
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:30,389
There's nothing there. Really.

285
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:32,019
A cable car.

286
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:35,320
Honestly, I want to ride that into La Paz.

287
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,289
- That...
- That's really fast.

288
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:40,000
I think riding that would be faster
than riding the bus.

289
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,029
- They say we can go in that.
- Really?

290
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:44,600
That bus has some dents in it.

291
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:46,330
(The bus is missing its jaw.)

292
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,970
- What? What happened to the front?
- The front is missing.

293
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,210
Look at the bus.

294
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,210
(He can't believe his own eyes.)

295
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:55,110
- You see that van over there, right?
- Yes.

296
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,049
That car
is a mode of public transportation here.

297
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,409
Oh, over there? I see.

298
00:11:58,409 --> 00:11:59,820
The stops are written on the front.

299
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:01,149
- I see.
- Number 600. It also has numbers.

300
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:03,549
Are those kinds of buses...

301
00:12:03,549 --> 00:12:05,289
like local buses?

302
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:06,350
Colectivo. Right.

303
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,289
It means
they collect people and go together.

304
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,360
Why are there so many cars?

305
00:12:11,789 --> 00:12:12,889
(Packed)

306
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:14,960
(Honk)

307
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,299
First, the car exhaust...

308
00:12:17,299 --> 00:12:21,100
is almost as bad
as the exhaust in Iquitos.

309
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,200
(Honk)

310
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,909
(Honk)

311
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,509
Oh, the car horns.

312
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,940
They say
the traffic in the capital isn't good.

313
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:31,309
We're going about 18km...

314
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,519
right now,

315
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:36,179
- and it's taking almost one hour.
- That truck...

316
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:37,850
- must be just stopped.
- Right.

317
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,889
The traffic is terrible.

318
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,690
The driver keeps honking
because he's angry, right?

319
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,730
A lot of people were angry.

320
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,129
Also, all of the drivers have one arm out.

321
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,399
- They keep pointing and yelling.
- I see.

322
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,269
It's crazy right now.

323
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:52,529
Doing that won't solve anything.

324
00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:54,669
It won't solve anything. Can you see?

325
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:56,610
I don't think the honking...

326
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,370
is aimed at one car, necessarily.

327
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:02,840
It's absolute chaos.

328
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,009
- It's the worst.
- Gosh.

329
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:06,679
This is how it feels right now.

330
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,679
I am Bolivia!

331
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,659
(Welcome to terrible traffic.)

332
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,120
There's no letting anyone through.

333
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,529
(Cutting in)

334
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,190
Don't they get into accidents?

335
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,429
That's very interesting.

336
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:22,360
(Bolivia's traffic jam never ends.)

337
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,830
(Losing it)

338
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,700
We're not moving at all.

339
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:29,139
If there's a small fender bender,

340
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,070
- they just go.
- I can see that.

341
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,809
Like the bus with the missing front bumper
from earlier.

342
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:34,340
I can see that from the bus
with the missing front bumper.

343
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,309
I can see from this that Bolivia
is going to be very dynamic.

344
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,850
That man is on top of the car.

345
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,049
Why is he on there?

346
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,750
Really.

347
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,759
Why are you backing into me?

348
00:13:46,889 --> 00:13:49,789
(He's obviously swearing.)

349
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:51,360
He just swore.

350
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
The driver is angry.

351
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,169
The driver of that van is angry as well.

352
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,340
It must've been because of that white car.

353
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,100
That car is impressive.

354
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,139
Look at his courage.

355
00:14:04,309 --> 00:14:07,379
Basically, all of the drivers are angry,

356
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:08,909
and they swear while they drive.

357
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,080
(Cutting in)

358
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,679
- Oh, look at that.
- It's above there.

359
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:14,750
Can you see?

360
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,320
I think the intersections are the issue.

361
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,289
I'm going to turn left.
I'm going to go straight.

362
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,690
The cars don't get out of the way.

363
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,929
- I don't think there are traffic lights.
- I don't think there are traffic lights.

364
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:25,029
- There are...
- There are some.

365
00:14:25,029 --> 00:14:26,230
- some traffic lights.
- They're hanging there.

366
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:27,960
It feels like the traffic lights
will fall off soon.

367
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,799
- The traffic lights up there.
- They're swinging right now.

368
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:31,870
This place...

369
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,870
will really infuriate drivers.

370
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:38,340
To tell you the truth, the city itself...

371
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,139
feels very unfamiliar.

372
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,480
(Honk)

373
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,950
It's because Bolivia, as a country,

374
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:50,889
had GDP growth of minus eight percent.

375
00:14:51,419 --> 00:14:55,289
It's already a poor country.

376
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:58,490
For it to have grown
by minus eight percent from there...

377
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,700
is really... Gosh.

378
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:05,870
I'm so curious
how the residents of La Paz live.

379
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:07,970
I want to see too.

380
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,009
- What?
- Are you happy?

381
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,110
I don't think being rich
makes you happy though.

382
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,440
That's true.

383
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,009
Honestly, the people here
could have higher rates of happiness.

384
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:19,350
I'm sure there are people
who live happily with their families...

385
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:22,350
by fishing at Lake Titicaca.

386
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,149
Being with people you love,

387
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:27,990
getting to eat with them
and living safely and soundly with them...

388
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:29,759
is what happiness is.

389
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:32,559
Having millions of dollars in a safe
doesn't make you happy.

390
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:33,860
Actually, will that make you happy?

391
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,429
- It could.
- That could make you happy in some way.

392
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,669
- Happiness has many different forms.
- That's true.

393
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,440
I'd be happy
as long as I have a toilet seat cover.

394
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,539
Exactly. You can be happy
as long as you have a toilet seat cover.

395
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:44,440
- Honestly, I...
- That doesn't take a lot of money.

396
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,870
feel so anxious right now.

397
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,409
- I'm nervous about the toilet seat cover.
- Really.

398
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:51,950
I'm sure
there are a lot of people like me.

399
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,450
I'm so stressed about whether or not
there will be a toilet seat cover.

400
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,590
Every time you go into a bathroom?

401
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,690
Yes. I get worried for no reason.

402
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:02,559
What if I have to go to the bathroom
on the way somewhere?

403
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,460
What if there's no toilet seat cover?

404
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,659
What if I don't have any coins?

405
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:07,799
Worries make more worries.

406
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:10,429
Are there people who carry
their own toilet seat covers?

407
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:13,500
I said that, actually. We should carry
toilet seat covers on our bags.

408
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,700
Right. There are those...

409
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,940
- What? Neck pillows?
- neck pillows. Right.

410
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,870
A toilet seat cover? That's a good idea.

411
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,309
That's a pretty good idea.

412
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:26,950
(They head towards the city center
while talking about happiness.)

413
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,190
(The bus suddenly stops.)

414
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,990
- Why did it suddenly stop?
- Because the traffic was backed up.

415
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,590
(A completely jam-packed road)

416
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,789
This is insane.

417
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:39,590
- Why is it so backed up?
- This traffic jam is ridiculous.

418
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,860
We're almost there.

419
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:44,169
(They come to a stop
with only 5km left to go.)

420
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,899
(The drivers are frustrated as well.)

421
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,440
(People get off one by one.)

422
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:59,580
(The bus is stopped in the middle
of the road with nowhere to go.)

423
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,549
(Deep sigh)

424
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,120
Gosh. The traffic is ridiculous.

425
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,820
I want to break the window and get out.

426
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:12,960
(Me too.)

427
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,829
This is way too much.

428
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:17,599
The traffic jam was...

429
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,440
insane.

430
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,269
I always travel from Seoul to Busan.

431
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,769
I've never seen such a bad traffic jam.

432
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,710
(It's not easy.)

433
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,049
I get what you mean.

434
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,950
I was a bit worried for them.

435
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:37,289
You went there for a trip,
so you felt it for a while.

436
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,890
But if they experience it every day,

437
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,460
- it will be really hard for them.
- It must be hard.

438
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,359
- They must be used to it,
- Exactly.

439
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,829
since it's their daily life.

440
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,029
Should we just get off and walk?

441
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,700
I know, right?

442
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,440
This is horrible.

443
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,869
(Walking might be faster.)

444
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,710
There are a lot of lodgings.

445
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,839
We can get off and look for one
as we walk.

446
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,240
- Yes.
- That might be better, right?

447
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,549
It's faster to get off now.

448
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,480
We can't go like this.

449
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,450
(This won't do.)

450
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,859
They're getting off too.
Are they going to a bathroom?

451
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,789
Walking might be faster.

452
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,059
We should get off.

453
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,200
I think it's better to get off.

454
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,329
- Let's get off.
- Okay.

455
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,170
Walking might be faster.

456
00:18:24,829 --> 00:18:28,000
(In the end,
they decide to get off and walk.)

457
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,200
Hello.

458
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:31,069
Guys.

459
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:33,210
- The traffic is...
- What's this?

460
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,440
Seriously, it's...

461
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,509
I shouldn't swear.

462
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,549
The car was stuck in one place
for about 30 to 40 minutes.

463
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,289
I feel stressed just looking at it.

464
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:47,359
How long of a drive was left
when you got off?

465
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:50,329
We were supposed to arrive
at the destination after seven hours,

466
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,359
but ten hours had already passed.

467
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:55,460
It was delayed for three hours,
and we still didn't arrive.

468
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,029
We want to get our bags.

469
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:00,369
(He gets their bags
instead of the others who are out of it.)

470
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:01,569
There they are.

471
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,640
- What about our bags?
- Put your bags in.

472
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
- It's better to put your bags in later.
- That's a great tip.

473
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,740
Pani Bottle.

474
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,480
He even expected that.

475
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,079
He's never wrong.

476
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:13,109
(A wordplay on his name)

477
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,480
Thankfully, the driver let us down,
so we're going to walk from here.

478
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,220
La Paz has terrible traffic.

479
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:22,589
At first,
they said we would arrive in three hours.

480
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:25,789
Now, it's been four hours,
and we still haven't arrived.

481
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,930
Should we walk and find a close lodging?

482
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,960
Yes, let's do that.

483
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,269
- That might be better, right?
- Yes.

484
00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:32,869
- Shall we get going?
- Yes.

485
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:36,240
(They walk downtown
where the lodgings are.)

486
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,640
Why is it congested?

487
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,380
I want to see what happened up front.

488
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:43,009
(What is it like
in front of the traffic jam?)

489
00:19:43,009 --> 00:19:44,910
Right, you always want to find out.

490
00:19:45,549 --> 00:19:47,779
Some people are fighting with their pride.

491
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,920
I'm sick of it. They shouldn't do that.

492
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:51,950
What's this? How long is the line?

493
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:54,220
Something must've happened up front.

494
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:58,259
(The traffic jam with no end)

495
00:19:59,089 --> 00:20:00,500
(This is not a car park.)

496
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,529
What's this?

497
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,200
No wonder cable cars pass by above.

498
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,140
(In front is a crossroad.)

499
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,079
Gosh, the exhaust gas is terrible.

500
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:16,539
It's good that you got off.

501
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:19,650
How long has it been
since it was abandoned, I wonder?

502
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,720
The cars are left neglected on the road.

503
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,250
The cars have been left neglected
for a long time.

504
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,990
That's why the traffic here...

505
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,759
becomes even more jammed
when the road is already narrow.

506
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,200
I think it will be slightly better
if they tow the old cars away.

507
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,930
If they get rid of the abandoned cars,
the road will get wider.

508
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,200
- They won't.
- Why don't they?

509
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,299
It was horrible.

510
00:20:43,769 --> 00:20:45,470
This the cause.

511
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,480
- Something's here?
- The three-way intersection.

512
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,339
I think this is the cause.

513
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:51,250
From three sides...

514
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,880
What's this?

515
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,279
- This is the problematic part.
- That's insane.

516
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:55,750
"I can't back off."

517
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,349
The drivers of Bolivia...

518
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:00,390
They just stick the hood in first.

519
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,359
There's no reversing in Bolivia.

520
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,329
- When you think about it...
- They only drive forward.

521
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:06,359
They might be staying like that even now.

522
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,299
- Even until now.
- Yes.

523
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,299
From three directions,
and there's nobody controlling it.

524
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,670
The drivers at the crossroad are...

525
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:18,539
extremely mad.

526
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,109
For now,
I think we are out of the worst of it.

527
00:21:21,109 --> 00:21:22,109
Yes.

528
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:23,980
It was an intense experience.

529
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,880
Now, we can talk.

530
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,619
It was the worst.

531
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,920
I think this town has the worst air.

532
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,759
The city was built on a mountain,
so they're all uphills and downhills.

533
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,160
There's no flat ground.

534
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:38,630
There were a lot of flat grounds
on the way here.

535
00:21:39,289 --> 00:21:41,460
Why did they build a city here
instead of the flat ground?

536
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,130
- You're right.
- Right?

537
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:44,569
Why didn't they build it on a flat ground?

538
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,500
I looked it up,

539
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,539
and there is a lot of lime
and silver here.

540
00:21:50,539 --> 00:21:52,170
They must've started as a mine.

541
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:55,210
Yes. The city must've grown from a mine.

542
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,609
Then it makes sense.

543
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:59,579
I gave it a thought
as I looked at this city.

544
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:02,519
Here's a tip to the mayor of La Paz.

545
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,049
The city has mountains
as tall as 6,000m above sea level...

546
00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:10,059
covered in perpetual snow.

547
00:22:10,759 --> 00:22:12,990
Since this is a cold city,

548
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,630
make them go up in lifts,

549
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,869
and make the way down like a ski resort.

550
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:20,000
So they go to work in lifts...

551
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,869
and ski back home.

552
00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:25,869
I think I read that story
from Kian84's webtoon.

553
00:22:26,339 --> 00:22:28,910
All the skiers
around the world will gather...

554
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,339
and vitalize your tourism industry.

555
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:33,009
It might help with your traffic.

556
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,420
It makes me think of various ways.

557
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,089
It's a playground.

558
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:41,190
It's a traffic chaos right beside,

559
00:22:41,589 --> 00:22:43,359
but here, they're being lovey-dovey.

560
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:46,130
There are couples on the playground.

561
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,460
People of this country...

562
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,529
date a lot on playgrounds.

563
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:50,970
Pani Bottle.

564
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,230
I need to pee.

565
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,200
Suddenly?

566
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,609
Look at him grabbing Pani Bottle's pinkie.

567
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,309
Pani Bottle, lead the way.

568
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:01,940
This bag is heavier than I thought.

569
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,880
They are holding hands.

570
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,720
When did you guys become so close?

571
00:23:09,319 --> 00:23:12,289
Pani Bottle, did we walk about 20 minutes?
Do we need to walk for another 20 minutes?

572
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:14,589
Twenty is not possible.
It might take another forty minutes.

573
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:16,690
- What?
- I'm fine with it.

574
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,759
- I'm fine with walking too,
- Forty minutes are fine.

575
00:23:19,089 --> 00:23:20,390
but can I go to the bathroom first?

576
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,930
Let's stop by a bathroom on the way.

577
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,829
Did he go to South America to poop?

578
00:23:24,829 --> 00:23:26,869
(Did he go to South America to poop?)

579
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:30,940
Since before, you had a weak prostate.

580
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,740
(Nodding)

581
00:23:33,069 --> 00:23:34,440
Let's go.

582
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,779
(They look for a bathroom
for the man with a weak prostate.)

583
00:23:35,779 --> 00:23:37,309
Turn right here.

584
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:40,180
We need to go over there.

585
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,319
(They walk...)

586
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,880
Turn right at the forked road.

587
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,990
(and walk...)

588
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:45,250
- Shall we go down here?
- Okay.

589
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,789
(and walk.)

590
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,089
(But they cannot find a bathroom.)

591
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,160
If you go to a cafe...

592
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,930
We didn't see a cafe.

593
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,059
- Can't you look it up...
- Exactly.

594
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:57,930
on Google Map?

595
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:58,970
There was none.

596
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,839
Forget everything, let me pee.

597
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:03,839
Okay.

598
00:24:04,269 --> 00:24:05,869
I'm getting the signal too.

599
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,309
Si Eon's sphincter is going to burst.

600
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:10,039
No, it's my prostate.

601
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:14,220
I need to pee now.

602
00:24:16,049 --> 00:24:18,519
Hey, there's a gas station.

603
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,720
Yes, there's a bathroom in a gas station
in Korea.

604
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,890
It's a must.

605
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:24,259
Excuse me. Is there a bathroom?

606
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:26,630
(There is a bathroom!)

607
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,660
Thank goodness.

608
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,660
Where?

609
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,170
(They head to the direction she pointed.)

610
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,269
Is that it?

611
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:34,299
How far is the lodging?

612
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:35,799
- Quite far.
- About 15 minutes walk.

613
00:24:35,799 --> 00:24:37,170
- Fifteen minutes?
- About ten to fifteen minutes.

614
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:39,039
- Shall we walk a bit further?
- Let's go.

615
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,269
Okay.

616
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,680
I don't think this is it. What's this?

617
00:24:43,339 --> 00:24:45,680
How long have I been holding in my pee?

618
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,420
We held it in for about four hours.

619
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,650
Yes, for four hours.

620
00:24:51,089 --> 00:24:54,619
We're slowly approaching
the downtown of La Paz.

621
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:56,289
Goodness.

622
00:24:56,619 --> 00:24:59,029
(He's close to losing his consciousness.)

623
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,730
(Surprised)

624
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,599
If you're in a rush, buy bread here...

625
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:04,069
- Yes, let's buy some bread.
- and use the bathroom.

626
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,200
Good.

627
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,529
It's a coffee shop.

628
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:07,539
(Good idea)

629
00:25:07,769 --> 00:25:10,569
Can we use the bathroom?

630
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:12,670
Instead, we'll buy bread.

631
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:15,180
(Can we use the bathroom?
Instead, we'll buy bread.)

632
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,309
Thank you.

633
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,609
Thank you.

634
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,880
Thank you.

635
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:25,250
Without Pani Bottle...

636
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,549
(Shaking his head)

637
00:25:27,049 --> 00:25:28,619
(They found peace thanks to Pani Bottle.)

638
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:29,759
It's nice.

639
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,859
It looks delicious.

640
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:34,730
(They eat the bread that came along
with buying the bathroom.)

641
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:37,269
Let's go quickly. The sun is about to set.

642
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,400
Let's go.

643
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,039
You didn't book the lodging beforehand
as well, right?

644
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,099
That's right, we're looking for it now.

645
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,140
I don't know exactly where it is,
but let's go.

646
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,279
(Thankfully,
it's at the entrance of downtown,)

647
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,339
(so they should find it easily.)

648
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,779
- Puno was nice.
- Right.

649
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:53,779
(Looking around)

650
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,079
(Where is it?)

651
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:57,119
Si Eon.

652
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,250
You're going to a three-star lodging,
right?

653
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,859
It's not about 3 or 4 stars.

654
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:03,319
- Let's go somewhere nearby.
- Somewhere nearby.

655
00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:05,829
We walked for a very long time.

656
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:07,700
We were tired,
so we decided to go anywhere nearby.

657
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,160
You should just go in anywhere.

658
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,869
That "Sayari" place.

659
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,630
(They find a hotel signboard
right in front.)

660
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,940
If we consider too many things,
we won't be able to decide on a place.

661
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:17,970
No, we need to consider one thing.

662
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,740
- Laundry.
- And a bathroom.

663
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,240
How many stars does it have?

664
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,440
It's a two-star hotel.

665
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:25,210
It has stars.

666
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,609
- Is this it?
- Here it is.

667
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:29,950
It's a 3-star hotel.
Why does this have 2 but there's 3 inside?

668
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:31,950
- Why...
- It has one more star.

669
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:33,619
(The hotel is weak on the outside
but strong on the inside.)

670
00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:34,619
What's this?

671
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:38,960
Thirty people... One room.

672
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:40,329
Thirty people?

673
00:26:40,329 --> 00:26:41,799
(Thirty people?)

674
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,529
(That's like an army training center.)

675
00:26:43,529 --> 00:26:45,299
- If there are 30 people...
- That's too many people.

676
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:47,599
in one room,
doesn't it mean they have to stand?

677
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:49,740
- Thirty people...
- Thirty people almost slept in a room.

678
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,269
Even Hotel Shilla will hate that.

679
00:26:53,369 --> 00:26:54,779
They'll say they give up.

680
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:58,279
(He confidently asks for 1 room
for 30 people.)

681
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,279
(What is he saying?)

682
00:27:00,279 --> 00:27:01,680
Is that why she looked so sour?

683
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,319
- She said something to me.
- We didn't know.

684
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,720
Ask about cleaning first.

685
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,990
- Sorry?
- Laundry.

686
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,460
Cleaning clothes...

687
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,160
This clothes cleaning?

688
00:27:12,859 --> 00:27:14,599
I even asked her to wash my clothes.

689
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,029
No wonder they don't like it.

690
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:18,329
We need to go somewhere else
for the laundry.

691
00:27:18,329 --> 00:27:19,730
So they don't do it here.

692
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:21,839
Let's go somewhere else.

693
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,609
The problem is,
we need to do the laundry quickly.

694
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:26,970
We must do it.

695
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,039
- There was one near here.
- Okay.

696
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,309
We're not in a hurry.

697
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:31,349
(In the end, they go somewhere else.)

698
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:32,480
I don't regret it.

699
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,750
This looks like downtown.

700
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,359
Pani Bottle, things look good from here.

701
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,630
The Witches' Market must be famous.

702
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:46,190
It's like Garosugil.

703
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,599
- It's Bolisugil.
- Bolisugil.

704
00:27:48,599 --> 00:27:50,230
- He said Bolisugil.
- Bolisugil.

705
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:52,029
I'm so curious.
Why is it called the Witches' Market?

706
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,740
It sells the ingredients sorcerers use
to tell your fortune.

707
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,109
In the market,

708
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,569
there are dried llamas.

709
00:27:59,569 --> 00:28:01,380
- Dried llamas?
- Llamas?

710
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,779
- There are embryos.
- Embryos?

711
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:04,750
They believe...

712
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,609
that if you bury dried llama embryo
in the yard...

713
00:28:06,609 --> 00:28:08,450
when you build a new house,
it will bring you luck.

714
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:11,619
Do they bury it
every time they build a new house?

715
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:12,990
It's like the pig's head in Korea.

716
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,160
- We pray with a pig's head.
- Pig's head.

717
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,460
- It must be similar.
- You're right.

718
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:18,990
It's like a superstition.

719
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:21,500
- A lot of tourists seem to come here.
- Really?

720
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,869
You really didn't go
because it was famous.

721
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,769
(Touring without looking)

722
00:28:26,769 --> 00:28:27,769
How cool.

723
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:29,140
There are Generation MZs here.

724
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,700
- It's nice here.
- Right.

725
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,039
MZ.

726
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,279
(La Paz's Generation MZs prove
that this is a popular place.)

727
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,680
(Glancing)

728
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,309
- This...
- It looks similar to this.

729
00:28:37,309 --> 00:28:39,509
- It looks good too.
- "Inca's Room."

730
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:40,579
(They find a hotel.)

731
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:41,980
Do you speak English?

732
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:45,289
There are 3 of us,
and we need 1 or 2 rooms.

733
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:48,720
And do you provide laundry service?

734
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,289
He's good.

735
00:28:50,289 --> 00:28:51,390
(Pani translator shines.)

736
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,130
It's 10 bolivianos for 1kg.

737
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,829
- For laundry?
- It's cheap.

738
00:28:54,829 --> 00:28:56,299
- It's cheap.
- Shouldn't we check the room?

739
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,329
Can we check the room?

740
00:29:00,329 --> 00:29:01,799
How many?

741
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:03,940
- Three.
- Three.

742
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:08,680
(Unlike Kian84,
he mentions the correct number of people.)

743
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:12,549
You're so cool.
You're so sexy when you speak Spanish.

744
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:14,779
You have a sexy brain.

745
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:16,380
- He's cool.
- Exactly.

746
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,319
- He's reliable.
- He's a professional.

747
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,720
If the room looks fine,
I'm going in straight away.

748
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,390
There are four beds?

749
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:27,359
There are so many beds.

750
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:28,500
(Big and clean room with 4 beds)

751
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,900
Let's check in here.

752
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,599
I personally think...

753
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,039
this place will have a cheap lodging fee.

754
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,539
For today, should we get one room each?

755
00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:39,009
Yes, one room each.

756
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:40,039
I'm fine with anything.

757
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:41,509
I can sleep together or separate.
Either way is fine.

758
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:43,880
Pani Bottle, you...

759
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,880
(Hesitating)

760
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,920
You turn into a tank at night.

761
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,049
I normally don't do that.

762
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:54,960
(But the night before,
as soon as he fell asleep,)

763
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,390
(he snored throughout the night.)

764
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:58,890
He's loud.

765
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:00,589
He must've been very tired.

766
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:03,430
(Si Eon wakes up and tosses around.)

767
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:06,400
(Kian84 who couldn't sleep due to
altitude sickness tries to wake him up.)

768
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:08,740
(Snoring)

769
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,970
He was like the cock of the Amazon.

770
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,710
(Like the cock of the Amazon)

771
00:30:15,009 --> 00:30:16,809
- Three rooms?
- Let's get three rooms today.

772
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:18,609
- We've decided. Let's go.
- Okay.

773
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:25,450
Good, give us three rooms.

774
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,390
- Three?
- Three rooms, yes.

775
00:30:28,589 --> 00:30:30,019
(One each)

776
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,460
(He waits for the check-in.)

777
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,529
What?

778
00:30:36,829 --> 00:30:38,970
No room?

779
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,170
Yes.

780
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,470
We can't do that.

781
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,039
- Why?
- That's the only room left.

782
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:48,079
They must have three rooms.
Why won't they have them?

783
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,309
I think she's not giving them to us
on purpose.

784
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:52,309
- I want to sleep separately.
- Yes.

785
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,220
One room each, no?

786
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:57,549
Did she not want to rent the rooms to us?

787
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,859
(But after a while,)

788
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,660
(they suddenly have rooms?)

789
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,130
Why do they have rooms now
when they didn't just now?

790
00:31:06,289 --> 00:31:10,430
(She meant they didn't have a room
for 1 person.)

791
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,630
They had three rooms in that size.

792
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,970
Not a room with one bed.

793
00:31:14,029 --> 00:31:15,369
She was a kind person.

794
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:16,500
(They almost misunderstood her.)

795
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:19,369
Even if we ask her why,
we won't be able to understand.

796
00:31:19,369 --> 00:31:21,480
- What do you think? Should we just sleep?
- I don't mind.

797
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,880
- I don't mind either.
- Let's just sleep.

798
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,980
(He checks the laundry service again.)

799
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:28,579
Let's go.

800
00:31:28,579 --> 00:31:29,920
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

801
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,920
I'm so glad you got the lodging.

802
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:34,390
(After 10 hours since leaving Puno,
they finally enter a lodging in La Paz.)

803
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,559
- It's a witch.
- A witch.

804
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:37,420
(After 10 hours since leaving Puno,
they finally enter a lodging in La Paz.)

805
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,259
(Current time 6:05 p.m.)

806
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:41,559
- The night view is amazing.
- At night...

807
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,000
(Current time 6:05 p.m.)

808
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,130
We're in La Paz...

809
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,470
at night.

810
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:53,069
This is a wine shop.

811
00:31:53,069 --> 00:31:54,170
There's beer too.

812
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,079
But Si Eon, I have rum...

813
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:58,180
from yesterday.

814
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,210
You don't want beer?

815
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,779
Then...

816
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,450
They're Bolivian beers.

817
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:05,119
These are Bolivian beers.

818
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:07,289
- Let's buy six cans.
- Don't we need to buy water too?

819
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:09,119
(Six cans of Bolivian beers
cost 72 bolivianos in total,)

820
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:10,859
(which is about 13.20 dollars.)

821
00:32:10,859 --> 00:32:11,890
Thank you.

822
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,190
- Let's go in and eat fruit.
- Okay.

823
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:15,529
(Next shopping is fruit.)

824
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:18,369
Shouldn't we buy two bundles of bananas?

825
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,430
One won't be enough.

826
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,500
I...

827
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:24,200
I want to try fruit I didn't try before.

828
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,039
What are they?

829
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,779
What are they?

830
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,210
- They're apple mango.
- Mango?

831
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:34,579
Really?

832
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:35,680
Mango.

833
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,819
They just sell it on the floor like that?

834
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:40,490
It's really cheap there.

835
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,720
How much?

836
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,859
"Ocho?"

837
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:48,529
- "Ocho?" Eight.
- "Ocho" is eight.

838
00:32:49,059 --> 00:32:51,200
No, all together.

839
00:32:51,829 --> 00:32:53,829
Inca's Room.

840
00:32:53,829 --> 00:32:55,099
(They come back to the lodging
with both their hands heavy.)

841
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:57,940
Is the seed big?

842
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,069
It's quite big.

843
00:33:00,369 --> 00:33:01,839
Why is it big?

844
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:02,980
Is this the one?

845
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,609
(Taking a bite)

846
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,150
Everyone gets one anyway.

847
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:08,279
- It's delicious.
- Is it?

848
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,779
(The city man who shies away
from unfamiliar stuff)

849
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:13,420
South America...

850
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,990
has good sunlight but little rain,
so the fruit must taste good.

851
00:33:17,289 --> 00:33:18,789
Fruit tastes good
when there's little rain.

852
00:33:18,829 --> 00:33:20,190
- Is that so?
- Yes.

853
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,730
Do they become less sweet
if they absorb too much water?

854
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,799
Yes.

855
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:25,200
(Seven bites)

856
00:33:25,529 --> 00:33:28,599
So when it rains heavily...

857
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:29,799
(He even eats the pulp on the skin.)

858
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:30,869
It's so good.

859
00:33:30,869 --> 00:33:32,410
- Is it incomparable?
- It's beyond your imagination.

860
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:34,109
How does it feel?

861
00:33:34,109 --> 00:33:35,180
This is what I think.

862
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,309
They have strong sunlight,

863
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:39,210
so photosynthesis is done really well.

864
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,710
But it doesn't rain much.

865
00:33:40,809 --> 00:33:44,279
So they have a lot of sugar
in their bodies.

866
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,019
- It's concentrated.
- It's concentrated.

867
00:33:47,089 --> 00:33:50,119
(Everyone sits on the floor
and inhales the fruit.)

868
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,190
(Everyone's become like Kian84.)

869
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,900
Everyone's eating on the floor
like Kian84.

870
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,559
(Everyone's become like Kian84.)

871
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:00,329
(He even eats the pulp of apple mango
on the seed.)

872
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,470
See you later.

873
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,240
Let's go.

874
00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:09,140
This is Bolivia.

875
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:11,210
- You went out alone?
- Yes.

876
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:13,849
I slept too much in the bus,

877
00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:16,480
so it felt like a pity to sleep.

878
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,480
- Right.
- I bet.

879
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:20,389
I want to exercise.

880
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,460
My body feels like it's rotting.

881
00:34:25,289 --> 00:34:29,030
On the way here, I saw a gym.

882
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:32,429
(When they were looking for a lodging
in the afternoon,)

883
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:33,599
A gym.

884
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:37,139
(they saw a local gym.)

885
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:40,440
It's modernized here.

886
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:44,010
It feels like Galleria Department Store
in Bolivia.

887
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:47,179
It's my first time
in a South American gym.

888
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:49,619
So I'm looking forward to it a lot.

889
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,989
Since it's 30 bolivianos, for 1 day,

890
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,219
it costs about six dollars.

891
00:34:57,829 --> 00:35:00,059
- Look at that.
- Gosh.

892
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:01,630
- It's the same.
- It looks nice.

893
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,960
It's equipped well.

894
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,929
- People are working out.
- Of course.

895
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,199
Bolivia had muscular men too.

896
00:35:08,469 --> 00:35:10,539
(Let's get started.)

897
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:13,110
(He just takes off his jacket
and starts exercising like that.)

898
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,170
You're amazing.

899
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:18,010
(He runs lightly.)

900
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,250
(Shaking his head)

901
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,980
He's in a high mountain.

902
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,150
He would be in a poor condition
even if he stays still.

903
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,789
I can't imagine that.

904
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:28,190
Running on a treadmill
4,000m above sea level.

905
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,190
You have workout equipment in your studio.

906
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:32,030
- That's not 4,000m above sea level.
- That's not 4,000m above sea level.

907
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,360
That's a basement.

908
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:36,429
(I see.)

909
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:42,070
(While Kian84 dreams of becoming
a Bolivian muscle man...)

910
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,570
(Snoring)

911
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,309
- He was tired.
- And he said he didn't snore.

912
00:35:48,309 --> 00:35:49,309
(Pani Bottle transforms into a tank.)

913
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,610
(Bragging Pani Bottle
who doesn't snore...)

914
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:56,179
(sleeps deeply while snoring.)

915
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:57,750
(The Choi Soo Jong of Sangdo-dong
video calls his wife.)

916
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,219
- I'm the Choi Soo Jong of Sangdo-dong.
- The Choi Soo Jong of Sangdo-dong.

917
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:04,760
(As soon as she picks up,
he shares the night view of La Paz.)

918
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,059
My goodness.

919
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:07,190
"Honey, can you see?"

920
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,829
How is it?

921
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:12,130
"How is it?"

922
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:14,099
Today, each of us got a room.

923
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
(He immediately gives her
an online room tour.)

924
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,340
It's nice.

925
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,539
It is.

926
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,010
Okay, my love. Have fun.

927
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:25,179
(Shy)

928
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:28,619
(Pouting)

929
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:32,219
(Crying)

930
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:34,219
- What is this? Goodness.
- Oh, my.

931
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,889
My goodness.

932
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,829
Simon Dominic has the expression...

933
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:42,599
from that dating show.

934
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:44,530
When he looks
at the lovey-dovey participants.

935
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,130
I saw this face on TVING.

936
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,940
The expression when he is deeply into it.

937
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,369
- Right?
- That was so fluttering.

938
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:51,440
- Yes.
- Can I open the window?

939
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,340
You feel hot now.

940
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,210
Why did they use this clip?

941
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,840
Why? It's so nice.

942
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,150
It's nice to see this
after the dull moments.

943
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,050
- It's sweet.
- It's a nice sight to see.

944
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,820
I secured a lot of screen time in the gym,
but they only used a bit.

945
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,489
I told you not to go.

946
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:08,159
I filmed it really coolly.

947
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:10,590
It's pumping up my blood sugar
all of a sudden.

948
00:37:11,019 --> 00:37:12,530
I should have taken off my shirt.

949
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:14,860
You should rest up then.

950
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:19,000
(They recharge in their own way.)

951
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,599
- Are you coming back from the gym?
- Yes.

952
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,670
I worked out for 50 minutes.

953
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,710
I didn't do anything.

954
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:26,840
I was going to check my phone,
but I passed out.

955
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,739
- I found out a useful tip.
- What is it?

956
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:30,710
I can get some mood lighting in here.

957
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:31,980
(All of a sudden?)

958
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,250
I hate this kind of bright light.

959
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,519
- That doesn't help me relax.
- Right.

960
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:38,989
Not this one. I need soft lighting.

961
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:40,650
Orange will be nice.

962
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,389
So...

963
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:45,760
(That's how he came up
with this useful tip.)

964
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,659
I can put a sock over the light bulb.

965
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,199
The mood looks warm in this room.

966
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,699
So...

967
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,139
since that's an LED light bulb,
it won't start any fire.

968
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:57,199
But your socks are white too.

969
00:37:57,199 --> 00:37:59,510
- I see. Because your socks are dirty?
- Once I put it over the light bulb,

970
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,840
the color sort of changed to ivory.

971
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,010
Why must we do that? The color...

972
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,909
I hate this bright light.

973
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,880
I'll show it to you.
It creates a nice atmosphere.

974
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:11,150
I laughed at it after doing it alone.

975
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,849
(He uses the ivory sock he just took off.)

976
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:13,949
Watch.

977
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:18,559
(Put it over the bright light bulb.)

978
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:21,500
- It was scary.
- Your sock looks dirtier like that.

979
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,630
(A threatening mood)

980
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,800
What is this?

981
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,670
What is this?

982
00:38:27,829 --> 00:38:30,570
- Why is his sock so black?
- This is scary.

983
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:33,039
It looks pretty bad
if you look at the light bulb.

984
00:38:33,309 --> 00:38:36,079
But the overall atmosphere...

985
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,579
- Was it okay?
- reminded me of a cafe.

986
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:39,949
(The overall atmosphere
reminded him of a cafe?)

987
00:38:39,949 --> 00:38:41,519
What kind of cafe would do that?

988
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,219
Don't pronounce "cafe" like that.

989
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:44,889
Yes. Mood lighting.

990
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,489
(His genius idea is shocking.)

991
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:50,090
Hey, is your sock caked with dirt?

992
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:51,760
I washed that yesterday.

993
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,460
We don't need mood lighting here.

994
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:56,300
(Even Pani Bottle wants
to remove the mood lighting.)

995
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,800
I was laughing at it alone,
thinking how cool it was.

996
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,570
I'm glad that it made you laugh.

997
00:39:03,269 --> 00:39:05,269
Shouldn't we plan tomorrow's itinerary?

998
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,809
We really didn't have any plans
for the next day.

999
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,909
Pani Bottle, what do you think?

1000
00:39:10,179 --> 00:39:13,409
Personally, I wanted to shop
for groceries tomorrow.

1001
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,280
- And there's Death Road.
- What?

1002
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,349
Death Road.
It's also called the Yungas Road.

1003
00:39:17,349 --> 00:39:20,489
There's a road next to a cliff.

1004
00:39:20,949 --> 00:39:22,920
Gosh. You have to risk your life for it.

1005
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,960
(This infamous unpaved road
connects La Paz and Yungas.)

1006
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:28,630
People can check out the view
via bicycle or car on that road.

1007
00:39:28,929 --> 00:39:30,400
If you fall off, do you die?

1008
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,570
You won't fall off, though.

1009
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,630
Where is that?

1010
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,440
Or we can watch a wrestling match.

1011
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,570
- A wrestling match?
- Yes.

1012
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,510
Women dress up in traditional outfits
and have wrestling matches.

1013
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,309
- "Cholita."
- I didn't know about that.

1014
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:43,780
Yes. I mentioned it several times.

1015
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,650
It won't be a bad idea
to go to the campsite.

1016
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,880
- Great.
- The view there is amazing.

1017
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,380
- It's different from Korea.
- Yes, indeed. It's so different.

1018
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:52,889
- I can guarantee that it will be amazing.
- What?

1019
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:55,219
(The Valley of the Moon was named
after the surface, resembling the Moon.)

1020
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,920
(His eyes open wide.)

1021
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,190
I had no idea.

1022
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,489
(I had no idea.)

1023
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,400
- You spent time going to the gym.
- Right.

1024
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,599
You didn't go to these places.
So you didn't go there?

1025
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,699
I'm watching it now on the screen.

1026
00:40:07,699 --> 00:40:10,099
(I'm watching it now on the screen.)

1027
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:12,539
This would have been great too.
But this is what I thought.

1028
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:15,980
"Who would think to go to the gym
in La Paz, Bolivia?"

1029
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,150
- Right. No one would.
- You were the only one.

1030
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:20,349
No one would have had
the thought you just had.

1031
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:23,619
Listen. The cameramen
went all the way there.

1032
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:26,250
This was a once-in-a-lifetime chance
to film such a spectacular sight.

1033
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,260
I bet they wanted to do
an amazing job filming that.

1034
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,619
But they ended up filming you
working out at the gym.

1035
00:40:30,619 --> 00:40:33,260
- No wonder they got a reality check.
- I'm glad you brought that up.

1036
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,860
Since they didn't film anything,
they had to buy all these clips...

1037
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,429
after going that far.

1038
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:39,300
- They should have gone there...
- No way!

1039
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,099
and filmed it themselves.

1040
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:43,300
- But they had to buy everything!
- He has a point.

1041
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,809
Gosh. That place looks amazing.

1042
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,170
(Deflecting)

1043
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,440
It looks great on the screen.

1044
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:52,050
If we are going there,
we have to check the room availability.

1045
00:40:52,409 --> 00:40:54,280
- There's something I want to do.
- What is it?

1046
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,920
- Remember the congested intersection?
- Yes.

1047
00:40:57,449 --> 00:41:00,889
(The three-way intersection
made them get off the bus.)

1048
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:03,159
I want to go there
and help them with the traffic jam.

1049
00:41:03,159 --> 00:41:05,889
(He wants to resolve the traffic jam.)

1050
00:41:06,489 --> 00:41:08,230
(The ultimate plan to localize)

1051
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,760
Hold on. How will you do that?

1052
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:12,500
What will you do after hearing that?

1053
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,300
Look at his face!

1054
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,139
(It's the same feeling he has now.)

1055
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:18,570
I was just making a joke.

1056
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:20,639
He went to the gym
and wanted to resolve...

1057
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:22,039
- the traffic jam in Bolivia.
- Right.

1058
00:41:22,039 --> 00:41:24,139
(It will definitely be unique.)

1059
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,309
(Kian84's revolutionary plan)

1060
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:28,380
(Thrilled and in despair)

1061
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,949
I want to go with you.

1062
00:41:30,949 --> 00:41:34,119
Hey, don't encourage him.

1063
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,960
Here's Pani Bottle's problem.

1064
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,989
He's just having fun now.

1065
00:41:37,989 --> 00:41:40,260
Kian84 would say
something crazy and absurd.

1066
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,559
But he would never do it.

1067
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,599
I really want to try it.

1068
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:45,670
We can try it for a minute.

1069
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,730
If it's not fun, we can quit then.

1070
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:49,539
What kind of traveler
would buy the traffic control wind?

1071
00:41:49,539 --> 00:41:51,099
That makes no sense.

1072
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,639
Only Kian84 would have come up
with that idea.

1073
00:41:54,739 --> 00:41:56,239
Only Kian84 would have come up with it.

1074
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:57,539
- Right. That's new.
- Yes.

1075
00:41:58,309 --> 00:41:59,949
I know what I want to do.

1076
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:02,750
- Let's eat beef tomorrow.
- Beef?

1077
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:04,920
He said we had to try beef
in South America.

1078
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,949
Let me tell you why. People said
we had to try beef in South America.

1079
00:42:07,949 --> 00:42:09,360
- But we didn't know.
- Right.

1080
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,590
- Because it's tasty?
- Because it's cheap.

1081
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:12,289
- There's a lot of it.
- I see. It's cheap.

1082
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:14,829
We should go to the campsite
if you want to have a barbecue.

1083
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:16,000
Sounds good.

1084
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,769
But we can have beef wherever we go.

1085
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:20,429
Or we can go to a restaurant
that sells beef.

1086
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:23,269
I don't mind going to the campsite.

1087
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,309
Personally,

1088
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,539
we can go camping in Korea too.
You go camping in Korea too.

1089
00:42:30,739 --> 00:42:33,179
- Right. I do.
- Is there anything else you want to do?

1090
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:34,920
They are in disagreement.

1091
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,980
Anything else?

1092
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:40,320
When we got there,
we all wanted to try out different things.

1093
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,019
So it took a while for us to decide.

1094
00:42:44,059 --> 00:42:45,860
(Pondering for a long time)

1095
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:47,789
Could we do this then?

1096
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,659
Can we go our separate ways for a day?

1097
00:42:50,659 --> 00:42:52,329
- That sounds fine.
- Really?

1098
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:53,969
- It's over.
- Okay.

1099
00:42:53,969 --> 00:42:56,099
- Let's go to sleep.
- Really? You'll do things separately?

1100
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:57,369
Yes. That's what we decided.

1101
00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:00,239
We were together for two weeks.

1102
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:02,340
- At first...
- I think we needed some alone time.

1103
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,510
Just like you guys have your own rooms,
you can have some alone time.

1104
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,820
(They will be on their own tomorrow.)

1105
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:11,219
- Gosh. There was lightning.
- No way.

1106
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:12,219
What?

1107
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,860
(The morning of their second day
in La Paz breaks.)

1108
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:19,960
(Cars still travel freely on the roads.)

1109
00:43:22,829 --> 00:43:24,730
- It looks amazing from afar.
- Yes.

1110
00:43:24,730 --> 00:43:25,869
- It looks great.
- Yes.

1111
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:29,070
(They will be enjoying La Paz
however they want today.)

1112
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,440
(Everyone is sleeping soundly.)

1113
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:39,050
(Knocking)

1114
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,650
(Clicking)

1115
00:43:41,309 --> 00:43:42,480
What's wrong?

1116
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:43,849
Kian84.

1117
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:45,719
(A man wakes Kian84 up with urgency.)

1118
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,019
- What's wrong?
- What is this?

1119
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,690
- What's going on?
- What? I'm scared.

1120
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:52,690
Yes?

1121
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,199
(He can barely keep his eyes open,
but he gets up.)

1122
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,469
(Who is it?)

1123
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,000
Gosh. I'm so tired.

1124
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,570
(The director barges in all of a sudden.)

1125
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:02,639
(He couldn't fix his messy hair.)

1126
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:04,070
What happened?

1127
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,409
Let me rest up a bit more.

1128
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:07,809
Kian84, there's a protest
in front of this building.

1129
00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:09,440
- What? A protest?
- The roads are blocked.

1130
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,849
It must've been so urgent.
The director went to him.

1131
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,650
Filming...

1132
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:15,849
We were all sleeping,
but we just woke up too.

1133
00:44:15,849 --> 00:44:17,420
So we're disoriented too.

1134
00:44:18,219 --> 00:44:20,650
(A while ago in front of their lodging)

1135
00:44:20,989 --> 00:44:23,289
(The staff members are serious.)

1136
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,760
(Adventure by Accident,
Group Chatroom for Staff)

1137
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,989
(A group of protesters
is making their way to our lodging.)

1138
00:44:26,989 --> 00:44:29,099
(By 8 a.m., the roads will be blocked.
Meet us in the lobby now.)

1139
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:30,659
(We need to get moving and leave
as fast as we can.)

1140
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:32,099
(The protesters
are getting close to the lodging.)

1141
00:44:32,929 --> 00:44:36,039
(An unexpected turn of events
no one saw coming)

1142
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:39,869
(The protesters
are moving up to the lodging.)

1143
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:45,210
(They're opposing
the government's taxation plan.)

1144
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,179
(The mine workers
are putting on a large-scale protest.)

1145
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,989
(The group of protesters
has filled the streets.)

1146
00:44:57,059 --> 00:45:01,389
(The traffic congestion has gotten serious
due to the protest.)

1147
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:05,400
(They won't be able to leave via car
if they don't get out now.)

1148
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:08,170
What time is it?

1149
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:09,900
It's 6:30 a.m.

1150
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:11,539
It's almost 7 a.m.

1151
00:45:11,739 --> 00:45:13,210
Let's pack up and leave now.

1152
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,010
I've never been
in this kind of situation before.

1153
00:45:17,179 --> 00:45:19,309
The protesters are enclosing the streets.

1154
00:45:19,309 --> 00:45:21,780
If we don't leave now,
we'll be locked up here.

1155
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,019
We might have to stay here for days.

1156
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:27,650
You guys had to leave via car
before the traffic got worse.

1157
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:28,690
Right.

1158
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,829
(He gets ready to leave without
having the chance to fully wake up.)

1159
00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:33,630
Hey.

1160
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,059
- You're up early.
- Yes.

1161
00:45:35,059 --> 00:45:36,159
(The staff member
comes to pull out the camera.)

1162
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:41,170
(They are ready to escape
at the last minute.)

1163
00:45:45,969 --> 00:45:50,840
(He gets out of the lodging
in a hectic manner.)

1164
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:53,210
(Adventure by Accident:
Group Chatroom for Staff)

1165
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:55,050
(The street where the cast
was staying got blocked.)

1166
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:56,119
(Why don't we meet up
at La Cumbre in La Paz?)

1167
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:57,250
Gosh. This is...

1168
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,789
- At the peak?
- What?

1169
00:46:00,289 --> 00:46:01,860
(The plan to escape from the city)

1170
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:04,590
(Traveling 25km
from the lodging to La Cumbre)

1171
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:07,730
It's like a scene in a movie.

1172
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:09,360
- "The plan to escape from the city."
- Right.

1173
00:46:11,329 --> 00:46:13,400
- He filmed it incorrectly.
- It was hectic.

1174
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,900
They didn't add any effect?

1175
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,139
(The group of protesters
is already nearing the lodging.)

1176
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:19,110
- This is crazy.
- Gosh.

1177
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,510
They are protesting now.

1178
00:46:26,949 --> 00:46:28,010
Oh, no.

1179
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,650
(The citizens have filled up the streets.)

1180
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:35,719
(Had they been late for a second,
they would've been isolated.)

1181
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:39,090
The protesters blocked the streets.

1182
00:46:39,090 --> 00:46:40,130
Hurry.

1183
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,130
We can't go by car now.

1184
00:46:42,829 --> 00:46:44,230
So we're rushing to get out.

1185
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,829
Okay.

1186
00:46:46,769 --> 00:46:48,070
- In many ways...
- Let's get out of here.

1187
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:49,369
Kian84, get in the white car.

1188
00:46:49,369 --> 00:46:50,840
- Okay.
- Get out of there.

1189
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,239
- Do you know?
- Text me when you arrive.

1190
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:54,340
- The staff must've been shocked too.
- Totally.

1191
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:57,710
(The staff member
is running around like crazy.)

1192
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:00,849
They must be from a local TV station.
They're here to cover the story.

1193
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:01,849
- Is it the car in the back?
- Yes.

1194
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:03,579
- Let's get going first.
- Get in the car in the back.

1195
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,389
The car in the back.

1196
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:09,960
(They are getting out
of the city in the car.)

1197
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,360
Gosh.

1198
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:16,630
- That city was crazy.
- Gosh.

1199
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:18,199
There's already a traffic jam.

1200
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:19,500
- Everyone was trying to get out.
- Gosh.

1201
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,400
I think walking will be faster than this.

1202
00:47:23,769 --> 00:47:27,869
I doubt that we'll be able
to get out of here by today.

1203
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:29,480
I can't believe this.

1204
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,780
- Right. I was really shocked.
- Yes.

1205
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:35,179
- Wasn't this a dangerous situation?
- Right.

1206
00:47:35,179 --> 00:47:39,050
In terms of safety, it wasn't dangerous.

1207
00:47:39,050 --> 00:47:40,989
We had an itinerary that day.

1208
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:43,889
The protest started in the morning.

1209
00:47:43,889 --> 00:47:46,329
When there's a protest,
the roads get blocked.

1210
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:48,090
- We had to get out of there fast.
- Right. You had an itinerary.

1211
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:49,760
Your itinerary would have been canceled.

1212
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,760
But we couldn't afford that.

1213
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,699
So we ran like crazy.

1214
00:47:53,699 --> 00:47:55,639
We had to get into the car.

1215
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:58,340
We ran like crazy all the way to the car.

1216
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,639
Kian84 seemed busy.
What were you doing then?

1217
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:01,940
- Right.
- You and Pani Bottle.

1218
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:03,880
Actually, this protest...

1219
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,480
didn't concern me and Pani Bottle.
We didn't have a reason to leave.

1220
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,079
We didn't have to use the car.

1221
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:10,150
(They didn't need to use the car.)

1222
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:13,289
Kian84, you had a place
you wanted to visit.

1223
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:14,289
- Right.
- So you had to get out.

1224
00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:17,789
If I didn't get out of the city,
I would've protested with the people.

1225
00:48:17,989 --> 00:48:19,360
I didn't know
what they were protesting about.

1226
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,260
He would join them
not knowing what it was for.

1227
00:48:22,730 --> 00:48:25,369
- He likes helping people.
- "Yes!"

1228
00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:28,639
(He got frustrated,
so he got out of the car.)

1229
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,099
There was a protest,

1230
00:48:31,469 --> 00:48:33,969
so I escaped from
the downtown area of the city.

1231
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,610
It's only been 5 or 10 minutes.

1232
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,179
There's another heavy traffic jam
like yesterday.

1233
00:48:40,179 --> 00:48:42,420
- Gosh.
- She's leaving with a suitcase.

1234
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,050
At the end of this road, there will be
the annoying intersection from yesterday.

1235
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:49,059
The intersection needs
some traffic control.

1236
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:50,789
This is the place.

1237
00:48:52,489 --> 00:48:55,500
Where should I begin?

1238
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,630
So you couldn't ride
the cable car that day?

1239
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,969
I couldn't go to the place via cable car.

1240
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:01,969
The route?

1241
00:49:02,269 --> 00:49:04,300
(There are layers of cars.)

1242
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,909
What should I do?
How can I free up the roads?

1243
00:49:08,469 --> 00:49:10,340
They should make a traffic light
at the intersection.

1244
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,179
What's this?

1245
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:15,579
I see. There's a traffic jam.

1246
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,320
But the construction is ongoing here.

1247
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:21,289
"I can't stop my construction."
Is that it?

1248
00:49:21,289 --> 00:49:23,190
That's crazy.
There's construction going on too?

1249
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:25,929
Everyone, look at the Pando bus.

1250
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:28,329
It's been there for 30 minutes.

1251
00:49:29,699 --> 00:49:32,199
I think it moved about 10m.

1252
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:33,599
That's so frustrating.

1253
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:35,199
Gosh. It's a war here.

1254
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,769
A lot of people are coming together...

1255
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,639
to pull out the car.

1256
00:49:40,869 --> 00:49:44,340
Gosh. I have to get going
according to my itinerary.

1257
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:47,110
Actually, as for today's itinerary,

1258
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,179
I can't tell you what it is now.

1259
00:49:49,179 --> 00:49:51,050
I was curious about this place.

1260
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:53,789
(Last night)

1261
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:55,659
(Is there anything you want to do
during your free day?)

1262
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,159
Of course, there is.

1263
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,090
I remember this from my elementary school.

1264
00:49:59,389 --> 00:50:02,730
My school had a sisterhood relationship
with a school in Japan.

1265
00:50:02,929 --> 00:50:05,000
A student could stay
at another student's house for a week.

1266
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:06,699
I was really envious of that.

1267
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:10,800
If possible, I want to interact...

1268
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,239
with the locals from South America
as much as I can.

1269
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:16,880
I really want to do that.

1270
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:19,550
I've been closed off for so long.

1271
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,980
Other than drawing for my job,

1272
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:25,420
I already have a made-up image
of them in my mind.

1273
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:29,119
In that way, I'm becoming more jaded.

1274
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:30,960
It comes with fame.

1275
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,630
People won't know who I am
in other countries.

1276
00:50:33,630 --> 00:50:34,789
- I see.
- Right.

1277
00:50:34,829 --> 00:50:37,429
You wanted to meet regular people here...

1278
00:50:37,429 --> 00:50:40,530
- become real friends with them.
- Right.

1279
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:43,670
If you want to, you can go meet them.

1280
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:44,800
You went to meet people.

1281
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,670
- Yes. He said he wanted to make friends.
- Really?

1282
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,070
I'll do it.

1283
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:50,809
I'm curious and looking forward to it.

1284
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,909
I don't know if I can meet them today.
The cars...

1285
00:50:54,579 --> 00:50:56,519
They aren't moving at all.

1286
00:50:57,019 --> 00:50:59,420
They're moving about 1km per hour.

1287
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:03,760
MBC. "Backpack Travels."

1288
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,230
I'm the correspondent, Kian84.

1289
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,500
Anyway, when there's an intersection,

1290
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,170
there will be a traffic jam.

1291
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:16,570
- I think these cute dogs...
- Gosh.

1292
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,639
can soften the anger of the citizens here.

1293
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:21,570
- They aren't cute.
- You guys have a huge job here.

1294
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:23,239
- They seem tough.
- Yes. They are scary.

1295
00:51:23,239 --> 00:51:24,239
Hello.

1296
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,380
How cute!

1297
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,650
Is that a school?

1298
00:51:34,989 --> 00:51:36,760
They still go to school
when there's a traffic jam.

1299
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,630
I hope you guys will grow
into the future of this country.

1300
00:51:42,329 --> 00:51:45,360
What's this? A Bolivian stationery store?

1301
00:51:46,769 --> 00:51:48,940
It doesn't matter where you are
in the world. Elementary school kids...

1302
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:52,369
stop by the stationery shop...

1303
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:54,969
before going to school. That's universal.

1304
00:51:55,809 --> 00:51:58,010
You seem to be having a blast alone.

1305
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:00,079
Gosh. You think so?

1306
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:01,409
Yes. You're entertaining.

1307
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,679
- Okay.
- You seem great.

1308
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:03,920
- He seems great, right?
- Gosh.

1309
00:52:04,349 --> 00:52:05,449
No.

1310
00:52:05,449 --> 00:52:06,519
(Feeling awkward)

1311
00:52:07,719 --> 00:52:10,389
(After spending some time alone...)

1312
00:52:10,789 --> 00:52:13,030
Gosh. The cars are moving now.

1313
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:15,760
The air is really bad.

1314
00:52:16,329 --> 00:52:18,329
I need to go there for some fresh air.

1315
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,269
(Going past the congested downtown area)

1316
00:52:23,639 --> 00:52:24,940
How far are we going?

1317
00:52:26,539 --> 00:52:27,610
(There's no traffic jam now.)

1318
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:28,670
Gosh. The road is empty.

1319
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:31,179
It took over two hours to get out.

1320
00:52:31,179 --> 00:52:32,710
Gosh. Look at the dust.

1321
00:52:33,179 --> 00:52:35,679
(He cuts through the thick cloud of dust.)

1322
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:39,650
(A spectacular view welcomes his escape.)

1323
00:52:42,019 --> 00:52:44,920
(Driving up to the peak of La Paz,
La Cumbre)

1324
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,199
(The staff members
are organizing their equipment.)

1325
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:54,000
(He safely escapes.)

1326
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,369
Thank you.

1327
00:52:57,769 --> 00:52:59,869
(He arrives at the peak of La Paz.)

1328
00:52:59,869 --> 00:53:00,909
Hello.

1329
00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:04,480
It's...

1330
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:06,280
What time is it?

1331
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,309
(He checks the time
as soon as he gets off.)

1332
00:53:08,210 --> 00:53:09,679
It's 11:02 a.m.

1333
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,190
When did we leave? We left around 7 a.m...

1334
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:16,989
from the hotel in La Paz.

1335
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:20,460
I asked the driver. And it was
exactly 25km away from the lodging.

1336
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,929
Four hours.

1337
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,400
It took 4 hours to travel 25km.

1338
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:27,900
Those of you who aren't patient...

1339
00:53:28,469 --> 00:53:31,000
shouldn't come to Bolivia.

1340
00:53:32,039 --> 00:53:33,639
Where should we eat?

1341
00:53:33,639 --> 00:53:35,309
- Eat?
- Is there a place to eat?

1342
00:53:36,010 --> 00:53:38,039
The staff packed me breakfast.

1343
00:53:39,409 --> 00:53:40,579
We can have breakfast...

1344
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,119
and go to the next spot.

1345
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,719
I don't know how long
we have to go, though.

1346
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:48,489
Seriously. I can put up
with altitude sickness and all.

1347
00:53:48,789 --> 00:53:49,960
The air pollution is really bad.

1348
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,590
Look at my shirt. It's so black.

1349
00:53:52,889 --> 00:53:55,230
It's because of the air pollution.
Can you see?

1350
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:57,329
And my lips are always chapped.

1351
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,130
Let's see.

1352
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:02,170
It's chicken with rice.

1353
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,409
(He hurriedly shoves in his first meal.)

1354
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:08,909
(Rummaging through)

1355
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:11,309
Let's find out what Si Eon
and Pani Bottle are doing.

1356
00:54:12,409 --> 00:54:13,780
I wonder if I'll have service here.

1357
00:54:15,579 --> 00:54:18,619
(He finally tries to let them know
about his status.)

1358
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,789
(It's taking a long time
for the receiver to pick up the phone.)

1359
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,760
He's not answering.

1360
00:54:24,989 --> 00:54:26,989
(Munching)

1361
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,559
It's okay. I'll see them later anyway.

1362
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:32,159
(Clueless Si Eon is sleeping soundly.)

1363
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:34,400
It's peaceful
when there's a protest going on.

1364
00:54:34,469 --> 00:54:36,400
(The youngest wakes up first.)

1365
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:38,969
(His face is puffy.
He must have slept well.)

1366
00:54:38,969 --> 00:54:40,639
This hotel is pretty nice...

1367
00:54:40,969 --> 00:54:43,079
because they serve breakfast.

1368
00:54:43,639 --> 00:54:45,849
For the past two days
after arriving in South America,

1369
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:47,480
I kept waking up at 5 a.m.

1370
00:54:48,050 --> 00:54:49,650
So I have all the time in the world today.

1371
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,449
The weather is amazing today as always.

1372
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:54,289
The weather is amazing?

1373
00:54:54,449 --> 00:54:56,559
He didn't know what was going on outside.

1374
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:57,760
We had no idea.

1375
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,789
(He has time to put together breakfast.)

1376
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:03,159
The bread doesn't look tasty.

1377
00:55:04,199 --> 00:55:05,670
Well, as long as I have butter.

1378
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:06,929
(The butter will be doing
the heavy lifting.)

1379
00:55:07,269 --> 00:55:08,900
This is a great budget hotel.

1380
00:55:10,869 --> 00:55:13,269
Coffee. I won't be able to sleep
if I drink coffee.

1381
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:16,840
So I'll drink mate tea instead.

1382
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,150
It alleviates altitude sickness...

1383
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,679
although I don't have any symptoms
for that. How do I work this thing?

1384
00:55:20,679 --> 00:55:22,179
He won't admit it because of his ego.

1385
00:55:22,179 --> 00:55:23,250
(He's strict when it comes
to taking care of his health.)

1386
00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:24,349
Nice.

1387
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,889
The bread looks ugly,
but it's tasty when you try it.

1388
00:55:27,889 --> 00:55:28,949
(He enjoys his breakfast elegantly.)

1389
00:55:30,489 --> 00:55:31,659
And with strawberry jam.

1390
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:34,559
(Taking a bite)

1391
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:37,860
This is great.

1392
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,539
(He finishes his perfect breakfast
with a cup of mate tea.)

1393
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,510
(The oldest member
gets ready to leave too.)

1394
00:55:47,309 --> 00:55:49,280
- Yes.
- The view looks amazing.

1395
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,340
- You were feeling better.
- The view is better during the day.

1396
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,280
- That's great.
- I was feeling so much better.

1397
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,010
(There's a clearer view
of the dense city, La Paz.)

1398
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:56,320
Gosh. This is so cool.

1399
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,579
(There's a clearer view
of the dense city, La Paz.)

1400
00:56:00,219 --> 00:56:03,920
Everyone, I will be checking out...

1401
00:56:04,289 --> 00:56:06,360
the ins and outs of this city...

1402
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,760
with Pani Bottle today.

1403
00:56:08,989 --> 00:56:11,659
It seems okay to travel alone.

1404
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:13,400
Let's do it.

1405
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:14,969
The two of us can go camping on our own.

1406
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,539
That sounds good to me.

1407
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,039
So will we just get groceries...

1408
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,469
and eat delicious food at the campsite?

1409
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:22,710
That sounds good.

1410
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,480
The two of them agreed.

1411
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,510
(Si Eon and Pani Bottle decided to enjoy
the city.)

1412
00:56:26,510 --> 00:56:30,519
When we arrived here yesterday,
the weather was bad.

1413
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,349
Today, the weather is nice.

1414
00:56:33,489 --> 00:56:36,090
- Kian84 isn't with us right now.
- Right.

1415
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:37,460
He's not here.

1416
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,260
(The strength of the locals is surprising
every time.)

1417
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,289
Gosh.

1418
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,230
Kian84 isn't here, and so?

1419
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:49,739
Now, I finally feel free.

1420
00:56:51,340 --> 00:56:52,869
(Speechless)

1421
00:56:52,869 --> 00:56:53,909
Goodness.

1422
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:56,579
(Their day is full of laughter.)

1423
00:56:57,179 --> 00:56:58,980
This is the best food that I had here.

1424
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,010
They're getting along so well.

1425
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:01,449
They're having so much fun.

1426
00:57:01,449 --> 00:57:03,719
- Goodness.
- I'm sorry.

1427
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:05,519
- That makes me sad.
- Gosh.

1428
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:07,719
Why do you keep smiling?

1429
00:57:08,019 --> 00:57:09,360
They look good together.

1430
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:11,460
The view looks amazing
even the second time.

1431
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,690
It's the best.

1432
00:57:13,289 --> 00:57:14,460
This is great.

1433
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:16,530
- It's delicious.
- Isn't it delicious?

1434
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:18,530
Didn't we have one more person?

1435
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,400
Who?

1436
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,170
What? You don't remember?

1437
00:57:23,739 --> 00:57:26,039
It's very cold.

1438
00:57:26,039 --> 00:57:28,969
(Someone is having a hard time
from the start.)

1439
00:57:29,539 --> 00:57:31,239
(Eating)

1440
00:57:32,179 --> 00:57:33,179
(Dropping)

1441
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:36,179
After I eat,

1442
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,650
I'll be meeting a local friend.

1443
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:40,849
Here I go.

1444
00:57:42,989 --> 00:57:44,219
It's really high.

1445
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:45,289
(He starts moving after a meal.)

1446
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:50,699
Hello.

1447
00:57:54,829 --> 00:57:56,300
I can't even breathe.

1448
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:57,500
(He goes to meet a local friend.)

1449
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,409
(Exclaiming)

1450
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:04,480
The clouds brush against the mountain.

1451
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:18,619
(Exclaiming)

1452
00:58:18,619 --> 00:58:20,030
Mountains and clouds.

1453
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,929
(Mountains and clouds)

1454
00:58:22,929 --> 00:58:25,099
This is the romance in life.

1455
00:58:25,099 --> 00:58:28,599
(Mountains and clouds are
the romance in life.)

1456
00:58:33,269 --> 00:58:36,239
The mountain is covered
with twinkle powder.

1457
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:39,750
It's Twinkle Powder Mountain.

1458
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:41,309
The color is similar to the powder.

1459
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:45,079
(He's moving while enjoying
the view outside the window.)

1460
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,090
(At that moment, he enters a tunnel.)

1461
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:49,119
What's this?

1462
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:51,059
The tunnel looks frightening.
I thought that it was a cave.

1463
00:58:52,019 --> 00:58:53,659
(Dark)

1464
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,059
There's no light inside the tunnel.

1465
00:58:57,429 --> 00:58:59,329
- There's no light inside the tunnel.
- Really?

1466
00:58:59,329 --> 00:59:00,869
(A dark tunnel without any light)

1467
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,139
- He's only looking at the exit.
- Yes.

1468
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:09,070
(The road gets narrower after the tunnel.)

1469
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:10,940
Oh, my. It got narrow all of a sudden.

1470
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:17,780
(It's a cliff on both sides.)

1471
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,820
What's going on?

1472
00:59:22,289 --> 00:59:23,989
(Looking around)

1473
00:59:23,989 --> 00:59:25,719
Sir, please pass us.

1474
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,730
The car passed them.

1475
00:59:29,559 --> 00:59:31,760
Goodness.

1476
00:59:32,429 --> 00:59:35,369
That was so scary.

1477
00:59:35,369 --> 00:59:36,969
He was on the other side of the road.

1478
00:59:36,969 --> 00:59:38,869
They're driving dangerously.

1479
00:59:39,269 --> 00:59:41,070
Where are you going?

1480
00:59:41,909 --> 00:59:43,739
- I'm on my way.
- Is it somewhere isolated?

1481
00:59:43,739 --> 00:59:45,309
He said that he wanted to make friends.

1482
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:49,150
I want to sleep,
but I can't because I'm too scared.

1483
00:59:50,949 --> 00:59:53,090
- Goodness.
- When they drive,

1484
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:54,920
they drive on the other side of the road.

1485
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,019
(All he can depend on is the handle.)

1486
00:59:56,019 --> 00:59:57,519
(Holding tight)

1487
00:59:57,789 --> 01:00:00,090
I thought that I was going to die.
They kept passing us.

1488
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,690
I wanted to sleep,

1489
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:04,659
but I couldn't help but hold onto this.

1490
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,710
Everyone. You'll see it
if the editor zooms in.

1491
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:16,880
I checked the driver's eyes
on the rearview mirror.

1492
01:00:17,539 --> 01:00:20,809
It's my first time staring at the eyes
of a man that I don't know...

1493
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:23,849
for such a long time.

1494
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:26,849
We made eye contact from time to time.

1495
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:30,719
I'm looking at the driver's eyes...

1496
01:00:31,489 --> 01:00:33,789
throughout the ride.

1497
01:00:39,099 --> 01:00:42,840
There's a lot of landslides here.

1498
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,070
(A landslide in the middle of the road)

1499
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:50,579
Everyone.

1500
01:00:51,340 --> 01:00:54,079
As you can see,
there's a landslide on the way.

1501
01:00:54,449 --> 01:00:56,219
The road is blocked.

1502
01:00:57,420 --> 01:00:59,449
As you can see...

1503
01:00:59,750 --> 01:01:02,190
- There are many variables.
- Take a look.

1504
01:01:05,219 --> 01:01:07,159
When it rains a lot,

1505
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,960
there would be many landslides.

1506
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:13,099
(It's not easy to meet a local friend.)

1507
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,469
(Exclaiming)

1508
01:01:17,139 --> 01:01:18,639
We're inside the clouds.

1509
01:01:19,739 --> 01:01:22,469
(Foggy clouds over the road)

1510
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:25,210
(Fascinated)

1511
01:01:27,349 --> 01:01:30,079
Are we going to a place where people live?

1512
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:31,380
(They continue along the road
in the clouds.)

1513
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:36,389
What's going on?

1514
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:38,690
I just saw it.

1515
01:01:38,690 --> 01:01:41,360
This is Death Road
that Pani Bottle mentioned.

1516
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,360
Finally.

1517
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,030
I don't know if you see it back there.

1518
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,969
This is called Death Road.

1519
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:48,730
- Death Road?
- Death Road.

1520
01:01:51,099 --> 01:01:52,909
(Last night at the lodging)

1521
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,769
(It's known as Death Road.
It's Yungas Road.)

1522
01:01:55,769 --> 01:01:58,179
(It's a cliff-like road.)

1523
01:01:58,539 --> 01:02:00,750
(Death Road that Pani Bottle talked about)

1524
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,579
(Remembering what Pani Bottle said,
he gets out of the car.)

1525
01:02:04,579 --> 01:02:05,619
I mean...

1526
01:02:10,619 --> 01:02:11,860
Is that Death Road?

1527
01:02:14,489 --> 01:02:16,329
(Exclaiming)

1528
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,199
It's not even a mountain. It's a cliff.

1529
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,909
What's underneath?

1530
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:29,480
- It's a cliff.
- A cliff?

1531
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:37,079
(It links La Paz and the Yungas valley.)

1532
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,519
Look how steep it is.

1533
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:43,019
- It looks scary.
- It's 90 degrees.

1534
01:02:43,590 --> 01:02:45,420
The cliff is so steep.

1535
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:51,530
There's a road in such a place.

1536
01:02:55,269 --> 01:02:57,500
- Gosh.
- Looking at it like that...

1537
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,739
(The road is next to a cliff
without any safety measures.)

1538
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:01,670
Isn't it one-way?

1539
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:03,039
What if a car comes
from the opposite direction?

1540
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:05,280
(Death Road where many people died)

1541
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:10,280
Isn't that a road for cars
where the bicycles are?

1542
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:11,349
Yes.

1543
01:03:11,349 --> 01:03:15,190
(A hot spot for fans of extreme sports)

1544
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,159
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

1545
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:20,429
My goodness.

1546
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:24,599
It's daytime,

1547
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:28,829
but you can't see very well
because of the clouds.

1548
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:31,800
The clouds are rising along the ridge.

1549
01:03:34,309 --> 01:03:37,710
It's scary because it's called Death Road.

1550
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:40,610
There are crosses here and there
on the road.

1551
01:03:41,079 --> 01:03:44,179
I think they made a cemetery
for people who died in an accident...

1552
01:03:44,179 --> 01:03:45,679
on the road.

1553
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:47,320
- It's a cemetery.
- Goodness.

1554
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:52,559
There's a cemetery for those who died.

1555
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:54,630
It's impossible not to be scared.

1556
01:03:54,630 --> 01:03:56,630
(It's impossible not to be scared.)

1557
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:59,429
For safety reasons, I couldn't get there.

1558
01:03:59,429 --> 01:04:01,269
- It's dangerous with a car.
- It's dangerous.

1559
01:04:01,269 --> 01:04:02,269
Yes.

1560
01:04:02,269 --> 01:04:04,840
I haven't been there,

1561
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,099
but strangely, I want to go there.

1562
01:04:06,099 --> 01:04:08,710
- It's odd.
- It's strange.

1563
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:11,539
(Tourists surrounded by clouds)

1564
01:04:11,809 --> 01:04:13,909
It feels like a dinosaur will pop out.

1565
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:16,219
It must be scary
because something might come out.

1566
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,679
Over there,

1567
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:21,420
there's another grave.

1568
01:04:22,349 --> 01:04:25,119
There's no solution
if you fall off from here.

1569
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:27,130
It's a cliff, not a mountain.

1570
01:04:29,559 --> 01:04:31,429
(He stops in front of a grave.)

1571
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,800
Gosh.

1572
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:36,440
I should pray.

1573
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:41,369
Wait.

1574
01:04:41,969 --> 01:04:43,179
Rest in peace.

1575
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,880
It looks spooky.

1576
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:53,719
Gosh, it's spooky.

1577
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,360
It's covered with clouds now.

1578
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,730
- It feels out of this world.
- Right.

1579
01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:04,300
It feels like a border
between life and death.

1580
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,369
(He returns after taking a look
around Death Road.)

1581
01:05:06,699 --> 01:05:10,570
The person you will meet lives...

1582
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:12,570
beyond Death Road.

1583
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,369
- Beyond Death Road?
- Yes.

1584
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:18,409
Going through Death Road will be
too dangerous.

1585
01:05:18,409 --> 01:05:20,079
There's a newly constructed road,

1586
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:23,050
- so we will...
- Is it a new road?

1587
01:05:23,050 --> 01:05:25,250
They constructed a wider road.

1588
01:05:26,219 --> 01:05:28,849
Since there's a new road,
you don't have to go through Death Road.

1589
01:05:28,849 --> 01:05:30,989
Right. I feel relieved.

1590
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:36,760
(No matter how much they descend,
all they see is the road.)

1591
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:40,199
There's no end. We keep descending.

1592
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,929
That's a long ride.

1593
01:05:42,929 --> 01:05:44,500
(The friend's house is quite far.)

1594
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,869
(He tries calling Si Eon and Pani Bottle.)

1595
01:05:49,809 --> 01:05:51,340
- Hello?
- Si Eon.

1596
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:52,780
- Kian84.
- Yes.

1597
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:56,349
I'm sorry. Please come back.

1598
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:58,579
What are you doing?

1599
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:01,619
We're not doing anything
because you're not here.

1600
01:06:01,619 --> 01:06:02,690
What are you doing?

1601
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:05,760
We're not doing anything
because you're not here.

1602
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:07,789
(They're enjoying a feast
now that Kian84 isn't with them.)

1603
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:09,230
They're enjoying a feast.

1604
01:06:09,289 --> 01:06:10,860
(Feeling sad)

1605
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,599
It's Chinese food.

1606
01:06:13,429 --> 01:06:14,900
Are you coming back tonight?

1607
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:19,000
I've been riding in a car...

1608
01:06:19,139 --> 01:06:21,510
for seven hours now.

1609
01:06:22,469 --> 01:06:24,610
- What?
- He's been in a car for seven hours.

1610
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:25,679
What?

1611
01:06:26,010 --> 01:06:27,679
If we turn back now,

1612
01:06:27,949 --> 01:06:29,579
I can get there by 9 p.m.

1613
01:06:29,579 --> 01:06:30,750
Then it would take him...

1614
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,380
- another seven hours to get back.
- Right.

1615
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:35,989
It takes several hours
because the country is so big.

1616
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:40,090
- What?
- We're only saying what's necessary.

1617
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,659
We always say what's necessary.

1618
01:06:43,059 --> 01:06:45,429
I think I will come back tomorrow.

1619
01:06:45,929 --> 01:06:47,929
Okay, take care of yourself.

1620
01:06:47,929 --> 01:06:52,469
Don't say that you'll sleep outside again.

1621
01:06:52,469 --> 01:06:54,210
Pani Bottle, are you well?

1622
01:06:54,809 --> 01:06:56,380
- Pani Bottle.
- He changed the subject.

1623
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:59,039
It must be difficult to be with Si Eon,

1624
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:00,380
but take good care of him.

1625
01:07:00,579 --> 01:07:02,409
It's really difficult. I'm suffering.

1626
01:07:02,579 --> 01:07:03,780
I can't get along with him.

1627
01:07:04,949 --> 01:07:08,050
Si Eon is difficult to be around,

1628
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:10,119
but he's a good person.

1629
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:11,519
- I can see that.
- Yes.

1630
01:07:11,519 --> 01:07:12,820
Tell him that I'm no fun.

1631
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,030
He's no fun at all.

1632
01:07:14,829 --> 01:07:16,500
(He just laughs.)

1633
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,659
All right. I'll message you later.

1634
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:20,829
- I can't hear you well.
- Okay.

1635
01:07:20,829 --> 01:07:22,670
- Bye.
- He had no idea about us.

1636
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:23,869
(He hangs up without knowing
what's going on with the others.)

1637
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:25,300
Seven hours?

1638
01:07:26,769 --> 01:07:29,110
If I had gone with him,

1639
01:07:29,139 --> 01:07:31,340
I'd have gone back to Korea.

1640
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:33,510
(Without caring, they enjoy the feast.)

1641
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,280
(Eating)

1642
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:38,679
(After a full meal)

1643
01:07:38,679 --> 01:07:39,820
Thank you.

1644
01:07:41,019 --> 01:07:43,389
- We have to walk 15 minutes...
- Yes.

1645
01:07:44,119 --> 01:07:45,860
to get to the cable car.

1646
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:49,659
They call cable cars "teleferico."

1647
01:07:49,659 --> 01:07:51,929
- Teleferico?
- Teleferico.

1648
01:07:51,929 --> 01:07:53,630
It's like a subway map.

1649
01:07:53,630 --> 01:07:55,230
It's true.

1650
01:07:55,699 --> 01:07:57,869
You can see everything from the cable car.

1651
01:07:57,869 --> 01:07:59,039
I bet.

1652
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:02,010
You can also transfer.

1653
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,280
In La Paz where there's a lot of traffic,

1654
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,610
it's very convenient.

1655
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:07,250
It's well made.

1656
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:09,110
(Cable cars are faster
than the narrow and busy roads.)

1657
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:13,820
(In harmony with the unique
natural environment)

1658
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:17,559
(It's a public transportation
and a tourist attraction.)

1659
01:08:17,559 --> 01:08:20,030
- It's close.
- It's a 17-minute walk.

1660
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:21,829
- That's good.
- Let's go.

1661
01:08:21,829 --> 01:08:22,860
(Seventeen minutes to the nearest station)

1662
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,270
By the way, I need to pee.

1663
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:29,939
What? Already?

1664
01:08:30,069 --> 01:08:32,539
Isn't it normal to want to pee?

1665
01:08:33,670 --> 01:08:36,140
- Restroom.
- Restroom.

1666
01:08:36,539 --> 01:08:38,079
- Is that how I say it?
- Yes.

1667
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,609
I need coins.

1668
01:08:39,609 --> 01:08:41,579
- I used them up.
- I don't have any coins.

1669
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:43,920
- I have some.
- You do?

1670
01:08:44,119 --> 01:08:45,180
Restroom?

1671
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:47,220
- Restroom?
- Yes.

1672
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:49,319
Go ahead. It's five bolivianos.

1673
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:50,989
- Get three bolivianos in change.
- Okay.

1674
01:08:51,659 --> 01:08:54,029
(Pani Bottle even calculates the change.)

1675
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:55,659
Why are you over there?

1676
01:08:56,130 --> 01:08:57,329
The restroom is over here.

1677
01:08:57,329 --> 01:08:58,399
On the third floor?

1678
01:08:58,399 --> 01:08:59,930
I almost died
while climbing up the stairs.

1679
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:01,500
- Did you pee in your pants?
- I got altitude sickness.

1680
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,899
- No.
- If you're in a hurry,

1681
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:05,300
it could be a mess.

1682
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:08,569
You pay two bolivianos
to climb up the stairs and pee?

1683
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:12,909
(It's refreshing, but he returns tired.)

1684
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,449
- Which country are you from?
- Korea.

1685
01:09:15,449 --> 01:09:17,479
- Koreans?
- Yes, we're Koreans.

1686
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:18,850
- Koreans.
- They're Koreans.

1687
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:20,619
- Koreans.
- Korea.

1688
01:09:20,619 --> 01:09:22,789
- Korea?
- Welcome to Bolivia.

1689
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:25,090
Thank you.

1690
01:09:25,659 --> 01:09:28,260
People in South America are nice
to Koreans.

1691
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:29,590
They're welcoming us.

1692
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:31,630
(Thank you.)

1693
01:09:33,729 --> 01:09:35,229
There's another protest.

1694
01:09:36,229 --> 01:09:38,569
- They're just sitting down.
- There's just some control.

1695
01:09:38,569 --> 01:09:40,670
They're eating while seated.

1696
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:42,569
They're talking to each other.

1697
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:48,350
(The protest where Kian84 had
to escape in a hurry)

1698
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:52,250
- Hello.
- Hello, Chinese.

1699
01:09:52,449 --> 01:09:55,489
We're from Korea.

1700
01:09:56,449 --> 01:09:58,819
This is what you hear the most
in South America.

1701
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:00,359
- "Chino."
- "Chino."

1702
01:10:00,359 --> 01:10:02,060
- No, I'm Korean.
- What does "chino" mean?

1703
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:03,659
- Chinese?
- Chinese.

1704
01:10:05,399 --> 01:10:06,430
Gosh.

1705
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:08,770
It's a tall building.

1706
01:10:09,229 --> 01:10:11,670
The atmosphere is
completely different here.

1707
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:13,970
- Gosh.
- Isn't it the center?

1708
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:17,279
It's filled with skyscrapers
like Teheran-ro.

1709
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:19,579
Usually, they aren't allowed to walk
on the street, right?

1710
01:10:19,579 --> 01:10:21,380
Right, it's forbidden.

1711
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,779
On top of that, it's not even the weekend.

1712
01:10:23,079 --> 01:10:25,020
Cars wouldn't be able to pass by.

1713
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:26,050
No.

1714
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:27,989
That's why they're walking
and taking cable cars.

1715
01:10:27,989 --> 01:10:30,260
Thankfully, there are cable cars.

1716
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:32,390
(Shooting)

1717
01:10:32,390 --> 01:10:33,659
That startled me.

1718
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:36,029
The view is magnificent.

1719
01:10:36,029 --> 01:10:38,529
- Look at the end over there.
- Gosh.

1720
01:10:38,529 --> 01:10:41,100
Building, mountain,
and snow on the mountain.

1721
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:42,729
- There are trees too.
- That's amazing.

1722
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:45,369
There isn't much in La Paz,

1723
01:10:45,369 --> 01:10:46,770
but it has an amazing view.

1724
01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:48,670
Yes, the view is incredible.

1725
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:50,840
That must be it.

1726
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,239
Where is it?

1727
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:54,550
There it is. El Prado.

1728
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:56,380
It's well-made.

1729
01:10:56,779 --> 01:10:58,050
Hello.

1730
01:10:58,350 --> 01:11:00,319
(After checking the route,
they purchase tickets.)

1731
01:11:01,289 --> 01:11:02,289
(Two cable car tickets cost 8 bolivianos,
about 1.5 dollars.)

1732
01:11:02,289 --> 01:11:04,659
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1733
01:11:05,289 --> 01:11:07,489
This will be so much fun.

1734
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:10,399
I can't believe
that it's public transportation.

1735
01:11:10,659 --> 01:11:12,600
Gosh, it looks nice.

1736
01:11:12,729 --> 01:11:13,800
Isn't it really nice?

1737
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:19,270
Look at the traffic.

1738
01:11:19,270 --> 01:11:22,010
(The traffic remains heavy.)

1739
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:24,539
The view is magnificent.

1740
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,149
- Is that a hotel building?
- The building...

1741
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:29,710
- What?
- Is it an apartment?

1742
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:31,149
That kind of apartment exists over there?

1743
01:11:31,149 --> 01:11:33,689
It was a different world
as soon as we departed.

1744
01:11:33,689 --> 01:11:36,289
- Right.
- The buildings are very...

1745
01:11:37,289 --> 01:11:38,789
Si Eon, get ready to get out.

1746
01:11:39,489 --> 01:11:40,729
We have to transfer.

1747
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:42,189
It's like the subway.

1748
01:11:42,430 --> 01:11:44,560
- Green Line?
- Green Line.

1749
01:11:47,529 --> 01:11:49,399
It looks amazing.
What kind of boulder is that?

1750
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:51,100
What's that?

1751
01:11:51,399 --> 01:11:53,640
- Gosh.
- That must be it.

1752
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,369
No, it's only...

1753
01:11:55,369 --> 01:11:56,680
- A small version?
- Yes.

1754
01:11:56,680 --> 01:11:58,880
There are small boulders too.

1755
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,250
(It was built as public transportation.)

1756
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:06,649
I went around all over La Paz.

1757
01:12:06,819 --> 01:12:09,319
Of all cities, it has the most...

1758
01:12:09,319 --> 01:12:11,359
unique views.

1759
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:12,920
Is there a place like this?

1760
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:14,659
We're here.

1761
01:12:14,659 --> 01:12:17,500
(They get off at a station
near the campsite.)

1762
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,670
This is incredible.

1763
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:23,300
(Si Eon and Pani Bottle head to
the campsite, looking at marvelous views.)

1764
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,800
(Man with healthy teeth is still moving.)

1765
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:30,479
I came down to an altitude of 920m.

1766
01:12:30,779 --> 01:12:33,079
I wonder where we're going.

1767
01:12:33,239 --> 01:12:34,979
I look forward to it.

1768
01:12:35,909 --> 01:12:40,520
(A long journey to meet a friend)

1769
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:44,520
(The car slows down.)

1770
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:49,760
Why is he stopping?

1771
01:12:50,659 --> 01:12:51,760
Is this it?

1772
01:12:56,329 --> 01:12:57,439
Have we arrived?

1773
01:12:58,239 --> 01:12:59,399
We arrived.

1774
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:01,640
Thank you.

1775
01:13:04,109 --> 01:13:05,909
(He gets out of the car.)

1776
01:13:05,909 --> 01:13:07,750
- Did he arrive at the destination?
- Yes.

1777
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,149
He said that this was it.

1778
01:13:09,149 --> 01:13:10,880
(Looking around)

1779
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:13,180
There's no one around,
and there are no buildings.

1780
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:14,590
There's nothing.

1781
01:13:14,590 --> 01:13:15,590
(He descends along the road.)

1782
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:17,560
Gosh.

1783
01:13:18,020 --> 01:13:19,359
(Hesitant)

1784
01:13:20,289 --> 01:13:22,489
(Flustered)

1785
01:13:23,029 --> 01:13:24,100
(The cliff comes to greet him
instead of his friend.)

1786
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,500
It's a cliff.

1787
01:13:29,369 --> 01:13:30,569
I know this sound.

1788
01:13:30,569 --> 01:13:31,640
What is it?

1789
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:35,369
What I know about ziplines is...

1790
01:13:35,369 --> 01:13:37,380
Is there a zipline?

1791
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:38,609
My gosh.

1792
01:13:40,649 --> 01:13:44,319
After a seven-hour ride...

1793
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:46,180
from La Paz...

1794
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,550
He's coming.

1795
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,359
Someone is coming on the zipline.

1796
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:54,460
What?

1797
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:55,859
What's going on?

1798
01:13:56,130 --> 01:13:57,859
Someone was coming.

1799
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:00,699
(Someone crosses the cliff
on the zipline.)

1800
01:14:00,699 --> 01:14:02,500
- Gosh.
- Really?

1801
01:14:03,369 --> 01:14:05,000
(Will he meet a local friend
in an unusual way?)

1802
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,470
Their first meeting is...

1803
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:10,539
He's coming.
Someone is coming on the zipline.

1804
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:13,609
(You'll see many interesting things
at my house.)

1805
01:14:13,979 --> 01:14:15,609
(Let's go now.)

1806
01:14:15,609 --> 01:14:16,779
It's really high.

1807
01:14:16,779 --> 01:14:18,720
(To a higher,)

1808
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,350
(more dangerous,)

1809
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:22,420
(and a deeper place)

1810
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:25,060
(He travels endlessly.)

1811
01:14:25,689 --> 01:14:27,590
(A friend who's the same age as Kian84)

1812
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:29,090
(Flinching)

1813
01:14:29,789 --> 01:14:31,729
(He's too talkative.)

1814
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:34,500
(Will he stop talking all together?)

1815
01:14:35,069 --> 01:14:37,100
(Meeting on the other side of the planet)

1816
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,970
(Special connections)

1817
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:42,140
(You're the best.)

1818
01:14:42,909 --> 01:14:44,979
(Friendship beyond age)

1819
01:14:45,109 --> 01:14:46,739
(High-five)

1820
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:51,680
(Thank you so much...)

1821
01:14:51,850 --> 01:14:55,090
(for this rare experience.)

1822
01:14:55,789 --> 01:14:57,789
(Si Eon and Pani Bottle face...)

1823
01:14:58,359 --> 01:15:00,430
(a magnificent view
on the other side of the planet.)

1824
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:02,060
(My heart is racing.)

1825
01:15:02,529 --> 01:15:05,600
(A beef party over a bonfire)

1826
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:07,869
(Try some.)

1827
01:15:08,899 --> 01:15:11,300
(It's so delicious.)

1828
01:15:12,039 --> 01:15:15,039
(While they're laughing and chilling,)

1829
01:15:16,039 --> 01:15:18,579
(an unexpected situation happens.)

1830
01:15:18,939 --> 01:15:20,449
(Don't touch our camera.)

1831
01:15:21,180 --> 01:15:24,220
(What happened at the campsite?)

1832
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:26,279
(Adventure by Accident)
