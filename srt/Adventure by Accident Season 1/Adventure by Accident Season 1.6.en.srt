1
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,540
(Laughing)

2
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:33,679
(He can see the zipline
right in front of him.)

3
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:37,249
It's a cliff.

4
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:40,589
(After driving for 7 hours,
he arrives at a cliff.)

5
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,350
Oh, someone's coming.

6
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,990
(Someone is flying...)

7
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,990
Who is it?

8
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,289
(across the giant cliff.)

9
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:49,490
It's like Tarzan.

10
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:53,159
Someone's coming on the zipline.

11
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,629
(Doubting his eyes)

12
00:01:55,999 --> 00:01:58,539
(A man is coming across the scary cliff.)

13
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:00,909
Hello.

14
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,070
Hello.

15
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:06,610
(He quickly lands on the other side.)

16
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:07,949
Hello.

17
00:02:07,949 --> 00:02:09,949
- Hello. How are you?
- Hello. How are you?

18
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:12,919
- I'm good.
- I'm good.

19
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:15,589
- Kian84.
- Kian84.

20
00:02:15,589 --> 00:02:17,290
- Yes. Kian84.
- Yes.

21
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:21,659
- I live over there. It's my house.
- Yes. My house.

22
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:24,659
- I use this to go across.
- I see.

23
00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:26,500
It's my form of transportation.

24
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,669
- Transportation.
- Transportation.

25
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:31,300
- You? Here?
- Yes.

26
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,869
Gosh. They're like stairs.

27
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:36,409
Since there are a lot of mountains,
there are a lot of people...

28
00:02:36,409 --> 00:02:37,879
who farm and live on ridges.

29
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,879
(For them, the zipline
is a form of transportation...)

30
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,980
Gosh. They also send things on it.

31
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,250
(and a form of communication
that connects them to the world.)

32
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,420
It's because this connects
right to my house.

33
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:48,489
(House, Current location)

34
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:52,289
(The zipline connects his house
directly to the big road.)

35
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,289
His house
is right in front of the zipline.

36
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:58,230
- Like a house next to a station.
- Exactly. A station district.

37
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,629
- A zipline district.
- A zipline district.

38
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:02,700
So each house has a zipline.

39
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,470
- They're privately owned
- Really?

40
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,200
- It's like having your own car.
- I see.

41
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,539
I see. They each have a zipline.

42
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:10,739
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

43
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,580
To your house.

44
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,080
How old are you?

45
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,050
I can't speak English.

46
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:18,619
No English?

47
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,750
Okay.

48
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,849
I translated some things,
so I should try to say those.

49
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:24,119
(Kian84 finally meets a local friend
after driving for seven hours.)

50
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,560
How old are you?

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,399
How is his age so long?

52
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,529
(His age sounds quite long.)

53
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:38,769
Jokes that tell it like it is?

54
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:41,769
Oh, it's kind of philosophical.

55
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:43,980
One more.

56
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,839
One second.

57
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:48,350
I'm 38 years old.

58
00:03:50,149 --> 00:03:52,019
Oh, you're 38 years old?

59
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,050
- Your birthday...
- You?

60
00:03:56,249 --> 00:03:58,619
I'm 39.

61
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,890
- Yes.
- Okay.

62
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,529
- You're younger, then.
- He's younger?

63
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,399
- Okay.
- You're my brother.

64
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:08,300
(They quickly figure out their
respective ranks, Korean style.)

65
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,330
Brother.

66
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,399
You'll be able to see lots
of fun things at my house.

67
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,269
(Using body language)

68
00:04:15,269 --> 00:04:16,339
Alegre?

69
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,679
Okay, thank you.

70
00:04:18,679 --> 00:04:20,350
- I'm sure he said something nice.
- Thank you.

71
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:21,410
Thank you.

72
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,580
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

73
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,519
(Kian84 heads straight to the zipline.)

74
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,880
- What are you doing?
- Are you going to ride it?

75
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,459
- We're going around by car.
- Oh, I see.

76
00:04:32,459 --> 00:04:33,730
Oh, you're going in the car.

77
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,730
(Slightly disappointed)

78
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,760
Okay.

79
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:38,959
I wanted to ride that,

80
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,830
but apparently, it can be dangerous
for those with no experience.

81
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,540
It's completely different
from ziplines that are for fun.

82
00:04:44,769 --> 00:04:46,369
There's no safety line.

83
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,239
Since I hadn't used one,
they thought it might be dangerous.

84
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:49,410
- That's true.
- True. Who knows what might happen?

85
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:53,580
(It takes approximately 20 seconds
on zipline.)

86
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,279
(They go by car to be safe...)

87
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:04,559
(and walk the rest of the way
where the car can't go.)

88
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:07,189
Put on your seat belt.

89
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,429
- I see.
- Here.

90
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,600
(So kind.)

91
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,999
You don't speak English?

92
00:05:18,769 --> 00:05:20,100
(The Spanish notes he's been studying)

93
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,709
You've been studying.

94
00:05:21,709 --> 00:05:23,170
I wanted to communicate with people a bit.

95
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,480
Oh, okay.

96
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:26,439
What's your name?

97
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,910
Celso Porfirio Cordero Liberos.

98
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,820
I'll write it.

99
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:36,820
Okay.

100
00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:38,589
Okay.

101
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,830
Calso Porlilo...

102
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,429
- Porfirio.
- Porfilio.

103
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,030
(Laughing)

104
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,069
Porfirio.

105
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:49,670
- Cordero.
- Cordero.

106
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,800
- Celso.
- Your name...

107
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,809
is Celso Porfirio Cordero Liberos.

108
00:05:54,809 --> 00:05:56,809
- Nice.
- His name is quite long.

109
00:05:57,809 --> 00:06:00,650
(Actually, he said his name earlier.)

110
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,879
Oh, that was his name.

111
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,119
(Kian84 just didn't understand.)

112
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:06,179
And your birthday...

113
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,949
is 1985...

114
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:12,020
I was born in 1984.

115
00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:14,360
Your birthday.

116
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,059
It turns out, he was born in 1984.
He was the same age as me.

117
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,059
You're my friend.

118
00:06:18,059 --> 00:06:20,100
He's the same age as you.

119
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,429
My birthday.

120
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,139
This is mine. Yes.

121
00:06:24,239 --> 00:06:25,300
You...

122
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,639
What month and date? I can't read it
if you write it in English.

123
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:32,480
(He writes each letter
slowly, but carefully.)

124
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:34,749
Oh, May 14th?

125
00:06:34,749 --> 00:06:36,379
- Okay.
- Porfi84.

126
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,550
Gosh. Friend.

127
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,590
- Same age.
- Yes.

128
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,550
What are the chances
that you're the same age?

129
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,559
It was interesting
that we were the same age.

130
00:06:45,689 --> 00:06:48,259
He's a friend of the same age
from the other side of the planet.

131
00:06:48,989 --> 00:06:50,290
It was cool.

132
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,230
It was cute too.

133
00:06:52,429 --> 00:06:54,970
What were you doing during my interview?

134
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,069
What is he doing?

135
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,270
I was saying something important,
but he's so distracting.

136
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,840
- He was sleeping over there.
- Yes.

137
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,309
He really takes the spotlight.

138
00:07:01,309 --> 00:07:04,139
Hey. Pani Bottle is packing back there.

139
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:05,179
(Drying his socks)

140
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,040
At least I was staying still.

141
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,280
(Quietly stealing the spotlight)

142
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:12,449
I'm solo.

143
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,389
- Me too.
- Solo.

144
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,759
(Are you also single?)

145
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,660
- You?
- I...

146
00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:22,129
(Writing his answer)

147
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:24,629
Okay. Understand.

148
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,369
He isn't married, but he has a wife?

149
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:29,699
You haven't gotten married,
but you have a wife?

150
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,300
That's what he said.

151
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,739
(Serious)

152
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:34,239
What is this?

153
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,869
Girlfriend?

154
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:37,309
(What is this with this charismatic guy?)

155
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,610
Did he get divorced?

156
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:43,980
(He reveals his secret.)

157
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,590
I haven't gotten married,
but I have a kid with her.

158
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,720
- They haven't had a wedding ceremony.
- I understand.

159
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,020
Yes. That can happen.

160
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,319
I'm jealous.

161
00:07:53,989 --> 00:07:57,189
Are you getting married in 2024?

162
00:07:58,429 --> 00:07:59,999
I should send some flowers.

163
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:04,569
I won't be able to make it,
but I'll send some flowers.

164
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:07,040
(I see.)

165
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:10,139
(Sending a token of friendship
to the other side of the planet)

166
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,110
That'd be crazy
if you actually sent him flowers.

167
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,550
I can send some flowers.

168
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,720
Your job?

169
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,579
I am...

170
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:21,550
a farmer. I see.

171
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:26,319
My family...

172
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:28,129
used to farm too.

173
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:32,460
My family... Rice...

174
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,499
Do you know Korean...

175
00:08:35,499 --> 00:08:36,999
- Icheon?
- Icheon rice?

176
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:40,239
Yeoju rice.

177
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,910
- Yeoju rice.
- It's very famous.

178
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,809
My...

179
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,379
Wait.

180
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:52,749
My job is painting.

181
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:55,119
- I see.
- Yes.

182
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:57,559
Comic. Cartoon.

183
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,559
- Spiderman. Batman. Superman.
- I see.

184
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,290
"Fashion King."

185
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:09,569
<i>BTS, Bong Joon Ho, Son Heung Min</i>

186
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:11,170
<i>Jay Park, Let's go</i>

187
00:09:11,739 --> 00:09:12,770
(Kian84's world-class lineup)

188
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,509
(Kian84's work lineup)

189
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:17,679
- Spiderman. Batman. Superman.
- I see.

190
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:20,679
- "Fashion King."
<i>- Let's go</i>

191
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:25,980
(They head deeper into the mountain
while Kian84 shows off his works.)

192
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,389
This place is impressive.

193
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,160
The roads are very rough.

194
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,389
(The way to Porfi's house
is like a safari tour.)

195
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,230
His house is really far.

196
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,770
- Yungas.
- Yungas?

197
00:09:43,629 --> 00:09:46,869
- This whole area is Yungas.
- Yungas.

198
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:49,069
- Yungas?
- Yungas.

199
00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:51,980
The area is called Yungas.

200
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,949
There are some houses on the ridges.

201
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:56,809
Good.

202
00:09:58,050 --> 00:09:59,979
Look on the other side.

203
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:03,589
There's a waterfall
on the side of the mountain.

204
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:05,189
- Oh, my.
- It's a waterfall.

205
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,790
The road is very rough.

206
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,490
(They keep going higher,
like they're about to touch the sky.)

207
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,800
How fascinating.

208
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,459
It's fascinating to have come
to a completely different country,

209
00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:15,229
but even within this country,

210
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:17,839
there's this place you have to drive
seven hours to get to.

211
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,800
(Porfi's house
is very deep inside the mountains.)

212
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,140
Now that I'm here...

213
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,750
Distance wise, it took longer
than going to Eric's house...

214
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,079
in the Amazon.

215
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:32,920
Let's see
what different cultures they have.

216
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:38,689
The car cannot go any farther.

217
00:10:38,689 --> 00:10:40,359
Let's get off here.

218
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:43,890
You have to walk from here.

219
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,059
- House.
- Let's go to my house.

220
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:48,069
Okay.

221
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,770
How long will it take?

222
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:55,069
(He turns on his beloved translator.)

223
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,839
How long will it take?

224
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:02,349
Twenty minutes.

225
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:04,120
Twenty minutes?

226
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,550
(Two fingers)

227
00:11:05,979 --> 00:11:08,250
(Is it 2 or 20 minutes?)

228
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:11,160
Let's go quickly.

229
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,490
Vamos?

230
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,920
Let's go quickly.

231
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,359
What does "vamos" mean?

232
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:17,059
- "Vamos" means "go."
- "Vamos."

233
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,630
(It's hard to use his translator
as much as he did in the car.)

234
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:23,329
(Speaking in Spanish)

235
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,069
(What is he saying?)

236
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,569
(He is kindly explaining about this road.)

237
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:35,179
If I knew this would happen,
I would've brought Pani Bottle.

238
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,179
I wouldn't have left Pani Bottle
with Si Eon.

239
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:41,819
(He misses Pani Bottle
now that he cannot communicate.)

240
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,760
There are mosquitoes sometimes.

241
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,319
Mosquito?

242
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,260
(He finally understands one word.)

243
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,760
I don't like mosquitoes.

244
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,959
Me too.

245
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,729
(Looking up on the translator)

246
00:11:54,729 --> 00:11:56,829
Are there snakes too?

247
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:58,240
- There are.
- Are there snakes?

248
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,339
Yes.

249
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,969
What about bears?

250
00:12:01,969 --> 00:12:05,540
Yes. I killed one down there.

251
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,079
Really?

252
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,750
(He is excited by the news
of various wild animals.)

253
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:13,849
- Do bears attack us?
- Yes.

254
00:12:13,849 --> 00:12:15,420
- They attack us?
- Yes.

255
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,359
My gosh, there are snakes and bears.

256
00:12:18,359 --> 00:12:19,959
(They still manage
to communicate somehow.)

257
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,929
What is "bear" in Korean?

258
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:24,199
Bandalgom.

259
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:25,729
Panda. It's cute.

260
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:28,270
There are pandas in Korea?

261
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,900
Korea? No.

262
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,870
There are no pandas in Korea.

263
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:36,069
Bandalgom.

264
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,709
Are there trees like this in Korea?

265
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:43,309
- This tree is kakawasi.
- Kakawasi.

266
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:45,250
- This is kakawasi.
- Kakawasi.

267
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:48,020
We don't have "kakarassi" in Korea.

268
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:50,449
Korea has ginkgo trees,

269
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:51,819
oak trees,

270
00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:53,359
- and chestnut trees.
<i>- Let's go</i>

271
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,859
That's avocado.

272
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:56,589
- Avocado.
- Oh, avocados?

273
00:12:56,929 --> 00:12:58,699
- Avocado.
- That?

274
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:00,000
This was fascinating.

275
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,599
(Bolivian avocado)

276
00:13:01,599 --> 00:13:03,000
This is my first time seeing it hanging
on a tree.

277
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I never saw the tree before.

278
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:06,400
(But...)

279
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,609
(Porfi wants to show him a lot of stuff.)

280
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:09,709
It's over there.

281
00:13:10,109 --> 00:13:12,309
We harvest once every year.

282
00:13:12,309 --> 00:13:13,339
So he...

283
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:14,449
(He doesn't understand.)

284
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,050
(Explaining...)

285
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,150
He told me...

286
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,819
Be careful not to fall.

287
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:22,120
(and looking after Kian84)

288
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,319
Be careful.

289
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:25,260
(Porfi speaks nonstop.)

290
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,959
He is chattier than I thought.

291
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,229
- Yes.
- Did he understand what you said?

292
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:34,729
He is very chatty.

293
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,000
- The conversation doesn't stop.
- Exactly.

294
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,770
I learned a lot of Spanish from him.

295
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,069
Because he kept talking,

296
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:46,839
- I naturally learned a lot.
- Cramming education.

297
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,510
If I were still there,
I would've become Spanish by now.

298
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,650
- You must've adapted to that language.
- Yes.

299
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,920
I think he's the best tutor.

300
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,490
(Best Spanish tutor)

301
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:00,719
(He is still walking with the best tutor.)

302
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:06,660
Just now, I think he said we needed
to walk for 20 minutes, not 2.

303
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,530
(That's right.)

304
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,099
Walk like this...

305
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,069
- Ten minutes.
- for ten more minutes.

306
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:13,400
Okay.

307
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:15,969
(They walk...)

308
00:14:15,969 --> 00:14:17,640
(and walk.)

309
00:14:18,579 --> 00:14:19,609
Thank you.

310
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,349
(The mountain road never ends.)

311
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,650
I think this is more remote
than the Amazon.

312
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:28,150
The Amazon is a city center.

313
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,559
- Are you tired?
- I'm okay.

314
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,490
It would take him 30 seconds on a zipline.

315
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,130
- Exactly.
- You're almost there.

316
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,160
(He keeps saying they're almost there.)

317
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,929
He keeps saying ten minutes.

318
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,000
He said that just now too.

319
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,770
He kept saying ten minutes.

320
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,740
I need to rest.

321
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,969
Let's take a rest.

322
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,870
He lied to me.
It will take more than 20 minutes.

323
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,010
(Can they arrive within the day?)

324
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,109
Yes.

325
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,319
It's amazing.

326
00:14:58,319 --> 00:14:59,579
(Si Eon and Pani Bottle drive easily
on the paved road.)

327
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,920
- We're going to a place like that, right?
- Yes.

328
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,059
I don't get sick of the view
even though it's my third time here.

329
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,189
(Si Eon coming for the 1st time
and Pani Bottle coming for the 3rd time)

330
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:09,559
- Pani Bottle.
- Yes.

331
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,530
Look at that.
There seem to be historical sites too.

332
00:15:14,770 --> 00:15:16,500
There is the Valley of the Moon nearby.

333
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,240
It's a place
with stones fixed in places...

334
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,500
where you can take a short walk.

335
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,040
(A representative site of La Paz,
the Valley of the Moon was formed...)

336
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,280
(when a mountain made of mud eroded.)

337
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,609
(It is called the Valley of the Moon...)

338
00:15:27,609 --> 00:15:30,010
(because it looks similar to the surface
of the moon.)

339
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:33,620
(The great view of the Valley of the Moon
makes you do a double take.)

340
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,949
- The Valley of the Moon.
- Yes.

341
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:36,550
- It's cool.
- It's on the right side of the road.

342
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,990
- Let's go.
- It's good to take a short walk.

343
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,219
It's quite far.

344
00:15:40,219 --> 00:15:42,030
How did I come here
on a bicycle last time?

345
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,429
- Is this the place?
- Yes.

346
00:15:45,599 --> 00:15:47,160
The ticket counter is here.

347
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:50,829
(They purchase the entrance tickets
to the Valley of the Moon.)

348
00:15:51,969 --> 00:15:53,469
(It costs 30 bolivianos.)

349
00:15:53,469 --> 00:15:54,510
Here.

350
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,109
- Can we leave our bags here?
- Yes.

351
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:00,640
- We can.
- What? Our bags?

352
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,550
- Yes, our bags.
- Thank you.

353
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,380
Thank goodness.

354
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:09,089
(They enter the Valley of the Moon.)

355
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:12,689
Can I touch it?

356
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:14,689
I think so, as long as you don't break it.

357
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,689
- Is this fur?
- Sit here.

358
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:19,359
- The dad pose.
- Good.

359
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,900
I'll make you look really tall.

360
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,300
- It looks fine, right?
- It really is the dad pose.

361
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,599
(They focus on leaving a record.)

362
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:30,870
It's cool.

363
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:33,209
(A very unfamiliar and mystical view)

364
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:34,780
This is so cool.

365
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,849
Bolivia itself is a mystical country.

366
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:40,620
Doesn't it have a lot more things to see
than you thought?

367
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,120
A lot more than what you expected
when you came here.

368
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:45,959
(You can see more than that in Bolivia.)

369
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:49,990
Awesome.

370
00:16:50,829 --> 00:16:52,030
This is amazing.

371
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,030
(We've never been to the moon.)

372
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,599
This really looks like the moon.

373
00:16:55,729 --> 00:16:58,839
(But if we do,
it would probably look like this.)

374
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,609
Do you want me to take a picture for you?

375
00:17:02,609 --> 00:17:03,969
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

376
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,179
- Should we ask them to take one for us?
- Us too?

377
00:17:08,179 --> 00:17:09,309
(He takes pictures
for the couples passing by.)

378
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,520
Can you help us take pictures?

379
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,319
(They successfully take
each other's pictures.)

380
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,589
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

381
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:18,160
- We made a heart.
- What is this?

382
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:20,660
- We made a heart.
- That was unintentional.

383
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:24,059
- Two men together...
- I don't feel great about it either.

384
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,400
Why is your face turning red?

385
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:27,359
Your face is turning red.

386
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,900
Let's go.

387
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:32,240
He lied to me.
It will take more than 20 minutes.

388
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,469
(He is kind in the midst of all this.)

389
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,609
- Good.
- Yes.

390
00:17:41,109 --> 00:17:42,109
Let's go.

391
00:17:42,109 --> 00:17:44,010
(He works up his strength
and sets off again.)

392
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:45,219
Let's go.

393
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:47,150
You're heading to a house...

394
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,319
(Past the forest...)

395
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,790
in the middle of the rainforest.

396
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,520
(and a stone road, they walk a lot more.)

397
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:54,990
(They're already on top
of a scary mountain top.)

398
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,790
The road is stony,
and it's a cliff right next to it.

399
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,699
I want to go fishing.

400
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,130
But to go fishing,
I need to go down there.

401
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,729
Forget it.

402
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,540
It's too far. I don't want to go fishing.

403
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,040
This is my house.

404
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:11,179
- House.
- My house.

405
00:18:11,179 --> 00:18:12,280
- You've finally arrived.
- Here?

406
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,050
I thought I was going to cross the border
by climbing the mountain.

407
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:16,250
Porfi's house.

408
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,880
(Surprised)

409
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,189
- There?
- Yes.

410
00:18:22,189 --> 00:18:23,420
(They need to walk more.)

411
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,689
- Your house.
- My house.

412
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,530
This is a death road.

413
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,430
Guys, do you see that over there?

414
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,730
I could've come here in ten seconds
on the zipline.

415
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:39,369
I think it took longer than one hour.
Anyway, I'm here.

416
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:42,409
- Do you see that?
- My son.

417
00:18:42,609 --> 00:18:44,109
It's his son. Hello.

418
00:18:44,109 --> 00:18:45,440
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

419
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,740
- I thought it was a bird.
- He's the son.

420
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,180
- He's cute.
- Hello.

421
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,780
Let's go.

422
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,819
(They make a last minute spurt.)

423
00:18:51,819 --> 00:18:52,980
Let's go.

424
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:57,020
The view is insane.

425
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:01,790
(Amazing)

426
00:19:02,659 --> 00:19:04,059
(He finds the start of the zipline.)

427
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,530
- It starts from here.
- Yes.

428
00:19:06,059 --> 00:19:07,930
(Like this.)

429
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:09,869
This is made really well.

430
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:12,440
- This is good.
- Yes.

431
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:19,309
(Follow the windy and narrow road.)

432
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,040
- My house.
- Yes.

433
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:25,180
Come in. It's my house.

434
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,349
Thank you.

435
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,220
Thank you for inviting me.

436
00:19:28,849 --> 00:19:30,819
This is Porfi's house.

437
00:19:30,819 --> 00:19:33,520
(Porfi's house is placed peacefully
on the hill.)

438
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:36,690
Hello.

439
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:38,930
Let me introduce them.

440
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,300
They're his family.

441
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,300
This is my sister.

442
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,069
- Your...
- This is my wife.

443
00:19:45,069 --> 00:19:47,139
- I thought she was his wife.
- My wife.

444
00:19:47,139 --> 00:19:49,569
- His wife.
- My wife.

445
00:19:49,569 --> 00:19:52,240
My name is Kian84.

446
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,309
I'm 38.

447
00:19:55,309 --> 00:19:57,649
She is 36.

448
00:19:57,649 --> 00:19:58,649
She's 36.

449
00:19:58,649 --> 00:20:01,450
We are the same age.

450
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,089
You're good.

451
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:04,919
- Your Spanish improved.
- It improved a lot, right?

452
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:08,359
- This is my son, Porfi.
- Your son.

453
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,700
- We're both Porfi. He is Porfi Junior.
- Porfi.

454
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:15,930
He is the second child,
and he has the same name as his dad.

455
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:18,240
So I named them.

456
00:20:18,569 --> 00:20:20,300
Dad is Porfi the First.

457
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,339
- And he is Porfi the 2nd.
- Porfi the 2nd?

458
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:23,710
Porfi Junior.

459
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,079
I should name my son Hee Min the second.

460
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:27,879
(Odd thought)

461
00:20:28,379 --> 00:20:30,450
Porfi.

462
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,879
I am Kian84.

463
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,520
- Kian84.
- Kian84.

464
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,419
- Yes.
- Hello Kian84.

465
00:20:36,589 --> 00:20:37,649
How old are you?

466
00:20:37,649 --> 00:20:40,220
- I'm 8.
- You're 8.

467
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,190
I used to be your age.

468
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:44,859
- I'm in 4th grade.
- In 4th grade?

469
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:47,700
Do you study well?

470
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:49,800
How does he understand?

471
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,970
They helped me translate
difficult words like this.

472
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,970
Really?

473
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,139
Which subject are you good at?

474
00:20:56,139 --> 00:20:57,740
- What subject?
- I'm good at mathematics.

475
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,879
Really?

476
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:01,210
Can you solve equations?

477
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,609
Multiplication and division.

478
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:07,379
Then I'll help you
with your math homework.

479
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,550
(Is he good at studying?)

480
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,859
Do you have it? Bring it here.

481
00:21:11,859 --> 00:21:13,290
Give me your math homework.

482
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:17,960
(While he goes to get his notebook,
he introduces Kian84 to another family.)

483
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,069
His child.

484
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:23,200
(His youngest son wrapped in a blanket)

485
00:21:24,369 --> 00:21:26,169
He was sleeping in the blanket.

486
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:28,909
- Is it a baby? It's a baby. My gosh.
- It's a baby.

487
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:31,540
- He was just born.
- It's a newborn baby.

488
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,680
(It's been less than a month
since he was born.)

489
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,450
Porfi has three sons.

490
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,919
Okay.

491
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:39,950
(Meanwhile,
Porfi Junior brings his notebook.)

492
00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:43,619
Give me.

493
00:21:43,619 --> 00:21:45,220
(He sits right next to Kian84.)

494
00:21:45,819 --> 00:21:46,889
What is this?

495
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:48,659
You're a hardworking student.

496
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:53,430
(Flipping through)

497
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,430
(In the end,
he looks at the notebook cover.)

498
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,369
"Dragon Ball."

499
00:21:58,369 --> 00:22:00,000
("Dragon Ball")

500
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,440
(He said he would teach him math,
but in the end, he talks about cartoons.)

501
00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:08,010
Your job.

502
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,780
(An artist)

503
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:12,379
- He's a comics artist.
- I'm a comics artist.

504
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,849
(Porfi Junior suddenly leaves.)

505
00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:17,919
What is it?

506
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:21,490
He's not interested in the fact
that I'm a comics artist.

507
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:22,829
Maybe he doesn't want to listen to you.

508
00:22:22,829 --> 00:22:25,700
No. That's not it.

509
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,200
- I'm a comics artist.
- "Darn it, he's a comics artist?"

510
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,599
(Get me a math teacher instead.)

511
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:31,030
- Draw for me.
- Draw for you? Okay.

512
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,139
(Doing his job
for the first time in a while)

513
00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:37,940
(Focused)

514
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,409
Porfi is really handsome.

515
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:46,379
Do you know "Dragon Ball?"

516
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,520
I watched it when I was young too.

517
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,619
(Very focused)

518
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:56,790
You drew their portrait.

519
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,859
It's a great present.

520
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:01,099
No, they're Woo Ki Myung
and Kim Doo Chi from my webtoon.

521
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:03,069
They're different people?

522
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:06,300
I should've drawn a masterpiece
like "Dragon Ball."

523
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,869
They might still think
that's their portrait.

524
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:11,040
That's right.

525
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,740
(Although they are characters
from the opposite side of the world,)

526
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,510
It makes me rather nervous
to draw in front of a child.

527
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:19,319
(but he does his best,
and they watch quietly.)

528
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:21,990
(Let's go together, Porfi!)

529
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:25,119
(They kick a ball around together...)

530
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:26,819
(and laugh together.)

531
00:23:26,819 --> 00:23:28,020
They look happy.

532
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,099
(They became close very quickly.)

533
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:37,300
(A friendship transcending
a 29-year age difference)

534
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,639
- High five.
- It looks so nice.

535
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:40,839
(It's coming soon.)

536
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,409
He's like my son.

537
00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:46,409
(They're still awkward.)

538
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:48,109
It's hard.

539
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:55,250
You draw the rest.

540
00:23:56,149 --> 00:23:58,020
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

541
00:23:59,059 --> 00:24:00,760
(Porfi Junior will draw the rest.)

542
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,230
He stopped drawing halfway.

543
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,790
- It was tough.
- He stopped drawing Kim Doo Chi halfway.

544
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,760
I hiked for too long.

545
00:24:08,369 --> 00:24:10,700
- Let's go to the valley.
- Okay.

546
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,700
Porfi said he would show me
around his house.

547
00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:18,909
- Banana tree.
- Banana tree.

548
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:21,579
It needs to grow taller.

549
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:23,780
- Fruit?
- Fruit?

550
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,119
It's a fruit tree.

551
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:26,419
(He roughly understands
that it's a fruit tree.)

552
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:27,919
(Following)

553
00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:31,089
I wash here.

554
00:24:31,089 --> 00:24:32,589
- Drink?
- Yes.

555
00:24:32,589 --> 00:24:34,119
I can drink.

556
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:37,030
- Is the water clean?
- It's fantastic. You can just drink it.

557
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,730
Is there any water you don't drink?

558
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:40,629
You even drank water from Lake Titicaca.

559
00:24:40,629 --> 00:24:42,599
(South America's sommelier
that tastes every water he comes across)

560
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:45,540
(He hydrates his mouth.)

561
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:50,869
(He hydrates his skin.)

562
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:54,510
- Give me a moment.
- Okay.

563
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,210
(He starts recharging in earnest.)

564
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,780
I was sweating the whole day.

565
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:01,819
- It's great, right?
- It's great.

566
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,250
The water's so cool.

567
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:07,159
Porfi.

568
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:09,359
(On the way to the valley after hydrating)

569
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:12,000
Porfi.

570
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,460
(Porfi suddenly stops.)

571
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:15,169
My son is coming over there.

572
00:25:15,899 --> 00:25:17,369
- Your son?
- Yes.

573
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:20,569
(Porfi's first son is crossing over
on the zipline.)

574
00:25:20,569 --> 00:25:21,909
He must be on his way back from school.

575
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,770
- Unbelievable.
- The first son.

576
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,909
The eldest son is coming back from school.

577
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:27,680
(Porfi's first son is crossing over
on the zipline.)

578
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,050
- This is his way back home?
- That's amazing.

579
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,680
- You have three sons?
- Yes.

580
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,480
- Three Porfis?
- Yes.

581
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,490
(They climb down to welcome him.)

582
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,960
(A familiar road)

583
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,030
Gosh.

584
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:47,059
(I'm not familiar with it.)

585
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:48,260
Goodness.

586
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,770
Now, Porfi the First...

587
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,470
Porfi the First...

588
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,940
is going down to greet his son.

589
00:25:59,109 --> 00:26:01,040
(I'm home. Welcome.)

590
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,680
He crossed over using the zipline.

591
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,649
- He's my son.
- Your son.

592
00:26:05,649 --> 00:26:08,819
- He is Elmer.
- Elmer.

593
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:12,419
He's good at mathematics.

594
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,389
You're good at mathematics too?

595
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:16,059
He's good.

596
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,230
The child feels rather shy.

597
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,069
But his eyes look brave.

598
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:25,200
(After showing off his son,
they continue to head to the valley.)

599
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,669
Guys, the way down is...

600
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:31,069
- Be careful.
- Bolivia's...

601
00:26:31,069 --> 00:26:32,809
If you trip, you'll fall off.

602
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,710
I understand.

603
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,349
My goodness. You must stay alert.

604
00:26:37,349 --> 00:26:42,450
(Kian84 follows Porfi.)

605
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:46,220
- The slope...
- It's beautiful.

606
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:48,359
Oh, gosh.

607
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,829
(Lying down)

608
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:54,000
It's beautiful.

609
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,869
- Oh, gosh.
- My goodness.

610
00:26:58,099 --> 00:26:59,500
It's beautiful!

611
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,869
- It's beautiful!
- You're a good friend.

612
00:27:03,169 --> 00:27:04,369
You're a good friend.

613
00:27:04,369 --> 00:27:05,480
You kept saying, "It's beautiful."

614
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,079
He invited me, so I can't say
that it hurts from falling down.

615
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:10,879
- He suddenly says it's pretty.
- You're kind.

616
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:18,889
(After walking for a long time,)

617
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:21,389
(they can finally see the valley.)

618
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,859
He is showing us his secret garden.

619
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:26,859
Guys. Gosh.

620
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:31,129
It's amazing.

621
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:35,669
(Porfi's secret valley
heals you automatically.)

622
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:37,169
I'm envious of that.

623
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,210
It's so nice.

624
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,250
This is the valley.

625
00:27:42,649 --> 00:27:44,909
We wash our clothes here.

626
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:46,379
You wash your clothes here.

627
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:50,050
I want to make a swimming pool there.

628
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,520
I'm planning to make it in the future.

629
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,419
You want to turn this
into your secret garden.

630
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,889
He wants to turn it into his garden.

631
00:27:57,889 --> 00:27:59,059
(We look forward
to Porfi's upgraded secret garden.)

632
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:00,430
I was really envious of this.

633
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:01,629
It's beautiful.

634
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,899
Let's go.

635
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:05,599
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

636
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:08,399
(They finish looking around the valley
and go back home.)

637
00:28:10,669 --> 00:28:12,780
(He starts showing his house in earnest.)

638
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,809
Porfi says he is going to show me
around his house.

639
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:18,480
So let's follow him.

640
00:28:19,349 --> 00:28:20,379
This is...

641
00:28:20,379 --> 00:28:22,389
(A chicken coop)

642
00:28:22,389 --> 00:28:24,649
(It's empty.)

643
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:27,389
Wild animals stole them away.

644
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,829
Leopard cats must've stolen them all.

645
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,129
How does everything seem similar
to my relative's house?

646
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,970
(This is the master bedroom.)

647
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:42,309
This is Porfi and his wife's room.

648
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:43,770
I sleep on this side.

649
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:47,010
This is an old laptop.

650
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:49,809
- It's a laptop?
- Yes, he had a laptop.

651
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:51,649
Laptop. Can you play games?

652
00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:53,980
It's very old.

653
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,389
Show me. This is...

654
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:57,649
(It makes a loud noise
as soon as it is turned on.)

655
00:28:57,649 --> 00:28:59,690
- Did it break down?
- It's broken.

656
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,159
- It's broken.
- Yes.

657
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,359
It's broken.

658
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:05,730
Okay.

659
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:09,629
What game do you like?

660
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:14,339
- "Mario Bros."
- "Mario Bros."

661
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,909
Doesn't Porfi look like Mario?

662
00:29:16,909 --> 00:29:18,240
He'll look exactly like him
if he wears overalls.

663
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:21,849
- My sons play games.
- Yes. Mario. The kids play it.

664
00:29:22,309 --> 00:29:25,180
I guess it's a universal thing.
Boys love games.

665
00:29:25,349 --> 00:29:28,649
Kids play games on their dad's computers.
A virus gets into their computers.

666
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:30,589
Or they break the computers.
So kids get scolded for that.

667
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:32,720
There it is.

668
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,329
I like "Mario Bros."

669
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:38,129
Hey, you. Do you want to play a round?

670
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:40,159
Go.

671
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,500
That's...

672
00:29:44,629 --> 00:29:45,669
It's over.

673
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,540
You have to jump.

674
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,569
- Try again. You have two lives.
- Okay.

675
00:29:49,569 --> 00:29:52,309
I'm not good at this.

676
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:54,309
- My sons are good at this.
- I see.

677
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,879
When I went to my relative's house
in the countryside,

678
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,819
- That again?
- my cousin's room looked like that.

679
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:03,220
So is your relative's house
in Bolivia or the Amazon?

680
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,619
- Which one is it?
- You can only choose one.

681
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:06,520
- Which one is closer?
- It's a mix of the two.

682
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,430
Let me explain.
The house overlooks the Yeoju River.

683
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,859
And there's Mount Yeoju.

684
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,460
- Is it Bolmazon then?
- Yes.

685
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,470
(It's a mix of Bolivia and the Amazon.)

686
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,470
Bolmazon.

687
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,540
So cute.

688
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,909
- Your cat?
- Oh, my.

689
00:30:21,909 --> 00:30:23,770
- Are they kitties?
- He's raising those kitties.

690
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,169
- They are so cute.
- Gosh.

691
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:28,909
(The kitties are sleeping.)

692
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:31,210
They are my kitties.

693
00:30:31,609 --> 00:30:34,349
Gosh. They are smaller than his palm.
They are adorable.

694
00:30:34,819 --> 00:30:36,149
- They were sleeping.
- Aren't they wildcats?

695
00:30:36,149 --> 00:30:37,220
They are kitties.

696
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,559
- They are kitties.
- Gosh. They are so cute.

697
00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:41,960
Oh, my. Look at them.
They look like dolls.

698
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,129
I felt bad for them.

699
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:45,629
Their mom went out to hunt for food.

700
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,730
Why did you feel bad?
She's coming back, though.

701
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,329
- Right.
- Something could've happened to the mom.

702
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,409
- I see. She must be cooking now.
- Okay.

703
00:30:55,409 --> 00:30:56,740
What's that? A furnace?

704
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,339
His sister was cooking there.

705
00:30:58,339 --> 00:31:00,680
This house smells just like
my relative's house in the countryside.

706
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,079
It's coming from the fire in the furnace.

707
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,550
Did your relatives bake bread there?

708
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,180
No. It's the smell of the furnace.

709
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:09,849
(This time, he shows his children's room.)

710
00:31:09,849 --> 00:31:11,649
- I see. His kids sleep here.
- Yes, my sons.

711
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:13,790
They study here too.

712
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,589
- The oldest and the second-oldest.
- Yes.

713
00:31:15,589 --> 00:31:17,859
(The oldest, Elmer,
the second-oldest, Porfi Junior)

714
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,000
- He's already studying.
- Yes.

715
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:21,559
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

716
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,000
Can I take a look?

717
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,169
A mini car.

718
00:31:25,169 --> 00:31:26,940
(Elmer is assembling a mini car.)

719
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,240
This is an engine for the mini car.

720
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:31,770
Elmer made this.

721
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,309
Really? That's amazing.

722
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,950
(Made by Elmer)

723
00:31:37,149 --> 00:31:39,180
I used to play with mini cars
when I was a kid too.

724
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,950
Why do you have so many pencils?

725
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,490
I have to draw...

726
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,720
and color them too.
So I need a lot of them.

727
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,530
Really? Do you like to draw?

728
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Yes.

729
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,359
You know what? I draw for a living.

730
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,530
Did you draw this?

731
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,230
- Did you paint this?
- Yes.

732
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,940
Show them to him, son.

733
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,339
Can I see?

734
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:03,270
(Surprised)

735
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:06,510
His oldest son liked to draw.

736
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:08,339
And his drawings were quite polished.

737
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:13,050
(Showing them off)

738
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,450
Hold on. This...

739
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:17,119
Did you use watercolor paint?

740
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:19,589
Yes. I used that.

741
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,290
Great job.

742
00:32:21,819 --> 00:32:24,889
You used watercolor paint for this.
But the texture...

743
00:32:25,329 --> 00:32:27,659
How should I put it?
It looks like acrylic paint.

744
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:30,169
You can adjust the texture
however you want.

745
00:32:30,169 --> 00:32:31,569
- A lion.
- The lion looks great.

746
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:34,139
(Elmer is showing a lot of potential.)

747
00:32:34,139 --> 00:32:35,970
You're very good.

748
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:38,040
He's only ten years old.
So that's considered...

749
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,609
- He's so talented.
- very good.

750
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:41,940
I used to teach kids at an art school too.

751
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,909
That's very good for a ten-year-old.

752
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:45,819
- So his level would be advanced?
- He's 13 years old.

753
00:32:45,819 --> 00:32:46,980
- He's 13.
- But he's still good.

754
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,680
- He's 13 years old.
- He's in 6th grade.

755
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,419
Well, a 13-year-old
can pull that off more easily.

756
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:54,419
But his drawings are polished.
I don't see any white spots.

757
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:57,030
When you look at kids' drawings,
they stop working on it as they get tired.

758
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:59,629
But he filled in all the details
and completed all the drawings.

759
00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:01,659
I could tell he was diligent.

760
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,030
(He gets up
after looking at Elmer's paintings.)

761
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,940
What's this?

762
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,669
- Gosh. It brings back my old memories.
- Goodness.

763
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:12,540
So I have no choice
but to mention it again.

764
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,480
When I went to the countryside,

765
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,649
the guys in the countryside
always had a TV like this in their rooms.

766
00:33:17,649 --> 00:33:19,619
- Bolmazon.
- Seriously. I'm not lying.

767
00:33:19,619 --> 00:33:21,750
- They bought this clip.
- This video.

768
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,859
Back then, we had PlayStation One.

769
00:33:25,859 --> 00:33:30,460
This is very old.
We had this for ten years.

770
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,700
- You had it only for ten years?
- Yes.

771
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,500
It looks like it's been here for 40 years.

772
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,770
(Since 2012)

773
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:40,139
I see. Gosh.
It looks just like my relative's house.

774
00:33:40,899 --> 00:33:44,569
The rooms, the smell of the furnace,
and the gaming machine.

775
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:47,680
I saw a resemblance of my hometown
in the Amazon.

776
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,909
But I saw a resemblance
of my hometown in Bolivia too.

777
00:33:50,379 --> 00:33:53,050
The residents in Yeoju
might not agree with me.

778
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:56,190
This was my life in Gyesin-ri
where I grew up.

779
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:59,260
In the 1990s, this was my life
in Gyesin-ri, Yeoju, Gyeonggi Province.

780
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,490
I'm so serious.

781
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,460
Okay.

782
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,430
I shouldn't scrutinize
their rooms too much.

783
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:09,200
They're reaching that rebellious phase.

784
00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:12,369
The kids might be sensitive. I'll leave.

785
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:13,940
(He's sweet enough to worry
about their rebellious phase.)

786
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:18,669
It looks just like the house I grew up in
when I was a kid.

787
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,210
It's the same.

788
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:26,149
Back in my country... My childhood.
It's the same.

789
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:28,720
I'm so happy to live here...

790
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:33,490
because all the things
this land gives me...

791
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,290
- Porfi, sit.
- Yes.

792
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:40,559
(He gets up as soon as he sits down.)

793
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:44,129
(Is that an avocado?)

794
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:46,770
It's not an avocado. It's a mango.

795
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,399
- It was a mango.
- A mango.

796
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,639
- The avocado trees are over there.
- Porfi...

797
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,240
- bragged about his orchard...
- This is a mango tree.

798
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:54,740
for about three hours.

799
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:56,450
So I'm good now. No more of that.

800
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:58,919
- Okay, Porfi.
- Yes.

801
00:34:58,919 --> 00:35:01,050
- This is coffee.
- Porfi is bragging about his fruit.

802
00:35:01,319 --> 00:35:02,849
- Coffee.
- Porfi is bragging about his fruit.

803
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,990
- Porfi.
- This is coffee.

804
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,559
Porfi. Coffee?

805
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:09,089
- Coffee.
- Americano.

806
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,030
- Coffee.
- A coffee tree is in front of his house.

807
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,059
Then they are coffee beans?

808
00:35:14,059 --> 00:35:15,300
Yes, they are.

809
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,700
(He's talking about the wild coffee tree.)

810
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,300
Okay. Porfi. Good.

811
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,109
- He seems very exhausted.
- You seem out of it.

812
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:26,780
I need to rest.

813
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,409
- Porfi.
- I...

814
00:35:29,579 --> 00:35:31,450
Porfi is so talkative.

815
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:33,619
I want to rest.

816
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:35,919
Porfi.

817
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,550
(There he goes again.)

818
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,760
(He still has a lot to show off.)

819
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,359
Okay.

820
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,899
He'll show us his kitchen.

821
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,470
I wanted to stop
after checking out his sons' room.

822
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,839
- This is it.
- Porfi is showing me the kitchen...

823
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,010
regardless of what I want.

824
00:35:57,069 --> 00:35:59,410
By the way,
the kitchen smells just like...

825
00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:01,879
the house in the countryside back home.

826
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:03,410
- Back then, the wall...
- Right.

827
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:06,979
Porfi! A gun.

828
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,519
You...

829
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:14,660
(Skilled)

830
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,089
Porfi. You...

831
00:36:17,089 --> 00:36:20,100
This is for hunting.

832
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,269
What do you hunt with the gun?

833
00:36:22,269 --> 00:36:24,229
Wild pheasant.

834
00:36:24,229 --> 00:36:25,229
Wild pheasant.

835
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:27,999
- He's allowed to have a gun, right?
- It must've been uncomfortable.

836
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:29,069
I don't know.

837
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:30,339
- Do Yeon.
- Is it for protection?

838
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:31,669
In Bolivia,

839
00:36:31,669 --> 00:36:34,240
people are allowed to have rifles
for hunting purposes.

840
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,310
- For hunting.
- Yes.

841
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:38,209
He told me he hunted pheasants
and cooked them for food.

842
00:36:38,209 --> 00:36:40,280
- Pheasant.
- You can't get fried chicken delivered.

843
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,720
- Right. There...
- So they hunt pheasants.

844
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,919
- Just like how we order delivery food,
- Right.

845
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:46,890
- they shoot pheasant with their rifles.
- They do that right away.

846
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,720
Then they must have pheasant
and beer together.

847
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,030
- Pheasant and beer.
- Pheasant and beer.

848
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,959
- Or pheasant and rice.
- Pheasant and rice.

849
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,700
Pheasant and rice, not chicken and rice.

850
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,300
- Fried pheasant.
- They are tasty too.

851
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,870
- Fried pheasant. Seasoned pheasant.
- Seasoned pheasant.

852
00:36:57,229 --> 00:36:59,200
I mean, I knew we were all the same.

853
00:36:59,769 --> 00:37:03,010
Who knew there would be a house in Bolivia
resembling the house in my hometown?

854
00:37:03,439 --> 00:37:05,709
We should film the next episode
in your hometown.

855
00:37:05,709 --> 00:37:07,709
- I'm so curious.
- But a lot has changed now.

856
00:37:07,709 --> 00:37:09,010
Let's do it in your relative's house.

857
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:10,209
- It changed a lot.
- I'm curious.

858
00:37:10,209 --> 00:37:12,519
- That's the oven.
- The oven.

859
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,850
The furnace.

860
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:14,979
- Did you have that in Yeoju?
- The furnace.

861
00:37:14,979 --> 00:37:17,019
- The furnace?
- We had a furnace.

862
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:20,919
We're going to cook chicken
in the furnace.

863
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,459
- We'll use the stones here.
- Really?

864
00:37:23,459 --> 00:37:24,459
(Porfi doesn't hesitate.)

865
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:25,999
- That's... Gosh.
- That must be hot.

866
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:27,260
Why did he put his hand in there?

867
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:29,430
We're going to use the stones here
to cook the chicken.

868
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:31,269
Porfi, are you a good cook?

869
00:37:31,269 --> 00:37:32,269
Yes.

870
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:34,539
I can cook pasta and everything.

871
00:37:34,539 --> 00:37:36,010
My wife helps me too.

872
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,109
People who sound confident like him
are usually good at cooking.

873
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:40,910
He was proud about his cooking.

874
00:37:41,209 --> 00:37:44,749
And thank you for inviting me to dinner.

875
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:47,220
Thank you. I'll go and cook.

876
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:50,189
I'll rest up now.

877
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:53,390
Porfi. He's so chatty.

878
00:37:55,089 --> 00:37:56,589
He's so chatty.

879
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:02,330
Seriously. He never stopped talking.

880
00:38:02,499 --> 00:38:06,769
That's why I felt bad.
I should have been friendly like him.

881
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,609
But I was so out of it.

882
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,979
Thank you for having me.

883
00:38:13,939 --> 00:38:14,979
(Make yourself at home.)

884
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,350
(I should get some rest now.)

885
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,350
- I should lie down for a bit.
- You must have been so tired.

886
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:25,149
- Actually, I woke up at 6 a.m.
- Right.

887
00:38:25,149 --> 00:38:26,919
Wait. Did I wake up at 5 a.m.?

888
00:38:26,919 --> 00:38:28,419
Ever since you woke up...

889
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,589
- I've been out.
- Gosh.

890
00:38:30,589 --> 00:38:32,660
I couldn't sleep at all in the car
because I was nervous.

891
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,800
- Right.
- You were in the car for eight hours.

892
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,200
- You hiked for an hour.
- Gosh.

893
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,430
(He's fatigued
from the long trip and hike.)

894
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:40,539
(But Porfi doesn't rest.)

895
00:38:41,939 --> 00:38:43,609
- Did you sleep there?
- I feel bad.

896
00:38:43,609 --> 00:38:46,010
- Did you sleep for a long time?
- I took a break.

897
00:38:47,379 --> 00:38:51,280
(He wakes up at the bustling sounds.)

898
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:57,289
(The father and son
show up with something.)

899
00:38:57,289 --> 00:38:59,160
- Did it die?
- It bites.

900
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,189
It's alive?

901
00:39:00,189 --> 00:39:01,660
Wait. I'll take a picture.

902
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,760
Wait.

903
00:39:03,789 --> 00:39:04,859
Just now...

904
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:05,959
(Is that a lizard?)

905
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:07,160
Gosh. It's a lizard.

906
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,399
- A lizard.
- A lizard.

907
00:39:08,399 --> 00:39:10,470
- That's cute.
- Lizards are super cute.

908
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,939
- That's so tiny.
- This was really funny. Watch.

909
00:39:12,939 --> 00:39:14,999
- Why?
- I thought it was dead.

910
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,010
- Let's release it.
- It played dead.

911
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:19,379
- It relaxed its legs.
- Yes.

912
00:39:19,379 --> 00:39:20,379
- On purpose?
- Right?

913
00:39:20,379 --> 00:39:21,580
It played dead.

914
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,580
- To run away.
- Right. Gosh.

915
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,950
(I got you, didn't I?)

916
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:26,620
- Four.
- So cute.

917
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,649
Did you catch it?

918
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,189
(A tiny yet precious lizard)

919
00:39:32,189 --> 00:39:33,390
Let it live.

920
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:35,359
That's cute.

921
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:38,229
- Kian84.
- Porfi.

922
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,899
You should sleep in the master bedroom.

923
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,769
Where will you sleep, Porfi?

924
00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:45,430
I'm going to sleep outside.

925
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:48,140
- He's so sweet.
- He's so kind.

926
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,640
I can sleep on the floor.

927
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,910
I'll sleep on the floor
between your sons' beds.

928
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:57,280
I'm not that uncivilized.
I have some manners too. How can I?

929
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:58,749
I wasn't comfortable...

930
00:39:58,749 --> 00:40:01,919
- making his wife sleep outside.
- Right.

931
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:03,890
- You wouldn't feel good about it.
- Right.

932
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:06,990
The bed? Okay.

933
00:40:07,289 --> 00:40:08,789
You got your wish.
You got to sleep in a tent.

934
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:11,589
Wasn't that on your bucket list?
Sleeping at the top of the mountain?

935
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:14,300
- Porfi didn't insist...
- No?

936
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,999
when I said no.

937
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:18,269
- I see. He should've insisted twice.
- He accepted it right away.

938
00:40:18,269 --> 00:40:19,499
- Right.
- That's how it is in Korea.

939
00:40:19,499 --> 00:40:21,800
- "But still. Sleep inside."
- "Sleep inside."

940
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,839
- "It's okay."
- "Just sleep inside."

941
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,569
- "It's okay."
- He should have insisted like this.

942
00:40:25,569 --> 00:40:27,240
Right. When I said I was fine...

943
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,979
- "Okay"
- "How about a tent?"

944
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,649
(Chuckling)

945
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,680
You wanted to camp out overnight.

946
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,749
I wanted to sleep
around the bonfire with Si Eon.

947
00:40:34,749 --> 00:40:37,720
But sleeping there alone was a bit sad.

948
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:40,319
(He heads out to set up the tent.)

949
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:43,189
People here don't say no
for the sake of formality.

950
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,629
But this is more comfortable.

951
00:40:46,729 --> 00:40:48,999
This is the tent I wanted.

952
00:40:49,669 --> 00:40:53,269
Gosh. This will be perfect
with the sleeping bag Si Eon gave me.

953
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:59,209
(He swiftly sets up the tent.)

954
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,780
(Struggling)

955
00:41:05,209 --> 00:41:07,220
(She helps him after observing him.)

956
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,319
Thank you.

957
00:41:08,879 --> 00:41:10,390
(Skillful)

958
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,890
- She helped me out.
- Okay.

959
00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:14,120
Thank you.

960
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:16,589
This is perfect.

961
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:18,660
(Thanks to her,
he sets up his shelter in no time.)

962
00:41:19,229 --> 00:41:21,600
(And Si Eon gives him the sleeping bag
on the first day.)

963
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:23,430
(I don't need this!)

964
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:24,899
(He said he didn't need it.)

965
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,339
I'm glad you listened to him.

966
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:27,539
So you could use it that day.

967
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:29,200
- That saved me from freezing to death.
- Gosh.

968
00:41:30,269 --> 00:41:32,839
(He finally has a chance
to use the sleeping bag.)

969
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,140
What would you have done without Si Eon?

970
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,379
This is my house.

971
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:40,780
(He heads somewhere with a light heart.)

972
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:44,050
(He arrives at the water tap in no time.)

973
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:45,990
(He takes off his shirt as it's hot.)

974
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:48,519
- I was so sweaty.
- Right.

975
00:41:48,959 --> 00:41:50,430
(He takes off his shirt.)

976
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,600
The water must have been so cool.

977
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:54,800
(He sticks his head in first.)

978
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,769
(A man in the wild)

979
00:41:56,769 --> 00:41:59,499
Gosh. So manly! Look at his back muscles.

980
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,539
(His manliness explodes.)

981
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:05,640
(This is how a manly guy takes a shower.)

982
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:08,410
Gosh. This is a clip
from "I Am a Natural Person."

983
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,479
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

984
00:42:09,479 --> 00:42:11,680
(He's like a beast.)

985
00:42:13,249 --> 00:42:14,319
(Faltering)

986
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:15,450
- That was cool.
- I slipped.

987
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:17,550
- What was that?
- No, that was cool.

988
00:42:19,189 --> 00:42:20,720
(Faltering)

989
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:25,089
(He continues taking a shower
as if nothing happened.)

990
00:42:25,229 --> 00:42:27,560
Gosh. He's gargling like that.

991
00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:29,569
Gosh. It's so cool.

992
00:42:30,169 --> 00:42:32,269
(After taking a cold shower,)

993
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:37,039
(he wipes himself off
with the clothes he wore.)

994
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:40,039
- Gosh. He's using it as a towel.
- His underwear.

995
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,479
(That's so cool.)

996
00:42:41,479 --> 00:42:42,850
- That wasn't a towel?
- No.

997
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:45,550
- I thought it had the same pattern.
- Right.

998
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,979
- You do what you have to do!
- What a cool guy.

999
00:42:47,979 --> 00:42:49,749
People don't do that even in the military.

1000
00:42:49,749 --> 00:42:50,990
I'm a man!

1001
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:52,149
- That.
- That's crazy.

1002
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,060
Goodness. The sun went down so quickly.

1003
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:55,289
(The sun has gone down during his shower.)

1004
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:56,589
Gosh.

1005
00:42:56,589 --> 00:42:58,689
(He puts on the clothes
he tossed earlier.)

1006
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,800
(He's going to wash his clothes.)

1007
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,030
(Half-hearted)

1008
00:43:04,169 --> 00:43:05,669
(He's washing his socks.)

1009
00:43:05,669 --> 00:43:07,939
(But the socks have lost their color.)

1010
00:43:07,999 --> 00:43:09,470
- Isn't that the mood light?
- I didn't have detergent.

1011
00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:11,939
- Right?
- A rotten mushroom.

1012
00:43:11,939 --> 00:43:13,510
- He's washing it there.
- A mood light.

1013
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,680
A rotten-mushroom light.

1014
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:17,879
(He washes the mood light,)

1015
00:43:17,879 --> 00:43:19,249
(hoping it would regain its color.)

1016
00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:22,180
(Is he done?)

1017
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,749
My clothes are soaked in sweat.

1018
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:25,950
Gosh. Look at the collar.

1019
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,589
- You didn't have detergent?
- He's just doing it by hand.

1020
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:33,260
(That's how...)

1021
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:34,729
(our moms used to wash clothes.)

1022
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:36,300
You didn't have detergent, right?

1023
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,729
I didn't want to use detergent.

1024
00:43:37,729 --> 00:43:39,229
I didn't want to harm the environment.

1025
00:43:40,069 --> 00:43:41,769
(He puts down the washed clothes.)

1026
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,939
(He puts down
his only pair of socks as well.)

1027
00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:50,209
I see. He hung them there to wring them.

1028
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:52,649
He's doing things like he's at home.

1029
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,189
Gosh. The clothes got stretched.

1030
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:58,220
(He wrings the socks too.)

1031
00:43:59,959 --> 00:44:01,459
(Flinging over)

1032
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,859
(After taking a cool shower
and washing the clothes,)

1033
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,800
(he heads back home
where his cozy tent awaits.)

1034
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:11,830
(There's no point in taking a shower now.)

1035
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:13,839
- He stepped on soil again.
- There's no point.

1036
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:14,870
(The man who lives
just because he was born)

1037
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:17,939
I couldn't do anything about my feet.

1038
00:44:17,939 --> 00:44:19,539
(That's Kian84.)

1039
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:23,609
This is the campsite
Pani Bottle has been bragging about.

1040
00:44:23,910 --> 00:44:25,680
- Hello.
- Hello.

1041
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,720
(They arrive at the campsite
Pani Bottle wanted to come to.)

1042
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,819
Actually, this is my third visit here.

1043
00:44:30,819 --> 00:44:32,419
- Yes. Good.
- Yes.

1044
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,660
- Do you remember him?
- Yes. I think so.

1045
00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:36,060
Maybe not.

1046
00:44:36,129 --> 00:44:37,990
(Gosh. People like him catch on fast.)

1047
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:42,600
(He visited in early 2022
and said the same thing at the campsite.)

1048
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:46,100
This is the view.

1049
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,339
(The spot Pani Bottle
has been recommending)

1050
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:48,439
Look at the view.

1051
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:51,370
Let's start a campfire
over there at night.

1052
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:52,510
- Sure.
- And let's gaze at it.

1053
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:53,580
Sounds great.

1054
00:44:54,339 --> 00:44:56,310
Come on. Bring Kian84 here.

1055
00:44:58,050 --> 00:44:59,479
Is there a way he can join us?

1056
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:02,080
I really wanted Kian84
to come to the campsite.

1057
00:45:02,519 --> 00:45:03,789
I came here three times for a reason.

1058
00:45:03,789 --> 00:45:05,050
The view is amazing every time.

1059
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:06,660
- It's making my heart beat.
- Yes.

1060
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,760
- The gray house. Okay.
- Yes.

1061
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,459
- Si Eon.
- That's nice.

1062
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,100
- It's similar to glamping.
- Yes.

1063
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,330
- Right. It's set-up nicely.
- Yes.

1064
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,800
Gosh!

1065
00:45:16,269 --> 00:45:17,600
And where's the toilet?

1066
00:45:18,569 --> 00:45:19,640
(The cozy lodging comes with a bathroom.)

1067
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:20,669
Okay.

1068
00:45:21,069 --> 00:45:22,539
We can take a shower here too.

1069
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,209
I don't think
there's a lid for the toilet.

1070
00:45:24,209 --> 00:45:25,910
- There is. I'm sure of it.
- Over there.

1071
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:29,039
- There is one. Yes, it's here.
- There's a toilet seat too.

1072
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:30,249
That's a great place.

1073
00:45:30,249 --> 00:45:31,879
No!

1074
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:33,620
His English makes no sense,
but I can understand him.

1075
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,149
(Pani Bottle's recommendation
comes with everything.)

1076
00:45:36,149 --> 00:45:38,149
Pani Bottle, thank you...

1077
00:45:38,149 --> 00:45:39,959
- Don't mention it.
- for bringing me here.

1078
00:45:40,819 --> 00:45:42,620
This place is the best
when you have company.

1079
00:45:43,129 --> 00:45:44,459
Coming here alone is sad.

1080
00:45:44,459 --> 00:45:46,430
I feel bad. I hope Kian84 was here too.

1081
00:45:48,229 --> 00:45:49,830
(The owner of the campsite
brings them a treat.)

1082
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,830
What's this?

1083
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,669
- A drink.
- Is it alcoholic?

1084
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,140
- Yes.
- Okay.

1085
00:45:55,569 --> 00:45:57,069
- Thank you very much.
- I'll try it. Okay. Thank you.

1086
00:45:57,069 --> 00:45:59,539
- Is that herb?
- The leaves. They're tree leaves.

1087
00:45:59,879 --> 00:46:02,010
(This guy had it in early 2022.)

1088
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:04,680
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1089
00:46:05,209 --> 00:46:06,280
Should we raise our glasses?

1090
00:46:06,749 --> 00:46:07,879
For Kian84.

1091
00:46:08,419 --> 00:46:09,689
He's not here.

1092
00:46:09,789 --> 00:46:11,249
I feel bad that
we're drinking this by ourselves.

1093
00:46:11,249 --> 00:46:12,789
For Kian84.

1094
00:46:12,859 --> 00:46:15,189
Sorry, Kian84. Come back already!

1095
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,789
Goodness. He's looking out for Kian84.

1096
00:46:16,789 --> 00:46:18,229
- Cheers to Kian84!
- Cheers to Kian84!

1097
00:46:18,229 --> 00:46:20,499
(To our comrade
who left to the unknown land)

1098
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,060
(A thumbs-up)

1099
00:46:22,459 --> 00:46:24,229
(The sun goes down in no time.)

1100
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:28,169
All right. Pani Bottle.
Get the fire going, please.

1101
00:46:28,769 --> 00:46:29,839
Is it working?

1102
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:30,839
(Blowing on the bonfire)

1103
00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:32,879
(Inhaling)

1104
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:36,649
I got it.

1105
00:46:36,649 --> 00:46:37,979
The campsite looks amazing.

1106
00:46:37,979 --> 00:46:39,780
I didn't know there was a place
like that in Bolivia.

1107
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,919
It looks romantic.

1108
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:42,519
I'll grill the steak now.

1109
00:46:45,419 --> 00:46:46,789
There it comes. It's a big steak.

1110
00:46:46,789 --> 00:46:48,060
It didn't sizzle.

1111
00:46:48,789 --> 00:46:49,990
- Is that a club?
- Gosh.

1112
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,729
- It's sizzling now.
- Gosh. That looks tasty.

1113
00:46:52,999 --> 00:46:53,999
This is nice.

1114
00:46:53,999 --> 00:46:55,930
Let's add the garlic cloves.

1115
00:46:55,930 --> 00:46:57,800
- Go ahead.
- Garlic cloves.

1116
00:46:57,870 --> 00:46:58,999
Great.

1117
00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:02,269
This is what I'm talking about.
This is camping in South America.

1118
00:47:02,269 --> 00:47:03,269
Right.

1119
00:47:06,609 --> 00:47:07,910
It sounds amazing.

1120
00:47:08,109 --> 00:47:10,050
Yes. It's cooking nicely.

1121
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:11,209
Should I check on the fire?

1122
00:47:11,209 --> 00:47:12,680
- Gosh. There it is.
- Goodness.

1123
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:14,149
(The highlight of camping in South America
is in full bloom.)

1124
00:47:14,149 --> 00:47:15,950
(Flipping)

1125
00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:19,660
What do you think?
Hey, it's cooked! No way.

1126
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:21,660
We have to cook it more.
It has to be cooked all the way.

1127
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,160
I think the sausage is almost cooked.

1128
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,490
I think we can eat that now.

1129
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:31,200
(He tastes the sausage to see
if it's fully cooked.)

1130
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:36,370
(After checking that it's cooked nicely,
he feeds Pani Bottle.)

1131
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,979
- Isn't it so different?
- It's tasty.

1132
00:47:42,979 --> 00:47:45,010
- Isn't it so good?
- Yes. The onion isn't spicy.

1133
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:46,050
(It's perfect with the onion.)

1134
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,890
(Corn)

1135
00:47:52,149 --> 00:47:54,359
(He adds the South American corn.)

1136
00:47:56,019 --> 00:47:58,060
- This is it. It has to look like this.
- Gosh.

1137
00:47:58,760 --> 00:47:59,859
This is it.

1138
00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:01,399
But the corn is huge.

1139
00:48:01,399 --> 00:48:03,470
- That's huge. Yes.
- They look like teeth.

1140
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:06,470
The sausage is big too. Everything is big.

1141
00:48:06,899 --> 00:48:08,700
It's just cooking slowly,
but it's going well.

1142
00:48:09,769 --> 00:48:11,140
It's a matter of speed.

1143
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:13,780
It looks like they're about done.

1144
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:14,979
- Right?
- Yes.

1145
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,280
Gosh.

1146
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:17,979
The pan caught on fire.

1147
00:48:18,249 --> 00:48:19,720
- What?
- Goodness.

1148
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,580
- Raise it.
- It's a fire show.

1149
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:22,819
It must have a smoky flavor.

1150
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:25,149
(Escaping)

1151
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:27,019
We can give it to a dog.

1152
00:48:29,019 --> 00:48:30,359
It's almost cooked.

1153
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:31,830
- Where's the plate?
- Right there.

1154
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:32,859
Should we try it?

1155
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,200
I think it's cooked.

1156
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,069
- That looks good.
- It cuts nicely.

1157
00:48:38,069 --> 00:48:39,129
That's amazing.

1158
00:48:39,999 --> 00:48:41,300
Let me try the bone.

1159
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:43,370
- We need to cook the bone a bit more.
- Really?

1160
00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:46,140
- But if you want to try it.
- I'll try it.

1161
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:47,910
Is it hot?

1162
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:48,910
(He carefully picks it up.)

1163
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:50,080
I got it.

1164
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,180
(Munching)

1165
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:57,720
(Gnawing)

1166
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,390
Pani Bottle is quiet.

1167
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:06,229
- Si Eon. It's good.
- Yes.

1168
00:49:06,229 --> 00:49:08,499
- Is it?
- It's good.

1169
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,300
- It's cooked perfectly.
- Really?

1170
00:49:10,629 --> 00:49:12,330
- We didn't season it, right?
- We didn't.

1171
00:49:12,629 --> 00:49:13,700
But why is it tasty?

1172
00:49:14,269 --> 00:49:15,269
(Getting some salt)

1173
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,169
(Try this.)

1174
00:49:19,879 --> 00:49:20,879
It's delicious.

1175
00:49:22,109 --> 00:49:23,680
Wait, what's this?

1176
00:49:24,149 --> 00:49:26,819
- It's perfect, and it's not tough at all.
- Right?

1177
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:32,120
It's really tasty.

1178
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,459
(The unexpected steak expert takes
a bite too.)

1179
00:49:34,019 --> 00:49:35,519
It's unbelievable.

1180
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:37,890
I was really surprised. Can I get
one more piece? It's so good.

1181
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:40,499
- Let's grill one more piece.
- How is this so good?

1182
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,899
(It's hard to understand,
but it's successful.)

1183
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,300
I was happy that he enjoyed it.

1184
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,470
Pani Bottle only eats delicious food.

1185
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:52,640
Is the corn cooked? Wait a minute.

1186
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,740
It's hot.

1187
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:55,010
(Eating)

1188
00:49:58,249 --> 00:49:59,410
- It's cooked.
- What?

1189
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:01,249
- This is good too.
- Be careful. It's hot.

1190
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:02,519
It's cooked.

1191
00:50:02,519 --> 00:50:03,620
(He just threw it on the grill.)

1192
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,120
- Gosh.
- It's cooked.

1193
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:07,120
- It's nice and sweet.
- How is this possible?

1194
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:08,959
I can't understand it.

1195
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,060
How is this proceeding?

1196
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,499
- All we need is that it works.
- This is great.

1197
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:17,499
(It's hot.)

1198
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:23,470
(He gives him food carelessly.)

1199
00:50:24,410 --> 00:50:25,470
(Even if it flows thoughtlessly...)

1200
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:26,709
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1201
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,479
(Everything is delicious.)

1202
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:36,950
(Everything is satisfying.)

1203
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:39,220
(The taste of traveling)

1204
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,859
It's therapeutic camping.

1205
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,620
Let's cheer.

1206
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,390
You worked hard. I had a lot of fun today.

1207
00:50:46,499 --> 00:50:47,600
It's a splendid night.

1208
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:49,560
- They travel well together.
- It's easy to cut it.

1209
00:50:50,899 --> 00:50:52,970
(Their official dinner)

1210
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:57,439
(On the other side of Earth
where they came on a trip by accident,)

1211
00:50:58,169 --> 00:51:01,780
(they're enjoying a relaxing time.)

1212
00:51:03,609 --> 00:51:05,080
Bravo.

1213
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,550
I'm happy to see him eat with gusto.

1214
00:51:10,249 --> 00:51:11,720
I just thought of this.

1215
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,959
What do you think Kian84 is eating
right now?

1216
00:51:14,359 --> 00:51:15,459
(Chuckling)

1217
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,689
Tree leaves?

1218
00:51:17,689 --> 00:51:19,760
(Laughing)

1219
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:21,560
I bet he likes them.

1220
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:24,200
- While saying, "These are tree leaves."
- What if he's eating roots?

1221
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,470
- Am I some caterpillar?
- He wouldn't hate it.

1222
00:51:26,769 --> 00:51:29,169
it's heartwarming that whenever
they see or eat something nice,

1223
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,439
- they think of Kian84.
- They think of Kian84.

1224
00:51:30,439 --> 00:51:33,910
Since we were so comfortable
and eating good food,

1225
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:36,039
- I felt bad for him.
- There's no need to.

1226
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,149
- I'm full.
- It's really delicious.

1227
00:51:38,149 --> 00:51:39,680
(They're enjoying food and feeling full.)

1228
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,249
- The fire is good, right?
- It's really great.

1229
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,149
It'll be perfect if these two burn.

1230
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:47,419
If the fire were bigger,
it'd be nice to sit here too.

1231
00:51:47,419 --> 00:51:49,120
(They hear the sound of a drone camera.)

1232
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:53,260
- Is this it?
- Yes.

1233
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,399
(Paying attention)

1234
00:51:54,399 --> 00:51:56,030
- You can't do that.
- It's not mine.

1235
00:51:56,459 --> 00:51:57,870
- Why even...
- No.

1236
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:59,330
All of us. Okay?

1237
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:01,169
(She acts unexpectedly.)

1238
00:52:01,169 --> 00:52:02,399
Hey.

1239
00:52:02,399 --> 00:52:05,209
(Surprised)

1240
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:06,510
(Pause)

1241
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:09,010
- That's our camera.
- Goodness.

1242
00:52:09,010 --> 00:52:11,780
No matter what,
she shouldn't throw it like that.

1243
00:52:12,149 --> 00:52:14,280
- What are you doing now?
- Bring that out of the sky.

1244
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,680
That is not ours.

1245
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,789
(The woman is furious.)

1246
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:20,089
(In an instant,
the atmosphere gets violent.)

1247
00:52:20,089 --> 00:52:23,359
Don't touch our camera.

1248
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,030
That was why he said that.

1249
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:27,160
- Yes.
- No more.

1250
00:52:27,459 --> 00:52:29,800
I'll call the police.

1251
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,069
I'll have them in trouble.

1252
00:52:31,069 --> 00:52:33,240
Oh, no. Pani Bottle.

1253
00:52:33,539 --> 00:52:34,839
What's going on?

1254
00:52:34,839 --> 00:52:37,970
We were just staring at the fire.

1255
00:52:38,169 --> 00:52:39,769
There was the sound of a drone camera.

1256
00:52:39,769 --> 00:52:42,080
We didn't have any staff members
using drone cameras.

1257
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:47,419
(At that time, the drone camera was
working hard with Kian84.)

1258
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:51,089
Someone else at the lodging put up
a drone camera.

1259
00:52:52,050 --> 00:52:54,019
The sound of the drone camera was loud.

1260
00:52:55,289 --> 00:53:00,030
A foreign lady thought
that it was our drone camera.

1261
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,999
I think she was asking if it was ours.

1262
00:53:02,999 --> 00:53:05,200
We said, "No team."
We aren't the same team.

1263
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,740
Maybe she thought
that you were a team called No Team.

1264
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,339
- No Team.
- We're No Team.

1265
00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:10,510
When I said, "No team," she took...

1266
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:12,109
Pani Bottle's camera.

1267
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:14,240
She threw it on the ground,

1268
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,740
and the camera broke.

1269
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:17,080
- Did it break?
- Oh, my.

1270
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:18,749
- The lens broke.
- Oh, no.

1271
00:53:18,749 --> 00:53:21,080
The campsite owner explained to her,

1272
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,890
but he said that it was hard
to make her understand.

1273
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:25,990
- That woman?
- Yes.

1274
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:28,859
This trip is so unpredictable.

1275
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,359
(On the other hand,
Kian84 feels refreshed.)

1276
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:33,700
- It's peaceful on his side.
- It's peaceful.

1277
00:53:33,729 --> 00:53:35,030
I'm being healed.

1278
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:36,629
This is where it's therapeutic.

1279
00:53:36,629 --> 00:53:38,100
It's comfortable all of a sudden.

1280
00:53:38,899 --> 00:53:41,039
(He spots something.)

1281
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:42,839
What is he preparing? There is so much.

1282
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:44,939
He must be making dinner.

1283
00:53:44,939 --> 00:53:45,939
(Preparing dinner)

1284
00:53:46,439 --> 00:53:49,180
(He takes out a stone from the furnace.)

1285
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:50,379
Is he cooking with a stone?

1286
00:53:51,379 --> 00:53:53,109
They cooked with a stone.

1287
00:53:54,019 --> 00:53:56,990
(Cooking chicken with heat from the stone)

1288
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:01,490
(Chicken with the stone is put back
into the furnace.)

1289
00:54:02,459 --> 00:54:03,459
(Adding more)

1290
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,129
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

1291
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:08,260
(Adding more again)

1292
00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:10,930
It looks like baked bread.

1293
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:12,830
- It's bananas.
- What's that?

1294
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:14,039
Bananas.

1295
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,269
He's preparing a feast for the guest.

1296
00:54:18,870 --> 00:54:20,479
(Scratching)

1297
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,410
I thought that he'd be eating tree leaves.

1298
00:54:24,149 --> 00:54:25,649
He ate something delicious.

1299
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:28,450
- I feel bad that I enjoyed it alone.
- Suddenly?

1300
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:30,450
(I feel bad that I enjoyed it alone.)

1301
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:32,789
- The situation switched suddenly.
- Don't touch our camera.

1302
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:35,319
They often feel bad to each other
in real time.

1303
00:54:35,319 --> 00:54:36,390
Goodness.

1304
00:54:40,229 --> 00:54:42,660
(He's setting up the dinner table.)

1305
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:44,370
Porfi.

1306
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:45,999
(Kian84 goes to help him.)

1307
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:48,370
(He plans to shine the dark area
around the furnace.)

1308
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:49,399
Now...

1309
00:54:50,669 --> 00:54:53,169
(Sloppy)

1310
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:55,680
(Glancing)

1311
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,979
(I'll just take it.)

1312
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:00,680
I guess I'm not being helpful.

1313
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,680
(I guess I'm not being helpful.)

1314
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:05,189
(He knows what to do.)

1315
00:55:05,589 --> 00:55:07,620
I wanted to help him,

1316
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,890
but there's nothing I can do.

1317
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:10,629
I'm fine here.

1318
00:55:10,629 --> 00:55:13,089
(He squats quietly.)

1319
00:55:13,830 --> 00:55:14,999
(He just waits.)

1320
00:55:14,999 --> 00:55:16,660
(Porfi Junior)

1321
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:18,769
- They're looking exactly the same.
- I'll just wait.

1322
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,370
He was watching a soccer game.

1323
00:55:21,539 --> 00:55:24,109
Do you like soccer?

1324
00:55:24,109 --> 00:55:25,609
Do you play soccer?

1325
00:55:26,169 --> 00:55:28,310
Which team do you like?

1326
00:55:29,109 --> 00:55:31,080
Which team do you like?

1327
00:55:31,080 --> 00:55:33,550
Manchester? Barcelona?

1328
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:36,249
Messi.

1329
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:37,950
- Messi?
- Messi.

1330
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:40,120
I like Messi too.

1331
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,720
They found something in common.

1332
00:55:42,359 --> 00:55:45,430
I also like Messi. I'm also his fan.

1333
00:55:45,959 --> 00:55:48,729
Isn't Kian84 the same age as Porfi?

1334
00:55:48,729 --> 00:55:50,629
- Right, and he's Porfi's son.
- He's young enough to be your son.

1335
00:55:51,399 --> 00:55:53,229
Who do you prefer, Ronaldo or Messi?

1336
00:55:53,569 --> 00:55:54,870
- Messi.
- Messi.

1337
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:56,769
Me too. I prefer Messi.

1338
00:55:57,039 --> 00:55:58,039
Give me a high five.

1339
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:00,439
My dream is...

1340
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:03,580
to see Messi bringing victory to Brazil
before I die.

1341
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:05,580
What?

1342
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,019
- He's not Brazilian.
- No,

1343
00:56:07,019 --> 00:56:08,450
he's Argentinian.

1344
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,589
- He's not Brazilian.
- No.

1345
00:56:10,589 --> 00:56:12,120
(The real fan doesn't know
Messi's nationality.)

1346
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:13,459
What...

1347
00:56:13,459 --> 00:56:14,819
- Messi and Brazil?
- Everyone,

1348
00:56:14,819 --> 00:56:16,830
we didn't mention it today.

1349
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:18,189
He wants Messi to change his country.

1350
00:56:18,189 --> 00:56:20,859
Remember that I always have
altitude sickness symptoms.

1351
00:56:20,859 --> 00:56:23,060
You aren't at a high altitude.

1352
00:56:23,060 --> 00:56:24,800
I still feel altitude sickness now.

1353
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:27,999
(Si Eon is speechless.)

1354
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:30,810
My dream is to see Messi bringing victory
to Brazil.

1355
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:32,539
Messi.

1356
00:56:32,539 --> 00:56:33,640
(Me too.)

1357
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,879
(Two months after that,)

1358
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:38,749
(Messi won the championship cup
as they hoped.)

1359
00:56:38,749 --> 00:56:40,350
- It made me cry.
- Gosh.

1360
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,390
At the same time,
the child must have felt happy too.

1361
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:49,319
What do you want to be when you grow up?

1362
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:51,930
I want to be a businessman.

1363
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,160
You want to make a lot of money?

1364
00:56:54,629 --> 00:56:56,359
(Nodding)

1365
00:56:56,729 --> 00:56:58,470
Really? What do you want to do
with a lot of money?

1366
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:00,569
You want to buy Messi
and create a soccer team?

1367
00:57:01,569 --> 00:57:03,709
I want to run a business by investing.

1368
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:05,140
- He's realistic.
- Really?

1369
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,339
I want to run a robot business.

1370
00:57:07,339 --> 00:57:08,609
A business related to robots?

1371
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:11,180
I'm running a business related to drawing.

1372
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:14,580
I'm running a gallery.

1373
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:18,749
A comic gallery business.

1374
00:57:18,749 --> 00:57:20,390
(He understands it roughly.)

1375
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,660
There's a saying...

1376
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,930
that money isn't the best,

1377
00:57:25,289 --> 00:57:26,899
but there's nothing better
in the world than money.

1378
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:29,330
It's not that.

1379
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:31,330
(It's not that.)

1380
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,899
- It's not that?
- It's not that.

1381
00:57:32,899 --> 00:57:34,999
Right. You're an adult already.

1382
00:57:35,939 --> 00:57:37,910
Family is the most important.

1383
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:40,709
My family is the most important to me.

1384
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,649
(The food is almost ready.)

1385
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:45,680
(Baked deliciously in the furnace)

1386
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,749
This is...

1387
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:49,080
(Sweet potatoes and potatoes
that smell like charcoal)

1388
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,120
- What's this?
- Potatoes and sweet potatoes.

1389
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:53,220
It's cabbage.

1390
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,519
- Cabbage?
- It's a salad.

1391
00:57:55,289 --> 00:57:56,959
- Gosh.
- It's cooked with a stone.

1392
00:57:56,959 --> 00:57:58,459
Stone chicken.

1393
00:57:58,459 --> 00:58:00,260
Stone chicken? That's amazing.

1394
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,899
It's incredible.

1395
00:58:03,030 --> 00:58:04,069
Thank you.

1396
00:58:04,069 --> 00:58:05,229
(Feeling moved)

1397
00:58:05,229 --> 00:58:06,370
Porfi.

1398
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:09,769
He prepared the dinner
for about three hours.

1399
00:58:10,569 --> 00:58:12,339
(Feeling grateful,
he sets the table alone.)

1400
00:58:12,339 --> 00:58:13,410
For now...

1401
00:58:14,879 --> 00:58:16,539
(Humming)

1402
00:58:17,209 --> 00:58:19,550
(Setting the plates while humming)

1403
00:58:20,519 --> 00:58:22,620
I think they mean to cover the table.

1404
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:26,249
(He guesses what to do.)

1405
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,720
They didn't have to do it so carefully.

1406
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:30,890
- It's a beverage.
- Okay.

1407
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,760
Could it be...

1408
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,899
Do you throw up after drinking this?

1409
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,370
Is there another masato expert?

1410
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:40,370
(A strong memory of masato)

1411
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,999
Whenever I see a traditional beverage...

1412
00:58:43,569 --> 00:58:44,569
(Speechless)

1413
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:46,169
Is it fermented?

1414
00:58:46,169 --> 00:58:47,410
(Try it.)

1415
00:58:47,609 --> 00:58:49,709
(He accepts it anyway.)

1416
00:58:50,609 --> 00:58:52,149
(Glancing)

1417
00:58:52,649 --> 00:58:54,350
(He tastes it a little.)

1418
00:58:54,350 --> 00:58:55,350
(Yum)

1419
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,149
(He doesn't know what it is,
but it's delicious.)

1420
00:58:58,149 --> 00:58:59,490
It's apple juice.

1421
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:02,260
(Healthy ingredients from nature)

1422
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,289
That's incredible.

1423
00:59:04,789 --> 00:59:05,830
Banana?

1424
00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:07,229
It's huge.

1425
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,430
(They gather around the table.)

1426
00:59:11,129 --> 00:59:13,569
Wait, there aren't chairs
for the children.

1427
00:59:14,499 --> 00:59:16,539
Can we use that as a chair?

1428
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:18,439
(A small and low chair)

1429
00:59:18,439 --> 00:59:20,169
Isn't it too low?

1430
00:59:20,839 --> 00:59:22,410
I'll sit here.

1431
00:59:24,379 --> 00:59:25,479
And...

1432
00:59:25,749 --> 00:59:27,180
It's okay since I have a long torso.

1433
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,319
(As if he's in a semi-basement)

1434
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,749
He's on the same level as Porfi Junior.

1435
00:59:31,749 --> 00:59:32,990
They're at the same eye level.

1436
00:59:34,189 --> 00:59:35,289
- Please eat.
- Yes.

1437
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:39,359
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1438
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:41,499
(Eating)

1439
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,060
(Fascinated baked banana)

1440
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,669
I wonder how it tastes.

1441
00:59:46,899 --> 00:59:48,370
(Humming)

1442
00:59:48,370 --> 00:59:49,800
It was delicious.

1443
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,539
- It was sweet and...
- Was it dry?

1444
00:59:52,539 --> 00:59:54,339
Yes.

1445
00:59:54,339 --> 00:59:57,580
It's because it was baked with the skin.

1446
00:59:57,910 --> 01:00:00,649
- Delicious?
- Yes, delicious.

1447
01:00:00,979 --> 01:00:02,120
It's really good.

1448
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,180
(It tastes excellent.)

1449
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,149
It tastes like chicken.

1450
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,359
I bet it was good.

1451
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,289
- All the oil must be gone.
- Yes.

1452
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:14,200
(He doesn't know what it is,
but the beverage is good.)

1453
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,129
(He serves the family first.)

1454
01:00:18,330 --> 01:00:20,300
(Gulping)

1455
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:23,339
It tastes very mysterious.

1456
01:00:23,499 --> 01:00:26,569
- Does it taste okay?
- Apple and...

1457
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:28,539
- Lime.
- Lime.

1458
01:00:28,539 --> 01:00:30,379
There's a lime tree.

1459
01:00:30,379 --> 01:00:33,010
So it came from that tree.

1460
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:36,879
(Elmer picked the lime himself.)

1461
01:00:36,879 --> 01:00:38,890
He made it with the lime that he picked.

1462
01:00:38,890 --> 01:00:41,560
He picked it from the tree by their house.

1463
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,220
(Handmade lime beverage made with love)

1464
01:00:43,289 --> 01:00:46,359
It tastes like a mixture of apple
and cilantro.

1465
01:00:48,030 --> 01:00:49,700
The chair is too low.

1466
01:00:50,629 --> 01:00:52,629
(Getting up)

1467
01:00:55,839 --> 01:00:58,039
(From the empty tent,)

1468
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:01,580
(his only luggage appears.)

1469
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,780
- That's good.
- This is good.

1470
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:07,649
He uses it as a cushion.

1471
01:01:07,649 --> 01:01:08,919
(The all-purpose bag is useful
at a time like this.)

1472
01:01:09,979 --> 01:01:12,490
(He eats comfortably above the ground.)

1473
01:01:12,789 --> 01:01:15,019
(Chewing and tearing)

1474
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:17,390
He's eating with such gusto.

1475
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:18,859
(He's enjoying local food made at home.)

1476
01:01:19,859 --> 01:01:22,200
Porfi. You're a good cook.

1477
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:25,330
- You're a good cook.
- Thank you.

1478
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:29,169
They look so peaceful.

1479
01:01:29,169 --> 01:01:33,339
In Korea, families don't usually eat
together.

1480
01:01:33,339 --> 01:01:35,979
- The entire family?
- I like how...

1481
01:01:35,979 --> 01:01:39,680
people in South America always eat
together with family.

1482
01:01:41,149 --> 01:01:44,689
This is how I live with my family.

1483
01:01:45,749 --> 01:01:48,319
The two of them are my princes.

1484
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:50,689
I love my children.

1485
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:53,560
You have three children.
You have a lot of energy.

1486
01:01:53,689 --> 01:01:54,800
Thank you.

1487
01:01:56,359 --> 01:01:58,030
How long have you lived together?

1488
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:00,800
- Fourteen years.
- Fourteen years?

1489
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,970
I married her with my heart.

1490
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,169
Porfi...

1491
01:02:05,169 --> 01:02:07,680
I never met another woman.

1492
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:10,879
She's the first woman that I met,
and we live together.

1493
01:02:10,879 --> 01:02:13,450
He's a romantic.
He's the Si Eon of Bolivia.

1494
01:02:13,609 --> 01:02:14,780
I see.

1495
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:19,019
Your life is beautiful.

1496
01:02:20,249 --> 01:02:23,260
I bet it touched you
that he's the same age as you.

1497
01:02:23,260 --> 01:02:26,490
Porfi made his choice,

1498
01:02:26,490 --> 01:02:28,899
and I made mine.

1499
01:02:28,899 --> 01:02:32,830
I realized that he has joys that I don't.

1500
01:02:33,229 --> 01:02:34,539
Everything is good.

1501
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:37,640
I'm happy that you visited us.

1502
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:38,970
I'm very happy.

1503
01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:40,580
Seeing Porfi...

1504
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:44,050
taking care of his family reminds me...

1505
01:02:44,050 --> 01:02:46,249
of my father.

1506
01:02:46,649 --> 01:02:49,720
He took a long time to prepare food.

1507
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:54,319
Thank you so much for giving me...

1508
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:56,519
this experience that I never had.

1509
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,589
Cheers for life.

1510
01:02:59,589 --> 01:03:02,560
- For life.
- For life.

1511
01:03:02,959 --> 01:03:06,030
(A glass of friendship lime juice)

1512
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:07,899
(He drinks it in one go.)

1513
01:03:08,439 --> 01:03:10,939
When we go there as tourists,

1514
01:03:10,939 --> 01:03:13,140
we can't have such an experience
at a local's house.

1515
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:14,439
Right.

1516
01:03:14,439 --> 01:03:16,209
He experienced it.

1517
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,680
He blended into their life.

1518
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,180
He went into their life.

1519
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:21,019
Right. The depth is different.

1520
01:03:21,019 --> 01:03:24,589
Porfi, do you like whisky?

1521
01:03:24,589 --> 01:03:26,419
- Yes.
- Do you like it?

1522
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:29,890
Is it impolite to bring it up
in front of his wife?

1523
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:33,430
Doesn't your wife dislike it
when you drink?

1524
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:34,560
Yes.

1525
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,100
(Glancing)

1526
01:03:36,100 --> 01:03:39,330
I control the amount
because she complains.

1527
01:03:39,470 --> 01:03:42,539
In the past, I drank until I got drunk.

1528
01:03:42,769 --> 01:03:44,439
Really?

1529
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:47,310
You become an adult when you get married.

1530
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:50,649
(He can't hide his disappointment.)

1531
01:03:51,149 --> 01:03:52,850
(Glancing)

1532
01:03:53,649 --> 01:03:54,720
Wait.

1533
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:58,620
(Is he going into his sons' room
all of a sudden?)

1534
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,620
(Taking quietly)

1535
01:04:01,919 --> 01:04:04,260
(He brings out a mysterious bottle.)

1536
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:06,560
(Shaking)

1537
01:04:06,689 --> 01:04:09,200
It's for the guests.

1538
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,769
Why am I walking on eggshells?

1539
01:04:12,430 --> 01:04:15,700
- I feel bad in front of his wife.
- Gosh.

1540
01:04:15,899 --> 01:04:17,410
I'm sorry.

1541
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:18,669
(It's okay.)

1542
01:04:19,370 --> 01:04:22,039
This makes me feel uncomfortable.

1543
01:04:22,180 --> 01:04:24,749
- I'll give you a little, so taste it.
- Okay.

1544
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:28,780
(Alcohol made with mandarins and honey)

1545
01:04:29,149 --> 01:04:31,350
I made it here.

1546
01:04:31,350 --> 01:04:33,649
Porfi, you transformed it?

1547
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:35,160
Wow.

1548
01:04:35,589 --> 01:04:36,660
(Turning)

1549
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:38,859
- He keeps glancing at her.
- I'm sorry.

1550
01:04:39,129 --> 01:04:40,660
(Okay.)

1551
01:04:40,859 --> 01:04:42,530
- A little?
- Yes.

1552
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:44,200
It's quite thick.

1553
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,600
He's mixing it.

1554
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,470
- Cheers for life.
- Cheers for life.

1555
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:51,740
It's nice to meet you,

1556
01:04:51,740 --> 01:04:54,680
and I hope you remember this
when you're in Korea.

1557
01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:57,450
Thank you.

1558
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:58,450
(He feels great.)

1559
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:01,180
Study hard.

1560
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:02,479
(Like all middle-aged men,
he tells them to study hard.)

1561
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,950
- Gosh.
- That looks delicious.

1562
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:06,289
(The adults enjoy their time.)

1563
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:08,789
(This is it.)

1564
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:10,560
He's walking on eggshells.

1565
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,530
His wife doesn't look happy.

1566
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,999
(Thanks to Kian84,)

1567
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:18,569
(he's allowed to break away today.)

1568
01:05:20,169 --> 01:05:21,470
Porfi.

1569
01:05:22,899 --> 01:05:23,899
I feel lonely.

1570
01:05:25,939 --> 01:05:29,510
(Loneliness as long-lasting
as altitude sickness)

1571
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,550
There he goes again.

1572
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:37,519
(He complained about loneliness
on the first day of the trip.)

1573
01:05:38,019 --> 01:05:39,490
It's because he's in front
of a nice family.

1574
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:43,419
I was jealous that he had children.

1575
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,160
(He gets up again.)

1576
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,760
- Suddenly?
- One more bottle?

1577
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:47,930
You...

1578
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:49,100
(What's going on?)

1579
01:05:49,999 --> 01:05:52,729
I will play an instrument.

1580
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:55,700
- To go with the alcohol...
- It's Kim Kwang Suk of Bolivia.

1581
01:05:55,899 --> 01:05:59,140
As Kian84 said that he's lonely,
he'll comfort him.

1582
01:05:59,709 --> 01:06:02,810
(Harmonica sounds spread out
in the middle of their meal)

1583
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,550
(Getting up)

1584
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:08,120
(Without listening,
she starts to clean up.)

1585
01:06:09,649 --> 01:06:11,789
(Dad is starting again.)

1586
01:06:13,149 --> 01:06:15,189
He keeps playing tactlessly.

1587
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,390
(Finale)

1588
01:06:18,629 --> 01:06:20,330
(Exclaiming)

1589
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:22,260
(Tired)

1590
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:23,800
The same thing happened
when I was a child.

1591
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,530
When dad came home with his friends,

1592
01:06:25,530 --> 01:06:27,100
he sang...

1593
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,039
- and his friends clapped for him.
- He brought out alcohol.

1594
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,339
Mom took out her anger on us.

1595
01:06:31,339 --> 01:06:33,870
She can't tell his friends to leave,

1596
01:06:33,870 --> 01:06:37,749
but dad's friends are tactless
and don't leave.

1597
01:06:37,879 --> 01:06:39,950
Look at the children's faces.

1598
01:06:39,950 --> 01:06:41,879
- That's the dad's friend.
- He's doing it again.

1599
01:06:41,879 --> 01:06:43,319
Imagine how they must feel.

1600
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:44,649
"When is he leaving?"

1601
01:06:44,649 --> 01:06:46,390
- "We have to sleep."
- I feel bad.

1602
01:06:47,459 --> 01:06:48,760
(Only they're enjoying it.)

1603
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,859
Beautiful. Good.

1604
01:06:51,830 --> 01:06:53,660
You're good at it.

1605
01:06:53,959 --> 01:06:57,229
Did you make your wife fall in love
with you with this?

1606
01:06:57,399 --> 01:06:58,899
(Flustered)

1607
01:06:59,669 --> 01:07:01,870
(He's speechless for a moment.)

1608
01:07:02,339 --> 01:07:03,839
Be honest.

1609
01:07:03,839 --> 01:07:06,039
I had many women.

1610
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:08,410
(He's being too honest.)

1611
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:10,410
I had many women.

1612
01:07:11,180 --> 01:07:12,850
(He's worried about Porfi being honest
while drunk.)

1613
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,580
(Sighing)

1614
01:07:16,819 --> 01:07:19,249
- I met about 27 women.
- What?

1615
01:07:19,249 --> 01:07:23,260
- However, I never fell in love...
- He's talking too much.

1616
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:26,359
with them like I did with her.

1617
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:30,060
A moment ago, you said
that she was your first woman.

1618
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:34,970
As I love her, we have three sons.

1619
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:36,669
Who liked the other first?

1620
01:07:36,999 --> 01:07:40,370
My wife liked me more.

1621
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,310
(Honey...)

1622
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:44,350
Is it correct?

1623
01:07:44,350 --> 01:07:46,280
- Yes.
- Really?

1624
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:48,649
What's the reason?

1625
01:07:48,649 --> 01:07:50,580
I should have brought it up
after putting them to bed.

1626
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:52,890
He's quite drunk. Goodness.

1627
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:55,760
Aren't you bored?

1628
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,789
You should go to sleep. I'm sorry.

1629
01:07:57,930 --> 01:08:01,459
They should go to bed
since we're just talking.

1630
01:08:01,459 --> 01:08:03,899
- Go inside.
- Go to bed.

1631
01:08:03,899 --> 01:08:06,069
Porfi the First and Porfi Junior.

1632
01:08:06,069 --> 01:08:07,169
Porfi the First?

1633
01:08:07,169 --> 01:08:09,039
- The one to his right is Porfi the First.
- Porfi the First and Porfi Junior.

1634
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:11,740
You're the real future of this country.

1635
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:14,310
They're so cute.

1636
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:16,280
(The cute children go back inside first.)

1637
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:19,249
This is great.

1638
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:24,220
I'm so happy that you came to visit me.

1639
01:08:24,419 --> 01:08:25,789
He must be very happy.

1640
01:08:25,789 --> 01:08:28,459
I'm also happy to meet someone
of my age...

1641
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:31,930
in such a faraway country.

1642
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:35,430
(Elmer is playing the pipe in his room.)

1643
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,269
Right. Elmer.

1644
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:39,769
(He arrives when called by his dad.)

1645
01:08:39,769 --> 01:08:41,100
Play it for him.

1646
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:44,169
(He starts playing the pipe.)

1647
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:48,379
(Elmer listens to his dad.)

1648
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:51,280
(A sudden talent show at night)

1649
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,109
(Playing hard)

1650
01:08:53,249 --> 01:08:55,919
I should give him some allowance.

1651
01:08:56,180 --> 01:08:58,490
Right, you should take some out.

1652
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,019
Come here.

1653
01:09:00,019 --> 01:09:01,089
(The uncle's wallet opens.)

1654
01:09:01,089 --> 01:09:03,120
- Here's some allowance.
- Thank you.

1655
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,490
Tell your brother to come.

1656
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:07,999
(Like adults giving allowance to children)

1657
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:11,600
I realized why my dad's friends
gave me an allowance...

1658
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,169
while drinking.

1659
01:09:13,169 --> 01:09:14,439
They were probably pleased.

1660
01:09:14,439 --> 01:09:16,499
It's the best thing at that age.

1661
01:09:16,499 --> 01:09:18,539
- That's true.
- Here's some allowance.

1662
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:20,439
- Thank you.
- Ask your little brother to come.

1663
01:09:20,439 --> 01:09:23,479
(He never looked happier today.)

1664
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:26,050
(He tells his brother what happened.)

1665
01:09:26,580 --> 01:09:28,050
(Hurry.)

1666
01:09:29,220 --> 01:09:31,319
All right.

1667
01:09:31,749 --> 01:09:34,019
I'm giving it to you.

1668
01:09:34,519 --> 01:09:36,620
- Thank you.
- Be a good son.

1669
01:09:36,620 --> 01:09:37,689
- Thank you.
- Sure.

1670
01:09:37,689 --> 01:09:38,789
I'm giving you some pocket money.

1671
01:09:38,789 --> 01:09:39,789
Sure.

1672
01:09:39,789 --> 01:09:41,399
Now go to sleep.

1673
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:42,800
(Old men always tell you to go to sleep.)

1674
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:43,860
Goodnight.

1675
01:09:43,860 --> 01:09:46,129
It felt good when I gave them
some pocket money.

1676
01:09:46,129 --> 01:09:47,230
- Right.
- Of course.

1677
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:49,369
Giving your nephew some money
makes you feel good.

1678
01:09:49,369 --> 01:09:51,239
I gave them the largest bills.

1679
01:09:51,239 --> 01:09:52,339
Good job.

1680
01:09:53,770 --> 01:09:54,810
Thank you.

1681
01:09:55,579 --> 01:09:58,150
(The adults are left
to spend more time together.)

1682
01:09:58,379 --> 01:09:59,709
Thank you, really.

1683
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:02,650
I root for you, Porfi.

1684
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,949
No, please.

1685
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,289
- Porfi, come to Korea.
- Yes.

1686
01:10:10,459 --> 01:10:12,360
Come to Korea.

1687
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:15,629
It's amazing...

1688
01:10:15,629 --> 01:10:19,169
how I met a friend my age in Bolivia.

1689
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:21,570
(Holding hands)

1690
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:22,940
You look a little tipsy.

1691
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:26,739
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1692
01:10:26,739 --> 01:10:28,209
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1693
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,409
(Hugging)

1694
01:10:31,409 --> 01:10:33,709
You got attached overnight.

1695
01:10:33,709 --> 01:10:35,449
- I'm rooting for you.
- Thank you.

1696
01:10:36,550 --> 01:10:39,050
He's a guy my age living
on the other side of the world.

1697
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,789
He was happier about it,
so I was thankful for that.

1698
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:45,930
He has a good sense of humor.

1699
01:10:46,529 --> 01:10:49,529
(They're different, but they hit it off.)

1700
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:53,169
(They shared their worlds
with each other for a day.)

1701
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:58,010
He seems like a nice person.
We got a lot closer.

1702
01:10:58,940 --> 01:11:00,169
Porfi, goodnight.

1703
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:02,180
- I'm going to sleep.
- Okay.

1704
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:03,539
(They say goodnight
in front of their doors.)

1705
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:04,579
Okay.

1706
01:11:04,680 --> 01:11:06,310
(Entering)

1707
01:11:06,310 --> 01:11:07,749
Life is the same everywhere.

1708
01:11:08,949 --> 01:11:10,050
Goodness.

1709
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:11,720
Let's sleep.

1710
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:15,320
(He feels too lazy to use his hands.)

1711
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:16,820
He'll use his toes.

1712
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:17,890
(His impressive toe movement)

1713
01:11:17,890 --> 01:11:19,690
As if we turn off the lights
with our feet.

1714
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:22,930
(He failed to close the doors
with his foot.)

1715
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:23,930
Gosh.

1716
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:28,070
(He closes the tent tightly.)

1717
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:31,209
(Now he's ready to sleep.)

1718
01:11:31,909 --> 01:11:33,610
(Lying down)

1719
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:36,640
(He met a friend his age
in South America.)

1720
01:11:37,379 --> 01:11:40,850
(He goes to sleep happily,
thinking about their special friendship.)

1721
01:11:43,949 --> 01:11:49,760
(Snoring)

1722
01:11:50,489 --> 01:11:52,829
(It was windy at night,)

1723
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:55,900
(but he could sleep deeply
as he didn't get altitude sickness.)

1724
01:11:56,860 --> 01:12:00,329
(The morning is coming in Bolivia.)

1725
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:03,369
(The mountain birds,)

1726
01:12:03,369 --> 01:12:04,640
(the cats,)

1727
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:05,810
- Oh, my.
- They're so cute.

1728
01:12:05,810 --> 01:12:08,079
(and a newborn baby)

1729
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:12,209
(Everyone in Porfi's family is up.)

1730
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:15,020
(But he's still sleeping like a rock.)

1731
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:16,119
He kept sleeping.

1732
01:12:17,989 --> 01:12:19,190
(Knocking)

1733
01:12:19,190 --> 01:12:21,320
Kian84, good morning.

1734
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,619
(Scratching)

1735
01:12:22,619 --> 01:12:23,690
- Kian84.
- Yes.

1736
01:12:24,629 --> 01:12:26,789
- Wake up now.
- Okay, Porfi.

1737
01:12:27,129 --> 01:12:29,930
Let's make coffee.

1738
01:12:29,930 --> 01:12:31,230
Okay.

1739
01:12:31,970 --> 01:12:32,970
Yes.

1740
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:34,970
They wake up early there, right?

1741
01:12:34,970 --> 01:12:36,570
Yes, they do.

1742
01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:38,039
Even the sun comes up early.

1743
01:12:38,739 --> 01:12:41,510
It's only 6:30 a.m. Let me sleep.

1744
01:12:43,039 --> 01:12:45,379
(He's a sleepyhead.)

1745
01:12:45,579 --> 01:12:48,850
(Wake up, Uncle Kian84.)

1746
01:12:50,379 --> 01:12:51,419
Kian84.

1747
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:54,520
I have handmade coffee you'd like.

1748
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:56,020
Morning coffee.

1749
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,230
At 7 a.m.?

1750
01:12:58,730 --> 01:13:00,430
Do you like coffee?

1751
01:13:00,430 --> 01:13:02,760
Coffee? Yes.

1752
01:13:04,129 --> 01:13:06,029
(Porfi mentioned coffee to wake him up,)

1753
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:07,770
(but he went right back to sleep.)

1754
01:13:07,770 --> 01:13:09,499
Porfi is not even hungover.

1755
01:13:10,339 --> 01:13:12,339
(As Porfi doesn't have a hangover...)

1756
01:13:12,339 --> 01:13:13,510
How diligent.

1757
01:13:13,510 --> 01:13:15,810
Right. He harvested that.

1758
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:17,209
It must feel so good to wake up...

1759
01:13:17,209 --> 01:13:19,449
- to the smell of coffee.
- Really.

1760
01:13:19,949 --> 01:13:21,180
How would that taste?

1761
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:22,650
He did all that for him.

1762
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:26,089
- Porfi is so sweet.
- Yes.

1763
01:13:26,089 --> 01:13:27,589
How thoughtful he is.

1764
01:13:27,919 --> 01:13:30,220
(Grinding)

1765
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:32,159
(Opening his eyes)

1766
01:13:33,089 --> 01:13:35,529
I felt so bad that I had to get up.

1767
01:13:35,529 --> 01:13:36,600
Right.

1768
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,900
(Puffy)

1769
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,169
He ate a lot.

1770
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:42,869
(You can tell how much he ate last night
from his puffy face.)

1771
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:45,940
(He managed to get up.)

1772
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:46,970
Hello.

1773
01:13:49,079 --> 01:13:50,180
What's that?

1774
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:53,050
(He wets his hair first.)

1775
01:13:53,050 --> 01:13:54,110
How clean he is.

1776
01:13:55,050 --> 01:13:56,079
(Rubbing)

1777
01:13:56,079 --> 01:13:58,350
- I didn't have shampoo.
- You're only using water.

1778
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:01,919
I can remove the grease
if I scrub enough with water.

1779
01:14:03,419 --> 01:14:06,489
(He uses his finger as a toothbrush.)

1780
01:14:06,489 --> 01:14:08,560
(Gargling)

1781
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:11,770
(He washes his face...)

1782
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:13,930
(and his ears.)

1783
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:15,869
(He took a shower only with water.)

1784
01:14:15,869 --> 01:14:17,600
- He washed it all.
- That's amazing.

1785
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:20,209
Is that a towel?

1786
01:14:20,209 --> 01:14:21,409
No, it's not. It's his shirt.

1787
01:14:21,409 --> 01:14:23,110
- It became his towel.
- Yes.

1788
01:14:23,339 --> 01:14:25,150
- If he dries that, it's a shirt again.
- Right.

1789
01:14:25,150 --> 01:14:26,810
It's a shirt when it's dry
and a towel when wet.

1790
01:14:26,810 --> 01:14:27,879
Right.

1791
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:30,650
(Staggering)

1792
01:14:31,289 --> 01:14:33,690
(He staggers as he can't see
while drying his hair.)

1793
01:14:35,419 --> 01:14:36,959
(Feeling refreshed)

1794
01:14:38,659 --> 01:14:39,959
Look how wet his back is.

1795
01:14:39,959 --> 01:14:41,560
(Wet)

1796
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:43,199
<i>Oh, Kian84</i>

1797
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,329
<i>Let's eat now</i>

1798
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:47,329
He sounds like an old man.

1799
01:14:47,329 --> 01:14:49,800
<i>Kian84, let's eat now</i>

1800
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,270
- Kian84.
- Porfi.

1801
01:14:52,770 --> 01:14:54,209
Did you sleep well, Kian84?

1802
01:14:54,539 --> 01:14:56,279
- Did you sleep well?
- How are you?

1803
01:14:56,779 --> 01:14:57,949
I slept well.

1804
01:14:58,779 --> 01:15:01,449
- Porfi really likes him.
- Yes.

1805
01:15:02,220 --> 01:15:04,749
This is what we're going to drink.

1806
01:15:04,749 --> 01:15:05,989
What?

1807
01:15:07,720 --> 01:15:09,659
- Coffee?
- Coffee.

1808
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:14,190
(While the adults are talking
in the morning,)

1809
01:15:14,959 --> 01:15:18,669
(the kids are getting ready
to go to school.)

1810
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:23,270
(The oldest son comes out
to go to school first.)

1811
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:26,810
- Kian84, they're going to school.
- Yes.

1812
01:15:26,810 --> 01:15:27,810
I see.

1813
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:29,409
- They'll go on the zipline again.
- Yes.

1814
01:15:29,409 --> 01:15:30,610
- They're going to school.
- Study hard.

1815
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:32,379
(Study hard!)

1816
01:15:32,379 --> 01:15:33,510
How brave you are.

1817
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:38,690
He's seeing him off to school.

1818
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:40,550
(Wearing a harness)

1819
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:43,060
He'll only rely on that one cord.

1820
01:15:43,690 --> 01:15:44,930
Be a good student.

1821
01:15:44,930 --> 01:15:47,089
(They also tie his bag tightly.)

1822
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:51,699
- He'll grow up to be strong.
- Right.

1823
01:15:51,699 --> 01:15:52,930
(Without hesitation)

1824
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:54,029
He left.

1825
01:15:54,029 --> 01:15:55,600
(He goes to school over the gorge.)

1826
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:56,839
He's not even wearing gloves.

1827
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:02,510
There is no seat for the zipline.

1828
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:04,379
It's just a piece of cloth.

1829
01:16:04,379 --> 01:16:06,510
- He made a knot with the cloth.
- He tied the cloth.

1830
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:10,480
That's how they go to school.

1831
01:16:11,589 --> 01:16:14,890
(It slows down in the middle.)

1832
01:16:15,720 --> 01:16:18,159
(He pulls the cable to go forward.)

1833
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:19,459
- With one hand?
- He has to do that.

1834
01:16:19,930 --> 01:16:21,430
Do you have to pull that?

1835
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:25,230
How tough he is.

1836
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:30,369
(After pulling dozens of times,)

1837
01:16:30,369 --> 01:16:32,409
The kids are really courageous.

1838
01:16:32,409 --> 01:16:33,810
(he finally steps on the ground.)

1839
01:16:33,810 --> 01:16:34,879
Oh, my.

1840
01:16:38,050 --> 01:16:41,520
- It looks dangerous to us.
- Yes.

1841
01:16:41,919 --> 01:16:45,150
But for them, it's their culture
and something common there.

1842
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:46,150
- It's their life.
- Right.

1843
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:47,249
Yes. Their life.

1844
01:16:47,249 --> 01:16:50,459
Actually, it's not just here
where they use ziplines.

1845
01:16:50,459 --> 01:16:53,390
Many people in South America
living at high altitudes use ziplines.

1846
01:16:53,390 --> 01:16:54,829
- Really?
- Yes.

1847
01:16:54,829 --> 01:16:57,560
Just like in Bolivia,
children in Colombia...

1848
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,699
- also get around by zipline.
- They use it a lot.

1849
01:16:59,699 --> 01:17:03,400
It's because it's so mountainous there.

1850
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:04,400
That's why.

1851
01:17:05,970 --> 01:17:08,180
(The second-oldest son gets ready
to leave for school next.)

1852
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:09,779
I'm a little worried about him.

1853
01:17:10,279 --> 01:17:13,409
Do they go to the same school?

1854
01:17:13,409 --> 01:17:16,150
My oldest son goes to a different school.

1855
01:17:16,150 --> 01:17:19,789
He's still in elementary school.

1856
01:17:19,789 --> 01:17:21,520
Then your oldest son is in middle school.

1857
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:28,300
He also gets ready quietly.

1858
01:17:28,300 --> 01:17:30,260
- They're so brave.
- I know.

1859
01:17:30,529 --> 01:17:32,600
- Why is it so touching?
- Right?

1860
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:35,470
Porfi Junior, take care.

1861
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,869
He's cute.

1862
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:39,839
- Bye.
- Bye.

1863
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:42,940
(After a short goodbye,)

1864
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:44,510
(he leaves for school.)

1865
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:45,579
There he goes.

1866
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:53,050
(He crosses the forest and the river...)

1867
01:17:53,050 --> 01:17:59,289
(to go to elementary school.)

1868
01:18:01,289 --> 01:18:02,900
Isn't he scared?

1869
01:18:03,959 --> 01:18:07,100
Their dad doesn't stop in the middle,

1870
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,570
but the kids are so light
that they have to use their hands.

1871
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:11,510
(Grinning)

1872
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:13,539
- He's so cute. He just smiled.
- Yes.

1873
01:18:14,039 --> 01:18:16,510
(He doesn't get scared...)

1874
01:18:16,510 --> 01:18:19,779
(and pulls himself forward by hand,
little by little.)

1875
01:18:22,879 --> 01:18:27,350
They would have to travel for two hours
if they didn't have that.

1876
01:18:27,720 --> 01:18:29,220
It'd be hard to go to school.

1877
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:31,989
He has to pull for a while.

1878
01:18:31,989 --> 01:18:33,159
- Oh, my.
- My goodness.

1879
01:18:38,270 --> 01:18:39,930
(He has to walk for 30 minutes
to school even after ziplining.)

1880
01:18:39,930 --> 01:18:41,270
He walks for another 30 minutes.

1881
01:18:41,669 --> 01:18:42,940
I felt a little moved...

1882
01:18:43,669 --> 01:18:47,339
when I sent them to school on the zipline.

1883
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:50,980
- They use the zipline on rainy days too.
- Yes.

1884
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:53,879
- They can't take a detour.
- Right.

1885
01:18:54,010 --> 01:18:57,749
The kids used something
that looked like a sack.

1886
01:18:57,749 --> 01:18:59,220
- Yes. Like a piece of cloth.
- Yes.

1887
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:01,619
The cloth was like a burlap sack.

1888
01:19:01,619 --> 01:19:05,529
- It looked worn out and dangerous,
- Of course.

1889
01:19:05,529 --> 01:19:08,029
so the production crew got them
a new harness.

1890
01:19:08,029 --> 01:19:09,029
A harness.

1891
01:19:09,029 --> 01:19:11,129
(A new harness)

1892
01:19:11,669 --> 01:19:15,100
(Thank you, Adventure by Accident)

1893
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:16,900
(After sending the kids to school safely)

1894
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:18,310
- Kian84.
- Yes.

1895
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:19,470
Porfi.

1896
01:19:19,570 --> 01:19:22,409
- Let's drink our coffee.
- Coffee?

1897
01:19:22,579 --> 01:19:24,810
(The adults will have breakfast together.)

1898
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:28,150
The kids have breakfast at school.

1899
01:19:28,379 --> 01:19:30,220
- Is it provided by the schools?
- Yes.

1900
01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:31,919
Breakfast.

1901
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,249
He also toasted bread.

1902
01:19:34,249 --> 01:19:35,489
Thank you.

1903
01:19:35,789 --> 01:19:38,959
Is it from them?

1904
01:19:39,230 --> 01:19:41,659
(He used fresh coffee beans from them.)

1905
01:19:41,659 --> 01:19:42,860
Sit down.

1906
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:45,430
(Freshly brewed Bolivian coffee)

1907
01:19:45,430 --> 01:19:46,869
What would it taste like?

1908
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,070
(Startled)

1909
01:19:51,369 --> 01:19:52,739
Is that a spider web?

1910
01:19:53,839 --> 01:19:55,010
- Is there a bug?
- Yes.

1911
01:19:55,010 --> 01:19:56,180
He added a spider.

1912
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:58,480
- In case he chokes while gulping it down.
- In case he chokes?

1913
01:19:58,709 --> 01:20:01,279
(He added a spider so that Kian84
doesn't choke on his coffee.)

1914
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:04,449
- Is it good?
- It's good.

1915
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:06,119
The morning coffee was good.

1916
01:20:06,119 --> 01:20:08,020
- How was it? Was it delicious?
- It was good.

1917
01:20:08,119 --> 01:20:09,890
It woke me up.

1918
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:14,730
I even made this with my own hands.

1919
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:16,360
- This too?
- Yes.

1920
01:20:17,230 --> 01:20:21,970
Did you also harvest the wheat?

1921
01:20:22,300 --> 01:20:24,570
- No.
- You bought the wheat.

1922
01:20:26,640 --> 01:20:28,279
Had he also harvested the wheat,
I would've been impressed.

1923
01:20:28,279 --> 01:20:30,539
- He bought the flour.
- He couldn't have made everything.

1924
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:32,650
Porfi, do you work today?

1925
01:20:32,810 --> 01:20:34,949
Yes. Today...

1926
01:20:34,949 --> 01:20:37,419
I'll check the zipline wires...

1927
01:20:37,419 --> 01:20:40,820
as a checkup.

1928
01:20:41,789 --> 01:20:43,760
After finishing our coffee,

1929
01:20:43,959 --> 01:20:45,329
let's work.

1930
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:47,890
- Okay. I'm glad.
- Okay?

1931
01:20:48,499 --> 01:20:50,529
(Porfi's new worker)

1932
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:52,570
- Well...
- You'll help him with his work.

1933
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:53,999
Just as I did in the Amazon,

1934
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:55,539
I wanted to help him...

1935
01:20:55,539 --> 01:20:56,970
- Right.
- You should pay for the food.

1936
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:58,409
- to return the favor.
- Yes.

1937
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:01,739
How many days has it been?

1938
01:21:02,379 --> 01:21:04,480
I've lost count.

1939
01:21:05,150 --> 01:21:08,449
Porfi invited me to his house,

1940
01:21:08,449 --> 01:21:09,949
so I slept over there.

1941
01:21:10,919 --> 01:21:14,820
Do you see the rocks are not even?

1942
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:16,360
The ground is uneven.

1943
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:18,220
That hurt my back so much.

1944
01:21:18,959 --> 01:21:21,589
(Even though his back hurt,
he slept like a baby.)

1945
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,230
So I had to...

1946
01:21:24,230 --> 01:21:25,900
(She's listening to Kian84 exaggerating.)

1947
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,499
She finds it interesting.

1948
01:21:27,499 --> 01:21:30,239
She's so shy. She doesn't talk that much.

1949
01:21:30,369 --> 01:21:31,869
I see some cats over there.

1950
01:21:31,869 --> 01:21:33,270
Can I see the cats?

1951
01:21:35,110 --> 01:21:36,779
Oh, dear.

1952
01:21:37,239 --> 01:21:38,779
What do they eat?

1953
01:21:38,779 --> 01:21:40,150
(The baby cats warm your heart
in the morning.)

1954
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:42,119
There are always cute animals here.

1955
01:21:42,119 --> 01:21:44,180
- How tiny they are.
- My gosh.

1956
01:21:44,379 --> 01:21:46,589
How cute you guys are.

1957
01:21:47,289 --> 01:21:49,520
- You're so adorable.
- They're so small.

1958
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,760
- They're so cute.
- They must be a month old.

1959
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:54,930
Let's do this. Help me.

1960
01:21:54,930 --> 01:21:56,029
Let's go.

1961
01:21:57,629 --> 01:21:58,730
(He starts checking the zipline.)

1962
01:21:58,730 --> 01:22:00,129
You're there to help him.

1963
01:22:00,129 --> 01:22:03,739
Yes. They have to check it often.

1964
01:22:03,739 --> 01:22:04,869
I can imagine.

1965
01:22:04,869 --> 01:22:06,909
- The most important mode of transport.
- Yes.

1966
01:22:07,669 --> 01:22:10,539
He's winding it so it's not slippery.

1967
01:22:10,539 --> 01:22:11,539
(He winds a rubber wire around it
to make it slip-resistant.)

1968
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:15,949
Let me hold this.

1969
01:22:18,589 --> 01:22:20,619
He adjusts the wire.

1970
01:22:20,619 --> 01:22:21,860
(He adjusts the wire with a steel wire.)

1971
01:22:21,919 --> 01:22:23,419
Please hold this.

1972
01:22:24,690 --> 01:22:26,560
Pull it all the way.

1973
01:22:27,489 --> 01:22:30,300
(He twists the wire to secure it.)

1974
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:31,699
I wanted to be more helpful,

1975
01:22:31,699 --> 01:22:34,070
- but it took a lot of skills.
- Right.

1976
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:37,100
All I could do was hold things for him.

1977
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:38,909
(Struggling)

1978
01:22:38,909 --> 01:22:40,369
One last time.

1979
01:22:42,379 --> 01:22:45,709
(He tightens the pin.)

1980
01:22:45,709 --> 01:22:46,949
I'll hold this.

1981
01:22:47,810 --> 01:22:50,550
- He tightens the screws by hand.
- He tightens them one by one by hand.

1982
01:22:51,020 --> 01:22:52,190
That's impressive.

1983
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:55,190
(The assistant is adding his strength
by frowning.)

1984
01:22:55,459 --> 01:22:56,489
Here.

1985
01:22:57,119 --> 01:22:58,730
- Now he oils it.
- Goodness.

1986
01:22:58,959 --> 01:23:01,959
His family keeps using the zipline.

1987
01:23:01,959 --> 01:23:04,800
- Right. It's for his family's safety.
- Yes.

1988
01:23:05,369 --> 01:23:08,669
How often do you check the zipline?

1989
01:23:08,940 --> 01:23:11,039
I don't do it regularly.
I check once in a while.

1990
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:14,339
I fix it whenever it gets loose.

1991
01:23:14,869 --> 01:23:17,140
Is there anything Porfi can't do?

1992
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:19,480
- He doesn't sleep.
- He doesn't get a hangover either.

1993
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:20,480
(Even though he drank last night,)

1994
01:23:20,879 --> 01:23:23,850
(he fixed the zipline easily.)

1995
01:23:24,579 --> 01:23:27,449
Porfi, is there anything else
I can help you with?

1996
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:30,289
You let me stay and even fed me.

1997
01:23:30,390 --> 01:23:32,789
Let's go to Coroico.

1998
01:23:32,789 --> 01:23:35,260
- Okay.
- My second son goes to school there.

1999
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:38,629
Let's pick him up after school
and go to Coroico.

2000
01:23:38,629 --> 01:23:40,199
Together?

2001
01:23:40,199 --> 01:23:41,730
Yes? Okay.

2002
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:44,640
Coroico is like downtown.

2003
01:23:45,369 --> 01:23:47,409
- I was too sad to leave right away.
- It's good.

2004
01:23:47,409 --> 01:23:49,779
I thought I could have a meal
with him there.

2005
01:23:50,339 --> 01:23:53,610
He wants to meet up down there.

2006
01:23:53,879 --> 01:23:57,050
I'll get ready and go down.

2007
01:23:57,550 --> 01:24:01,489
Porfi,
let's meet at the end of the zipline.

2008
01:24:02,390 --> 01:24:04,289
- See you there.
- Okay.

2009
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:06,060
I'll get ready and go there soon.

2010
01:24:06,190 --> 01:24:09,100
He'll go down first,
and Porfi will come down by zipline.

2011
01:24:09,230 --> 01:24:10,430
Ma'am, I should go.

2012
01:24:10,430 --> 01:24:11,529
(He says goodbye to his family.)

2013
01:24:11,529 --> 01:24:13,270
Yes. I'm going to go.

2014
01:24:13,270 --> 01:24:16,869
- Stay healthy.
- Be safe.

2015
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:21,110
Come to Korea with Porfi someday.

2016
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:23,110
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2017
01:24:23,110 --> 01:24:25,749
We should take care
of Eric's family and Porfi's family.

2018
01:24:25,749 --> 01:24:27,749
- Yes.
- Right. He made two friends.

2019
01:24:27,749 --> 01:24:28,820
He did.

2020
01:24:29,180 --> 01:24:32,690
Hey, I have to go back.

2021
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,860
Take care. I should get going.

2022
01:24:36,989 --> 01:24:39,260
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2023
01:24:40,529 --> 01:24:44,459
I'll get ready and go down.

2024
01:24:45,470 --> 01:24:47,699
I feel like I imposed
on their hospitality. I feel bad.

2025
01:24:47,699 --> 01:24:51,140
I wish there was more
I could help him with.

2026
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:52,970
Be happy.

2027
01:24:53,570 --> 01:24:54,640
Goodness.

2028
01:24:56,379 --> 01:25:00,980
(What will happen in Coroico?)

2029
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:05,419
(Everything is on Uncle Kian84 today!)

2030
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:07,690
(Tell me your wish.)

2031
01:25:07,989 --> 01:25:08,989
(Notebooks)

2032
01:25:08,989 --> 01:25:10,320
(A soccer ball)

2033
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,489
(A backpack)

2034
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:13,060
(He buys them all.)

2035
01:25:13,060 --> 01:25:14,459
(Uncle Kian84 is the best.)

2036
01:25:14,829 --> 01:25:16,300
(But...)

2037
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:18,459
(he's struggling at the counter.)

2038
01:25:18,970 --> 01:25:20,699
(Uncle?)

2039
01:25:20,970 --> 01:25:22,140
(Can I get a discount?)

2040
01:25:22,140 --> 01:25:23,239
(Not at all.)

2041
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:25,470
(Will he be able to pay?)

2042
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:27,940
(Finally, the long-awaited destination...)

2043
01:25:28,169 --> 01:25:30,079
(of this journey)

2044
01:25:30,480 --> 01:25:33,050
(Where do you want to visit the most
in South America?)

2045
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:35,550

01:25:42,190 --> 01:25:44,060
(It was eventful,)

2049
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:46,230
(but they were happy together.)

(Since they knew they couldn't come back,)

01:25:52,199 --> 01:25:54,600
(they wanted to fully enjoy the journey.)

2053
01:25:55,029 --> 01:25:57,140
(They went on a trip...)

2054
01:25:57,140 --> 01:26:00,709
(by accident with no plans.)

2055
