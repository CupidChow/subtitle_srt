1
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:05,060
(Adventure by Accident)

2
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:09,530
(Kian84)

3
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,700
(Lee Si Eon)

4
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,640
(Pani Bottle)

5
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:31,719
(A man who lives...)

6
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:33,620
(just because he was born)

7
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,719
(Kian84)

8
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:37,930
(He goes to South America
just because he was born.)

9
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,930
(When going on trips)

10
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,129
(Three sets of clothes)

11
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:43,129
(For example, we're going somewhere,)

12
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:44,569
(and we don't have a place to stay,)

13
00:01:44,569 --> 00:01:45,700
(so we have to sleep on the street.)

14
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:47,370
(Sleep on the street?)

15
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:49,239
(That's even better.)

16
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:51,510
(Wherever our steps take us)

17
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,510
(There is no information.)

18
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:54,140
(Traveling is for playing.)

19
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,739
(A combination of no standards,)

20
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:58,310
(no plans, and no worries.)

21
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,349
Probably.

22
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:01,750
(Let's find a place to stay around here.)

23
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,750
(Couldn't we stay there?)

24
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,750
(That's not bad.)

25
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,150
(- What do you think? Should we stay here?
- I don't care.)

26
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,359
(- How about you?
- I don't care.)

27
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,659
- Let's sleep here.
- Okay.

28
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:11,489
(Simply put, they'll put themselves
through misery during this trip.)

29
00:02:12,459 --> 00:02:13,459
(I'm so tired.)

30
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:15,359
(Seriously, this is...)

31
00:02:15,359 --> 00:02:16,370
(Oh, no.)

32
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:20,240
(They slowly start to lose their minds
with the increased use of bad words.)

33
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:23,240
(Their physical condition
hits rock bottom.)

34
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:28,740
(However, the charms of South America
keep them going.)

35
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,219
(They experience all sorts of struggle
head on.)

36
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,189
(Why did they go
to the other side of the earth?)

37
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,960
(Their 10 day journey starts now.)

38
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,729
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

39
00:02:50,729 --> 00:02:52,500
This production scale is no joke.

40
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,039
That gave me chills.

41
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,009
- I want to see more.
- Seriously.

42
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,139
- How awesome.
- It's like a documentary.

43
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:00,310
- The production scale is amazing.
- Seriously.

44
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:01,580
Here. Take this.

45
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,780
(4 weeks before departure, Kian84's house)

46
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,810
(Snacks to have with drinks)

47
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,680
Kian84, are you drinking again?

48
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,750
On the floor again.

49
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,960
- Anyway, we really wanted...
- Yes.

50
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:14,560
to do this for a year.

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,289
You made a proposal,
but you were turned down.

52
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:18,389
You kept getting turned down,
so you were depressed.

53
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,259
Is this actually happening?

54
00:03:20,259 --> 00:03:21,430
It is.

55
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,729
I'm fine. I make enough to live on.

56
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:26,469
I'm just worried
that you'll get fired from MBC.

57
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:30,310
No. We can do this for sure. We're going.

58
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,539
- Really?
- Yes.

59
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:32,909
(I thought
about what I wanted to do with you.)

60
00:03:32,909 --> 00:03:34,680
- I gave it some thought.
- Okay.

61
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,009
Now that I'm at this age,

62
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,449
nothing feels fun.
I've done everything before.

63
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,319
For example, today,

64
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,250
I was drawing.

65
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,060
I finished drawing.

66
00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:51,129
What? I don't have anything to do.

67
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:52,530
I go on TV.

68
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,659
The program ends.

69
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,229
Wait. What do I do now?

70
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,900
- I have nothing to do.
- Right.

71
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,840
- Then I go running.
- Yes.

72
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,400
I drink. I sleep.

73
00:04:01,669 --> 00:04:02,710
Then I get up.

74
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,469
I lie in bed and look at my phone.

75
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,009
Nothing feels fun.

76
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,379
I understand. I can sympathize,

77
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,409
so I feel a bit sad.

78
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,449
It's like I'm getting stuck...

79
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,319
in my routine.

80
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,319
Sometimes,
you just can't fill that emptiness.

81
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,490
- You're right.
- Now,

82
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:22,219
I don't know.

83
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:26,029
(His contemplation of himself...)

84
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:28,300
(has always been somewhere in his heart.)

85
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,069
It's hard not to get stuck in a rut.

86
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,870
You care about what others think.
You try to act like a good person.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,470
That's why nothing feels fun.

88
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:42,949
When I notice that I'm forcing a smile,
I get irritated.

89
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:46,379
I sometimes find myself faking a laugh
to the point that I fool myself.

90
00:04:46,379 --> 00:04:49,550
Then I feel, "This isn't it."

91
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:53,290
"Hee Min, you're really losing yourself."

92
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,120
That's how I feel.

93
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:56,860
"Losing yourself."

94
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,089
So was that conversation...

95
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:01,430
what started this program?

96
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,899
I think it happened that way.

97
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:05,370
It was our natural flow of thought.

98
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:08,769
You could call it an escape.

99
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:11,509
You could also call it a second life.

100
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:13,209
But don't you dream
of something like that?

101
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:18,509
Watching people
who have nothing to do with me...

102
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:22,120
work or take a nap at home...

103
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,990
feels so strange,

104
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,519
but I also really like it.

105
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,990
Like a documentary.

106
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:34,399
Maybe something
like "Tears of the Amazon."

107
00:05:34,899 --> 00:05:37,129
Honestly, going to that kind of place...

108
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,100
must be hard but fun.

109
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,439
Wouldn't somewhere in the wild be good?

110
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,879
Our program will start in the Amazon...

111
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:49,910
that you dreamed of for so long.

112
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,149
- The Amazon?
- Yes.

113
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:53,879
Are we going to meet the Zo'e people?

114
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,420
I wonder what Yamulu is up to.

115
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,949
- Yamulu?
- I was such a big fan of Yamulu.

116
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,319
Would they still be there?

117
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,459
If they are, that'd be amazing.

118
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:06,160
Then would I also... Wait.

119
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,199
Don't they live without clothes there?

120
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,329
I'm not sure.

121
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:12,670
They don't wear any clothes.

122
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,139
The men just use a cone-like thing.

123
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:16,170
(Acting it out is prohibited.)

124
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,209
(What was that?)

125
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:20,839
- So, I'm fine with going to the Amazon.
- Right.

126
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,509
I'm just scared.

127
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,379
If we go to a city in Brazil,
it's not really safe.

128
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:26,720
We're not going to Brazil.

129
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,449
The Amazon is in Brazil.
What do you mean we're not going there?

130
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,819
The Amazon is not just in Brazil.

131
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,319
- Oh, really?
- We're going to go to Peru.

132
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:37,060
- Oh, Peru is nice.
- Peru. I see.

133
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,959
We're only going to give you
the starting and end points.

134
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,600
We have no plan for everything in between.

135
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,000
It's up to you to fill that time.

136
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:45,199
So I have to get
to the final destination myself?

137
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,300
Exactly.

138
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,600
There is a final destination.

139
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,870
It's the one place in South America
that you've wanted to go to.

140
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,480
The place in South America
I wanted to go to?

141
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,740
- The desert?
- Yes.

142
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,110
The salt flats.

143
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:58,410
That's very famous.

144
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,379
(It's called the entrance to the Amazon.)

145
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:03,949
It's so big.

146
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:06,620
- I've never seen a forest like that.
- Gosh.

147
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:10,629
- Even that ant is amazing.
- Oh, my.

148
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:12,589
Gosh. How did they film all of that?

149
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:14,399
- That alligator is crazy.
- Gosh. An alligator.

150
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,800
(A city that breathes with the forest)

151
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,029
We filmed this ourselves.

152
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,370
(In the middle of a tropical forest
on the other side of the globe,)

153
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,740
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

154
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,069
- What is that?
- Is that alligator meat?

155
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:25,240
(the people here live on
and create their own culture.)

156
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,879
That must've been amazing.

157
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,750
(The first city where
the Adventurer by Accident will visit)

158
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:35,519
(Iquitos)

159
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:37,689
- The Uyuni Salt Flats.
- Right.

160
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:42,089
I want to go see the Uyuni Salt Flats
before I die.

161
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,930
(The final destination of this journey,
Uyuni Salt Flats)

162
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,069
(A journey with a total moving distance
of 38,943km)

163
00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:57,339
- I'm so jealous.
- Gosh.

164
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:01,639
(A no-plan, local immersive journey
by accident...)

165
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,079
(is starting now.)

166
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,779
This makes my heart pound.

167
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:09,649
Earlier, I saw the Uyuni Salt Flats...

168
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:11,250
- for a moment.
- Right.

169
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,689
I really want to go there.

170
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:13,759
(Unique, hard-to-find views)

171
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,420
I'm sad. It would've been nice
if you all had come along.

172
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,060
If they had, all of us would've split up.

173
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,629
I'm so happy.

174
00:08:19,629 --> 00:08:21,600
- What an interesting combination.
- Right.

175
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,829
I feel like I have a new family.

176
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:26,029
But aren't we your closest friends?

177
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:28,300
- Right.
- No? What was that answer?

178
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,069
- Did you feel bad?
- You have some good friends here.

179
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:31,610
We could call this group
the Kian Division.

180
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,910
- What did you say?
- Kian Division.

181
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,540
I think you're causing a division.

182
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:38,149
- Let's go with Kian Division.
- Kian Division?

183
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:40,250
Maybe Ki Line?

184
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,580
That's right. Get in the right line, kids.

185
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,450
- I'm so thankful.
- Thank you all for coming to watch.

186
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,789
Thank you so much.

187
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,860
From the opening video, it seemed...

188
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,129
like you went to a lot of places.

189
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:53,100
Did you decide where to go beforehand?

190
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:55,700
You said you had no plan,
but how much was really unplanned?

191
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,399
We really didn't make any plans.

192
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,169
- But it's a TV program.
- Exactly.

193
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:02,799
- You must need a general plan.
- You must.

194
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:04,610
- Like just the basic outline.
- Like where we'd stay and such?

195
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,080
This is how our program was.

196
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,809
Let's not do the typical thing
and follow a plan.

197
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,450
The viewers know now.

198
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:13,980
That was our goal.

199
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,720
Kids, if season one goes well,

200
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,889
- Yes.
- and we go...

201
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:19,720
Why are you speaking down to us? Kids?

202
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
You can't call people kids on MBC.

203
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,029
- That's the trend nowadays.
- Everyone.

204
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:24,259
- Yes?
- Would you go?

205
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,059
Wait. So I...

206
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,960
came on this show because I wanted to.

207
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,169
- Really?
- I see.

208
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,470
- What did you want to do?
- I want to go on the trip too.

209
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:33,700
- Really?
- Yes.

210
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,539
I've never traveled alone.

211
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:39,309
Traveling overseas is a little bit scary.

212
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,809
- There'd be a language barrier and all.
- Right.

213
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:45,879
I've also been abroad a lot for work,

214
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,179
but I really haven't...

215
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,519
- traveled overseas.
- Yes, I bet.

216
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:51,950
- That's true.
- Like on tour, right?

217
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,490
- Exactly.
- This is what we have in common.

218
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,190
We're pre-travelers
whose travel bugs are awakening.

219
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,860
(She suddenly sounded like a textbook.)

220
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,169
- Sorry. I feel like I don't fit in yet.
- Not at all.

221
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:08,169
- But seriously...
- I'm sorry.

222
00:10:08,169 --> 00:10:09,399
Your ears are so red.

223
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:10,470
I feel so embarrassed.

224
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,240
Okay. Let's hurry and watch the video.

225
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,009
Let's see how the man
who lives just because he was born does...

226
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:17,509
on his trip around the world.

227
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:20,720
- Yes.
- Let's go!

228
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:22,480
Let's go.

229
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:26,220
(October 18, 2022, 3:00 p.m.)

230
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:29,059
(Surprisingly, it is five hours
before departure.)

231
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,029
Has he finished packing?

232
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:32,259
It's five hours before departure?

233
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,799
If it's five hours before,

234
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:37,370
- he should've finished packing.
- Exactly.

235
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,929
(No matter how you look at it,)

236
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,700
(he doesn't seem to plan on going.)

237
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:52,610
(Can't be bothered)

238
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,190
Let's go, then.

239
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:03,190
(Scratching)

240
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:07,230
One pair of underwear.

241
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,929
(Is this really his bag
for his South America trip?)

242
00:11:12,169 --> 00:11:13,970
Toothbrush. Toothpaste.

243
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:16,340
(He packs without much concern.)

244
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,710
Passport.

245
00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:22,340
Mask.

246
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,980
Notebook.

247
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,250
(He shoves in a set of clothes.)

248
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,220
(Scratching his stomach)

249
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,019
A change of clothes.

250
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:36,960
Toothbrush. Toothpaste.

251
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,460
(What he packed for his 10-day trip
to South America)

252
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:40,600
- A windbreaker.
- Did you pack one set of clothes?

253
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,929
Yes, one set of clothes.

254
00:11:43,929 --> 00:11:44,970
What?

255
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,139
Excluding the clothes I wore,

256
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:51,240
I packed one short-sleeve shirt
and a pair of shorts.

257
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,379
- You only took one change of clothes.
- Right.

258
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,509
For a ten-day trip,
how much would you normally pack?

259
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,919
- Well,
- Won't he pack ten outfits?

260
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,519
- I'd pack ten outfits.
- Don't people usually pack ten?

261
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,649
- One for every day.
- You'd need at least ten.

262
00:12:03,649 --> 00:12:06,019
- Ten is the minimum.
- Right. Ten is the minimum.

263
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:07,519
In case my clothes get dirty.

264
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,889
- If your clothes get dirty,
- You'd need a few more.

265
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:10,490
you can just shower with your clothes on.

266
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:12,960
- It's shocking.
- So I...

267
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,399
watch this travel YouTuber, Pani Bottle.

268
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,529
- I know him.
- I heard from him...

269
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,669
that this was what I should do.

270
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,440
He said I should buy new clothes there
if I needed it.

271
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,340
But he did pack more than me.

272
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,870
(The prime example
of the student becoming the master)

273
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,240
(He wisely packs his bags.)

274
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:28,740
- Let's go.
- Oh, that shirt.

275
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,509
You wear that a lot.

276
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:34,149
(He packs his charger,)

277
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,090
(and he's on his way.)

278
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,620
(Preparation time, 15 minutes)

279
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,360
(6:00 p.m., Incheon International Airport)

280
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,659
Thank you.

281
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:53,639
Gosh.

282
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:55,870
- Do you have everything?
- Yes, I do.

283
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:57,509
- All right.
- Thank you.

284
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:01,740
Why are they taking pictures?

285
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,009
Why...

286
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:06,720
I was so shocked.
"Why are they taking pictures of me?"

287
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,019
(Hi?)

288
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:12,450
Why are they taking pictures?

289
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,690
There are so many reporters.

290
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,929
Why are you...

291
00:13:17,659 --> 00:13:19,830
Thank you.

292
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,470
This is the first time that people
took pictures of me at the airport.

293
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,669
(These are the airport pictures,
the symbol of stardom.)

294
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:29,740
- My goodness.
- There were a lot of news articles.

295
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,139
(They are all talking about his bag.)

296
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,409
The title is funny.

297
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:34,340
"He doesn't have a suitcase.
Is this really happening?"

298
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:37,379
You would pack more than that
even when you go to Jeju Island.

299
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:41,049
(2.5 hours until departure)

300
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:43,220
(Bangkok, Suvarnabhumi,
Nha Trang, Los Angeles)

301
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:44,750
(Sliding over)

302
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,059
- This is your plane ticket,
- Yes.

303
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:48,559
and this is your living expense...

304
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:49,789
- for one day.
- Really?

305
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:52,360
- Yes. We got it for you.
- I thought you wouldn't.

306
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,360
Really?

307
00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:54,899
(Spitting)

308
00:13:56,259 --> 00:13:59,200
That's 100, 200, 300, 400, 500...

309
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:00,700
(Checking if it's real)

310
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,000
You smelled it.

311
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,110
- The money smelled good.
- Dollar bills smell good.

312
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,740
(His travel expense is 1,000 dollars.)

313
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,779
You gave me a lot.

314
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:12,710
- Hello.
- Hello.

315
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:13,950
(He heads to check in.)

316
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:16,379
I'm going to Peru.

317
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:17,519
- Are you going to Peru?
- Yes.

318
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,289
- Do you have a layover in LA?
- That's what I heard.

319
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,690
(Glancing)

320
00:14:26,259 --> 00:14:28,399
Who are they?

321
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:31,429
How fascinating. Thank you.

322
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,700
(Even with his mouth covered,
it's obvious that he is smiling.)

323
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,309
(Happy)

324
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:40,240
Do you have any bags to check?

325
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,080
- No.
- That's so nonchalant.

326
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,250
(The check-in finishes in a flash
as he has no bag to check.)

327
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,320
- Thank you.
- Have fun.

328
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,419
(He leaves with his only luggage.)

329
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,389
Sorry, but who are you?

330
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,690
- We're your fans.
- We're your fans.

331
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,720
- Really?
- Yes.

332
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,460
- You weren't cast by the staff?
- No.

333
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,559
- Are you Chinese?
- Yes.

334
00:14:57,559 --> 00:14:58,759
How do you know me?

335
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:00,100
You're famous.

336
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,330
- Really?
- Yes.

337
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,399
Unbelievable.

338
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,799
Bye.

339
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,200
Are you here to see me?

340
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,870
(Touched)

341
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:09,039
(That's not the case.)

342
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,909
It's still great that they recognized you.

343
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,710
Yes. They killed two birds with one stone.

344
00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:16,009
(Laughing)

345
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,149
Thank you.

346
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:21,820
I might become a global star.

347
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:26,049
(He departs lightly as if he's going
to his neighbor's house.)

348
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:27,620
- I'm off.
- This is your first time...

349
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,019
going on a long trip, right?

350
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:30,759
That's right.

351
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,059
(Flying for 12 hours 30 minutes)

352
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:34,799
(Los Angeles International Airport)

353
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,570
(Los Angeles International Airport)

354
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:40,269
(30 minutes before the connecting flight)

355
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:41,340
My goodness.

356
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,539
(The man who sleeps just because
he was born doesn't mind where he sleeps.)

357
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:52,279
(Even when children arrive
at the playground, he stays asleep.)

358
00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:55,549
(Flinching)

359
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:59,590
(Not affected at all)

360
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:03,929
The layover was hard.

361
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,460
Did you have to wait for several hours?

362
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,860
I was in the plane
for about 12 to 13 hours,

363
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:11,870
and I had to wait
for about 4 to 5 hours here too.

364
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,230
- You know what that's like.
- That was an awkward amount of time.

365
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,799
- You can't even go out.
- Exactly.

366
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,809
(Flying for 8 hours 40 minutes)

367
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,769
(Lima International Airport)

368
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,139
(Lima International Airport)

369
00:16:23,009 --> 00:16:25,049
That's Peru.

370
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:26,279
Can you tell?

371
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,750
There are a lot of travel YouTubers.

372
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:33,250
- That's right.
- As I watched their videos,

373
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,620
Peru has made it
onto my travel bucket list.

374
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,259
(Peru has become
one of Simon Dominic's must-visit places.)

375
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:41,100
(He looks lost in the foreign land.)

376
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:44,370
(Beeping)

377
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,669
It's working.

378
00:16:47,669 --> 00:16:48,870
(He turns on the self-camera
to get rid of the awkwardness.)

379
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,370
(Well...)

380
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:54,740
I flew for 24 hours...

381
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,679
and arrived in Peru.

382
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:00,620
This is Lima?
I'm in Lima, the capital city of Peru.

383
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,149
The trip doesn't start here,

384
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:05,019
but I need to take a plane
to somewhere else again.

385
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,320
I just kept sleeping, eating,

386
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,330
flying, and checking my luggage.

387
00:17:11,259 --> 00:17:14,460
I couldn't wash my hair for 24 hours,

388
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,559
so my hair is starting...

389
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:17,569
(Flicking)

390
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:20,240
- to get dandruff.
- Oh, dear.

391
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:23,369
If there's anything interesting,

392
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:25,410
I'll turn on the camera again.

393
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:28,480
They gave me one camera...

394
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,039
and told me to talk to it.

395
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:34,920
(From now on, with you guys...)

396
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,549
I prefer videos filmed from this angle.

397
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:38,990
It feels more realistic.

398
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,859
(Through Kian84's eyes,)

399
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,190
(you can look vividly...)

400
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,230
(at beautiful South America.)

401
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,299
- I want to go there.
- Look at the clouds.

402
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:54,700
(Kian TV starts.)

403
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,809
(He broadcasts about travel tips,)

404
00:17:57,569 --> 00:17:59,170
(his daily life,)

405
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,009
(traffic,)

406
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:03,950
(and famous places.)

407
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,750
(As informative as a documentary)

408
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,480
(He laughs,)

409
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,450
(sweats,)

410
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,819
(becomes inspired,)

411
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:17,259
(draws,)

412
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:19,829
(and walks...)

413
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,299
(until he reaches the Uyuni Salt Flats.)

414
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,039
(Kian TV will share all the emotions.)

415
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,240
It's still fun.

416
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:38,710
This is nice.

417
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:42,380
I wasn't trying to do that on purpose.

418
00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:44,750
- I went there alone.
- Yes.

419
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,420
I couldn't help but look at it
and talk to myself.

420
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,660
It would make you feel less lonely.

421
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,960
- Yes.
- The fact that it's watching you.

422
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,660
That's right.

423
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,930
I talked to the camera
more than I talked to Si Eon.

424
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:54,759
You must've become friends.

425
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,559
Even when Si Eon and I didn't get along,

426
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,630
I would talk to the camera
and we'd just mesh well.

427
00:18:57,630 --> 00:18:59,400
That's right,
because it just listens silently.

428
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,670
(Changing his location)

429
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:05,609
(Airport tour with Kian TV)

430
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,710
I...

431
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,740
(Suddenly stopping)

432
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,750
I'll exchange money now.
Maybe I shouldn't film that.

433
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,750
Excuse me.

434
00:19:15,619 --> 00:19:16,890
Hold on, please.

435
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:21,220
(Selectively using Korean)

436
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,029
- Do you want to change to soles?
- Yes, change.

437
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:27,029
- Five hundred.
- Five hundred.

438
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,259
(Sniffing)

439
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,799
I'll exchange half for now.

440
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,240
- It's 1,768 soles.
- Thank you.

441
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,309
And this is your ticket.

442
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:39,539
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

443
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,480
"Sol" is their currency, right?

444
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,980
- Yes. It's sol for Peru.
- Sol.

445
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:48,880
I exchanged 50 dollars...

446
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:51,390
(No, it was 500 dollars.)

447
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:54,319
I exchanged 50 dollars...

448
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,089
to Peruvian soles.

449
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:00,960
I don't think I can exchange it back
if I bring it to Korea,

450
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,460
so I'll use it up before I leave.

451
00:20:03,329 --> 00:20:04,670
Let's eat.

452
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,000
(He's hungry from the long flight.)

453
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:08,799
Let's see.

454
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,210
(Sauntering around
looking for a restaurant)

455
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,210
For the first time in my life,

456
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,509
I'll try Peruvian McDonald's.

457
00:20:21,349 --> 00:20:23,819
I wonder if there's shrimp burger in Peru.

458
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,289
(It's all in Spanish.)

459
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:31,359
(He picks up the menu first.)

460
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,559
Double bacon...

461
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,660
How did you pronounce it?

462
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:38,829
- Is it bacon?
- I wondered what it was.

463
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:40,170
- Bacon...
- Bacon.

464
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,400
It's written as "bacon." Look.

465
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,769
Yes. It's "bacon" if you read it as it is.

466
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:43,970
It's bacon.

467
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,109
(Turns out he was right.)

468
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,380
Double bacon...

469
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,480
(He turns out to be a Spanish genius.)

470
00:20:48,609 --> 00:20:49,680
Excuse me.

471
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:51,579
- Hello.
- Hello.

472
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,720
Is this a set?

473
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,779
A set?

474
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,920
- Like this?
- Yes. Is it a set?

475
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,220
- Yes, this is the price.
- Yes.

476
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,519
And this.

477
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:02,720
- Okay.
- Okay.

478
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,230
This, medium or large?

479
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,390
- Large.
- Large.

480
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,390
Large.

481
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:08,930
Thank you.

482
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,569
(Receipt)

483
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,470
- Your number. Thank you.
- Thank you. Number.

484
00:21:15,099 --> 00:21:16,799
It's the same as Korea.

485
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:19,240
How much is this?

486
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,579
Peruvian soles...

487
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:25,309
(What?)

488
00:21:26,109 --> 00:21:28,079
(The calculation gets him
deep in thought.)

489
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,450
It's not cheap. About 14 dollars?

490
00:21:31,819 --> 00:21:34,759
(Meanwhile, his order is ready.)

491
00:21:34,759 --> 00:21:36,690
(He checks his number.)

492
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,329
This?

493
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,059
(Two coke?)

494
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:41,299
Yes, thank you.

495
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,869
- Yes, thank you.
- Maybe that's someone else's.

496
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:47,700
I ordered wrong.

497
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,569
I was wondering why it cost me 14 dollars.

498
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:54,039
I ordered two sets.

499
00:21:54,039 --> 00:21:56,579
(Let's just eat.)

500
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,609
(Taking a big bite)

501
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,150
You would normally say a combo
instead of a set.

502
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:06,750
If you say "set," they won't understand.

503
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,720
(After his lunch,
he waits for the layover.)

504
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:11,460
I'm in Lima,

505
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,730
the capital city of Peru.

506
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:16,400
I'm going to Iquitos.

507
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,839
I'll draw out the plan once I arrive
at the lodging.

508
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,109
(He looks up something again.)

509
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,809
Can I go fishing in the Amazon River?

510
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,410
Iquitos.

511
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,910
(This is how someone with no plan
plans a trip.)

512
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,150
Wait. You flew and even had one layover,

513
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,390
but where are Si Eon and Pani Bottle?

514
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,819
Initially, I thought...

515
00:22:39,819 --> 00:22:41,990
I was traveling alone.

516
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,589
- Initially?
- Initially.

517
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:46,430
(It's already his third time
boarding a plane.)

518
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,960
It's the third time.

519
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,630
Connecting flights are tiring.

520
00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:52,599
I'm boarding the plane.

521
00:22:58,509 --> 00:22:59,609
Finally.

522
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:04,750
(Admiring)

523
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:07,420
The Amazon rainforest,
the lungs of the earth.

524
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:12,890
Is that what lungs look like?

525
00:23:13,589 --> 00:23:17,230
(Did I just hear that correctly?)

526
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,960
- What are you saying?
- That's not what it means.

527
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,859
Did you think it was called the lungs
because it looked like our lungs?

528
00:23:21,859 --> 00:23:23,700
Well, lungs are internal organs too...

529
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,569
- Oh, that's intestines.
- Do you know where our lungs are?

530
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,400
Why is it called the lungs of the earth?

531
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,940
Lungs...

532
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,170
I see.

533
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:32,410
Wait, shouldn't we say alveoli?
Is it the lungs?

534
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,180
The alveoli are in the lungs

535
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,940
- Anyway, they're necessary.
- Are they the same thing?

536
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,609
It's called the lungs
because it's a big forest.

537
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,309
- Oxygen...
- Exactly. It produces a lot of oxygen,

538
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:43,349
so it's called the lungs of the earth.

539
00:23:43,349 --> 00:23:45,089
Oxygen, I see.

540
00:23:45,089 --> 00:23:46,619
(They learn about the wonderful human body
thanks to the Amazon rainforest.)

541
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:49,319
I should try fishing if I have the chance.

542
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:55,400
(The courses of the river can be seen
between the clouds.)

543
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,730
Gosh, South America is amazing.

544
00:23:57,730 --> 00:23:59,869
You don't have much opportunity
to see that in real life.

545
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:00,869
Right?

546
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:03,039
We can only watch on TV.

547
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:05,910
I wanted to come here before I died.

548
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:07,740
I get to do it like this.

549
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:11,509
(He gets more emotional
as he gets closer.)

550
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:12,750
My heart is pounding.

551
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,150
I can see it clearly.

552
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:17,420
There are houses in the Amazon.

553
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:22,160
(Heart fluttering)

554
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,859
(2 hour flight
from Lima International Airport...)

555
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:26,130
(to Iquitos Airport)

556
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,099
(He arrives in Iquitos, Peru.)

557
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:31,970
(Sniffing)

558
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,700
It's humid here.

559
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:38,069
(Inhaling and exhaling)

560
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:41,680
You're breathing in the air of Iquitos.

561
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,339
Then it feels real that I've arrived.

562
00:24:44,009 --> 00:24:45,809
The air smells so nice.

563
00:24:45,809 --> 00:24:48,049
(Welcome to Iquitos.)

564
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:50,519
- Finally.
- Iquitos.

565
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:53,349
Guys, it looks like
I arrived there very quickly,

566
00:24:53,349 --> 00:24:56,259
- but I spent about 20 hours?
- About 24 hours?

567
00:24:56,259 --> 00:24:59,289
- Yes, about 24 hours.
- No, it took you 27 to 28 hours.

568
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,160
That's the second day.

569
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,400
(In between the tourists
with a lot of luggage...)

570
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:08,900
- Taxi?
- No, thanks.

571
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,299
- Taxi.
- No, thank you.

572
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,210
Where are you going?

573
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,880
No, thank you.

574
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,009
Who are they?

575
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:17,380
Taxi drivers.

576
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:19,509
Hotel? Going to the city center?

577
00:25:19,509 --> 00:25:20,650
No, thank you.

578
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,420
(They spotted a prey.)

579
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:28,819
How many drivers are following you?

580
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:31,289
It was a bit scary.

581
00:25:31,289 --> 00:25:34,230
You look like the Pied Piper.

582
00:25:36,259 --> 00:25:38,099
(He is welcomed as soon as he arrives
in South America.)

583
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,099
How many are following you?

584
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:46,099
(The Pied Piper
that attracts taxi drivers)

585
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:47,569
Why, I...

586
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:49,539
Sorry, I'm waiting.

587
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:51,440
Later.

588
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:53,180
No.

589
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,109
(There's no such thing as "later," dear.)

590
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,849
Sorry, later.

591
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,650
(One driver follows him until the end.)

592
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,950
He is tenacious.

593
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:03,950
You know...

594
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:06,059
here?

595
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,059
(The lodging he looked up in advance)

596
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:09,230
- You know?
- Yes.

597
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:12,430
How much?

598
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,329
Thirty soles?

599
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:16,569
Yes, thirty soles.

600
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:18,970
- Three...
- It's very cheap.

601
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:21,470
They know less English than you'd think.

602
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,170
Then do they only speak Spanish in Peru?

603
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,269
Yes, Spanish.

604
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:26,279
(Most of them speak Spanish only.)

605
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,279
Thirty?

606
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:32,420
Then 20 sol?

607
00:26:32,579 --> 00:26:34,519
Twenty?

608
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,849
That's the cheapest I can offer.

609
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,059
- Twenty?
- Yes.

610
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:42,190
Okay, let's go.

611
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:44,690
About 6.40 dollars?

612
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:47,529
(They set off at about 7 dollars.)

613
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:58,980
Why does it feel
like the Republic of Suriname here?

614
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:04,579
(The view of South America we only saw
in movies)

615
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:07,579
That's when I got the feeling
that I was on a trip.

616
00:27:07,579 --> 00:27:09,049
- For real.
- I can imagine that.

617
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,119
The feeling of being in South America,
right?

618
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:17,690
(Slightly nervous)

619
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:20,599
It's similar to the Philippines.

620
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,200
Hello.

621
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,269
(It's "hola" not "olle.")

622
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:33,140
- "Olle" is the trail in Jeju Island.
- I meant "hola."

623
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,279
Hola.

624
00:27:36,109 --> 00:27:37,180
Olle.

625
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,049
(It's "hola" not "olle.")

626
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,349
(He feels slightly relieved.)

627
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,190
Hi.

628
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:49,759
(Smiling)

629
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,289
They're cute.

630
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:55,900
Oh my goodness!

631
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,769
(Driving fast)

632
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:01,839
- What was that?
- That's so scary.

633
00:28:03,009 --> 00:28:04,069
(Driving fast)

634
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,279
Hold on, this...

635
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,410
(Holding on tight)

636
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,680
A truck drove past.

637
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,180
It's exciting.

638
00:28:15,549 --> 00:28:17,789
It's so thrilling.

639
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:20,319
There's no center lane.

640
00:28:20,519 --> 00:28:22,859
There's no center lane.

641
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:23,890
(Clean)

642
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,329
And look.

643
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:27,700
There are craters on the road.

644
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:30,529
- There are craters.
- My goodness.

645
00:28:30,529 --> 00:28:33,440
When you play KartRider,

646
00:28:33,769 --> 00:28:36,740
there are obstacles in between.

647
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:41,140
But if you step on it here,
the car will actually flip.

648
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,180
(KartRider survival mode)

649
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,650
It's really like a game.

650
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,220
(Honking)

651
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,390
(Honking)

652
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:56,190
(Honking)

653
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,130
I'm so scared.

654
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:59,599
- It must be scary.
- It's scary.

655
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:01,130
I hope you arrive soon.

656
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,799
Let me get off quickly.

657
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,799
Please let me get off quickly. I'll walk.

658
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:08,240
(Welcome. This is your first time
in South America, right?)

659
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,670
He's enjoying it.

660
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,269
- He's enjoying it.
- He's having fun.

661
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:14,940
It costs about seven dollars
to the destination.

662
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,309
But seeing how he is driving
with his life on the line,

663
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,420
I should pay him more.

664
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:23,119
He's driving with his life on the line.

665
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:24,890
(Tough)

666
00:29:25,089 --> 00:29:26,259
(Only the strongest can survive
on the roads of South America.)

667
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:28,190
This is really new.

668
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,289
(Only the strongest can survive
on the roads of South America.)

669
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,259
This is like the Garosu-gil of Iquitos.

670
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,140
Is this like the Dongmyo Flea Market
of Iquitos?

671
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:44,670
Food and various stalls.

672
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,109
(Rows of restaurants by the roadside)

673
00:29:46,109 --> 00:29:47,380
Tomorrow,

674
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:51,450
I'll eat at a local restaurant.

675
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:52,680
That's good.

676
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:54,450
- Yes.
- Famous local restaurants.

677
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:57,250
What's that?

678
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:00,359
Do you see that?

679
00:30:00,589 --> 00:30:01,960
What's that? Are they people?

680
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:05,230
A long time ago, Kim Wan Sun...

681
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,299
That's right.

682
00:30:08,299 --> 00:30:09,500
(An unconventional performance)

683
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,769
They had the same thing there too.

684
00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:11,829
(Kim Wan Sun of Iquitos)

685
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:13,400
Kim Wan Sun of Iquitos.

686
00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:23,809
(He arrives at the city center
after a long drive.)

687
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:25,609
This must be the place.

688
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,190
Thank you.

689
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,119
- Okay?
- Yes. Have a good day.

690
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,289
Have a good day. Thank you.

691
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:36,160
After driving for this long,

692
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,730
it cost me less than seven dollars.
It's really cheap.

693
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,829
(Iquitos is a city in northern Peru
along the Amazon river and jungle.)

694
00:30:41,829 --> 00:30:43,599
That's amazing.

695
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:48,940
(It's the center of the Peruvian Amazon,
called "the Island on Land.")

696
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,140
It's cool.

697
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,970
(It's at the upstream of the Amazon River
and is called "Gateway to the Amazon.")

698
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,910
It's called "Gateway to the Amazon."

699
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:59,250
It's fun to look around at markets.

700
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:03,289
(It has unique delicacies
you can only find in the Amazon...)

701
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,190
(and has the dynamic life
of a hot rainforest.)

702
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,599
(Iquitos, the city of the Amazon)

703
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,700
Let's find lodging.

704
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:22,369
I didn't book the lodging,

705
00:31:22,369 --> 00:31:24,369
so I booked it on the spot.

706
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,339
- You really didn't plan.
- It's real.

707
00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:29,349
(Looking around)

708
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:31,049
Why aren't there traffic lights?

709
00:31:31,609 --> 00:31:34,980
(Empty)

710
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,519
Goodness.

711
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,720
Traffic lights...

712
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,460
(Walking carefully)

713
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,329
(He checks the map.)

714
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,269
Thankfully, the main street is nearby.

715
00:31:56,970 --> 00:31:58,140
Where is that place?

716
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,710
- That place looks hip.
- That place looks nice.

717
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,880
That's not what I had in mind.

718
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,109
- I had a biased picture of the Amazon.
- Right.

719
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:03,180
- That's right.
- Yes.

720
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:05,849
Hello.

721
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,549
Cute.

722
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,660
(Is this the place?)

723
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,130
Gosh.

724
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:19,029
This hotel looks a bit...

725
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,799
The hotel I was planning to go to
looked way too run-down.

726
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:25,000
So I switched to a different hotel.

727
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,240
This one is a two-star hotel.

728
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,200
I should go there instead.

729
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,470
(He sets out again to his new hotel.)

730
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:40,980
Hotel La Casona.

731
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,250
(He arrives at the hotel
after a long walk.)

732
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,789
La Casona.

733
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,190
You really didn't plan anything.

734
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:51,630
You were trying to get a hotel room
without a reservation.

735
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,029
Right. People usually...

736
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:55,599
book plane tickets
and make hotel reservations beforehand.

737
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,029
So I thought making reservations
in advance would be nice too.

738
00:32:59,569 --> 00:33:00,569
(Muffled laughter)

739
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:02,299
- What a useful tip that is.
- Yes.

740
00:33:04,509 --> 00:33:05,569
Checking in.

741
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:07,309
- Checking in?
- Yes.

742
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:09,079
One...

743
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:11,849
One day.

744
00:33:12,109 --> 00:33:14,180
I have a double room.

745
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:16,849
- Two beds. I have a matrimonial room.
- I see.

746
00:33:16,849 --> 00:33:18,289
Air conditioner?

747
00:33:18,819 --> 00:33:19,960
- Air conditioner.
- Wi-Fi?

748
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,690
- Wi-Fi. TV.
- TV.

749
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:23,490
- Air conditioner?
- TV. Air conditioner.

750
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:25,059
How much?

751
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:28,160
It's 140 soles.

752
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,230
- It's 140?
- It's 50 dollars for 1 day?

753
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:32,799
Given the price, it must be a nice hotel.

754
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:33,869
One forty.

755
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,740
(Lodging fee, 140 soles,
approximately 50 dollars)

756
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,779
This... Swimming?

757
00:33:40,009 --> 00:33:41,410
- No swimming pool.
- No swimming pool?

758
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:43,450
- No.
- No? Okay.

759
00:33:43,609 --> 00:33:44,609
Thank you.

760
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:46,319
So there's no swimming pool.

761
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,920
- Well, there's the Amazon River.
- Right.

762
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,549
- The Amazon River.
- That's true.

763
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:52,349
- The water must be cool there.
- Right. You can swim there.

764
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:53,990
Right. That's the best swimming pool.

765
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,430
- The hotel looks pretty good so far.
- Yes.

766
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,930
- The hallway looks nice.
- It looks nice.

767
00:34:00,930 --> 00:34:02,329
- It looks clean.
- Yes.

768
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:08,799
- Yes. One room.
- Thank you.

769
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,839
Gosh.

770
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,750
Why did he give me such a nice room?

771
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:19,519
(There are 3 beds.)

772
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:21,549
- Then 50 dollars is cheap for that room.
- Yes, it is.

773
00:34:21,549 --> 00:34:22,650
There are three beds.

774
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,420
(Chuckling)

775
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,920
Isn't that for a couple
on their honeymoon?

776
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,889
It took over 40 hours to get here.

777
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,269
(He goes straight to the bathroom.)

778
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,969
Gosh. What's this smell?

779
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:40,940
It had this odd, damp smell inside.

780
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,440
Gosh. Look at his socks.
They look so damp in sweat.

781
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,139
- The socks...
- Didn't the smell come from you?

782
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:49,340
Hey. No way. It was the bathroom.
It wasn't me.

783
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,909
(The question catches him off guard.)

784
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,780
(Opening)

785
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:55,719
(Tossing)

786
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:57,750
Darn it. The water...

787
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,519
I was in a hot country for 40 hours.
So I was soaked in sweat.

788
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:01,690
So I washed the clothes.

789
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:05,190
(Why is he suddenly
going out of his room?)

790
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:08,530
(Looking around)

791
00:35:10,969 --> 00:35:12,369
No one's going to take this, right?

792
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:14,239
(Slapping it down)

793
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,739
I had to dry the shirt.

794
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,769
- Right here. Yes.
- I see. You put them outside like that?

795
00:35:18,769 --> 00:35:19,909
It'll dry in no time.

796
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,539
I should...

797
00:35:22,849 --> 00:35:23,849
(Giving it a throw)

798
00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:25,449
What if someone steps on them?

799
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,320
You know?

800
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,820
- Is that your underwear?
- Yes.

801
00:35:30,849 --> 00:35:33,219
I did laundry.

802
00:35:33,219 --> 00:35:35,289
I put them under my feet
when I take a shower.

803
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:36,559
When I wash my hair with shampoo,

804
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:38,630
the shampoo residue flows down there.

805
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,699
- Residue?
- The shampoo goes down.

806
00:35:40,699 --> 00:35:42,360
It washes my body once.

807
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,000
Then it goes down to the clothes
under my feet.

808
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,699
And I'm stepping on them.

809
00:35:45,699 --> 00:35:47,699
After that, the clothes get washed.

810
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:50,369
Then I bring them out to dry them.

811
00:35:50,369 --> 00:35:52,139
I'll be able to wear them again.

812
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:53,809
It's a useful tip.

813
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,909
(He goes to the counter
after putting down his laundry.)

814
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,719
I'm... I...

815
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,449
- Fishing tour?
- I see.

816
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:05,150
"Amazon fishing tour."

817
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:07,690
(He spotted the fishing tour package
when he was checking in earlier.)

818
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:08,789
That looks fun.

819
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:12,659
The only hobby I have is fishing.

820
00:36:12,659 --> 00:36:13,860
I like fishing.

821
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:16,230
Fishing in the Amazon...

822
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,800
is equivalent...

823
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,300
to shopping in Milan, Italy
for fashion enthusiasts.

824
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,639
It would be similar to that.

825
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,269
(The paradise of lively freshwater fish)

826
00:36:25,969 --> 00:36:27,340
(Amazed)

827
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,880
The size is on a different scale.

828
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,280
(A man dreams of becoming
the best fisherman in the Amazon.)

829
00:36:34,679 --> 00:36:37,190
- Every day.
- Every day?

830
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,690
I...

831
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,119
Tomorrow? Is that the day after today?

832
00:36:42,389 --> 00:36:43,760
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow is...

833
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:45,960
Tuesday.

834
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,400
And...

835
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:49,530
as for my room, plus...

836
00:36:50,429 --> 00:36:51,469
one more day.

837
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,840
- Yes. Just for one more day?
- He seems to understand you.

838
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,900
Yes.

839
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,010
It's 80 dollars.

840
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:00,079
Total... How much?

841
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,610
- Total...
- In total...

842
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:04,150
This is in soles for one night.

843
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,449
(Amazon fishing tour, 80 dollars,
1 extra night, 140 soles)

844
00:37:05,449 --> 00:37:06,579
(A total of 452 soles,
approximately 154 dollars)

845
00:37:06,579 --> 00:37:07,880
- This.
- Okay.

846
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,019
So you didn't book the tour
in advance either.

847
00:37:11,019 --> 00:37:13,190
- You just booked it at the hotel.
- At the hotel.

848
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,489
Actually, here's why I didn't make
any plans for my itinerary.

849
00:37:16,489 --> 00:37:18,460
I wasn't going to join any tours.

850
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,460
I was going to buy a fishing rod from
a shop nearby, go to the Amazon River,

851
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,469
- and fish there on my own.
- Okay.

852
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:25,429
But it was too much for me.

853
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:27,039
Anyway, you were so brave.

854
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,440
At 12 o'clock.

855
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,610
- Two...
- Twelve o'clock tomorrow.

856
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:33,480
- Tomorrow at noon. Okay.
- Yes.

857
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,880
Okay. I understand.

858
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,179
- Change...
- And...

859
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:40,650
my clothes... This...

860
00:37:41,219 --> 00:37:44,550
- This space?
- Yes. My clothes... Yes.

861
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,590
Okay.

862
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:48,889
- Thank you.
- He's a great communicator.

863
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:53,630
(The streets of Iquitos
have already gotten dark.)

864
00:37:56,199 --> 00:37:57,369
What's going on?

865
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,670
(As soon as he comes out,
he spots the parade.)

866
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,309
(The locals are congratulating Kian84
for arriving in South America.)

867
00:38:10,309 --> 00:38:12,550
"Kian84 for arriving in South America."

868
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,349
- "Kian84 for arriving in South America."
- That's so cool.

869
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:16,949
- What on earth?
- They did that for him?

870
00:38:20,019 --> 00:38:21,820
The reality sank in...

871
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,289
when I was entering downtown.

872
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:26,659
I could feel this energy
that I was in an unknown world.

873
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,369
Going there alone would be fun.

874
00:38:30,369 --> 00:38:31,730
- There are so many things to see.
- Right.

875
00:38:32,469 --> 00:38:37,510
(He follows the exotic scenery
and heads somewhere.)

876
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,079
(Zooming by)

877
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:44,050
(He's gotten used to it already.)

878
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:49,050
(He's going to...)

879
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:50,619
A supermarket.

880
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,219
(a supermarket.)

881
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:57,690
(He's going to buy daily necessities
to make up for his lacking backpack.)

882
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,900
This is where the toothbrushes are.

883
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:02,829
The minty one.

884
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:04,099
(Toothpaste)

885
00:39:04,099 --> 00:39:05,630
A razor.

886
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,769
This one.

887
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,139
(He goes to buy food for his dinner.)

888
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:12,139
Hello.

889
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,340
Takeout?

890
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,909
Is it possible?

891
00:39:16,909 --> 00:39:18,579
- "Possible?"
- I see.

892
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,880
Rice.

893
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,480
(I want to have a rice dish.)

894
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:24,650
Are you asking if this is rice?

895
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:25,650
Rice.

896
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,920
Hold on.

897
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,860
- "Hold on."
- "Hold on."

898
00:39:31,489 --> 00:39:32,829
Wait.

899
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,869
- Rice dishes.
- Food with rice.

900
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:38,369
(He barely manages to communicate
with the translating app.)

901
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,000
(But he still can't understand
what she's saying.)

902
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,670
(Yes.)

903
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:44,070
Yes.

904
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:47,610
(It comes with chicken, rice,
and a salad.)

905
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:49,110
Beef?

906
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,949
(Chicken!)

907
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,050
- Chicken.
- Chicken.

908
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,719
- Chicken rice?
- Yes.

909
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:56,920
- Okay.
- Yes.

910
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,889
This one... Takeout?

911
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:01,559
Takeout. Yes. One.

912
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:03,760
We understood each other.

913
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:06,800
You seem to be talking about
something else, but you communicated.

914
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:08,800
She's cute.

915
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,599
(English is easy.)

916
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,070
(The worker comes back
a while later with a bill.)

917
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:19,010
And chicken...

918
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,909
- Chicken.
- Yes.

919
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,579
- One.
- Are you going to eat here?

920
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:24,250
- No. Takeout.
- For takeout?

921
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:27,679
I want to order more. Plus.

922
00:40:27,849 --> 00:40:29,820
- "Plus."
- I wanted more chicken.

923
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,989
"I want to order more."

924
00:40:30,989 --> 00:40:32,889
It might come out to like five dollars.

925
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:36,590
The prices for food
are about the same as in Korea.

926
00:40:38,289 --> 00:40:39,329
Rice.

927
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,630
Comida de arroz.

928
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,800
Comida de arroz.

929
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,199
Calculate.

930
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,840
Calculo.

931
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:53,480
- Calculo.
- Calculo.

932
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,739
(He's studying Spanish to survive.)

933
00:40:56,179 --> 00:40:58,849
So the staff didn't intervene at all?

934
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:01,250
- The staff and I...
- You were alone the whole time?

935
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,320
We were in different times and space.

936
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:05,889
They were in front of me,
but I had to pretend they weren't there.

937
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:07,690
In the end, they didn't interpret for you.

938
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,429
- And they didn't guide you to the hotel.
- To find the hotel...

939
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:12,190
You had to find hotels yourself too.

940
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,730
Right. They just let me be.

941
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:15,530
- The lack of communication.
- Yes.

942
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,670
Thank you.

943
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:18,670
(The food he ordered comes out.)

944
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,039
- Chicken and rice.
- Yes.

945
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,070
Yes.

946
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:25,909
- Chicken.
- Yes.

947
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:27,480
Where...

948
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,480
- Finish? This?
- Yes.

949
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,679
Okay.

950
00:41:33,079 --> 00:41:34,579
Thank you.

951
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:37,420
I asked for more chicken.

952
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:39,619
But she didn't get it.

953
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,889
(He failed to order his lunch correctly.)

954
00:41:44,889 --> 00:41:46,599
(And he failed again with his dinner.)

955
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,900
(He always ends the conversation
with "okay" and "thank you.")

956
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:52,500
Imagine you actually
get your order right later.

957
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,300
- You'll be so happy then.
- Right.

958
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,340
- You might even cry.
- Right.

959
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,340
Right.

960
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,710
- You need to undergo trial and error.
- Yes.

961
00:41:58,739 --> 00:42:00,679
(The worker suddenly brings out chicken.)

962
00:42:01,139 --> 00:42:03,210
(Is that mine? I guess not.)

963
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:06,579
(The chicken goes to someone else.)

964
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,619
(Feeling glum)

965
00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:13,050
Thank you.

966
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,360
Thank you very much.

967
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,860
Thank you.

968
00:42:18,429 --> 00:42:20,199
Thank you.

969
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,559
Beverages.

970
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:23,730
(He's in the beverage section.)

971
00:42:23,969 --> 00:42:26,400
Inca Kola. This is Inca Kola.

972
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,070
- You should drink that.
- This one is really popular.

973
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,699
- You can only get that in Peru.
- Right.

974
00:42:29,699 --> 00:42:30,869
That's really good.

975
00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:33,940
Ice.

976
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,010
I want a cool drink.

977
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:42,250
Cold...

978
00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:46,389
- I'm cold. Ice. Cold...
- "I'm cold."

979
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:49,960
- He's telling her about his condition.
- "I caught a cold."

980
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,230
"I caught a cold."

981
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,360
- He talked about himself.
- "I'm cold."

982
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:55,929
I'm cold. Ice. Cold...

983
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,699
- Kola. Ice. Cold.
- Kola.

984
00:43:00,699 --> 00:43:02,440
(He only studied up to "cold.")

985
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:03,610
Yes.

986
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:05,039
(This worker escorts
this desperate cold boy.)

987
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:06,269
No.

988
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:10,480
- Yes?
- Yes. This...

989
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,550
(He's back where he was before.)

990
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:12,809
Refrigerator...

991
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,750
- Kola.
- Inca Kola.

992
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:17,190
- Kola. Yes?
- Yes.

993
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,489
- Okay. Inca Kola.
- Kola.

994
00:43:20,489 --> 00:43:22,460
- Okay.
- He says okay to everything.

995
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,559
Not being able to communicate
is such a disadvantage.

996
00:43:24,789 --> 00:43:26,659
Gosh. I'll just drink it lukewarm.

997
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,469
(He buys the lukewarm soda.)

998
00:43:31,469 --> 00:43:33,030
(And he buys two.)

999
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:37,010
(He's buying everything
since he's here anyway.)

1000
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:41,739
(Daily necessities, 66.10 soles,
approximately 22 dollars)

1001
00:43:41,739 --> 00:43:43,010
Thank you.

1002
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,280
Thank you.

1003
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:48,949
Simon Dominic. How do you say,

1004
00:43:48,949 --> 00:43:51,420
"I want refrigerated cola" in English?

1005
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,489
Do you know?

1006
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,019
Cola. Refrigerator.

1007
00:43:56,019 --> 00:43:57,630
- What?
- Ice?

1008
00:43:58,130 --> 00:43:59,429
Inca Kola.

1009
00:43:59,429 --> 00:44:00,960
(Give me a cold one.)

1010
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,230
(What?)

1011
00:44:03,469 --> 00:44:04,469
They might give you a spicy soda.

1012
00:44:04,469 --> 00:44:05,670
(Give me a cold one.)

1013
00:44:06,469 --> 00:44:09,000
(The thank-you boy goes back
to the hotel after grocery shopping.)

1014
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,579
(He suddenly makes a U-turn.)

1015
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:16,480
How much?

1016
00:44:17,449 --> 00:44:18,579
Three soles.

1017
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:20,880
One.

1018
00:44:21,349 --> 00:44:22,420
This one.

1019
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:23,849
(He buys a snack to replace
the extra chicken he couldn't buy.)

1020
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,750
- Banana.
- Banana.

1021
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:27,090
Banana. Okay.

1022
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,090
- What? Okay.
- Three soles.

1023
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:32,059
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1024
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,900
(It's hot.)

1025
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:41,170
(Taking a bite)

1026
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,440
(Sniffing)

1027
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:47,909
It's not banana.

1028
00:44:48,809 --> 00:44:49,909
What was that, Kian84?

1029
00:44:49,909 --> 00:44:53,309
It tasted like a deep-fried potato.

1030
00:44:53,309 --> 00:44:55,219
- It wasn't a banana?
- It must have been that!

1031
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:57,219
Everyone, that was a great explanation.

1032
00:44:57,219 --> 00:44:58,420
- But knowing you guys...
- You got your cheat sheet out.

1033
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,820
- Yes. The staff gave me a notebook.
- There it is.

1034
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:04,789
They told me to open it up
whenever we felt frustrated.

1035
00:45:04,889 --> 00:45:07,329
What he had wasn't a banana or potatoes.

1036
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,860
He had an empanada.

1037
00:45:09,860 --> 00:45:11,800
- An empanada.
- An empanada.

1038
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,199
- What's that?
- Yes.

1039
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:15,340
- That's from an empire.
- Later... I see.

1040
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:18,510
That's not an "empire." It's empanada.

1041
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,869
- An empire.
- An empanada.

1042
00:45:19,869 --> 00:45:21,940
It's often enjoyed
in Spain or South America.

1043
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,579
- It's a type of pie.
- It's a pie.

1044
00:45:23,579 --> 00:45:27,280
Yes. They add all kinds of ingredients
inside the dough.

1045
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,480
What went inside?

1046
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,750
All kinds of ingredients.

1047
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:31,190
That's...

1048
00:45:32,489 --> 00:45:34,460
I see. She said it was an empanada.

1049
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:36,989
- But you heard it as "banana."
- You heard it as "banana."

1050
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:39,730
(It definitely looks different
from a banana at second glance.)

1051
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,230
(Banana?)

1052
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:42,829
(Trying to hold back her laughter)

1053
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:45,800
(He buys it thinking it's a banana.)

1054
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,639
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1055
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:50,070
(Taking a bite)

1056
00:45:50,409 --> 00:45:52,409
(Sniffing)

1057
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,550
(It's not banana.)

1058
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:01,250
(He doesn't know what it is,
but he enjoys it.)

1059
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,650
Hello.

1060
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,650
Hello.

1061
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:07,789
- How are you?
- How are you?

1062
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,030
- Hello.
- Hello.

1063
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:13,659
Hello.

1064
00:46:13,659 --> 00:46:15,429
(Just like a local,)

1065
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:19,730
(he greets them
and comes back to the hotel.)

1066
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,110
(He bought hard liquor with the soda.)

1067
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:25,269
Should I taste it?

1068
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,039
(Sniffing)

1069
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:32,079
(He has a sip of it
while enjoying the night air.)

1070
00:46:32,849 --> 00:46:34,849
- That looks pretty cool.
- Right?

1071
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:37,789
It's pretty good.

1072
00:46:39,019 --> 00:46:40,019
(Shouting)

1073
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,460
Thank you.

1074
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:47,000
(He comes back to the hotel
as he practices how to say thank you.)

1075
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,639
Gosh. It's cool inside.

1076
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:55,699
(Oh, my!)

1077
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,139
It's so cool.

1078
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,139
(Tossing)

1079
00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:03,139
(This youthful man
takes off his shoes first.)

1080
00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:04,480
Gosh. This is it.

1081
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:07,280
(Sitting down)

1082
00:47:07,719 --> 00:47:09,349
(He's getting ready to eat on the floor
when there's a table.)

1083
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:10,750
He's eating on the floor again.

1084
00:47:12,849 --> 00:47:13,920
What is it?

1085
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,159
Gosh, this is frustrating.

1086
00:47:17,289 --> 00:47:18,289
What is it?

1087
00:47:18,829 --> 00:47:21,599
I forgot to ask for chopsticks.

1088
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,199
- Oh, no.
- Gosh.

1089
00:47:24,769 --> 00:47:27,469
How could I forget to ask for cutlery?

1090
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:31,340
(Feeding himself has been
a difficult task today.)

1091
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:33,139
(He pours out the ingredients first.)

1092
00:47:33,139 --> 00:47:34,639
How are you going to eat that?

1093
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,550
(Deep in thought)

1094
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:42,050
(Flinching)

1095
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,590
(He barely manages to stay civilized.)

1096
00:47:44,989 --> 00:47:47,190
(He starts using his bare hands.)

1097
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:48,889
He's in the wild now.

1098
00:47:49,019 --> 00:47:51,989
I thought about asking for it.
But I forgot that.

1099
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,960
This is chicken breast.

1100
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:01,139
(He's following Indian culture in Peru.)

1101
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:02,599
(Slurping)

1102
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:05,840
(Humming in approval)

1103
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,610
That looks pretty good.

1104
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:10,349
But they used a dry part of the meat.
So it wasn't so good.

1105
00:48:11,409 --> 00:48:16,579
(He didn't get what he wanted
with the burgers and dinner.)

1106
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:18,650
So you should study
before going on a trip.

1107
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:22,889
- That's a useful tip. We should study.
- You should research.

1108
00:48:22,989 --> 00:48:25,190
For some reason,
I want to stay by his side.

1109
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:27,900
I feel awful that
he didn't even get the spoon.

1110
00:48:29,699 --> 00:48:31,300
(He cleans his finger-spoon.)

1111
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,769
- That must be so nice.
- Gosh. Nice.

1112
00:48:37,409 --> 00:48:38,739
That's the happiest moment.

1113
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,139
(Letting it out)

1114
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:44,650
(He becomes more advanced by using
the sauce container instead of his hands.)

1115
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:46,550
- Gosh. He's smart.
- Goodness.

1116
00:48:47,579 --> 00:48:49,480
- Humans must know how to use tools.
- Right.

1117
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,420
(He knows how to use tools.)

1118
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,559
(This time,
he tastes Inca Kola for the first time.)

1119
00:48:55,059 --> 00:48:59,429
(How does the yellow soda taste?)

1120
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,960
(In approval)

1121
00:49:03,829 --> 00:49:05,070
This is good.

1122
00:49:05,530 --> 00:49:06,670
I'm curious.

1123
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:09,639
It doesn't taste like regular cola.

1124
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:11,239
- Is it completely different?
- It's different.

1125
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:13,369
It sort of tastes like
the Korean energy drink.

1126
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:15,679
- Right.
- Yes. It even has a similar color.

1127
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:17,679
- It did taste like the energy drink.
- The color too.

1128
00:49:18,179 --> 00:49:22,119
(He keeps eating on the floor
without saying much.)

1129
00:49:22,179 --> 00:49:24,420
So you haven't left Korea yet, right?

1130
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,590
- Just pretend I'm still at home.
- This is...

1131
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:32,760
(Nothing has changed in Peru.)

1132
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:35,760
(Munching)

1133
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,030
(Getting up)

1134
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:39,230
What's that?

1135
00:49:40,099 --> 00:49:41,800
(Grabbing)

1136
00:49:44,139 --> 00:49:46,610
(His precious talking buddy
that he brought over)

1137
00:49:47,139 --> 00:49:48,179
(Chewing)

1138
00:49:48,179 --> 00:49:49,579
Hello.

1139
00:49:50,349 --> 00:49:51,849
I went grocery shopping at a supermarket.

1140
00:49:53,550 --> 00:49:56,820
I bought a razor and shampoo.

1141
00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:00,820
And this is tasty. It's called Inca Kola.

1142
00:50:01,059 --> 00:50:03,690
It has the color of antifreeze.

1143
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:04,760
Antifreeze.

1144
00:50:04,989 --> 00:50:07,030
I tried it. And it's pretty good.

1145
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,559
Anyway, I had my dinner.

1146
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:12,269
And tomorrow, I'll go on the Amazon tour.

1147
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,969
In Korean currency,
it costs about 100,000 won.

1148
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:18,170
I'll take a boat and fish on the river.

1149
00:50:19,010 --> 00:50:21,610
I'll call it a night here. I'm so tired.

1150
00:50:22,179 --> 00:50:23,949
That's it for my day.

1151
00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:26,880
In 1, 2, 3.

1152
00:50:28,219 --> 00:50:31,590
(There's no reaction from Kian TV.)

1153
00:50:32,619 --> 00:50:34,559
(Bored)

1154
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:36,519
You should have video called someone.

1155
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,630
The connection wasn't good.

1156
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:39,659
- Really?
- Yes.

1157
00:50:39,659 --> 00:50:41,599
Didn't you get a SIM card there?

1158
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:43,260
Of course, I didn't prepare one.

1159
00:50:44,829 --> 00:50:46,630
I can't drink it without ice.

1160
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:49,039
Excuse me. Ice?

1161
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:50,300
- Ice? Yes.
- Ice. Yes.

1162
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:53,980
(He returns to the empty room
with his precious ice.)

1163
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,840
- They had ice.
- They had ice.

1164
00:50:56,309 --> 00:50:59,110
Gosh. I should have come here
with my girlfriend.

1165
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:00,980
(Darn it.)

1166
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,119
- Have you gone mad?
- Did I mishear him?

1167
00:51:03,219 --> 00:51:04,719
How could you air that part?

1168
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:07,289
- I thought I was hearing things.
- Come on. Beep it out.

1169
00:51:07,289 --> 00:51:08,690
I thought I misheard him.

1170
00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:14,099
What am I going to do in this big room
all by myself?

1171
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:17,300
(For some reason, he's feeling thirsty.)

1172
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:18,900
(So he washes the food down
with iced soda.)

1173
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,269
(Humming)

1174
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,099
This is great.

1175
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:25,070
(He compliments the soda,)

1176
00:51:25,739 --> 00:51:30,179
(but no one is in the spacious room
to respond to him.)

1177
00:51:31,110 --> 00:51:33,579
(He keeps watching TV.)

1178
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:37,789
(He grabs the remote.)

1179
00:51:40,289 --> 00:51:43,789
(He changes the channels.)

1180
00:51:45,989 --> 00:51:49,059
(He doesn't understand
the language anyway.)

1181
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:55,969
(Only the unfamiliar language
resonates throughout the room.)

1182
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:00,610
(Lowering his head)

1183
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:05,949
He looks lonelier
because there are three beds.

1184
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,349
Three beds?

1185
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:08,550
(Three beds)

1186
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,849
(Three beds and one person)

1187
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,019
Gosh, I feel so freaking lonely.

1188
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:19,860
Isn't that a line from a movie?

1189
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:22,030
- What's wrong with me?
- Isn't he drunk?

1190
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:23,829
Of course he is.

1191
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,570
I look so shabby.

1192
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:28,539
It makes me feel...

1193
00:52:28,699 --> 00:52:31,909
so sad. You know what I mean, right?

1194
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:34,010
- He must have been so lonely.
- I know.

1195
00:52:34,010 --> 00:52:35,639
He traveled far to get there.

1196
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:38,750
Gosh, I feel so freaking lonely.

1197
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,480
(He admits his feelings
without intention.)

1198
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:43,750
(Clicking his tongue)

1199
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:48,420
(Sighing)

1200
00:52:51,590 --> 00:52:53,090
(Clicking his tongue)

1201
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:56,630
(Since he left home,)

1202
00:52:57,099 --> 00:53:01,699
(he was always alone.)

1203
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,409
(He could neither complain to someone...)

1204
00:53:05,409 --> 00:53:08,110
(nor share joy during his trip.)

1205
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:09,840
I feel lonely.

1206
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,250
(Laughing)

1207
00:53:11,250 --> 00:53:12,610
I feel bad for you.

1208
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:16,449
Instead of traveling alone,

1209
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:19,150
you should go with a friend
if you're single.

1210
00:53:20,219 --> 00:53:21,219
It's lonely.

1211
00:53:21,219 --> 00:53:23,590
That's why I said useless things
in front of the camera.

1212
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,559
It'd be nice if I could speak
their language,

1213
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:26,630
but I couldn't.

1214
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:28,429
All I could say was...

1215
00:53:28,429 --> 00:53:30,059
yes or thank you.

1216
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,699
It's very lonely.

1217
00:53:31,699 --> 00:53:33,730
(It's very lonely.)

1218
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,539
It's only his first day.

1219
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:38,969
He's lonely.

1220
00:53:38,969 --> 00:53:40,340
(A feeling of emptiness hits hard.)

1221
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,480
(Rummaging)

1222
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:47,320
(He turns on Kian TV to comfort himself.)

1223
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,719
Everyone,

1224
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:51,150
I turned the camera back on.

1225
00:53:51,889 --> 00:53:54,920
I thought it'd be a good idea...

1226
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:59,260
to draw every day what I felt
during the day like a sketch journal.

1227
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,429
I will draw.

1228
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,199
(Kian84 records his trip in his own way.)

1229
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:12,909
(Slurping)

1230
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:18,349
What will he draw?

1231
00:54:18,349 --> 00:54:21,119
(Drawing carefully from his heart)

1232
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,320
(His eyes as empty as his hotel room)

1233
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:30,260
(His hyper realistic dark circles
under his eyes)

1234
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:36,900
(His drawing looks sadder
than ever today.)

1235
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,630
He looks so down.

1236
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:39,869
(His drawing looks sadder
than ever today.)

1237
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:42,599
It's not one day less. It's one day more.

1238
00:54:43,170 --> 00:54:44,469
"Infernal Flight."

1239
00:54:44,469 --> 00:54:46,010
(Title "Infernal Flight")

1240
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:47,170
Like this.

1241
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,809
(First day of his trip alone)

1242
00:54:51,949 --> 00:54:53,409
It looks so sad.

1243
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,949
(There are so many lights to turn off.)

1244
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,449
(Grunting)

1245
00:55:00,449 --> 00:55:01,460
Gosh.

1246
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,789
(When watching TV...)

1247
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:06,760
(and looking at the phone get boring)

1248
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:08,699
(Dozing off)

1249
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:11,199
(Falling asleep)

1250
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:16,469
(He falls asleep on this lonely night.)

1251
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,510
(The morning arrives in Iquitos.)

1252
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:28,050
This is the actual first day
of my trip abroad.

1253
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:31,420
(Squirming)

1254
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,320
(8 a.m. in Iquitos, Peru)

1255
00:55:38,190 --> 00:55:41,130
(He has enough time
before the Amazon fishing tour.)

1256
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:46,300
(He comes out of the room.)

1257
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:51,409
Where are my clothes?

1258
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:54,780
(Laughing)

1259
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:57,550
Oh, no. I was worried.

1260
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:02,519
(His laundry that he displayed
in the front yard)

1261
00:56:06,389 --> 00:56:08,090
- I should ask if they threw it away.
- Oh, no.

1262
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:09,090
(Evaporated)

1263
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:12,130
Where did my clothes go?

1264
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:14,699
Hello.

1265
00:56:14,699 --> 00:56:16,199
(Well...)

1266
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,170
My clothes...

1267
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,599
My clothes?

1268
00:56:25,309 --> 00:56:26,710
Oh, yes.

1269
00:56:26,809 --> 00:56:28,510
How...

1270
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:30,110
Yes.

1271
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:32,010
- You know?
- Yes, I know.

1272
00:56:32,010 --> 00:56:35,179
- Yesterday, my partner saw...
- Yes.

1273
00:56:35,179 --> 00:56:39,119
that it was raining.

1274
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,820
- Yes.
- That's why.

1275
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:43,489
(When he was in a deep sleep)

1276
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:45,090
(Raining)

1277
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:48,800
- Gosh.
- It rained.

1278
00:56:49,429 --> 00:56:52,869
(His clothes get washed again
with heavy rain.)

1279
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,940
Your clothes are here.

1280
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,969
- He's friendly.
- Right.

1281
00:56:57,969 --> 00:56:59,239
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.

1282
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:01,409
I'll take all my clothes.

1283
00:57:01,409 --> 00:57:02,510
Okay.

1284
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:04,150
I'm sorry.

1285
00:57:04,309 --> 00:57:06,050
(Sniffing)

1286
00:57:06,679 --> 00:57:08,420
Yesterday,

1287
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:10,679
- it was raining.
- Rain? Thank you.

1288
00:57:13,349 --> 00:57:14,590
Thank goodness.

1289
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:18,559
(He almost ended up with one outfit.)

1290
00:57:18,929 --> 00:57:21,429
(He finds his extra clothes safely.)

1291
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,929
(This time, he displays them in the room.)

1292
00:57:23,929 --> 00:57:24,969
All right.

1293
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:28,469
I feel like they stink more than before.

1294
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,170
Gosh, I should wash them again.

1295
00:57:34,139 --> 00:57:37,340
(He leaves the hotel and goes outside.)

1296
00:57:41,019 --> 00:57:42,920
(Pressing)

1297
00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:52,630
(Suddenly, he stops and stretches.)

1298
00:57:55,429 --> 00:57:56,900
(He starts to run.)

1299
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:58,730
Wherever I am, I go running.

1300
00:57:59,829 --> 00:58:04,610
(The view of Peru is different
from Korea.)

1301
00:58:05,369 --> 00:58:07,679
It must be different to run
in a new place.

1302
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:11,380
Running in a foreign country
it's a good way to take a look around.

1303
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:12,809
(His morning run fits naturally
in the local area.)

1304
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,349
(Exclaiming)

1305
00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:17,820
It's the Amazon.

1306
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:21,119
Is the Amazon nearby?

1307
00:58:22,159 --> 00:58:23,389
That's fascinating.

1308
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:25,559
It's so vast.

1309
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:30,159
There are so many dogs.

1310
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,070
There's dog poop.

1311
00:58:37,099 --> 00:58:38,239
It's everywhere like landmines.

1312
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:41,210
Goodness,

1313
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,210
(Dog poop)

1314
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:45,150
Dogs pooped everywhere.

1315
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:47,510
All the dogs were out and free.

1316
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,820
They pooped everywhere like landmines.

1317
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:53,690
Gosh, those punks.

1318
00:58:54,050 --> 00:58:55,889
It's like a Spider Mine.

1319
00:58:55,889 --> 00:58:57,190
(His running course is full of tension.)

1320
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,429
(He escapes the dog poop landmine.)

1321
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:07,130
There are so many dogs
in this neighborhood.

1322
00:59:10,699 --> 00:59:12,070
(Dog poop morning)

1323
00:59:12,070 --> 00:59:13,239
"Dog poop morning."

1324
00:59:17,239 --> 00:59:21,280
(Covered in sweat,
he arrives at the hotel.)

1325
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,519
Thank you.

1326
00:59:27,019 --> 00:59:28,519
Air conditioner.

1327
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,260
I want you.

1328
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:33,630
Air conditioner.

1329
00:59:34,329 --> 00:59:35,659
(Hesitant)

1330
00:59:36,130 --> 00:59:37,159
Air conditioner.

1331
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,869
That startled me.

1332
00:59:40,869 --> 00:59:42,769
- Is that a foot?
- What's that?

1333
00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:45,639
(An unidentified man in the empty room?)

1334
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:49,409
(He's so surprised that he enters
while holding his breath.)

1335
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:51,849
(Chuckling)

1336
00:59:51,849 --> 00:59:52,949
Who is it?

1337
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,980
(Moving up and down)

1338
00:59:59,389 --> 01:00:00,519
Who is it?

1339
01:00:02,989 --> 01:00:05,360
(He musters up the courage
and approaches him.)

1340
01:00:05,929 --> 01:00:07,389
(Getting up)

1341
01:00:08,059 --> 01:00:10,300
(Screaming)

1342
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:14,900
(He literally falls on his back
out of surprise.)

1343
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,199
Is this some kind of cartoon?

1344
01:00:17,099 --> 01:00:18,710
(Unbelievable)

1345
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:24,610
(The assailant is vigorous.)

1346
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:25,639
You startled me.

1347
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:27,979
- You startled me.
- Hey.

1348
01:00:27,979 --> 01:00:29,950
I thought you were a thief.

1349
01:00:31,249 --> 01:00:33,450
(It's Lee Si Eon.)

1350
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:34,689
What's going on?

1351
01:00:34,689 --> 01:00:38,660
I flew 25 hours to surprise you.

1352
01:00:39,559 --> 01:00:41,329
Hello.

1353
01:00:41,329 --> 01:00:42,360
(6 months ago)

1354
01:00:43,189 --> 01:00:44,499
Is there a place you wanted to go?

1355
01:00:44,499 --> 01:00:45,800
No.

1356
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,059
How long does it take?

1357
01:00:47,059 --> 01:00:48,329
- Twenty...
- There's no direct flight.

1358
01:00:48,329 --> 01:00:49,530
Twenty what?

1359
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:52,599
(Feeling dizzy)

1360
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:53,700
It takes 27 hours.

1361
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,369
I don't like taking long flights.

1362
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:59,280
- Long flights are difficult.
- They are.

1363
01:01:00,709 --> 01:01:03,610
Without asking for details,

1364
01:01:03,749 --> 01:01:06,320
you agreed and said that you were excited.

1365
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:10,289
It'd be fun to travel with Kian84.

1366
01:01:10,389 --> 01:01:12,619
I'll get to talk to him a lot,
so it sounds good.

1367
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,260
(Since their first meeting 6 years ago,)

1368
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,459
(they met every week
and shared thoughts and feelings.)

1369
01:01:20,999 --> 01:01:22,930
We're more like friends...

1370
01:01:22,999 --> 01:01:24,999
despite the age difference.

1371
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,110
I missed him...

1372
01:01:29,110 --> 01:01:32,110
because I can't see him often anymore.

1373
01:01:32,479 --> 01:01:36,809
I wanted to spend time with him
even if it's for a short time.

1374
01:01:36,809 --> 01:01:38,919
(To feel it again,
he decided to travel with him.)

1375
01:01:39,479 --> 01:01:40,550
I really wanted to.

1376
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:43,519
Did you keep it a secret for months?

1377
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:45,189
Yes, for months.

1378
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,959
You should come with me.

1379
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:48,760
I can't go.

1380
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,059
I even talked to the production staff.

1381
01:01:51,459 --> 01:01:53,430
(Kian84 asked him in person.)

1382
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:56,999
(He pretended to refuse the offer
with method acting.)

1383
01:01:58,470 --> 01:01:59,970
(I'm jealous of you.
Take care of yourself.)

1384
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:01,869
(He even pretended by leaving a comment.)

1385
01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:04,510
(The day after Kian84 left Korea)

1386
01:02:04,809 --> 01:02:07,079
(From Incheon...)

1387
01:02:07,079 --> 01:02:09,709
(to Dallas, Texas...)

1388
01:02:09,709 --> 01:02:10,780
(to Lima, Peru)

1389
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:12,680
- It must have been hard for him too.
- I know.

1390
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,289
I'm tired. I want to go home.

1391
01:02:16,249 --> 01:02:20,490
(After a long flight,
he arrives in Iquitos.)

1392
01:02:20,789 --> 01:02:22,260
- Hello.
- My goodness.

1393
01:02:23,789 --> 01:02:25,930
(Panting)

1394
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:30,769
What's this? Is it urine?

1395
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:33,900
What? He didn't pee in it, did he?

1396
01:02:34,769 --> 01:02:37,570
Would it be strange if I cover my face?

1397
01:02:38,110 --> 01:02:39,209
You had no idea?

1398
01:02:39,209 --> 01:02:41,880
- I had absolutely no idea.
- Not at all?

1399
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,249
You must have been so surprised.

1400
01:02:43,249 --> 01:02:45,749
Si Eon was very busy because of a drama.

1401
01:02:45,749 --> 01:02:48,749
He's extremely busy
even though he doesn't look it.

1402
01:02:48,919 --> 01:02:50,550
He has a lot on his schedule.

1403
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:54,729
They let me finish all my parts
in the drama shoot.

1404
01:02:54,959 --> 01:02:59,599
If Si Eon took three flights to get there,

1405
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,729
it means that he really wanted to travel.

1406
01:03:01,729 --> 01:03:03,400
- Yes, he has affection for him.
- To be honest,

1407
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,499
I thought that he'd be lonely.

1408
01:03:06,669 --> 01:03:08,939
I didn't think that he'd be prepared.

1409
01:03:08,939 --> 01:03:11,209
Is it because you were worried?

1410
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:12,610
That's part of it.

1411
01:03:13,309 --> 01:03:15,780
The most important thing is that
I wanted to spend time with him.

1412
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:17,880
I went because I wanted to travel
with him.

1413
01:03:18,349 --> 01:03:21,249
I'd have been more depressed without him.

1414
01:03:21,249 --> 01:03:22,519
Right.

1415
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:26,720
If you had been alone, it would've been
the same as the first night.

1416
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,059
You'd drink...

1417
01:03:28,059 --> 01:03:29,990
and keep swearing.

1418
01:03:30,689 --> 01:03:32,360
It would have repeated endlessly.

1419
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,800
- Right.
- Your swearing would've gotten worse.

1420
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,829
(Thanks to Si Eon, he didn't get lonely.)

1421
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:38,800
- Si Eon, work hard.
- Why are you here?

1422
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:41,039
I was doing a good job alone.
You shouldn't have come.

1423
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:42,970
I have to leave soon anyway.

1424
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:44,269
- What?
- I have to leave.

1425
01:03:44,269 --> 01:03:46,410
I stopped by because I was here for work.

1426
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:49,050
You wouldn't be in Peru for work.

1427
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:53,849
I was thinking of making
a will-made documentary.

1428
01:03:53,849 --> 01:03:56,019
- "Will made?"
- I meant well-made.

1429
01:03:56,019 --> 01:03:58,220
I came all the way here.

1430
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:59,490
(Despite what they say, they're laughing.)

1431
01:03:59,490 --> 01:04:00,519
What do you think?

1432
01:04:00,919 --> 01:04:02,860
I brought some stuff.

1433
01:04:03,459 --> 01:04:05,829
- Why did you bring so much?
- I brought a lot.

1434
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:07,829
You packed so much.

1435
01:04:08,329 --> 01:04:11,499
In your photo, your luggage was...

1436
01:04:12,039 --> 01:04:13,769
Let me see what you brought.

1437
01:04:14,769 --> 01:04:16,209
My gosh.

1438
01:04:16,209 --> 01:04:19,410
I wanted to ask.
Do you do this intentionally?

1439
01:04:19,539 --> 01:04:20,740
It's heavy.

1440
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:23,380
Si Eon.

1441
01:04:23,380 --> 01:04:25,919
Listen, this is backpacking.

1442
01:04:25,919 --> 01:04:27,349
I brought a backpack.

1443
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:30,789
(These are both backpacks.)

1444
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:32,820
How many pieces of underwear
did you bring?

1445
01:04:33,220 --> 01:04:37,059
Three. You can take two of mine.

1446
01:04:37,229 --> 01:04:38,459
- What?
- You can borrow two of mine.

1447
01:04:38,459 --> 01:04:39,499
- Underwear?
- Why?

1448
01:04:39,499 --> 01:04:40,660
Isn't it because you don't have underwear?

1449
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:42,099
(Flustered)

1450
01:04:42,099 --> 01:04:45,340
That's not it.
Here's why I brought so much.

1451
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,439
We'll be going to many places.

1452
01:04:47,439 --> 01:04:48,740
(Speechless)

1453
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:51,380
- We have many places to go.
- I controlled myself.

1454
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:54,010
I thought about how...

1455
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:55,979
I will travel.

1456
01:04:55,979 --> 01:04:57,780
You don't have sunblock, do you?

1457
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:59,119
Are you listening to me?

1458
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,079
- My thought was...
- You don't have to explain.

1459
01:05:01,079 --> 01:05:03,720
I have a lot of things to do.

1460
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,720
I made all the plans.

1461
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,260
I don't want to hear about your plans.

1462
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:10,059
We will be going to countries
where it's cold.

1463
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,599
Did you know that or not?

1464
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:14,559
We're going to countries where it's cold?

1465
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:16,300
Yes, we are.

1466
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:19,470
He didn't know that it was cold
in the desert where he wanted to go.

1467
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:22,110
He thought that it was hot
because it was called a desert.

1468
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:24,840
The daily temperature difference is
over 20 degrees.

1469
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,610
It's not hot during the day either.

1470
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,110
What? I'm not planning to go
to a country with cold weather.

1471
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:31,280
Hey, I brought a padded jacket.

1472
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,619
Take one.

1473
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,019
It's too hot.

1474
01:05:36,019 --> 01:05:38,459
We're going to a place where it's cold,
you fool.

1475
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:41,119
Keep a sleeping bag.

1476
01:05:41,789 --> 01:05:43,630
He brought one for Kian84.

1477
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:46,530
That bag holds 70 liters.

1478
01:05:47,059 --> 01:05:49,269
There's a lot of space without those two.

1479
01:05:49,269 --> 01:05:51,470
Why did you pack so much?

1480
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:53,439
I brought things for you.

1481
01:05:53,869 --> 01:05:55,470
I don't need them.

1482
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:57,269
(The padded jacket from Si Eon)

1483
01:05:57,269 --> 01:05:58,880
(He said that he didn't need it,
but he uses it well.)

1484
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:01,110
(The sleeping bag from Si Eon)

1485
01:06:01,139 --> 01:06:03,150
(He uses it well.)

1486
01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:04,919
(Laughing)

1487
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:06,479
- He used it well.
- I'm sorry.

1488
01:06:06,619 --> 01:06:08,249
I almost died without it.

1489
01:06:08,249 --> 01:06:10,550
- He used it very well.
- I apologize.

1490
01:06:10,749 --> 01:06:12,459
I was rude and mean.

1491
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:14,959
This is for Si Eon.

1492
01:06:14,959 --> 01:06:16,729
(Si Eon's travel expenses get delivered.)

1493
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:19,499
We should be frugal with this money...

1494
01:06:19,499 --> 01:06:21,669
until we get to Uyuni.

1495
01:06:21,669 --> 01:06:24,169
- This is for everything including food?
- Yes.

1496
01:06:24,169 --> 01:06:26,570
Let's get something from the supermarket.
Is there one around here?

1497
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:28,169
- There is.
- Let's go there.

1498
01:06:28,169 --> 01:06:29,769
I'll tell you where to go.

1499
01:06:30,470 --> 01:06:31,539
I'm tired.

1500
01:06:31,539 --> 01:06:33,579
It doesn't feel like
it's going according to plan.

1501
01:06:33,579 --> 01:06:35,550
It never went according to plan.

1502
01:06:35,550 --> 01:06:36,610
Let's go.

1503
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:39,349
All right, let's go to the supermarket.

1504
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:42,090
Wait, if we're going, let's take this.

1505
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:43,749
We should bring our passports.

1506
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,959
- You don't need it here.
- But still,

1507
01:06:45,959 --> 01:06:46,990
I'll bring mine.

1508
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:48,130
What if you lose it?

1509
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:50,160
I always carry my passport when I travel.

1510
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,360
That's the right thing to do.

1511
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:53,229
- It's your ID card.
- I'm worried that I might lose it.

1512
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,139
Aren't we walking there?

1513
01:06:58,139 --> 01:07:00,070
The drivers are waiting.

1514
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:01,840
Oh, let's go.

1515
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,269
But...

1516
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:08,380
No.

1517
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:10,110
It must be very competitive.

1518
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,950
Supermarket.

1519
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:16,590
Go to the supermarket.

1520
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:18,820
(They head to a market.)

1521
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:22,459
The ride is...

1522
01:07:25,559 --> 01:07:26,930
(It's Si Eon's first time riding
a motorcycle taxi.)

1523
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:28,030
It's scary.

1524
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:31,570
(At that time, they get near a bus.)

1525
01:07:32,099 --> 01:07:33,570
It's very hectic.

1526
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:36,169
My gosh.

1527
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:37,570
Look at that.

1528
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:40,979
(Comfortable)

1529
01:07:40,979 --> 01:07:44,780
I've never seen anyone riding
on a truck bed.

1530
01:07:46,019 --> 01:07:48,590
We're going to the Amazon at noon.

1531
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:49,749
What for?

1532
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:51,689
It's the Amazon tour.

1533
01:07:51,889 --> 01:07:53,789
- Really?
- We'll take a boat...

1534
01:07:53,789 --> 01:07:55,329
and go piranha fishing.

1535
01:07:55,329 --> 01:07:57,030
(Laughing)

1536
01:07:57,260 --> 01:07:58,760
That sounds fun.

1537
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:01,160
This must be the market.

1538
01:08:02,099 --> 01:08:03,499
All right.

1539
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:05,369
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1540
01:08:05,369 --> 01:08:07,099
- Money.
- How much is it?

1541
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:09,010
- Twenty.
- Okay.

1542
01:08:09,010 --> 01:08:10,039
Twenty?

1543
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,780
Twenty.

1544
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:13,979
Thank you.

1545
01:08:13,979 --> 01:08:15,610
(Thank you.)

1546
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:17,749
My gosh.

1547
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:20,479
(What's this place that puts them
in a daze?)

1548
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:22,419
This is insane.

1549
01:08:23,289 --> 01:08:25,619
(The Dongmyo Flea Market of Iquitos)

1550
01:08:25,619 --> 01:08:26,889
(Miscellaneous goods, vegetables,)

1551
01:08:26,889 --> 01:08:28,430
(medicinal herbs, and fruits)

1552
01:08:29,959 --> 01:08:32,900
It must be a market that sells everything
from the Amazon.

1553
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,059
I want to go there too.

1554
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:37,799
- Look at that fish.
- It looks unusual.

1555
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:39,900
(A place...)

1556
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:42,570
(where you can see the lives
of the locals up close)

1557
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,280
It's called Belen Market.

1558
01:08:46,280 --> 01:08:48,950
Do you have daily necessities?

1559
01:08:49,179 --> 01:08:51,009
- I brought almost everything.
- Did you?

1560
01:08:51,009 --> 01:08:52,820
Let's find something to eat.

1561
01:08:53,519 --> 01:08:54,620
I'm hungry.

1562
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:55,889
Let's eat.

1563
01:08:55,889 --> 01:08:58,049
Let's take a look around.

1564
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:01,160
- Get a pair of sunglasses.
- What?

1565
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:03,389
- You'll need sunglasses.
- It's okay.

1566
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:05,599
I get burnt except around my eyes.

1567
01:09:05,929 --> 01:09:08,670
I was the only one running
without sunglasses.

1568
01:09:08,670 --> 01:09:12,040
A beetle bumped into my eyelashes.

1569
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:13,939
It feels like my eye will fall out.

1570
01:09:15,639 --> 01:09:17,969
My eye became really red.

1571
01:09:17,969 --> 01:09:19,009
(He's about to need sunglasses
more than anyone else.)

1572
01:09:19,179 --> 01:09:21,280
I told him to buy sunglasses
since the first day.

1573
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,549
Sunglasses are very important
while traveling.

1574
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:25,719
Si Eon.

1575
01:09:27,179 --> 01:09:28,950
- Hello.
- How much?

1576
01:09:29,219 --> 01:09:30,389
Water?

1577
01:09:30,389 --> 01:09:32,620
- Lemonade.
- Lemonade.

1578
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:35,629
- Delicious?
- It was lemonade.

1579
01:09:35,629 --> 01:09:37,629
- How much?
- It's five soles.

1580
01:09:37,629 --> 01:09:40,360
- It's five soles.
- Two, please.

1581
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,670
- Which one would you like?
- This one.

1582
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:45,769
- Name.
- Is it delicious?

1583
01:09:45,769 --> 01:09:47,099
Barley tea.

1584
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:49,469
- Barley?
- Barley tea.

1585
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:52,379
- Corn.
- It was barley tea.

1586
01:09:52,410 --> 01:09:53,839
Corn.

1587
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:55,210
It was corn tea.

1588
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:58,580
- Thank you.
- Yes, okay.

1589
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:00,019
Corn.

1590
01:10:00,979 --> 01:10:02,290
It's like cherries.

1591
01:10:07,689 --> 01:10:10,059
- Look at his face.
- Try this.

1592
01:10:11,429 --> 01:10:13,599
(They exchange beverages
and drink it in one go.)

1593
01:10:16,729 --> 01:10:18,339
(Gasping)

1594
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:23,040
Did he make it himself?

1595
01:10:23,339 --> 01:10:26,679
(South American beverages taste
much different than they expected.)

1596
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:30,110
He doesn't look happy.

1597
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:32,049
I was very tired.

1598
01:10:32,049 --> 01:10:35,950
I was in good condition
because I slept well the night before.

1599
01:10:36,189 --> 01:10:37,889
However, Si Eon was in bad condition.

1600
01:10:37,990 --> 01:10:39,889
I hardly slept on the plane...

1601
01:10:39,889 --> 01:10:41,219
- Oh, my.
- because I was worried.

1602
01:10:41,219 --> 01:10:43,189
- Why?
- In case I missed my connecting flight.

1603
01:10:43,189 --> 01:10:45,860
- I had never had layovers before.
- And it was your first trip there.

1604
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:48,870
I didn't know where I had to go
after getting off the plane.

1605
01:10:48,870 --> 01:10:50,729
I could hardly sleep
because I was worried.

1606
01:10:50,729 --> 01:10:52,740
Just like me, you stress out in advance.

1607
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,000
Right.

1608
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,210
- I'm the type to always worry in advance.
- Right.

1609
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:58,679
- I can't get around without a plan.
- Right.

1610
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:00,740
- I don't get stressed.
- They're so different.

1611
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,450
Missing a flight
doesn't stress me out either.

1612
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:04,549
What about you, MINO?

1613
01:11:04,549 --> 01:11:05,719
- Are you like us?
- What are you like?

1614
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:07,250
I'm more like him.

1615
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:08,280
- Really?
- You just go?

1616
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:11,120
I just go with the flow.

1617
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,089
(He also lives just because he was born.)

1618
01:11:13,790 --> 01:11:15,290
- What is it?
- What?

1619
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:16,689
(Striding)

1620
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:17,790
Let's cross.

1621
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:21,500
He must've been so stressed there.

1622
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:22,530
I was.

1623
01:11:22,530 --> 01:11:26,500
Everyone was so confused including me.

1624
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,099
The whistle is so...

1625
01:11:29,309 --> 01:11:32,439
(They arrived
at the entrance of the market.)

1626
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:37,379
(Looking around)

1627
01:11:37,379 --> 01:11:38,650
It looks good.

1628
01:11:39,049 --> 01:11:40,979
I don't really want to eat that.

1629
01:11:40,979 --> 01:11:42,849
Really? You said you were hungry.

1630
01:11:42,849 --> 01:11:44,250
I don't really feel like eating.

1631
01:11:45,120 --> 01:11:47,689
You should eat some at a market like this.

1632
01:11:50,129 --> 01:11:52,330
Si Eon,
they look like large-eyed herrings.

1633
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:53,629
Aren't they piranhas?

1634
01:11:54,629 --> 01:11:55,769
Piranhas?

1635
01:11:56,200 --> 01:11:58,469
- Palometas.
- Palometas.

1636
01:11:58,469 --> 01:12:00,870
- They have teeth too.
- Piranhas?

1637
01:12:01,299 --> 01:12:03,040
- Si Eon, those fish have suckers.
- What is that?

1638
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:04,969
- That's true.
- Do they eat moss?

1639
01:12:04,969 --> 01:12:05,979
- You know them, right?
- Yes.

1640
01:12:05,979 --> 01:12:07,540
We have one at my office.

1641
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:09,479
(Amazed)

1642
01:12:10,349 --> 01:12:12,879
All the freshwater fish look
like they're sea fish.

1643
01:12:12,879 --> 01:12:14,719
There are many interesting fish.

1644
01:12:16,589 --> 01:12:17,950
What is that?

1645
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:19,189
It's so distracting.

1646
01:12:20,089 --> 01:12:21,389
Kian84, stop and pose.

1647
01:12:22,530 --> 01:12:24,030
- This place looks cool.
- Really?

1648
01:12:25,160 --> 01:12:26,530
The background looks good.

1649
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:29,269
Doesn't it look ugly?

1650
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:30,769
(He doesn't care.)

1651
01:12:31,729 --> 01:12:33,269
(Reluctant)

1652
01:12:33,639 --> 01:12:34,670
(Click)

1653
01:12:35,540 --> 01:12:37,009
It's not that bad.

1654
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:40,780
Can you take photos with a beautiful view?

1655
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:42,849
This kind of background is cool.

1656
01:12:43,879 --> 01:12:45,150
I like it here.

1657
01:12:45,349 --> 01:12:47,820
I can see the Amazon River over there.

1658
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:51,420
(He forces himself to smile,
holding barley tea.)

1659
01:12:51,420 --> 01:12:52,460
(Click)

1660
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:53,820
(He took a photo with the Amazon River.)

1661
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:55,990
I like the vibe.

1662
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:57,660
Stand right there.

1663
01:12:58,360 --> 01:13:00,460
I'll get the bald eagles in the picture.

1664
01:13:01,299 --> 01:13:02,370
One, two.

1665
01:13:02,969 --> 01:13:04,599
(Eagles?)

1666
01:13:04,769 --> 01:13:06,540
(He took a quick photo,
but it looks like a magazine cover.)

1667
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:07,799
- It looks cool.
- Right?

1668
01:13:08,139 --> 01:13:09,670
(They keep exploring the market.)

1669
01:13:10,009 --> 01:13:11,469
(What is that?)

1670
01:13:11,639 --> 01:13:13,439
(Si Eon looks like he's enchanted
by something.)

1671
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:17,080
(What stopped him?)

1672
01:13:17,309 --> 01:13:19,150
- What?
- What is that?

1673
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,849
(Stunned)

1674
01:13:21,849 --> 01:13:22,849
(Laughing)

1675
01:13:22,849 --> 01:13:24,820
(The screen hasn't been paused.)

1676
01:13:25,660 --> 01:13:27,089
(The rulers of the Amazon River)

1677
01:13:27,089 --> 01:13:29,360
- Look at that.
- It's huge.

1678
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:30,490
(The top predators, alligators)

1679
01:13:31,799 --> 01:13:33,360
(Shocked)

1680
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:34,700
It has a lot of meat.

1681
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:37,469
I want to touch it.

1682
01:13:37,469 --> 01:13:40,269
Si Eon, maybe you should ask.

1683
01:13:40,269 --> 01:13:41,799
(Nodding)

1684
01:13:42,139 --> 01:13:43,809
- He says I can touch it.
- Really?

1685
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,410
Oh, my. How can he touch that?

1686
01:13:46,410 --> 01:13:47,439
(Flinching)

1687
01:13:48,439 --> 01:13:49,849
(It's dead.)

1688
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:51,280
It's the tail.

1689
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,820
How do you eat this?

1690
01:13:53,820 --> 01:13:55,389
The skin is so thick.

1691
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:57,519
(Do you sell it in kilos?)

1692
01:13:57,519 --> 01:13:58,620
(How many kilograms?)

1693
01:13:58,620 --> 01:13:59,960
He's buying some.

1694
01:13:59,960 --> 01:14:01,360
(It's unfamiliar to us.)

1695
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:03,660
He asked how much it was per kilogram.

1696
01:14:05,229 --> 01:14:06,599
Shall we try one kilo?

1697
01:14:06,599 --> 01:14:07,629
Gosh.

1698
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:10,429
- When can we try alligator meat again?
- I don't want to. You try some.

1699
01:14:10,429 --> 01:14:12,799
- How about a leg?
- No. I don't want it.

1700
01:14:13,299 --> 01:14:16,610
We could eat that for a week.

1701
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:20,240
One tail could last a week.

1702
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:21,410
It must be expensive...

1703
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:23,309
given how much the skin is.

1704
01:14:23,509 --> 01:14:24,809
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

1705
01:14:24,809 --> 01:14:25,979
(Kian84 is sad as he's leaving.)

1706
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:28,250
Choose what you want to eat now.

1707
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:30,790
After looking around the market,
I feel full now.

1708
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:31,820
Come on, Si Eon.

1709
01:14:31,820 --> 01:14:33,889
Let's get food from a convenience store.

1710
01:14:35,389 --> 01:14:36,660
Just look around here.

1711
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,559
How about some fruit?

1712
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:40,500
I'll have a watermelon.

1713
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,099
Let's look for watermelons.

1714
01:14:42,099 --> 01:14:43,500
Excuse me.

1715
01:14:45,599 --> 01:14:46,740
How much is it?

1716
01:14:48,370 --> 01:14:49,410
(Are they Peruvian watermelons?)

1717
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:51,110
They look like pumpkins,
but they were watermelons.

1718
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:52,210
Them?

1719
01:14:52,639 --> 01:14:53,939
How much...

1720
01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:56,210
It's 1.7 dollars per piece.

1721
01:14:56,879 --> 01:14:58,650
- Five.
- How much?

1722
01:15:00,679 --> 01:15:02,790
You said this... Five?

1723
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:04,589
(Nodding)

1724
01:15:04,589 --> 01:15:05,620
Okay.

1725
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:07,460
(They understood each other.)

1726
01:15:07,589 --> 01:15:10,089
- It's so cheap.
- It's about 1.8 dollars.

1727
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:13,900
Thank you.

1728
01:15:15,299 --> 01:15:16,670
Thank you.

1729
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:18,000
The watermelons look so good.

1730
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,939
- It was so sweet.
- It was good.

1731
01:15:19,939 --> 01:15:21,500
We'll take some home.

1732
01:15:22,969 --> 01:15:24,540
Yes.

1733
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:25,580
Thank you.

1734
01:15:26,179 --> 01:15:27,610
It's so cheap.

1735
01:15:27,879 --> 01:15:28,910
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Bye.

1736
01:15:31,110 --> 01:15:33,849
(Crispy)

1737
01:15:35,179 --> 01:15:36,549
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

1738
01:15:37,849 --> 01:15:39,259
Can't we get Korean ramyeon?

1739
01:15:39,259 --> 01:15:41,189
(He's still hung up on it.)

1740
01:15:41,189 --> 01:15:44,229
I can't eat anything from here.

1741
01:15:44,229 --> 01:15:46,360
(The city boy still needs time to adjust.)

1742
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,900
I'd rather starve.

1743
01:15:48,629 --> 01:15:49,900
The watermelon is good, though.

1744
01:15:53,839 --> 01:15:55,040
I'm very tired.

1745
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:57,509
He couldn't have a meal.

1746
01:15:58,339 --> 01:16:03,879
(They go back to their lodging
after having one piece of watermelon.)

1747
01:16:04,979 --> 01:16:07,019
(Surprised)

1748
01:16:07,019 --> 01:16:08,250
How refreshing.

1749
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:09,650
(Their batteries are recharged
in the lodging.)

1750
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:10,790
I'm so happy.

1751
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:12,990
I'm still out of it.

1752
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:16,229
I still see the hind leg of the alligator.

1753
01:16:16,229 --> 01:16:17,589
That was shocking.

1754
01:16:17,589 --> 01:16:18,900
- So, Kian84.
- Yes.

1755
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,360
What do we take to the Amazon River?

1756
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:23,870
The guy at the counter will guide us.

1757
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,370
I'll pay for you too.

1758
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:28,599
I'll ask him how much.

1759
01:16:29,410 --> 01:16:31,839
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1760
01:16:32,179 --> 01:16:33,280
The Amazon...

1761
01:16:34,710 --> 01:16:36,280
- Fish tour.
- fish tour.

1762
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,479
One more person, please.

1763
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:39,120
- We have 100 dollars.
- Mr. Kim?

1764
01:16:39,879 --> 01:16:40,879
- Hello.
- Hello.

1765
01:16:40,879 --> 01:16:43,320
My name is Orlando, Eric's dad.

1766
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,889
Will he take us on the fishing tour?

1767
01:16:44,889 --> 01:16:46,389
He's Eric's dad.

1768
01:16:46,389 --> 01:16:48,120
He's at the river.

1769
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:50,689
- We're two people.
- Two people.

1770
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:52,360
It's 80 dollars...

1771
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:55,129
if you want to add one more person.

1772
01:16:55,129 --> 01:16:56,370
- It's 80 dollars?
- Yes.

1773
01:16:56,370 --> 01:16:57,570
It's 80.

1774
01:16:57,570 --> 01:16:58,629
(Let me see...)

1775
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,670
- You said 80 dollars?
- Yes.

1776
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:03,439
- Change.
- It's 100 dollars.

1777
01:17:04,009 --> 01:17:06,040
- That means...
- Here are 20 dollars.

1778
01:17:06,139 --> 01:17:07,679
This is the change.

1779
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:09,379
Okay.

1780
01:17:09,379 --> 01:17:11,309
- So...
- That values more.

1781
01:17:11,309 --> 01:17:13,580
It's 160 dollars, and this is...

1782
01:17:14,519 --> 01:17:16,120
Well, it's about that.

1783
01:17:16,519 --> 01:17:17,820
Okay.

1784
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:20,160
- Is it correct?
- I have no idea.

1785
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:21,820
- I guess it's right.
- It's around that price.

1786
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:23,790
- I paid about 100 dollars too.
- Okay.

1787
01:17:23,790 --> 01:17:25,629
Don't you go to the jungle...

1788
01:17:25,629 --> 01:17:27,530
on an Amazon tour?

1789
01:17:27,530 --> 01:17:29,200
- Yes.
- Is there a fishing tour too?

1790
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:30,929
You're right. Are you curious?

1791
01:17:30,929 --> 01:17:32,139
- Yes?
- Nothing.

1792
01:17:32,139 --> 01:17:34,000
- I was waiting for you.
- Okay.

1793
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:37,939
Let me tell you about Amazon jungle tours.

1794
01:17:37,939 --> 01:17:39,780
Amazon jungle tours can be
as short as one day.

1795
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:43,110
If you go deep into the jungle,

1796
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:46,420
it could be even longer than a week.

1797
01:17:46,519 --> 01:17:48,349
There are various tour courses.

1798
01:17:48,349 --> 01:17:50,250
Let me tell you a few.

1799
01:17:50,349 --> 01:17:53,460
First of all,
you can go into the Amazon jungle...

1800
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:55,689
and see some insects, plants,

1801
01:17:55,689 --> 01:17:57,589
and animals like monkeys,
alligators, and so on.

1802
01:17:57,589 --> 01:17:59,830
You can also try fishing in the river...

1803
01:17:59,830 --> 01:18:01,559
- like Kian84 did.
- Right.

1804
01:18:01,559 --> 01:18:04,629
You can travel a little far
and see pink dolphins.

1805
01:18:04,629 --> 01:18:07,540
You can swim while enjoying the sunset.

1806
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:09,570
- You did a lot of research.
- I did.

1807
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:11,769
Out of all these tours,

1808
01:18:11,769 --> 01:18:13,509
the fishing tour that Kian84 booked...

1809
01:18:13,509 --> 01:18:15,879
especially focuses on fishing.

1810
01:18:15,879 --> 01:18:17,549
Did I sound like I was
on "A Story about the Day?"

1811
01:18:17,549 --> 01:18:18,580
Yes.

1812
01:18:18,580 --> 01:18:20,049
- "A Story about the Day."
- I thought we were on SBS.

1813
01:18:20,049 --> 01:18:21,820
- I'm sorry. This is MBC.
- I felt like I was watching that show.

1814
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:22,849
I see.

1815
01:18:23,790 --> 01:18:27,820
(He carries a big bag wherever he goes.)

1816
01:18:29,689 --> 01:18:32,799
(On the other hand,
Kian84 doesn't really carry anything.)

1817
01:18:35,670 --> 01:18:37,269
- You brought a backpack?
- Yes.

1818
01:18:37,269 --> 01:18:38,599
What did you bring that big bag for?

1819
01:18:39,870 --> 01:18:40,969
Everyone...

1820
01:18:40,969 --> 01:18:43,040
(Everyone.)

1821
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,910
We're off to the Amazon River now.

1822
01:18:46,379 --> 01:18:47,979
It's a manual car.

1823
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:52,080
I saw the dashboard,
and this car has traveled 230,000km.

1824
01:18:52,750 --> 01:18:56,920
It takes about 15 minutes
from the city to Nanay Port.

1825
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,620
It's 50 minutes? It's quite far.

1826
01:18:58,620 --> 01:18:59,960
No, 15 minutes.

1827
01:19:00,689 --> 01:19:02,229
Look at you.

1828
01:19:02,729 --> 01:19:03,790
Didn't he say 15?

1829
01:19:03,790 --> 01:19:05,530
Wasn't it 50?

1830
01:19:05,530 --> 01:19:07,500
- He said 15.
- Fifteen.

1831
01:19:07,830 --> 01:19:10,900
Fifteen is 1 and 5, and 50 is 5 and 0.

1832
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,030
You didn't even know that.

1833
01:19:13,799 --> 01:19:14,839
Are we here?

1834
01:19:16,370 --> 01:19:18,070
(Koreans, let's get out.)

1835
01:19:20,139 --> 01:19:22,139
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1836
01:19:23,450 --> 01:19:25,349
Are you on a march?

1837
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:28,450
I used to be amazing at marching.

1838
01:19:29,349 --> 01:19:30,589
I should record this.

1839
01:19:30,589 --> 01:19:31,849
(His bag is bigger than a soldier's gear.)

1840
01:19:31,849 --> 01:19:33,219
How heavy is this?

1841
01:19:33,219 --> 01:19:35,290
It's not that heavy.
It was less than 20kg.

1842
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:37,589
Is Pani Bottle inside the bag?

1843
01:19:38,389 --> 01:19:39,500
All of sudden, he comes up.

1844
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:40,599
He might pop out.

1845
01:19:40,599 --> 01:19:42,160
It'll be a surprise.

1846
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:44,170
I'm sorry. I was impatient.

1847
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:46,500
We'll walk through Nanay Market first.

1848
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,639
We can see alligator meat too.

1849
01:19:48,639 --> 01:19:50,540
- We need hats.
- The regional...

1850
01:19:50,809 --> 01:19:52,439
- Hats.
- Hats?

1851
01:19:53,379 --> 01:19:54,979
Where's my hat?

1852
01:19:55,210 --> 01:19:57,650
I brought a hat, but I couldn't find it.

1853
01:19:57,650 --> 01:19:59,320
I'm sure I put it in here.

1854
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:01,219
- Hats.
- Hats?

1855
01:20:01,219 --> 01:20:02,589
- Okay.
- Hats.

1856
01:20:04,389 --> 01:20:05,820
Look at the buildings. Gosh.

1857
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:06,920
(They go to the market
near the port first.)

1858
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,820
How do I put it into words?

1859
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,460
It's beyond description.

1860
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:14,259
(You can get the strong vibe
of the local market.)

1861
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:16,469
He has such a good posture.

1862
01:20:17,299 --> 01:20:19,570
- That's true.
- His walking posture.

1863
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,139
Look at him walking.

1864
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:24,240
Your walk hasn't changed.

1865
01:20:25,979 --> 01:20:27,839
(Si Eon still walks duck-footed.)

1866
01:20:28,009 --> 01:20:29,979
You should learn his walk.

1867
01:20:31,809 --> 01:20:33,719
- I see hats over there.
- Where?

1868
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,589
- Shall we buy a hat each?
- Yes.

1869
01:20:36,589 --> 01:20:38,549
- Mister.
- Mister, wait.

1870
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:40,920
- We want to buy hats.
- Hats.

1871
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,860
I want a navy one.

1872
01:20:43,189 --> 01:20:45,660
(They bought the hats they needed.)

1873
01:20:46,929 --> 01:20:48,200
The hats look good on them.

1874
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,129
(Guerrilla training)

1875
01:20:50,469 --> 01:20:52,070
He's in a good mood now.

1876
01:20:54,269 --> 01:20:56,240
I felt good with the big backpack.

1877
01:20:56,240 --> 01:20:57,309
(Now the old man
misses his time in the military.)

1878
01:20:57,639 --> 01:20:59,679
What does he have on his shoulder?

1879
01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:01,309
- What's that?
- What is that?

1880
01:21:01,309 --> 01:21:02,950
- What?
- A monkey?

1881
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:04,809
- Can I touch it?
- Is that a monkey?

1882
01:21:04,809 --> 01:21:06,349
- It was so cute.
- That's so cute.

1883
01:21:06,349 --> 01:21:07,580
It's adorable.

1884
01:21:08,179 --> 01:21:10,620
- He must be keeping it as a pet.
- It's so interesting.

1885
01:21:11,389 --> 01:21:12,920
How small the monkey is.

1886
01:21:13,089 --> 01:21:14,089
I know.

1887
01:21:16,229 --> 01:21:17,589
This way.

1888
01:21:18,129 --> 01:21:19,360
Okay.

1889
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,360
(Where is the guide bringing them?)

1890
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,700
Here they have fresh water.

1891
01:21:22,599 --> 01:21:23,769
It's a restaurant.

1892
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:26,639
Let's eat something.

1893
01:21:27,099 --> 01:21:28,639
This is alligator meat.

1894
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:30,240
- Alligator?
- Yes.

1895
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:31,809
This is very delicious.

1896
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:33,740
(They saw raw alligator meat
in the morning.)

1897
01:21:34,379 --> 01:21:35,410
(Surprised)

1898
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:37,250
(I'm scared.)

1899
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:39,120
- Should we try some alligator meat?
- I won't.

1900
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,479
Do you want some?

1901
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:41,679
(Shaking his head)

1902
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:42,820
I wish he did.

1903
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:46,320
- One alligator.
- Alligator.

1904
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:49,960
What do you want?

1905
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:52,229
- I want a banana.
- A banana.

1906
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:55,360
One alligator and one banana.

1907
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:58,129
One rice from here.

1908
01:21:58,129 --> 01:22:00,969
There is a lot of alligator meat.
I should take some home.

1909
01:22:00,969 --> 01:22:02,339
(Grilled alligator meat
and a roasted banana)

1910
01:22:02,610 --> 01:22:05,269
(He's reluctant to have lunch.)

1911
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:07,809
(The owner brings them
a big bowl of something.)

1912
01:22:07,879 --> 01:22:08,910
(Wriggling)

1913
01:22:09,809 --> 01:22:11,179
- What's that?
- What is that?

1914
01:22:11,179 --> 01:22:12,820
What is this?

1915
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:14,979
These are edible larvae.

1916
01:22:15,049 --> 01:22:17,349
(The Amazon food source
caught them off guard.)

1917
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:19,420
(It's good.)

1918
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:25,120
(Kian84 bravely picks up a roasted larva.)

1919
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:28,189
(He takes a big bite.)

1920
01:22:27,689 --> 01:22:28,830
That's brave.

1921
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:31,830
You see people eat raw larvae
in documentaries.

1922
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:33,469
I thought I could too.

1923
01:22:34,570 --> 01:22:35,740
It's not that bad.

1924
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:37,900
I think pupae are better.

1925
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:39,410
They have to keep this scene in the show.

1926
01:22:39,410 --> 01:22:40,410
A pupa.

1927
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:41,439
(He tries one more.)

1928
01:22:41,439 --> 01:22:43,009
I can't eat the heads, though.

1929
01:22:44,339 --> 01:22:46,009
- The heads.
- Oh, my.

1930
01:22:46,009 --> 01:22:47,080
(He wants to go home.)

1931
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:49,280
- Oh, dear.
- His reaction is so funny.

1932
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:50,879
The main dish is...

1933
01:22:50,879 --> 01:22:52,049
(It's time to try the main dish.)

1934
01:22:52,049 --> 01:22:53,950
alligator meat from the Amazon River.

1935
01:22:55,019 --> 01:22:57,960
Let me try some alligator meat.

1936
01:22:58,660 --> 01:22:59,729
(He puts a lot of sauce on it.)

1937
01:22:59,729 --> 01:23:01,089
Si Eon doesn't like it.

1938
01:23:03,129 --> 01:23:04,299
What's that? Alligator meat?

1939
01:23:04,299 --> 01:23:05,330
(He tried a big piece.)

1940
01:23:05,330 --> 01:23:06,769
It must be savory.

1941
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:10,740
He's not picky.

1942
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:12,769
(Chomping)

1943
01:23:12,769 --> 01:23:14,269
I can't read his face.

1944
01:23:14,269 --> 01:23:15,979
He's frowning.

1945
01:23:15,979 --> 01:23:17,110
(I know this taste.)

1946
01:23:17,339 --> 01:23:19,410
It tastes like chicken...

1947
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:21,820
that worked out hard.

1948
01:23:22,049 --> 01:23:24,049
It tasted similar to chicken.

1949
01:23:24,679 --> 01:23:27,150
(He tries another piece.)

1950
01:23:28,189 --> 01:23:31,320
I see why they're good fighters.

1951
01:23:31,729 --> 01:23:33,429
Their bodies are just muscles.

1952
01:23:33,830 --> 01:23:36,429
You should run away
if you meet an alligator.

1953
01:23:36,429 --> 01:23:37,660
- That's good advice.
- Yes.

1954
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:39,099
Run if you meet an alligator.

1955
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:41,099
Try a small piece.

1956
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:42,570
(I don't want to.)

1957
01:23:42,570 --> 01:23:44,439
- Oh, no. He hasn't eaten at all.
- I have a weak stomach.

1958
01:23:44,599 --> 01:23:47,670
You look like
you'll eat raw alligator meat.

1959
01:23:48,410 --> 01:23:49,809
You get disgusted so easily.

1960
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:54,379
It's like you lived such a sheltered life.

1961
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:56,549
Like a nobleman.

1962
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:58,920
(Si Eon tries a piece.)

1963
01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:02,820
It tastes like the chicken breast you eat
when you're on a diet.

1964
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:04,259
It's just like chicken breast.

1965
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:07,929
I feel like I'll become muscular
like an alligator.

1966
01:24:07,929 --> 01:24:10,360
(Laughing)

1967
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:12,799
It was almost the same as chicken breast.

1968
01:24:13,799 --> 01:24:15,799
But a little drier.

1969
01:24:15,799 --> 01:24:17,170
(Munching)

1970
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:20,139
I think I can try alligator meat.

1971
01:24:20,139 --> 01:24:22,210
- Me too.
- I can't eat the larvae, though.

1972
01:24:22,210 --> 01:24:25,349
If they're roasted, I can try some.

1973
01:24:25,349 --> 01:24:27,950
Gosh. I'd rather die than eat the larvae.

1974
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,349
Isn't it better to eat them than to die?

1975
01:24:30,349 --> 01:24:31,990
(That's true.)

1976
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:33,650
You should keep living
in this beautiful world.

1977
01:24:33,650 --> 01:24:35,920
I guess if my life was on the line,
I should eat them.

1978
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,389
She's so good.

1979
01:24:37,389 --> 01:24:39,330
- Do Yeon is so witty.
- Thank you.

1980
01:24:39,330 --> 01:24:41,729
- What would we do without her?
- I know.

1981
01:24:42,500 --> 01:24:43,559
I'm full.

1982
01:24:43,929 --> 01:24:46,969
I don't know when I'll get to eat
alligator meat again.

1983
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:50,240
That's it.

1984
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,339
Thank you.

1985
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:57,280
I think I'll be full
for the rest of the day.

1986
01:24:58,410 --> 01:25:00,379
You eat less than I thought.

1987
01:25:00,479 --> 01:25:01,979
I just realized that too.

1988
01:25:03,519 --> 01:25:06,189
The river is as big as the ocean.

1989
01:25:07,790 --> 01:25:10,660
They use it like a terminal.

1990
01:25:11,559 --> 01:25:13,559
(Many ships are at the port.)

1991
01:25:13,559 --> 01:25:14,830
Is that our boat?

1992
01:25:14,830 --> 01:25:17,200
(The Nanay River flows around
the rainforest like an island.)

1993
01:25:17,200 --> 01:25:19,200
(Most of the Amazon tours take off
from the Nanay River port.)

1994
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,969
This is Eric.

1995
01:25:21,969 --> 01:25:24,000
- My name is Eric.
- Eric.

1996
01:25:24,599 --> 01:25:27,240
(When he was booking
the fishing tour yesterday,)

1997
01:25:27,740 --> 01:25:29,610
(there was a pamphlet for the tour.)

1998
01:25:29,610 --> 01:25:31,580
(Eric is the fishing tour guide
in the poster.)

1999
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:33,210
- Okay.
- Iquitos.

2000
01:25:33,210 --> 01:25:34,950
- Iquitos.
- Welcome to Iquitos.

2001
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:37,080
- Iquitos is the best.
- Iquitos.

2002
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:39,750
This is our boat.

2003
01:25:39,750 --> 01:25:42,719
(They're finally off to the Amazon River.)

2004
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:47,530
- Oh, my.
- Goodness.

2005
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:48,700
It's nice.

2006
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:51,530
(The large stream unfolds
before their eyes.)

2007
01:25:51,559 --> 01:25:54,099
- The Amazon River.
- It was so big.

2008
01:25:54,099 --> 01:25:55,839
(The lifeline of South America flows
across 7 countries.)

2009
01:25:56,670 --> 01:25:58,000
(The Amazon River is
the world's largest river.)

2010
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,769
When will I get to ride a boat...

2011
01:26:00,769 --> 01:26:02,540
on the Amazon River again?

2012
01:26:02,839 --> 01:26:04,139
Is that the river?

2013
01:26:04,679 --> 01:26:06,879
- The Amazon River?
- The Amazon River.

2014
01:26:06,879 --> 01:26:08,379
This is the Amazon River.

2015
01:26:08,379 --> 01:26:09,580
The Amazon River.

2016
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:14,450
(The two travelers are sailing...)

2017
01:26:16,660 --> 01:26:20,530
(into the endless wilderness.)

2018
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:23,059
Hey, look at that.

2019
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:24,400
Look at that guy.

2020
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:26,830
He's fishing.

2021
01:26:26,830 --> 01:26:27,900
(The Amazon River is...)

2022
01:26:28,599 --> 01:26:32,839
(home to the residents of Iquitos.)

2023
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:38,080
I realized I was in a different world.

2024
01:26:38,309 --> 01:26:39,509
Hello.

2025
01:26:40,450 --> 01:26:41,750
(The locals say hello back.)

2026
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:43,450
I don't know how to describe it.

2027
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:45,519
Not everyone can come here easily.

2028
01:26:45,519 --> 01:26:47,049
This could be...

2029
01:26:47,049 --> 01:26:49,519
our first and last time being here.

2030
01:26:49,519 --> 01:26:50,689
I loved it.

2031
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:55,799
Does the river flow
through multiple countries?

2032
01:26:55,799 --> 01:26:59,030
So, Amazon doesn't refer
to a specific place.

2033
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:01,570
- It's the Amazon rainforest.
- Yes.

2034
01:27:01,570 --> 01:27:02,969
Here's a map.

2035
01:27:02,969 --> 01:27:04,040
It looks like a real estate agency.

2036
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:05,910
- Is that the Amazon jungle?
- A real estate agency.

2037
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:07,570
Yes. This is the Amazon.

2038
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:10,080
A part of it is also in Colombia.

2039
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,679
Colombian coffee.

2040
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:13,950
The river flows in Columbia...

2041
01:27:13,950 --> 01:27:15,179
and also Brazil.

2042
01:27:15,179 --> 01:27:17,920
This is Iquitos right here.

2043
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:20,189
There are so many unfamiliar names.

2044
01:27:20,189 --> 01:27:21,349
(The boat is at a small tributary now.)

2045
01:27:21,349 --> 01:27:22,719
Right. That's how we came in.

2046
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:24,219
That was the start.

2047
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,229
We're going into a small stream now.

2048
01:27:26,229 --> 01:27:28,530
As if we're getting out of a highway
and going into a small road.

2049
01:27:28,530 --> 01:27:29,830
It's a small river.

2050
01:27:30,559 --> 01:27:31,799
The Amazon River.

2051
01:27:32,900 --> 01:27:35,400
- Jungle.
- Go to the jungle.

2052
01:27:40,339 --> 01:27:41,809
Is he going to wash his face again?

2053
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:45,979
(What is he doing?)

2054
01:27:48,410 --> 01:27:50,320
(After washing his face)

2055
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,379
Are you washing your hair too?

2056
01:27:51,379 --> 01:27:53,049
He washes them at once.

2057
01:27:53,049 --> 01:27:55,420
(He's always a mystery.)

2058
01:27:55,460 --> 01:27:59,290
So after we fish,

2059
01:27:59,589 --> 01:28:01,559
can we go with it?

2060
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:03,360
Can we take what we fished home?

2061
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:05,229
I don't think so.

2062
01:28:05,229 --> 01:28:07,769
Really? I heard they could cook it for us.

2063
01:28:08,170 --> 01:28:09,769
Let's just let them go...

2064
01:28:09,769 --> 01:28:11,099
after taking a look at them.

2065
01:28:11,540 --> 01:28:13,570
I want to see pirarucus.

2066
01:28:13,639 --> 01:28:16,210
(Pirarucus are one
of the largest freshwater fish,)

2067
01:28:16,210 --> 01:28:18,240
(which are 4 to 5cm and weigh 200kg.)

2068
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:21,750
Kian84, don't you feel like
we'll catch something huge?

2069
01:28:22,150 --> 01:28:23,650
Right? I have that feeling too.

2070
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:27,389
Where are we going? Whatever.

2071
01:28:27,389 --> 01:28:29,460
It took longer than we thought.

2072
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:30,719
Why does it take so long?

2073
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:33,259
(The two got tired from a long boat ride.)

2074
01:28:33,559 --> 01:28:36,229
(Singing)

2075
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,830
(As they get deeper
into the Amazon river,)

2076
01:28:41,070 --> 01:28:44,170
(they get more exhausted.)

2077
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,710
(Are you singing K-pop?)

2078
01:28:50,910 --> 01:28:51,950
I think we're here.

2079
01:28:51,950 --> 01:28:53,910
(After a long ride,
they arrived at a remote jungle.)

2080
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:56,019
Oh, my.

2081
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,349
- Okay.
- Okay.

2082
01:28:59,349 --> 01:29:01,519
(They follow the guide and take
their first step into the Amazon jungle.)

2083
01:29:01,790 --> 01:29:03,490
We came such a long way.

2084
01:29:04,059 --> 01:29:06,660
- It was such a long ride.
- I know.

2085
01:29:07,790 --> 01:29:08,960
What are we going to do?

2086
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:11,830
- What is that?
- What's that?

2087
01:29:11,830 --> 01:29:13,200
- What are they?
- Monkeys?

2088
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:14,370
(A mysterious scream surrounds them.)

2089
01:29:16,670 --> 01:29:20,670
(The two men are being sucked
into an unknown jungle.)

2090
01:29:21,910 --> 01:29:25,139
(What will they see in the Amazon jungle?)

2091
01:29:25,809 --> 01:29:28,250
Where are they taking us?
We were going to fish.

2092
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:33,719
(They get to fish piranhas...)

2093
01:29:33,719 --> 01:29:35,820
(in the deepest part of the Amazon River.)

2094
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:37,389
(Here it is.)

2095
01:29:37,389 --> 01:29:38,389
(Is it here?)

2096
01:29:38,929 --> 01:29:39,929
(It is!)

2097
01:29:40,290 --> 01:29:41,559
(Piranhas in the Amazon are formidable.)

2098
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:43,299
(Kian84 jumps into the river.)

2099
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:45,129
(Don't grab the boat.)

2100
01:29:45,769 --> 01:29:47,030
(I feel like an alligator is coming.)

2101
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:48,429
(The more intimidating one is coming.)

2102
01:29:48,599 --> 01:29:50,400
(There must be 1 ton of them
in the river.)

2103
01:29:50,599 --> 01:29:52,469
(While drying their bodies,)

2104
01:29:52,469 --> 01:29:53,769
(they fall asleep.)

2105
01:29:54,240 --> 01:29:56,309
(Roast piranhas for dinner)

2106
01:29:56,309 --> 01:29:58,009
(It's been so long
since I was invited to someone's house.)

2107
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:01,150
(But a mysterious Amazonian food appears?)

2108
01:30:03,019 --> 01:30:05,349
(The shocking way it was cooked)

2109
01:30:05,990 --> 01:30:07,019
(Crying out)

2110
01:30:07,019 --> 01:30:08,519
(I won't watch this.)

2111
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:09,990
(It's a culture shock, really.)

2112
01:30:12,030 --> 01:30:15,460
(And...)

2113
01:30:17,259 --> 01:30:18,460
(You're ignoring me completely.)

2114
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:19,469
(Why are you doing that?)
