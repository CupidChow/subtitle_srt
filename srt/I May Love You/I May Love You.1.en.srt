68
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:30,940
Yes.

69

70
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,020
He's very upset.

71
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,340
I have to seize the chance
and win him over.

(You Huan, Independent Fashion Designer)
Don't you mind

73
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,856
he has pursued Ming Zhu before?

74
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,260
Of course, I do.

75
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,580
But,

76
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,820
I still like him.

77
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,580
Besides, Ming Zhu is married

78
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,780
to Captain Lu already.

79
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,140
Tang Yu has no more chance.

80
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,420
Since you're so open-minded,

81
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,540
I can rest easy then.

82
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,460
I was worried

83
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,860
you and Ming Zhu
might have some issues because of this.

84
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,980
What were you thinking?

85
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,220
Ming Zhu doesn't like Tang Yu.

86
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,980
The reason
she agreed to cooperate with me

87
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,140
was to give me more chances
to be with Tang Yu.

88
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,300
Okay.

89
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,980

(Yeah.)

98
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,780
(He refuses no matter what.)

99
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,260
(It must be at that price.)

100
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,940

Rest assured.

106

We've revised a new design plan

107
00:04:44,128 --> 00:04:45,620

I'll have Gao Heng

109
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,760

send you the new design later.

(and Renowned Producer)

111
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,260
Mr. Tang.

112
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,660
You changed the design plan?

113
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,620
If we make mistakes,
we'll need post-production editing,

114
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,260
and it'll cost more.

115
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,360
Isn't that a waste of money?

116
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,820
Money is not an issue.

117
00:04:59,100 --> 00:04:59,820

118
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,060
(the price you offered)

119
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:02,780
(last time was quite reasonable.)

120
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,020
(We'll move.)

121
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:05,820
Really?

122
00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:07,500
Didn't your family live there
for three generations?

123
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,660
So, you're attached to it.

124
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,180
(Well, that's true.)

125
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,060
(But as long as the price is right,)

126
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,780
(we can agree.)

127
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,340
It's not about
whether you agree or not now,

128
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,700
it's about me not agreeing.

129
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,180
I think keeping this house is nice.

130
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,380

will become a touristy spot too.)

Wait.

149
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,540
No.

150
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,700
I object.

151
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,992

to the market price for demolition,

158

sign the contract, and move out,

Yes.

169
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,060
was brilliant.

170
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,060
Very clever.

171
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:30,820
Enough.

00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:17,100
If we pause now, our company
will face big compensation claims.

188
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,980
Our production team suggests for us

189
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,700
to take the victim stance
since the novel

190
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,740
is suspected of plagiarism.

191
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,300
When we bought the novel,

192
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,180
it was because

193
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,020
we didn't realize it plagiarized others.

194
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,980
This is our own oversight.

195
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,580
Now that there's an issue,

196
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,940
Time has to bear the consequences.

197
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,380
If that's the case,

198
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,780
"White Dew to Frost"
will be the only project we can develop.

199
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,340
I will find a new project.

200
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,780
Understood.

201
00:07:48,448 --> 00:07:49,300
I'll get back to work.

202
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,940
Mr. Tang.

203
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,580
Mr. Tang.

204
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,340
What is it?

205
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,380
I've brought you a cake.

206
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,340
Dessert can boost dopamine.

207
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,040
I figured after your recent heartbreak,

208
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,540
you might still be feeling down.

209
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,340
So, I got you a big one.

210
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,940
Thank you.

211
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:36,840
I don't need it.

212
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,180
Keep it for yourself.

213
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,260
Actually,

214
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,560
a heartbreak is not a big deal.

215
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,100
Maybe there's someone

216
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,340
more suitable around you.

217
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:48,900
I didn't notice that.

218
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,900
Tang Xin, why are you here

219
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,300
anyway?

220
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,776
To bring you a cake.

221
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,460
Don't you have other jobs to do?

222
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,380
As your ally,

223
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,940
it's my job to take care

224
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,300
of your emotions too, isn't it?

225
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,500
Mr. Tang.

226
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,120
I'll take my leave then.

227
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,020
Close the door for me.

228
00:09:27,872 --> 00:09:28,950
(Six months ago)
Mr. Tang.

229
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,100
I can help you pursue Ming Zhu.

230
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,500
Pursuing a girl is challenging.

231
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,420
So,

232
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,060
you'll have to listen to me

233
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,020
from now on.

234
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,540
Sure.

235
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,740
(It's my 1,352nd day
of crushing on him.)

236
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,420
(I've gotten used to joy and heartache.)

237
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,940
(You don't see me for who I am
even when I stand in front of you.)

238
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,780
(You can't discern my thoughts,)

239
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,500
(let alone my chaotic state.)

240
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,260
(Tang Yu.)

241
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,260
(What should I do)

242
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,020
(to make you fall for me?)

243
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:22,620
Hey.

244
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,460
Huan.

245
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:24,980
How did it go?

246
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,900
My opportunistic plan failed.

247
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,860
He didn't even take a bite.

248
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,100
Alright.

249
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,420
So be it.

250
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,180
(To be honest,)

251
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,300
(you're beating around the bush.)

252
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,780
(One eats Tang Sanzang's flesh
to live long.)

253
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,100
(One doesn't fatten him up
or give him a good bath.)

254
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,300
(Your goal)

255
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,940
is to make Tang Yu
your boyfriend soon.

256
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,940
Now that you mention it,

257
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,620
I did seem to make a big circle.

258
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,460
Right?

259
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,340
I told you.

260
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,580
Bad one die from talking too much,

261
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,390
and monsters die
from having too many affairs.

262
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,860
You're the monster.

263
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,540
You just wait and see.

264
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,510
Before, I didn't play a straight ball,

265
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,340
but if I really did,

266
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,860
he might not be able to handle it.

267
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,420
Alright.

268
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,140
Bye.

269
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,260
(Screenwriting Department)

270
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,260
("A Dream for You" Proposal)

271
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,220
(Trending: 1 Zhou Jialu and Tang Yu
Went Home Together Late at Night)

272
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,300
She's a rising 95 Liner young actress.

273
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,820
So why not?

274
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,420
If it were me,

275
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:45,940
I'd date her.

276
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,060
Me too.

277
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,060
That's you.

278
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,350
Mr. Tang isn't short of dates.

279
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,900
I think it's real though.

280
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,820
I saw Zhou Jialu

281
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,140
coming to our company that day.

282
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,100
Xiaoxiao.

283
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,752
What are they talking about?

284
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,980
Haven't you checked Weibo?

285
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,350
It came first on the trending list.

286
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,940
Xin.

287
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:08,340
You've been close to Mr. Tang lately.

288
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,580
Do you have any insider information?

289
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,980
This is obviously fake news.

290
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,420
How do you know?

291
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,260
There are photos.

292
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,660
(I couldn't tell her)

293
00:12:19,936 --> 00:12:21,140
(Tang Yu just had a heartbreak)

294
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,380
(and his crush wasn't Zhou Jialu.)

295
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,940
Many in the entertainment industry
have tried to get close to Mr. Tang.

296
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,180
This hot topic is obviously planned.

297
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:31,780
(Han Xiaoxiao)
You're right. Mr. Tang

298
00:12:31,808 --> 00:12:34,080
(Time's newbie screenwriter)
has been in hot topics before.

299
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,420
Besides, he is not that kind of man.

300
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,660
Contact Zhou Jialu's team.

301
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,860
Tell them to clarify it.

302
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:49,980
Don't make me do it.

303
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,540
Alright.

304
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:51,660
Mr. Tang.

305
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:53,780
Hello.

306
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,020
Mr. Tang
wanted the hot topic handled now.

307
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,864
Do not do it again.

308
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,140
Mr. Tang.

309
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,440
What a coincidence.

310
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,020
What was that for?

311
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,900
To see whether
you have the scent of a woman on you.

312
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,660
Did you smell anything?

313
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,780
No, not at all.

314
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:49,900
I guess with your recent heartbreak,

315
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,500
you're probably not in the mood for that.

316
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,860
I knew

317
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,860
it was just a rumor.

318
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:56,980
Tang Xin.

319
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,860
Every time you mention the breakup,

320
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,380
it's like reminding me

321
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,300
how unreliable you are as an ally.

322
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:10,140
You won't be able to win her over.

323
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,330
I'm just helping you
to realize that sooner.

324
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,620
Mr. Tang, you first.

325
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,580
(Zhou Jialu clarifies rumors
with Tang Yu.)

326
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,460
Not bad.

327
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,220
Quick response.

328
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,100
You have good virtue.

329
00:14:28,304 --> 00:14:29,320
You're worthy of praise.

330
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,220
What virtue?

331
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,580
It's the noble qualities
of being a male boss.

332
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:36,860
I'll drive myself.

333
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:37,500
You go ahead.

334
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,140
Alright.

335
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,220
Oh, shoot.

336
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,300
I forgot I took my car

337
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,300
to a 4S Store for maintenance yesterday.

338
00:14:47,968 --> 00:14:49,640
How could you
forget something like that?

339
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,300
Why not?

340
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:52,940
Mr. Tang.

341
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,020
How about I drive?

342
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,140
This way,
I can drop off Miss Tang as well.

343
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,940
No need to trouble you, Mr. Gao.

344
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,940
You finally get off work on time.

345
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,500
How about

346
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,140
I drive you, Mr. Tang?

347
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,950
Give her the keys.

348
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,500
(I just want to sit)

349
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,020
(in the passenger seat,
the so-called girlfriend's seat.)

350
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,740
(I don't really want to be his driver.)

351
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,940
(His legs are long.)

352
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,020
Stop.

353
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,780
That's enough.

354
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,300
Why are you nervous?

355
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,180
I'm not nervous.

356
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,900
I'm not nervous at all.

357
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:42,180
Are you sure you can handle this car?

358
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,020
Of course.

359
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:55,940
(Shoot.)

360
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,340
(Mr. Gao has spotted my car.)

361
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,660
(I mustn't let Tang Yu see it.)

362
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,500
(Otherwise, it'll be hard to explain.)

363
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,960
(Exit)

364
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,180
Watch out!

365
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,300
How about I drive?

366
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:18,660
No need.

367
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,340
Mr. Tang, how can I let you drive?

368
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,700
You can sit or lie down.

369
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,420
I assure you
my driving skills match yours.

370
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,060
Mr. Tang, you sound

371
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,780
like a pervert.

372
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:37,580
Let's go.

373
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,100
Mr. Tang.

374
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,140
Mr. Tang.

375
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,620
Are you upset?

376
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:02,860
What?

377
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,660
I mean,

378
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,500
are you sad?

379
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,580
Tang Xin.

380
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,020
Why did you agree
to help me pursue Ming Zhu

381
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,820
if you think we're incompatible?

382
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,920
I didn't think
you two were incompatible.

383
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,020
Really?

384
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,540
Why the double-dealing then?

385
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,660
You provided me

386
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,540
with fake information about Ming Zhu.

387
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,820
It's because she doesn't like you.

388
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,140
Ming Zhu and Captain Lu

389
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,744
have known each other since high school.

390
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,980
You appeared a bit later.

391
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,300
Mr. Tang.

392
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,540
I have a question.

393
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,180
Go ahead.

394
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,180
Have you ever considered

395
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:51,020
developing a female-oriented project?

396
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,740
After all, our male-oriented projects
are quite stable.

397
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,300
How about you become the CEO of Time?

398
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,740
At 30 years old, a man still

399
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,300
hasn't had a serious girlfriend.

400
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,260
Isn't it weird?

401
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,380
Doesn't it mean he has issues?

402
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,660
How's that weird?

403
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,580
He can always find one at a later time.

404
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,780
(Tang Dingding)
If our son wants,

405
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,180
(a recent graduate)
he can get married at 50.

406
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,540
The age of 30 is a hurdle for men.

407
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,380
Once they cross it,
they're not desirable anymore,

408
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,860
like a rotten vegetable in the market.

409
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,780
How can you describe your son like that?

410
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,500
Why not?

411
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,540
Am I wrong in saying that?

412
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,300
It's not right for him to stay single.

413
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,220
When we got together,

414
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,660
I wasn't that young either.

415
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,580
So it's a trait of the Tang family.

416
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,540
I'm back.

417
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,740
Dad, Mom.

418
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:49,980
Yu.

419
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,820
You're back.

420
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,030
Where are they?

421
00:19:53,344 --> 00:19:55,440
One is in the study,
and the other is in the bedroom.

422
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,860
They fought again?

423
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,300
Did you cause trouble again?

424
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,900
Why would it be me?

425
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
Every time I cause trouble,

426
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,020
the three of you

427
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,420
will gang up on me together.

428
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,700
Only when you cause trouble

429
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,220
does this kind of standoff happen.

430
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,700
I caused trouble?

431
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,940
What trouble did I cause?

432
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,900
Why are you laughing?

433
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,220
It's just

434
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,180
that Mom said

435
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,860
you're sick.

436
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,980
It's some hereditary disease
in our family's males.

437
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:37,940
So,

438
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,260
Yu, it's fine.

439
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,060
Tell me.

440
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,820
Are you...

441
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,700
Are you...

442
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,940
Yu.

443
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,700
You...

444
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,660
You...

445
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,140
You're really not interested in women?

446
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,660
I really want to cancel your credit card.

447
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,060
Tell me.

448
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,340
What did they say?

449
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,820
Mom said

450
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,140
you're a rotten vegetable.

451
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,820
The company's key project
for the second half of the year

452
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,488
was suspended
due to suspected plagiarism.

453
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,220
Investments were mostly dumped into it.

454
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,460
There's been a lot of gossip.

455
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,100
If I can't find a replacement project

456
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,500
within three months,

457
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,660
Time's stock price
will definitely be affected.

458
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,060
But

459
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,020
three months later,

460
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,540
I'll be almost 30.

461
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,460
If I still haven't found a girlfriend
by then,

462
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,700
I'll become the leftover,
rotten vegetable in the market.

463
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,300
But in the next three months,

464
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,460
I can only do one thing.

465
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,340
You two are my parents

466
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,740
and also shareholders of Time.

467
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:16,580
Choose one.

468
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,020
It's up to you

469
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,632
- Find a girlfriend.
- Find a new project.

470
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,260
(Deal with your mom.)

471
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,460
(Understood.)

472
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,300
Mom.

473
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,780
I remember you have a few girlfriends

474
00:22:54,816 --> 00:22:56,580
who seem to have bought shares
in our stock.

475
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,980
If the stock price falls too hard,

476
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,940
your weekly tea on Monday afternoons

477
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,580
will be awkward.

478
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,300
Awkward.

479
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:15,820
Let's eat.

480
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,660
I'm hungry, Dad.

481
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,300
Why aren't we eating yet?

482
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:21,980
Let's go eat.

483
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,820
Quick, let's go.

484
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,820
- Come.
- Let's eat.

485
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,380
Alright, Dad.

486
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,340
Let's eat.

487
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:25,820
Eat.

488
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,020
- Eat.
- Eat.

489
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,140
Yu.

490
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,700
Nice.

491
00:23:32,896 --> 00:23:33,860
You're really something.

492
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,460
(Each scene is like a living cell.)

493
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,860
(A dramatic action point)

494
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,220
(needs to drive the story forward.)

495
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,100
(I need to pay attention in displaying)

496
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,140
(character information.)

497
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:55,860
(I must note this.)

498
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,940
("A Dream for You")

499
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:21,980
("A Dream for You")
(Sugar Heart.)

500
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,940
(Do you know
that the copyright for your novel)

501
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,860
(will expire in three months at Time?)

502
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,340
(I know.)

503
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,300
(I signed a four-year contract,)

504
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,020
(and it's been three years,
eight months, and 13 days.)

505
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,580
Good that you know.

506
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,580
Time's recent developments

507
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,600
have mainly been
projects targeting male audiences.

508
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,060
Works like your female-oriented
romance novel

509
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,100
are probably of no use to them.

510
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,500
But we don't need to worry.

511
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,460
After all, we're one of the top three IPs
on the website.

512
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,780
Many people are vying for us.

513
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,500
Several leading film companies
have already

514
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,779
inquired about the sequel rights.

515
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,272
The price has increased several times.

516
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,740
(My dear child.)

517
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,740
(You've been locked up for so long,)

518
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,460
(and you haven't seen your father yet.)

519
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,820
(I'm losing the Holy Favor.)

520
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,100
(What should I do?)

521
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,380
(Oh no.)

522
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,340
(Mr. Gao saw my car today.)

523
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,540
(If he exposes
that I lied to hitch a ride,)

524
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,420
(I will not only lose the Holy Favor.)

525
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,700
(I might even be snubbed.)

526
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,420
(No.)

527
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,580
(I have to shut him up.)

528
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,340
Mr. Gao.

529
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,060
Good morning.

530
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:35,780
Morning.

531
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,780
Mr. Tang hasn't arrived yet.

532
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,060
I'm not looking for him.

533
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,904
I'm looking for you.

534
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,940
Me?

535
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,900
I brought you breakfast.

536
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,500
Why did you bring me breakfast?

537
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,740
Mr. Gao.

538
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,380
About what happened yesterday...

539
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,100
You know.

540
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,100
(Is she talking about the car?)

541
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,060
(I made it so obvious.)

542
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,060
(He should understand what I mean.)

543
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,180
(But why did she lie to Mr. Tang?)

544
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,660
(It's unrelated to work.)

545
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,820
(He shouldn't need
to report to Mr. Tang.)

546
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,260
(Does she)

547
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,820
(have feelings for Mr. Tang?)

548
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,100
(I've liked Tang Yu for so long.)

549
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,380
(I can't let him ruin it like this.)

550
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,260
Okay.

551
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,900
I'll reply to you later.

552
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,460
Mr. Tang.

553
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,020
What's up?

554
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:29,980
Nothing.

555
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,140
I just brought Mr. Gao some breakfast.

556
00:26:32,464 --> 00:26:33,376
I go downstairs now.

557
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,340
Mr. Tang.

558
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,180
Mr. Tang.

559
00:26:47,536 --> 00:26:48,420
Want something to eat?

560
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,140
No need.

561
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,660
(Stop looking at me.)

562
00:27:12,816 --> 00:27:13,840
(If you look at me again,)

563
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,220
(I'll risk bankruptcy)

564
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,540
(to buy dried fish for you again.)

565
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,100
(Bankrupt for dried fish?)

566
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,820
(I really don't understand)

567
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,060
(what she's thinking every day.)

568
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,700
(She helps me pursue Ming Zhu.)

569
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,740
(Is she trying to use this opportunity
to get close to...?)

570
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,740
Mr. Tang.

571
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:46,180
Sit.

572
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:46,940
Okay.

573
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,340
Why haven't you eaten yet?

574
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,660
I'm planning to finish this...

575
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,060
I'll eat now.

576
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,740
Gao.

577
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,580
Do you have a girlfriend?

578
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,780
Should I have one?

579
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,100
Stand up.

580
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,380
If I remember correctly,

581
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,320
you're three years younger than me.

582
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,860
You're well-behaved

583
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,300
and very diligent at work.

584
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,700
Also, quite handsome.

585
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,100
You don't smoke or drink.

586
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,340
That's right.

587
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,700
I have no bad habits.

588
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,260
Not bad.

589
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,700
Pretty good.

590
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,540
It makes a lot of sense now.

591
00:29:13,792 --> 00:29:14,900
Hurry up and have breakfast.

592
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,380
Mr. Tang.

593
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,180
Actually, I've already had breakfast.

594
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,420
Since Tang Xin bought it for you,

595
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,540
finish it.

596
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:32,860
Mr...

597
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,460
(Qiong Kun Liao Dao)
[*Impoverished]

598
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,020
(Recently, I bought a dao.)
[*Island]

599
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,260
(Feel free
to visit my impoverished island.)

600
00:30:03,104 --> 00:30:04,340
(She's so poor but still bought)

601
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,780
(such a sumptuous breakfast
for Mr. Gao.)

602
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,420
(It seems I was right.)

603
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,980
(I've expressed it so clearly,)

604
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:19,940
(Mr. Gao shouldn't expose me, right?)

605
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,500
(Miss Sugar Heart, I'm your fan.)

606
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,700
(I'd like to ask for an autograph.)

607
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,660
(Are you still here?)

608
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,350
(Why haven't you updated your Weibo?)

609
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,660
(Hello, Miss Sugar Heart.)

610
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,620
(I'm Zhou Dan,
a screenwriter at Time Pictures.)

611
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,940
(I really like your novel
"A Dream for You".)

612
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,580
(May I have your contact information?)

613
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,860
(Hello, Miss Zhou.)

614
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,060
(I've heard
about your screenwriting works.)

615
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:39,180
(Thank you for your liking.)

616
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,240
(But I have a contract
with the publishing house,)

617
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,810
(so I can't add you on WeChat for now.)

618
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:43,540
(I'm sorry.)

619
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,940
(You don't look poor)

620
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,420
(with the breakfast you bought.)

621
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,540
Look at this. What's going on?

622
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,540
Quick, look.

623
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,340
Really?

624
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,660
Hurry, take a look.

625
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,140
Check your Moments.

626
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,860
(What's going on?)

627
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:06,300
(Mr. Tang never interacted
with employees on Moments before.)

628
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,300
(Mr. Tang,
who puts only cacti in the office,)

629
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,460
(has a bad personality
and speaks harshly.)

630
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,032
(How did she manage
to get along with him?)

631
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,020
(Juicy gossip!)

632
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,740
Get back to work.

633
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,380
You're friends with Tang Xin.

634
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,620
Go ask her.

635
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,980
How can I ask her about this?

636
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,820
It's nothing.

637
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,820
Although I have a good relationship
with her...

638
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,540
(Zhou Dan)
It's just a comment on a Moments post.

639
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,100
(Senior Screenwriter at Time Pictures)
It's nothing.

640
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,260
Gossip is not important.

641
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,340
Work makes you happy.

642
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,620
Get to work quickly.

643
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,180
(Screenwriting Department)

644
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,940
You're not working.

645
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,740
What are you all talking about together?

646
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:53,780
Get ready for a meeting.

647
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,540
What's going on?

648
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:58,660
(Moments.)

649
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,420
(Meeting Room)
Lately,

650
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,580
(Meeting Room)
the company has a batch of IP rights

651
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,220
that will expire in just three months

652
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,220
Whether to renew or not,

653
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,620
the Copyright Department
wants our Screenwriting Department

654
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,740
to provide some opinions.

655
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,100
I think,

656
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,060
as you all know,

657
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,460
half of the company's filming projects
were halted.

658
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:18,380
We urgently need a new project
to take over.

659
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,940
If there are some good IPs
among these about to expire,

660
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,540
it could also help the company
solve some urgent issues.

661
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,060
The ones I sent you just now

662
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:29,340
are some IPs that Mr. Tang Sr. purchased

663
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,640
when he was here four years ago.

664
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,300
Take a look first.

665
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,700
They've been here for four years,

666
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,300
and Mr. Tang hasn't even looked at them.

667
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,380
I guess it'll be difficult

668
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,260
to renew them.

669
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:40,900
Ms. Chen.

670
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,340
Actually, "A Dream for You"

671
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,260
is quite good.

672
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,900
I used to follow its updates every day.

673
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,500
The novel is indeed good,

674
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,740
but the fantasy romance genre

675
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,900
has not been the development direction
of Time.

676
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,340
The company probably won't
spend money to renew it.

677
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,180
Come in.

678
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,100
Ms. Chen.

679
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:14,780
Tang Xin?

680
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:18,180
Do you need me for something?

681
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,100
Ms. Chen.

682
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,340
Regarding "A Dream for You",

683
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,740
I still want to try to fight for it.

684
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,620
Come. Have a seat and talk.

685
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,900
Ms. Chen.

686
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,980
"A Dream for You" is my novel.

687
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,180
I've been trying

688
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,140
to work on an adaptation plan
and script.

689
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,540
I know.

690
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,260
I still have a lot to improve on,

691
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,380
but

692
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:44,580
I really have strong feelings
for this novel.

693
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:46,740
I also have many ideas of my own.

694
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,540
Tang Xin.

695
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,620
Your novel,

696
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,620
when Mr. Tang Sr. was here,

697
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,780
was acquired by Time through my efforts.

698
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,380
You have feelings for it.

699
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,740
I do too.

700
00:33:59,888 --> 00:34:00,900
It's precisely because we

701
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,660
know that it's a good story

702
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,540
that I don't want it

703
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,500
to continue being neglected by Time.

704
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,580
You also know

705
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,940
that since Mr. Tang took over Time,

706
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,220
there have been few projects
in the romance genre.

707
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,820
Even if I agree,

708
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:19,060
you won't be able to get past Mr. Tang.

709
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:24,980
Alright.

710
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,420
Thank you, Ms. Chen.

711
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,260
I understand.

712
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,260
The characters are weak.

713
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,380
The plot is routine.

714
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:33,740
The settings are cliché.

715
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:37,740
The significance
of developing these stories further...

716
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,820
is small.

717
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,940
Tell the Copyright Department

718
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,620
not to take the audience

719
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,940
for fools.

720
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,220
Mr. Tang.

721
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,660
Calm down.

722
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,260
Actually, there's good news today.

723
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,900
Your decision earlier was correct.

724
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,700
We sent out an apology letter

725
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,380
regarding the plagiarism incident.

726
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,140
Our company
supporting the author's rights

727
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,340
despite losing the funds

728
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,340
has won us fans.

729
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,380
Can this be considered good news?

730
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,940
Reputation matters.

731
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,740
Projects matter just as much.

732
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,780
If we can't find a replacement project

733
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,860
within three months,

734
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,460
the company's stock price...

735
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,180
Will plummet.

736
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,220
Rest assured, Mr. Tang.

737
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,220
Currently, all departments

738
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,780
are hunting for great material.

739
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,100
Tang Xin.

740
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,060
Your proposal

741
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:30,620
was rejected by Ms. Chen, right?

742
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,740
You might as well

743
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:34,540
speak directly to Mr. Tang.

744
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,020
Aren't you two close?

745
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:37,620
You don't believe

746
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,180
he would be interested in you, do you?

747
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,900
Even the celebrity Zhou Jialu
can't catch his attention.

748
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,260
Be realistic.

749
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,340
Stop daydreaming.

750
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,260
Is that so?

751
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,500
I'll ask Mr. Tang right now

752
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,900
to see if he shares your thoughts.

753
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,460
What do you mean?

754
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,780
I'll simply relay every single word

755
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,860
you just said to Mr. Tang.

756
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,060
Let's see how he responds.

757
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,780
Sent.

758
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,500
It's just a private chat.

759
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,380
Do you really have to?

760
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,580
You just said it in front of me.

761
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,020
Do you think I don't know

762
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,180
what you said in private?

763
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:13,460
Well played.

764
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,700
You actually sent it.

765
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,460
Did you hear it all?

766
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,180
I was just outside.

767
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,220
Did you send it or not?

768
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,060
I won't tell you.

769
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:30,940
Notify all departments.

770
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,060
If anyone has a good project or topic,

771
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,180
come to me directly.

772
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,840
(Tang Xin: shjd#8irunbjdjd&hdj......)

773
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:43,740
(Speak plainly.)

774
00:36:47,472 --> 00:36:48,700
(Sent it to the wrong person.)

775
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,240
(Didn't retract it in time.)

776
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,340
(What's this?)

777
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,860
(How did you type it?)

778
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,300
(Typed out with my face.)

779
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,700
Where was I?

780
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,060
Good projects.

781
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,860
Good material.

782
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,940
Come to you anytime.

783
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,580
Hurry and go, then.

784
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:16,140
Sure.

785
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,340
I'll inform them now.

786
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,420
I have something to share.

787
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,780
Be quiet for a moment.

788
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,820
I just received notice from Mr. Gao.

789
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,260
Mr. Tang highly values the selection

790
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,420
of the new project.

791
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,820
He specifically instructed

792
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,140
that anyone with good project proposals

793
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,900
could visit his office.

794
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,660
He's ready at any time.

795
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,700
Let's all start preparing.

796
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,500

Tang Xin.

813
00:38:34,032 --> 00:38:34,860
I'm looking for...

814
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,580
Mr. Tang is in the meeting room
for an interview.

815
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:38,260
It might not end until after work.

816
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:39,940
(An interview?)

817
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,100
(I've never seen Tang Yu)

818
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,100
(being interviewed on-site.)

819
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,220
In that case,

820
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,420
I won't see Mr. Tang.

821
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,540
I'll see Mr. Gao.

822
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,740
He's also in there, right?

823
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:50,660
Yes.

824
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,180
Great.

825
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,048
Thank you, Miss Chen.

826
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,820
Looks like Tang Xin is pursuing Mr. Gao.

827
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,140
Hard to say.

828
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,420
She seems to like Mr. Gao

829
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,900
compared to Mr. Tang.

830
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,540
Her taste is quite unique.

831
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,140
Mr. Tang always seems aloof.

832
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,140
What's good about him?

833
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,140
I think

834
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,660
Mr. Gao is pretty good.

835
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,260
"White Dew to Frost" has always

836
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,100
been a theme that Time is adept at.

837
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,420
Plus,

838
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,180
the cast is incredibly strong.

839
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:19,860
I believe

840
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:22,020
it'll receive support from fans.

841
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,540
Thank you.

842
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,900
Okay, let's pause for a moment.

843
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,260
Sure.

844
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,660
Mr. Tang, we'll

845
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,100
be asking some personal questions.

846
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,020
Here's

847
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:28,780
the rough outline.

848
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,020
Please take a look first.

849
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,300
Sure.

850
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:32,340
Find your angle beforehand.

851
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,740
If there are any issues,

852
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,940
I can stop promptly.

853
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,220
Understood.

854
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,420
Why are you here?

855
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,980
Mr. Tang might not permit photos.

856
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,580
I'm just

857
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,300
admiring his glasses,

858
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:50,780
thinking of buying the same.

859
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,860
Focus properly.

860
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,220
It's clear.

861
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:02,700
Okay.

862
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,580
No questions from me.

863
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,060
Get ready.

864
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,740
Mr. Tang.

865
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,620
We're starting now.

866
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:11,540
Okay.

867
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,700
Okay, I want to ask

868
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,820
on behalf of netizens.

869
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,460
Are you still single, Mr. Tang?

870
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,220
Because you mentioned
liking gentle and intelligent girls

871
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,300
in a previous interview.

872
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,740
As a token of gratitude,

873
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:27,820
have a candy.

874
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,420
No thanks.

875
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,540
It's just a small favor.

876
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,660
Get back to work.

877
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,020
It's okay. Keep it.

878
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,580
- Moreover, most female leads
- No thanks, really.

879
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:35,540
are of that type

880
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,940
in your movies.

881
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,100
I wonder if you've found someone

882
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,460
who fits this criterion.

883
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,540
This is hard to answer.

884
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,940
It depends on feelings.

885
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,540
It's almost noon now.

886
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,768
You guys haven't eaten yet, right?

887
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,420
You go grab a meal first.

888
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,552
We'll resume this afternoon.

889
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,060
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Tang.

890
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,140
Mr. Gao.

891
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:58,820
Mr. Tang.

892
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,300
Take them to the cafeteria.

893
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:00,820
Sure.

894
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,820
This way, please.

895
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,820
Why so happy?

896
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,180
Mr. Tang.

897
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,580
Do you have time to have lunch together?

898
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,460
I have work at noon.

899
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,780
How about tonight?

900
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,940
No time either.

901
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:28,260
(If I hadn't known that Tang Yu
is a VIP here,)

902
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,700
(I wouldn't have come to the gym.)

903
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,540
(With an annual membership,)

904
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,300
(I could at least run into him once.)

905
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,980
(Checked in at the gym.)

906
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,940
(Not exercising for three months
will make you a pauper.)

907
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,220
What's the connection?

908
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,780
(Why would not exercising
turn you into a pauper?)

909
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,300
(Because good health is a huge wealth.)

910
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,100
That's absurd.

911
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,860
(Wait for another two minutes.)

912
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,140
(Just two minutes.)

913
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,540
(If he doesn't show up, I'll leave.)

914
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:49,820
Not bad.

915
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,780
You ran for an hour.

916
00:42:56,464 --> 00:42:58,010
Aren't you afraid of hurting yourself?

917
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,140
Mr. Tang.

918
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,780
You scared me.

919
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:02,820
Did I scare you that much?

920
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,740
I thought you were bold.

921
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,620
That's because you suddenly appeared.

922
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,060
Blaming me now, huh?

923
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,820
You ran four kilometers in an hour.

924
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:14,500
The first fifty minutes
were just walking, right?

925
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:15,740
No.

926
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,500
I was doing Pilates just now.
Didn't you see?

927
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,140
Also,

928
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:19,740
take a look.

929
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,420
I just finished this program.

930
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,500
Where are you going?

931
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,300
Mr. Tang.

932
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,420
Why are you still here?

933
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,420
I can chat with you.

934
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,580
I don't

935
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:48,580
have much else to do.

936
00:43:52,752 --> 00:43:54,020
Have you decided on the topic?

937
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,620
I...

938
00:43:56,064 --> 00:43:57,180
What topic do want to do?

939
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:01,300
Tang Yu.

940
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,580
If I can write a satisfactory script,

941
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,980
would you be my producer?

942
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:09,860
Sure.

943
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,260
That is if your script gets approved.

944
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:13,980
I'm not asking you
to be the executive producer

945
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,260
but the executive producer.

946
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,300
(If you become the producer,)

947
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:21,820
(we'll)

948
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,220
(have more time together.)

949
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:27,700
Okay.

950
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,700
You wouldn't be this accommodating,
Mr. Tang.

951
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,660
You had me help you before,

952
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:37,420
yet you failed to pursue her
despite all my efforts.

953
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:38,980
I know

954
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,220
it's my fault.

955
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,940
So, you don't want to help me now.

956
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:43,980
I get it.

957
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:49,660
It's okay.

958
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:50,700
Don't worry.

959
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:55,940
Did you agree?

960
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,460
For real?

961
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,220
As long as your script is good,

962
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,780
I'll follow the company's process

963
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,820
and assign you a suitable producer.

964
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:06,820
No.

965
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,820
I don't want anyone else.

966
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,780
I want you.

967
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:35,740
("852 days of Secret Crush.")

968
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:53,820
Yu.

969
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,780
His signature is better.

970
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,060
Tang Yu.

971
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:36,100
(I hope that one day,)

972
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:39,020
(I can also stand beside you)

973
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,220
(as a screenwriter.)

974
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,140
(We'd look cute)

975
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,380
(in matching outfits.)

976
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:26,260
