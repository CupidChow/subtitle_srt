Are you looking for Mr. Tang?

He went out but will be back later.

Okay.

33
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,100
I'll wait for him here.

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,420
Why don't I

35
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,740
call him for you?

36
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,660
It's fine.

37
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,980
I'll wait for him here.

38
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,580
Alright.

39
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,420
Mr. Gao.

40
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,020
Remember to bring the documents
that need signing to me.

41
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,660
Alright.

42
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,740
Waiting for me?

43
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,780
Come in then.

44
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:53,460
Miss Chen.

45
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,300
You may go home now.

46
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:54,900
Okay.

47
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,220
Mr. Gao.

48
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,260
Why are you wearing glasses today?

49
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,300
I've been wearing contacts too much,

50
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,500
and my eyes are a bit inflamed.

51
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:11,980
Mr. Tang.

52
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,620
I've not eaten. Have you?

53
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,820
I'll order food for you both.

54
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,060
And add a cup of juice.

55
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,660
Thank you.

56
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,260
Why are you looking for me?

57
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,060
Mr. Tang.

58
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,300
Why did you suddenly

59
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,460
want to renew the contract for
"A Dream for You"?

60
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,020
Weren't you not planning on filming it?

61
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,940
The development schedule
hasn't been confirmed yet.

62
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,500
You can choose not to sign.

63
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,420
Did you renew it

64
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,460
because of the novel,

65
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,700
or was it because of me?

66
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,140
It's the same to me.

67
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,540
Tang Yu.

68
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,380
Do you know

69
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,220
that Ming Zhu and Captain Lu
got married?

70
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,820
You have no chance anymore.

71
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,180
Tang Xin, are you just
looking for something to say,

72
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,500
or trying to provoke me?

73
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:21,940
You don't understand.

74
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,460
This is called

75
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,900
desensitization therapy.

76
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,100
I just need to say it multiple times,

77
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,180
and you might get over it.

78
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,540
Am I right?

79
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:33,820
Tang Yu.

80
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,260
Do you like me?

81
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,180
Take a guess.

82
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,180
Since you already know,

83
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,500
why did you still ask me?

84
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,540
When?

85
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,380
Are you asking when
I started liking you?

86
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,540
It hasn't been that long.

87
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,740
Probably the past few months.

88
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,460
Don't ask me why I like you.

89
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,940
You're handsome,

90
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,180
rich,

91
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,020
and not fickle.

92
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,180
So it's normal for me to like you.

93
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,540
Just because of this?

94
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:54,940
Tang Yu.

95
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,540
Do you think I'm pretty?

96
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,300
Can I be your girlfriend then,

97
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,300
since you think I'm pretty,

98
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,100
and I think you're handsome?

99
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,860
Who told you

100
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,420
I only want a pretty girlfriend?

101
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,140
Isn't that it?

102
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,660
Men all like pretty girls.

103
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,100
If I only wanted pretty girls,

104
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,580
I would have
a whole truck of girlfriends.

105
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,260
Then answer me.

106
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,580
I want to be your girlfriend.

107
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,460
Do you want me or not?

108
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,140
We

109
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,340
aren't suitable.

110
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,620
Tang Yu.

111
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,620
You should've just said
that you don't like me.

112
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,780
Why did you say "not suitable"?

113
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,540
That's so formal.

114
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,020
Tang Xin.

115
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,100
I understand.

116
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,220
I won't disturb you anymore.

117
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,100
(Tang Yu.)

118
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,460
(I've liked you for nearly 1400 days.)

119
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,820
(The one glance that felt like eternity
four years ago,)

120
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,620
(I thought it was destiny.)

121
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,740
(Since then,)

122
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:47,380
(you've been)

123
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,220
(the person I want to stand beside by.)

124
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,780
(I like that you always)

125
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,940
(keep to your principles.)

126
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,460
(I like your confidence)

127
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,100
(that can turn any dangerous situation
around.)

128
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,900
(I like that you seemed disgusted)

129
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,500
(but would still
carefully feed the kitten.)

130
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,540
(I also like the gentle heart)

131
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,940
(hidden under that cold face.)

132
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,900
(But all these)

133
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,100
(have nothing to do with me anymore.)

134
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,340
I can't stand it

135
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,340
if I don't say this.

136
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,900
A man asking a woman
to help him pursue someone,

137
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,020
and that person being her best friend,

138
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,500
haven't you ever thought

139
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,020
how foolish this behavior is?

140
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,260
Since you don't like me,

141
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,020
why give me hope?

142
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,300
Why renew the contract

143
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,940
for a novel you clearly don't like?

144
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,740
Also,

145
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,460
if you get bitten by a cat, dog,
or person in the future,

146
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,940
don't come looking for me.

147
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:23,020
Why me out of so many staff
in the company?

148
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,980
I must have been out of my mind

149
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,500
to play along with you for so long.

150
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,860
You led me to misunderstand this.

151
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
You also made me hopeful.

152
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,300
And now you're saying
that we're not suitable.

153
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:46,940
Tang Yu.

154
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,620
You're really quite awful.

155
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,340
What are you looking at?

156
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,580
You haven't seen your boss
being scolded before,

157
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,060

00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,260
who made you depressed?

375
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,140
I was writing a sad story
about the character.

376
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,060
Don't over think it, Dad.

377
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,180
Are you sure it's your script

378
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,940
and not someone mistreating you?

379
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,460
Tell me the truth.

380
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,100
Nothing of that sort.

381
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,220
That's not right.

382
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,980
Look at her.

383
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,660
She's clearly in a bad mood.

384
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:16,540
Right? Isn't she?

385
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,940
You're just like your mom.

386
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,780
Your emotions are
written all over your face.

387
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,540
Xin, why don't you

388
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,820
come home for a few days?

389
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:23,620
Forget it.

390
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,460
Your mom and I

391
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,220
will visit you.

392
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,460
No.

393
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,740
I confess, okay?

394
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,340
I just had a heartbreak.

395
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,620
A heartbreak?

396
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:41,060
So. Dad,

397
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,420
please stop my mom
from finding me blind dates.

398
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,380
Xin.

399
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,260
Which jerk rejected my daughter?

400
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,340
Is he blind?

401
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,420
My daughter is so beautiful.

402
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,700
How could he not like you?

403
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,260
That's right.

404
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,460
Please stop nagging.

405
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,220
I just had a heartbreak,

406
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,340
and you guys
are rubbing salt in my wounds.

407
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,740
Also,

408
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,380
stop finding me blind dates.

409
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,380
I'm so good-looking,

410
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,660
but you make it
as though no one wants me.

411
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,140
It's precisely
because you're heartbroken

412
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,980
that you should go on a blind date.

413
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,820
Hear me out.

414
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,700
The guy in the second photo

415
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,940
looks good, too.

416
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,940
He's Ms. Lin's son,
self-employed, and runs his own company.

417
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:22,700
He's quite good.

418
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,340
Look. See?

419
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,540
Come on.

420
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,460
Just one glance.

421
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,180
I can't hear you. I can't hear you.

422
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:29,300
Hey.

423
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,580
Forget it.

424
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,380
She refuses to listen,

425
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,660
so let's end this topic.

426
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,540
Dad, Mom.

427
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,980
I still have work to do,

428
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,300
I'll talk to you guys next time.

429
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,180
Rest early.

430
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,180
Bye.

431
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,220
(Mr. Tang.)

432
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,540
(The agenda)

433
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,460
(for the next half a month)

434
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,180
(in Malaysia has been sent to your email.)

435
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,100
(Please take a look.)

436
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,100
(Your flight is 9.00 a.m. tomorrow.)

437
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,780
(I'll be downstairs at 6.30 a.m.)

438
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:05,900
(Got it.)

439
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,500
Now let's invite Mr. Tang

440
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,380
to cut the ribbon
for the grand opening

441
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,660
of Time Cinema.

442
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,420
Mr. Tang, please

443
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:36,020
cut the ribbon
for Time Cinema's grand opening.

444
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,620
(This must be the handsomest
president there is.)

445
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,340
(How I wish I were Mrs. Tang.)

446
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,580
(I wonder what kind of a woman)

447
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,020
(could tame such a guy.)

448
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:43,820
(I'm drooling.)

449
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,060
(If he plays a role in a movie)

450
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,180
(It will certainly be a hit.)

451
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,140
I've kissed him before.

452
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,540
He's just an ordinary person.

453
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,300
Smile.

454
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,700
Why are you smiling?

455
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,740
Are you that happy?

456
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,620
Hello, Mr. Lu.

457
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,580
Tang Xin.

458
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,500
Have you made a decision
about your copyright?

459
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,660
I'm still thinking.

460
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,620
No worries.

461
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,220
I'll be in Shanghai for a few days.

462
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,700
Let's meet up

463
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,100
and talk about this after I return.

464
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,220
Sure. Bye.

465
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,380
Mr. Tang, are you alright?

466
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,660
We have hangover medicine at the hotel.

467
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,660
I'm fine. See?

468
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,700
I've arrived at the hotel.

469
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,140
The higher...

470
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,380
It's getting late,

471
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,320
so you should head home, too.

472
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,420
No need to escort me.

473
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,180
Thank you.

474
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,500
Goodbye.

475
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,020
Mr. Tang, do you need some warm water?

476
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,100
It's fine.

477
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,540
I'm alright.

478
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,940
A pig. A fist.

479
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,340
A smile. A goodbye.

480
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,700
What does Sugar Heart mean by that?

481
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,100
Let me ask you.

482
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,260
I heard

483
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,900
that she went
to your office again the other day.

484
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,100
What did you talk about?

485
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,780
I didn't say anything.

486
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,060
So, something did happen.

487
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,380
Why didn't you tell me? You...

488
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,860
You're so inconsiderate.

489
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,540
There's nothing to say.

490
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,580
Since you won't say

491
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,900
I'll make a guess myself.

492
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,740
Tang Xin

493
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,380
confessed to you.

494
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,420
I noticed it a long time ago.

495
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,300
Tang Xin is interested in you.

496
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,100
I'd say,

497
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,980
isn't it good that Sugar Heart

498
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,740
can express her feelings so directly?

499
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,300
How interested could she be?

500
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,940
It's probably just a momentary impulse.

501
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,980
If you say it that way,
it means you rejected her.

502
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,140
How did you know?

503
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,660
It's obvious.
Why else would you look so dejected

504
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,300
if you didn't reject her?

505
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,660
We're fundamentally different

506
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,100
and not suitable for each other.

507
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,340
That couldn't be right.

508
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:35,740
Two days ago, he said it himself

509
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,660
that Tang Xin

510
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,420
is proactive, hardworking,

511
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,260
thoughtful, and enlightened.

512
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,420
So your impression of her

513
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,700
made a three sixty turn
after she confessed to you.

514
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:46,820
Take it easy.

515
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,620
Mr. Huo.

516
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,740
Actually, Miss Tang...

517
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,380
She...

518
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:54,860
She...

519
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:56,860
She...

520
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,700
She said she only liked me
for my wealth and looks.

521
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,460
Did you believe her

522
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,500
because she said that?

523
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,020
You're kidding, right?

524
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,460
You've known Tang Xin
for quite some time.

525
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,140
That young lady is stubborn
with a soft heart and sharp mouth,

526
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,740
Right?

527
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,100
It's brave enough of her

528
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,260
that she told you

529
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,460
she liked you.
she liked you.

530
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,780
What more do you want?

531
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,780
Do you want her
to express her feelings with tears

532
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,700
and say a hundred reasons
why she likes you?

533
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,580
You're so...

534
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,900
You clearly like her

535
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,000
but are too stubborn to admit it.

536
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,540
You'll regret it sooner or later.

Mr. Tang.

594
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,180
The various data of Time Cinema
for this month

595
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:18,940
are steadily increasing.

596
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,660
The film occupancy rate
and average attendance per screening

597
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,260
have both exceeded market expectations.

598
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,380
Revenue has increased

599
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,420
by 21 percent compared to last quarter.

600
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,220
Mr. Tang.

601
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:28,620
Mr. Tang.

602
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:31,940
Go on.

603
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,420
The internal original film projects
of the company

604
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,340
are in progress as well.

605
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,940
The Screenwriting Department has already
submitted proposals for topics.

606
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,820
They're waiting for your review.

607
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,980
Several initial projects already have

608
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,140
intentional screenwriting teams.

609
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,180
The adaptation proposals
have been submitted.

610
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,740
There will be a "Light of Tomorrow"
promotional meeting this week,

611
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,700
and we look forward to your attendance.

612
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:54,020
How is the progress
of "White Dew to Frost"?

613
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,980
The filming is going very smoothly.

614
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,100
That's it?

615
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,500
Miss Tang Xin.

616
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,860
Make an arrangement.

617
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,940
Visit the set of "White Dew" tomorrow.

618
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:05,780
Understood.

619
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,980
After Tong Xin encounters danger,

620
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,740
her reaction seems a bit off-character.

621
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,340
It's mainly in the emotional scenes.

622
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,900
The pacing feels a bit dragging as well.

623
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,540
Please make adjustments
as soon as possible.

624
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,220
Okay.

625
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,460
Director.

626
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,140
Mr. Tang has arrived.

627
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,700
Mr. Tang, welcome to inspect the work.

628
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:34,820
Mr. Jiang, you've worked hard.

629
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,420
Please have a seat.

630
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,020
How's everything going?

631
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,020
How's the progress of the shoot?

632
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,220
The coordination is getting better,

633
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:43,620
and we've caught up with the schedule.

634
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,740
We were discussing the upcoming scenes.

635
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,100
Is that so?

636
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:50,900
(Don't be afraid.)

637
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,340
(You're holding nothing.)

638
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,140
(What's there to be afraid of him?)

639
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,340
Mr. Tang.

640
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,700
I've felt a sudden surge of inspiration

641
00:33:58,700 --> 00:33:59,860
since your arrival.

642
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:01,660
Director.

643
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,660
Why don't I share it with you?

644
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:06,140
You two go ahead.

645
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:06,940
I'll just listen casually.

646
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,380
Sure.

647
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,140
Go ahead.

648
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,220
This scene depicts Tong Xin's
emotional scene

649
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,180
after being hurt by Mu Zisheng.

650
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,820
I took a look just now.

651
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,220
I think the female lead
seems too vulnerable.

652
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,900
How about we make Tong Xin
more unrestrained?

653
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,900
Let her focus on the case

654
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,500
after her heartbreak.

655
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,780
And then,

656
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,820
we'll make Mu Zisheng's encounter

657
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,740
more miserable.

658
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,940
For example,

659
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,300
getting hit by a car
when leaving the house,

660
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,300
or being injured by falling objects
from a height,

661
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,620
or getting bitten by a dog.

662
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,620
Director.

663
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,140
These plot points

664
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,700
might be a bit cliché.

665
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,140
But look at here,

666
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,820
the danger in ancient mansion later,

667
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,060
with the lungs being pierced.

668
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,860
I think it's very reasonable.

669
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,580
After all, Mu Zisheng
is a supporting male character.

670
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:52,220
Even if Tong Xin used to like him,

671
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,300
but now,

672
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,220
he's no longer an important person

673
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,540
in Tong Xin's life.

674
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,740
For the upcoming emotional scenes,

675
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,260
I think we can delete them

676
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,340
and have Mu Zisheng exit directly.

677
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,340
Director.

678
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,660
In my opinion,

679
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:10,340
for the mid-part, we can intersperse

680
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,980
some events of Tong Xin returning
to the crime scene.

681
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,700
In this way, we can better

682
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,140
reflect the character's personality.

683
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,700
Just a little interruption.

684
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,460
Sorry about that.

685
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:20,980
In my impression,

686
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,940
Mu Zisheng shouldn't be a bad person.

687
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:23,820
Yes.

688
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,340
I didn't say he's a bad person.

689
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,060
But

690
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,660
good people can also make mistakes.

691
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:29,740
Hurting someone as good as Tong Xin

692
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,460
is the biggest mistake he has made.

693
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,460
Tang Xin, you...

694
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,300
Yeah.

695
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,100
This is actually quite interesting.

696
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,260
About the actor playing Mu Zisheng,

697
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,580
his handling of emotional scenes

698
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,820
always lacks something.

699
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,260
If we follow your idea,

700
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:44,780
we can

701
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,340
highlight the character's
shining moments

702
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,700
when he faces danger and gets injured.

703
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,980
That way, we can avoid dragging
and meaningless emotional scenes.

704
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,540
I actually think this change

705
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,300
would make it more intriguing.

706
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,060
Mr. Tang, what do you think?

707
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,020
In my opinion...

708
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:03,700
Mr. Tang.

709
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,140
Aren't you just listening casually?

710
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:10,700
I don't have any objections.

711
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,300
You're in charge
of the creative process.

712
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,300
You make the decisions.

713
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,220
Okay.

714
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,300
So, Director,

715
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,060
I'll work on the changes,

716
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:19,100
and then show them to you.

717
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,020
Alright.

718
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,020
You go ahead and make the changes
according to your idea.

719
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,540
What's happening there on the scene?

720
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,100
I'll go take a look.

721
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,340
Tang Xin.

722
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:32,980
Mr. Tang.

723
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,100
Do you have anything else?

724
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,620
If not, I'll go and get busy.

725
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,180
You can just wander around casually.

726
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,300
You have no idea how terrible

727
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,500
Tang Yu's face looked.

728
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,220
Aren't you being too harsh?

729
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,940
He just rejected you,

730
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,700
and now he doesn't even have the right

731
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,100
to have intact lungs.

732
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,340
I was just venting my frustration.

733
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:05,700
Can I really hire someone
to assassinate him?

734
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,100
Your behavior

735
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:09,660
of seeking pleasure
through verbal revenge

736
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,820
could only mean

737
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,460
you can't let go of him yet.

738
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:14,820
Exactly.

739
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,740
If I could move on so easily,

740
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,820
I would become the female lead
in an idol drama.

741
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,820
But honestly,

742
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,140
your post-breakup state

743
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,740
is much better than I imagined.

744
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,180
You look like there's nothing wrong
at all.

745
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,620
After all, we're adults.

746
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,820
It's just a breakup.

747
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,420
I don't want to cry and look ugly.

748
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,380
I still need to maintain some dignity.

749
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,460
Hanging out at your place.

750
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,340
Life goes on, day by day.

751
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,620
Ming Zhu is the happiest.

752
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,700
Traveling around the world
for honeymoon.

753
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,740
Right now,

754
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,340
she must be sunbathing on some island.

755
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,340
Oh, you.

756
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,020
We've got customers.

757
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,540
These are the two girls

758
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:16,220
I told you about last time.

759
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:18,820
How are you?

760
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,980
How's your combat power today?

761
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:24,020
Don't underestimate a woman
who just went through a breakup.

762
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,820
I'll leave it to you, bestie.

763
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,020
I'm out.

764
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,820
Welcome!

765
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,660
Hello, miss.

766
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,580
It's been a while.

767
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,540
Do you remember me?

768
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,180
Of course I remember.

769
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:41,180
We got a lot of new arrivals this week.

770
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,500
How about I show you around?

771
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:43,140
Sure!

772
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,460
Do you remember the camisole
you bought last time?

773
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,540
This is a scarf woven
with special-grade silk from Jiangnan.

774
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,460
It matches well with the camisole
you got last time.

775
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,340
It feels pretty good.

776
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:55,980
I'll take this one.

777
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,580
Alright.

778
00:38:58,700 --> 00:38:59,820
Let's look at this piece of clothing.

779
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,020
This is a handcrafted limited edition

780
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,700
from our designer.

781
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,700
Only one piece available.

782
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,540
How about giving it a try?

783
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,580
No need.

784
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,500
I'll just take it.

785
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:10,820
Okay.

786
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,660
Let's look at this dress.

787
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,980
It is a knitted dress.

788
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,620
Isn't it nice?

789
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,700
It's really nice.

790
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:20,140
Although this is not a limited edition,

791
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,220
several D-list celebrities have already
taken a liking to it,

792
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,460
saying they'll come to try it
in a couple of days.

793
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,740
Then sell it to me.

794
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,100
I think it suits me better.

795
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:27,220
Sure.

796
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,660
I think the same as well.

797
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:29,500
I'll reserve it for you then.

798
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,020
This knitted sweater.

799
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,460
Don't be fooled by its plain appearance,

800
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,820
it looks fantastic when worn.

801
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,820
Sure, I'll take it.

802
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:37,820
Great.

803
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,340
Now, let's look at the clothes here.

804
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,340
These colors really complement you.

805
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,020
They're perfect.

806
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:44,940
Miss.

807
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,740
I think this is enough for today.

808
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,060
Let's just get these for today.

809
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:51,620
Sure.

810
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,660
Please have a seat first.

811
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,780
I'll prepare your bill.

812
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,620
Sure.

813
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,180
Would you like some drinks?

814
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,140
Anything is fine.

815
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,340
Great. Please have a seat.

816
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,020
You're so efficient.

817
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,340
Of course.

818
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:05,820
Hurry up.

819
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,540
Prepare the bill.

820
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,820
Sorry for the wait.

821
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,580
Please have some water.

822
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,340
Thank you.

823
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,100
This is the bill.

824
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,580
Why is it more expensive than last time?

825
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,060
Really?

826
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,620
It's okay.

827
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,100
Here, buying and selling are free.

828
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,700
If you don't like it,
you don't have to buy it.

829
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:28,820
It's not that.

830
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,300
I just feel like,

831
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,460
are you doing this on purpose?

832
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,340
Why would I do that?

833
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:34,220
I mentioned last time.

834
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,220
Our store

835
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,660
sells handmade high-end designs,

836
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:37,780
and the pricing is very reasonable.

837
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,580
(It's just that I recommended
the most expensive ones to you.)

838
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,100
Wait a moment.

839
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:44,940
I'll make a call.

840
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,620
Please have a seat for a moment.

841
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,180
- Sure.
- Enjoy some juice.

842
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,340
I'm begging you, take it easy.

843
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,020
Don't ruin my brand reputation, okay?

844
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,180
Didn't you ask me
to improve my combat power?

845
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,020
I asked you to...

846
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,540
You should keep your combat power

847
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,500
to explode Tang Yu's lungs.

848
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,820
Hello, Dingding.

849
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:16,540
What's wrong?

850
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,460
Hello, Yu.

851
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,300
Let me tell you.

852
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,820
You definitely mistook the person.

853
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,060
Ming Zhu

854
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,180
is not as good as you imagine.

855
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:23,820
Just now, she...

856
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,540
Get to the point.

857
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:29,180
I was buying clothes
at her friend's studio.

858
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,940
The clothes she recommended to me
are getting more expensive one by one.

859
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:33,820
Way more than the last time.

860
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,340
She really tried hard to bleed me dry.

861
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,100
No, bleed you dry.

862
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,020
Is Ming Zhu in Nangang now?

863
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,060
No, she's not.

864
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,820
Earlier on,

865
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:47,340
I heard from her bestie, the editor,

866
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,500
she went on her honeymoon.

867
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,540
Let her.

868
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,220
She has found her true love,

869
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,820
yet she still bullies your sister.

870
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,540
And you actually let her do that?

871
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,340
Even if our family is wealthy,

872
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,060
you can't be so extravagant.

873
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,460
Does she have a mole

874
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,260
on the right side of her cheek?

875
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,340
Yes, what's wrong?

876
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,340
Her name is Tang Xin, not Ming Zhu.

877
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:14,180
Tang Xin?

878
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,940
Isn't Tang Xin Ming Zhu's best friend?

879
00:42:17,020 --> 00:42:18,340
She even helped you pursue Ming Zhu.

880
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,620
Tang Dingding, didn't I tell you

881
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,740
not to mention this again?

882
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,260
Why would I let her do that
if she's not Ming Zhu?

883
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:28,940
I owe her.

884
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,420
I understand now.

885
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,780
I guess I'll

886
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,820
help you coax her then.

887
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:39,820
Later.

888
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:41,820
Mr. Tang, rest assured.

889
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,580
I guarantee not to disclose

890
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,340
a single word

891
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,020
about Miss Tang Xin.

892
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,340
How did the copyright renewal discussion
go with her?

893
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,340
Miss Tang Xin has been working
with the film crew lately

894
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:53,340
and rarely comes to the company.

895
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,940
But don't worry.

896
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,140
I'll go remind her immediately.

897
00:42:59,220 --> 00:42:59,820
I'll pay with the card.

898
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,180
Card, please. What's wrong?

899
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:04,820
Nothing.

900
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:11,540
Please sign here.

901
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,340
All set.

902
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,060
Good.

903
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,300
Here's your card.

904
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,340
Do you know who I am?

905
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,340
Should I ask who is your dad?

906
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,300
My dad?

907
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,020
Tang Haiming.

908
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:35,500
Tang Haiming?

909
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:37,500
Tang Haiming.

910
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,460
Isn't that Mr. Tang Sr.?

911
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,300
Then, Tang Yu is...

912
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,540
Tang Yu is my brother.

913
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,740
I'm Tang Dingding.

914
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:44,820
Tang Yu's sister.

915
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,060
(Six months ago)
(I just want to be a fallen rich lady.)

916
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,260
Come in.

917
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,100
Mr. Tang. It's time for dinner.

918
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,540
Thank you.

919
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,180
Your ambitions are quite big, huh?

920
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,060
Not only you want to be a rich lady,

921
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,940
but also you want to indulge
in male charm.

922
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,340
Can't indulge in male charm

923
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,420
mean being indulged with just one man?

924
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:51,340
(Of course,)

925
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:52,980
(that man has to be impressive.)

926
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,220
By the way, during this few days,

927
00:44:58,700 --> 00:44:59,860
did you forget the important matters?

928
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,860
After your fabricated plan,

929
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,740
it won't just come to an abrupt end,
will it?

930
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,620
It was a completely unexpected situation.

931
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,820
I couldn't arrange a meeting
with Ming Zhu last time.

932
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:14,980
Don't worry.

933
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,020
I've already planned the next steps
for you.

934
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,940
If you want to capture someone's heart,

935
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,340
you must first capture their stomach.

936
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:22,620
The meals you cook yourself

937
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:24,460
are full of heartfelt intentions.

938
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:25,940
So...

939
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,540
This is not a bad idea.

940
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,140
If I remember correctly,

941
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,180
both you and Ming Zhu are from Suzhou.

942
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,060
How about you teach me to cook a dish
from your hometown?

943
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,260
What's wrong?

944
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,460
Can't you cook?

945
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,620
How is that possible?

946
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,700
I've been cooking

947
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,660
since I was a kid.

948
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,740
I can be considered a culinary expert
in Suzhou.

949
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,260
If you're looking for a teacher,
you've found the right person.

950
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,100
You're quite confident.

951
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,860
What dish are you planning to teach me?

952
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:54,020
How about Yangzhou Fried Rice?

953
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:54,860
That's too common.

954
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:57,020
How about Sweet and Sour Mandarin Fish?

955
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,300
Of course.

956
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,940
But for Sweet and Sour Mandarin Fish,

957
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:02,780
you'll need a lot of ingredients.

958
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:04,420
It's quite a grand dish.

959
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,740
It's not a problem with the ingredients.

960
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:06,740
Tell me more about it.

961
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,420
First, we need a mandarin fish.

962
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,540
The mandarin fish can't be alive.

963
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:11,500
It's not good for frying if it's alive.

964
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,260
However,

965
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,500
it can't be dead for too long as well.

966
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,500
The time of death
should be between 45 minutes

967
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,660
and an hour.

968
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:17,700
We also need

969
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,540
aged vinegar, fruit vinegar,
balsamic vinegar,

970
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,420
cooking wine, ginger wine,
rice wine.

971
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:20,540
The aged vinegar
should be over ten years old.

972
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,580
The fruit vinegar
needs to be three months old.

973
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,540
The balsamic vinegar should be fragrant.

974
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,580
13 percent cooking wine,

975
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,460
28 percent ginger wine,

976
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:25,220
3 percent rice wine,

977
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,100
and...

978
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,420
A mandarin fish that died within an hour.

979
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,060
It shouldn't be alive for frying,

980
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,100
but it also can't be dead for too long.

981
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,540
The aged vinegar over ten years.

982
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,260
Three-month-old fruit vinegar.

983
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,060
The fragrant balsamic vinegar.

984
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:32,660
13 percent cooking wine.

985
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:33,380
28 percent ginger wine.

986
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,300
3 percent rice wine.

987
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,580
There are pepper, peppercorn, chili,

988
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,980
dried ginger, star anise,
cinnamon, tangerine peel,

989
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,380
mint, cardamom, basil,

990
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,860
clove, fennel, bay leaves, rosemary,

991
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,780
lavender, jujube, and tamarindus indica.

992
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:43,220
Do I lack any ingredients?

993
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:48,860
She probably doesn't remember

994
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,100
what she said before.

995
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:52,820
Do you?

996
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:54,260
I...

997
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:55,940
Of course, I remember.

998
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,380
I'll give you credit
for having some cooking talent.

999
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:01,820
