00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,839

It's dangerous to drink alone outside.

75

Morning.

76
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,940
Morning, Mr. Tang.

77
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,940
Tang Xin.

78
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,900
I still feel a bit unwell.

79
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,100
How about...

80
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,500
How about you pour me a glass of water?

81
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,740
You feel unwell?

82
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,020
You want water?

83
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,220
Continue acting.

84
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,359
Your acting skills are so good.

85
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,500
Why become a producer?

86
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,620
Just debut as an actor.

87
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,860
You found out?

88
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,340
How did you find out?

89
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,660
Good night.

90
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,620
See that?

91
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,559
Originally,

92
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,599
I installed this camera

93
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,340
to observe Hua Juan.

94
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,340
I didn't expect you
to give me such a big surprise.

95
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,700
I really have to praise you

96
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,319
for doing it so meticulously.

97
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,540
You're afraid
I'd notice the water reduced, right?

98
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,460
Go back.

99
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,599
I can explain this.

100
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,939
If you want to explain, explain quickly.

101
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:51,139
Don't give me these opening remarks.

102
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:51,860
Yesterday,

103
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,279
I did drink.

104
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,580
I did get a bit drunk.

105
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,220
You did lie to me too.

106
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,740
Tang Xin.

107
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,060
Do you

108
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,199
really not know

109
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,820
why I lied to you?

110
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,639
Regardless of the reason,

111
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,279
you can't stay in my house
for a minute longer.

112
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,220
Go back.

113
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,940
Wait.

114
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,860
No.

115
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,119
- Go back.
- Listen to my explanation.

116
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,119
I don't want to listen.

117
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,700
I just want you out of my house now.

118
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,039
Quickly.

119
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,959
Get out now.
Your house is just at the opposite.

120
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,900
Get out.

121
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,439
Dingding?

122
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,660
You guys...

123
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,439
You two...

124
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,500
No, quickly come in.

125
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,100
There's no "you two".

126
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,239
Did you guys...

127
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,999
What you guys?

128
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,039
Don't think too much.

129
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,140
Let me show you something.

130
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,940
I haven't changed my shoes yet.

131
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,649
It doesn't matter. We're leaving right away.

132
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:43,500
Come.

133
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,300
A script?

134
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,239
This is a script for "A Dream for You".

135
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,239
I wrote it three years ago to practice.
Take a look.

136
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,980
Three years ago?

137
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,039
I remember

138
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,420
when I just finished writing this novel,

139
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,679
I really hoped

140
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,420
someone could turn it into a film.

141
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,900
But I majored in Chinese literature

142
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,340
and knew nothing about film creation.

143
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,660
Just then,

144
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,020
I met someone.

145
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,700
(I hoped I could shine like him,)

146
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,140
(living up to his excellence.)

147
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,660
So,

148
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,599
I started as a rookie screenwriter,

149
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,839
learning slowly

150
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,799
and accumulating experience.

151
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,220
Today,

152
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,020
screenwriting has
become my beloved career.

153
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,279
I hope you can find

154
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,940
a career you love soon.

155
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,879
So, who is that person?

156
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,780
Your first love?

157
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,060
I...

158
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,540
Why are you so perceptive?

159
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,439
Let's go for work.

160
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,799
- Remember to read it.
- Did I hit the nail on the head?

161
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,420
What nail?

162
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,140
Morning, Chen.

163
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,420
Morning, Mr. Tang.

164
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,420
Morning.

165
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,599
I must say,

166
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,020
you look quite cool with glasses.

167
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,780
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

168
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,420
Mr. Tang.

169
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,839
This morning,
the finance department sent me a bonus,

170
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,260
saying it was at your suggestion.

171
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,020
You don't want it?

172
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,799
No, I want it, of course.

173
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,940
I'll take as much as you give me.

174
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,660
Mr. Tang.

175
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,359
I'll get you a cup of coffee.

176
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,050
(Dingding invited you in the group)
Okay, thank you.

177
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,680
(Group Members:
Tang Xin, Lu Zhixing, Huo Chendong)

178
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,020
(Lu Zhixing invited Feng Chen)

179
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,340
(Dingding:
I have something serious to announce.)

180
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,940
(I'm going to be the female lead
in "A Dream for You".)

181
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,839
(This is the most important decision)

182
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,780
(of my 23 years of life.)

183
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,479
(Originally, I wanted to call everyone)

184
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,620
(and announce it in person,)

185
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,460
(but that seemed a bit silly.)

186
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,680
(Tang Yu: I'll arrange for someone
to draft the contract now.)

187
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,380
(Lu Zhixing: Welcome aboard.)

188
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,740
(Dingding: Mr. Lu,
I look forward to working with you.)

189
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,820
- This is already...
- Great news.

190
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,660
We have our female lead.

191
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,559
Check your phone.

192
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,420
The group.

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,779
(Hotnews)

194
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,660
(Dingding: I'm going to be the female lead
in "A Dream for You".)

195
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,559
(Rich Lady: Dingding.)

196
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,140
(You made up your mind already?)

197
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,079
(Dingding: Actually,
after meeting with Mr. Lu yesterday,)

198
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,660
(I pretty much made up my mind.)

199
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,159
(After reading your script today,)

200
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,679
(I became even more certain.)

201
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,860
(I also want to be a shining girl.)

202
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,119
(By the way,)

203
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,759
(the script is not childish at all.)

204
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,159
(I really like this version.)

205
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,279
(I think the ending
is much better than in the book.)

206
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,300
Script?

207
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,700
What script?

208
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,799
It's

209
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,319
the adaptation script
I wrote three years ago

210
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,820
as a practice for "A Dream for You".

211
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,919
You wrote a script three years ago?

212
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,660
Why didn't you show us earlier?

213
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,079
Well,

214
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,319
I thought it wasn't very good,

215
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,860
so I...

216
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,780
If you don't mind,

217
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,020
let me take a look at it.

218
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,060
Wait.

219
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,340
Let us all take a look at it.

220
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,839
Yu, I'm here.

221
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,959
Didn't we agree
that I'd give it to you tomorrow?

222
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,119
Why are you in such a hurry?

223
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,100
I've already made plans with Shen Fei.

224
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,559
No need to change shoes.

225
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,719
Didn't you make plans with someone?

226
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,660
Just go.

227
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,839
Yu, you're really superficial.

228
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,559
I'm your sister, after all.

229
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,660
Even a sister grows up.

230
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,119
It's time to have your own life.

231
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,479
Go.

232
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:58,919
Hurry.

233
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,999
- I'll have a sip of water.
- Go.

234
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,300
- Let me have a sip of water.
- Go ask Shen Fei for it.

235
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,460
Be careful on the way.

Tang Xin.

271
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,260
I know.

272
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,860
You've always treated "A Dream for You"

273
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,780
like your own child.

274
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,980
You have a lot of ideas

275
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,399
and have put in a lot of effort.

276
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,220
Wait.

277
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,660
Did Tang Yu tell you something?

278
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:08,900
- Yes.
- I...

279
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,180
He just called us.

280
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:12,799
No.

281
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,399
Don't listen to him.

282
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,519
I know my original script.

283
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,959
It really wasn't very good,

284
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,719
and then it...

285
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,879
It has a lot of weird parts

286
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,719
that need improvement.

287
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,580
I just...

288
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,100
Alright.

289
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,220
Don't act anymore.

290
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,220
Both Feng and I

291
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,780
have read your script.

292
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,879
The two of us

293
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,919
basically have the same opinions
as Tang Yu's.

294
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,159
We hope to use this version as a basis

295
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,580
to revise the story outline.

296
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,679
Could you please hold it in next time?

297
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,799
I haven't finished acting yet.

298
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,860
Feng.

299
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,260
I've noticed that you've been
very enthusiastic about acting lately.

300
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,660
I think,

301
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,359
why don't you write a role for yourself

302
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,660
and have fun acting it.

303
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,620
That's a good idea.

304
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,159
No.

305
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,740
Wait.

306
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,740
So, what you two mean is...

307
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,319
What we mean is

308
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,519
that your initial script,

309
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,580
although there are many immature parts,

310
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,679
the overall tone is what we want.

311
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,519
Yes.

312
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,639
And after the recent tempering,

313
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,460
your screenwriting skills
have become very proficient.

314
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,700
Don't be proud.

315
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,180
The most important thing is
to return to the original intention.

316
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,599
That's right.

317
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,079
This is your greatest advantage

318
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,540
as the author.

319
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,439
I think

320
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,759
you shouldn't think too complicatedly

321
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,060
about screenwriting.

322
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,100
Sometimes, sincerity is more important
than technique.

323
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,399
Okay.

324
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,980
I will definitely work hard.

325
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,980
Good.

326
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,079
I've already talked

327
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,919
to Tang Yu as well.

328
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,799
We'll first sign the actress contract
for Dingding.

329
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,019
For the investment contract,

330
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:37,519
we have to wait for Time Pictures' side
to finish the shareholders' meeting.

331
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,780
We can sign the contract after that.

332
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,060
Tang Xin, I'm counting on you.

333
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,599
Thank you, Mr. Lu, for your trust.

334
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,220
I will definitely work hard.

335
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,980
It's not just Mr. Lu.

336
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,660
Not just Mr. Lu, but also...

337
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,820
Also me.

338
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,700
Beautiful screenwriter.

339
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,820
I'm counting on you.

340
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,679
Rest assured.

341
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,700
I will really work hard.

342
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,159
(Hello, Tang Xin.)

343
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,439
What's up, big star?

344
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,479
Quickly check Weibo.

345
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,540
Someone is accusing you of plagiarism.

346
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,780
Plagiarism?

347
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,879
What plagiarism?

348
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,479
(Quickly go on Weibo.)

349
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,599
(An account named Shakeslamb)

350
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,599
(posted on Weibo half an hour ago)

351
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,639
(saying that your novel)

352
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,100
(plagiarized a book)

353
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,679
(called "A Thought Three Lifetimes".)

354
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,759
When I checked earlier,
there were only a dozen comments.

355
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,980
Now, there are over 200 comments.

356
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,219
(Why didn't they say anything
when the novel was published?)

357
00:20:33,219 --> 00:20:35,759
(Now that they see Miss Sugar Heart
is popular, they come out to make trouble.)

358
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:37,500
(Resolutely protect Miss Sugar Heart.)

359
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,439
(This is a baseless accusation.)

360
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,359
(I stand with Sugar Heart.)

361
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,980
(If you have evidence, show it.)

362
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,599
(Miss Sugar Heart is the best.)

363
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,620
(Disgusting marketing account.
You better turn yourself in.)

364
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,700
It's just some marketing accounts
causing trouble.

365
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,340
Dingding.

366
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,919
(You'll be a big star in the future.)

367
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,359
(In case you encounter such situations,)

368
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,679
don't be panic.

369
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,220
You'll get used to it.

370
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,180
You're right.

371
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,340
It seems that most people
are still quite rational.

372
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,479
But these people are really despicable.

373
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,919
(Why do they smear others
for no reason?)

374
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,399
I haven't scolded you yet.

375
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,479
Why do you

376
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,759
search for me on Weibo for no reason?

377
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,460
(Are you secretly in love with me?)

378
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,119
I'm not Yu.

379
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:23,140
(This is my duty
as the head of your fan club.)

380
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,039
(I must always help my idol)

381
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,159
clear rumors and gossip on the internet

382
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,460
to maintain a clean online environment.

383
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,380
Okay.

384
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,380
You continue to be an online cleaner.

385
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,279
I have a script meeting tomorrow.

386
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,679
There are still two scenes to revise.

387
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,159
Talk to you later.

388
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,679
Bye.

389
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,620
(Okay.)

390
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,380
Such a master of insinuation.

391
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,060
What are you looking at?

392
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:53,839
Tang.

393
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,060
Come.

394
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,039
- Come, take a look.
- What are you looking at?

395
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,340
Xin, Zhou Jialu.

396
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,780
Zhou Jialu?

397
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,599
Didn't we already choose Dingding
as the female lead?

398
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,319
- Are you still interested in her?
- Just look.

399
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,820
No.

400
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,420
We definitely won't use her.

401
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,599
But it seems like

402
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,159
this young lady was provoked.

403
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,700
She isn't particularly friendly to us.

404
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,119
(It's rumored that you gave up)

405
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,959
(on the opportunity to cooperate
with Time Pictures)

406
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,159
(to compete for a project
of Mr. Lu Zhixing)

407
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,999
(that has recently
gained a lot of attention.)

408
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,639
(But the casting for the project
has not been officially announced.)

409
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,079
(Fans are very curious
about how the negotiations are going.)

410
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,460
(Can you reveal some information?)

411
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,839
Before,

412
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,799
I did have interest

413
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,540
in playing a role
in this movie you mentioned.

414
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,340
But

415
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,700
my team is very cautious
when choosing projects.

416
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,119
(Out of responsibility)

417
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,820
(to the audience and fans,)

418
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,079
I'm currently not considering

419
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,999
cooperating with Mr. Lu on this project.

420
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,319
(Are you saying that there's a problem
with this project?)

421
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,380
(Is it the rumored plagiarism issue?)

422
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,399
There are many groundless rumors
on the internet.

423
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,919
I can't distinguish
between true and false.

424
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,620
But as an actress,

425
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,860
I really care about my artistic life.

426
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,279
So,

427
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,900
for projects with similar rumors,

428
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,020
I need to consider them carefully.

429
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,319
Could you provide more...

430
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,279
I believe Mr. Lu

431
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,359
will investigate the truth
of the matter.

432
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,020
So, let's talk about something else.

433
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,639
She's so good at acting.

434
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,079
Okay. Stop watching.

435
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,700
Boring.

436
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,119
Don't you guys have work?

437
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,220
Disband.

438
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,340
Get your computers. Let's have a meeting.

439
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,500
Get to work.

440
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,460
Tang.

441
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,679
This kind of person is just boring.

442
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,919
She likes to seek attention.

443
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,159
Such a clown.

444
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,519
Don't lower yourself to her level.

445
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,999
Her lie was so concise.

446
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,759
It was us who didn't choose her.

447
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,460
Now she's putting herself
on a high horse, blaming everything on us.

448
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,119
Will what she said have an impact on us?

449
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,340
What impact can there be?

450
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,279
The so-called plagiarism issue
she mentioned?

451
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,559
I haven't heard of it at all.

452
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,580
Have you seen it?

453
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,479
I saw it once before,

454
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,020
but I didn't pay attention at the time.

455
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,239
When writing books,

456
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,340
coincidences in concept are common.

457
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,959
Nobody cared before,

458
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,839
but now it seems
the attention has increased.

459
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,700
Exactly.

460
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,679
Wait a moment.

461
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,100
But I can guarantee

462
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,639
that I did not plagiarize anyone's book.

463
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,239
I typed every word

464
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,079
on my own.

465
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,980
Alright.

466
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,540
I absolutely trust you.

467
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,020
Don't overthink it.

468
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,380
Let's have the meeting.

469
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,060
I disagree.

470
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,780
It's a positioning issue.

471
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,879
These past few years,
Mr. Tang has been emphasizing

472
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,340
the company's positioning issue.

473
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,639
Time's appearance

474
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,439
in this industry

475
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,060
is the benchmark
for high-quality male-oriented content.

476
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,719
Now, if we spend 100 million,

477
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,879
to invest in some romance projects

478
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,199
for young girls,

479
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,900
can our audience accept that?

480
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,559
- Exactly.
- He's right.

481
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,460
Right.

482
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,780
Mr. Hu.

483
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,820
We're all on the same team.

484
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,479
To be honest,

485
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,639
I really haven't had a girlfriend

486
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,439
who's willing to spend money
to go to the cinema

487
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,060
to watch our movie.

488
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,460
Also,

489
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,919
the original author of this project

490
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,759
is also the current editor-in-chief,

491
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,719
Tang Xin.

492
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,839
She's also a talent
that Time has cultivated.

493
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,700
Isn't that right?

494
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,199
When she was working
on the project in our company,

495
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,679
didn't you always praise her?

496
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,820
You said she has a strong ability
and innovative ideas.

497
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,860
Mr. Zheng.

498
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,780
You also said this before.

499
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,500
But recently, I heard that this Tang Xin

500
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,020
seems to have
a special relationship with you.

501
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,439
Mr. Tang.

502
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,039
At this time,
we must not let emotions take over.

503
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,860
If you make such impulsive decisions,

504
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:22,399
the ones who bear the risks

505
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,740
will be us.

506
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,799
Since I took over Time,

507
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,759
we have consistently

508
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,439
broken through
and developed the male market

509
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,740
under the premise
of social and humanistic care.

510
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,279
We have walked steadily

511
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,959
on this path

512
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,140
and solidly over the years.

513
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,660
This is related to the contributions
of everyone present.

514
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,060
But today, what I want to say is

515
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,879
that if we always stay

516
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:46,799
in this comfort zone,

517
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,940
it will only

518
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,319
narrow the path

519
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,940
and may even lead to extremes.

520
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,399
If we can

521
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,660
harvest a lot of female audiences

522
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,639
through a good romance movie,

523
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,420
that is the path
Time should take in the future.

524
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,460
Everyone, please take a look.

525
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,999
This is the popularity, discussion,

526
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,119
and audience liking analysis

527
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,620
of the novel "A Dream for You"
on the internet.

528
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,639
It can be seen

529
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,559
that the left part refers

530
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,039
to the audience of "A Dream for You".

531
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,159
While the right part

532
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,220
represents the main audience of Time.

533
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,759
From the chart, it can be seen

534
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,319
that the main audience of Time

535
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,319
and the main audience
for "A Dream for You"

536
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,500
are two different groups of people.

537
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,559
We have also conducted

538
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,559
an analysis of the future market fit

539
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,700
for "A Dream for You".

540
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,159
It can be said that the collaboration

541
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,759
among Tang Xin, Lu Zhixing, and Time

542
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,039
can greatly attract more audience,

543
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,679
making them interested

544
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,279
and willing to enter the cinema

545
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,279
to watch this movie.

546
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,340
Sorry, let me interrupt.

547
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,159
What you mentioned

548
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,879
about the comfort zone and all,

549
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,900
I don't understand.

550
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,559
I have only

551
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,620
one opinion.

552
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,780
Don't fuss around.

553
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:53,839
Yes.

554
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,980
Fussing around can easily backfire.

555
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,919
The movie market is tough these days.

556
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,380
One wrong step,

557
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,719
let's not talk about recovering costs,

558
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,380
Time's brand itself

559
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,380
will be damaged.

560
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,639
We've been constantly cultivating

561
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,799
our expertise for so many years.

562
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,679
Isn't that good?

563
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,359
Why take such risks?

564
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,900
I believe
you must have heard this saying,

565
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,140
"Wealth and risk go hand in hand".

566
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,620
If we look at the entire industry,

567
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,300
Dajiang has always
been pressing down on us.

568
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,100
Not breaking through

569
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,740
is acceptable.

570
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,860
But everyone here,

571
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,580
do you really want
to be in perennial second place?

572
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,460
Being in perennial second place
isn't bad either.

573
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,180
I will personally serve

574
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,300
as the producer for "A Dream for You".

575
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,159
- As for my track record as a producer,
- He will be the producer?

576
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,540
I believe everyone should be clear.

577
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,380
Let's start the vote.

578
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,340
I agree.

579
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,220
- I also agree.
- Agree.

580
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,359
If Mr. Tang Sr. were here,

581
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,959
I don't think he would agree

582
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,780
to such a risky investment.

583
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,460
I think so too.

584
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,740
Mr. Tang.

585
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,140
What is it?

586
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,220
There's something
I want to report to you.

587
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:29,820
Should I...

588
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,519
It's okay.

589
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,319
Go ahead.

590
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,300
"A Dream for You" is trending.

591
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,380
It's suspected

592
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,180
of plagiarism.

593
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,119
- What's going on?
- How could this happen?

594
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,300
- I don't know.
- Exactly.

595
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,919
Plagiarism?

596
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,740
Look at this.

597
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,180
- First place.
- Yes.

598
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,540
It's trending.

599
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,500
What's going on?

600
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,799
This project is still
in the development stage.

601
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,100
The hype shouldn't skyrocket like this
all of a sudden.

602
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,639
Do you know what's going on?

603
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,860
It's Zhou Jialu.

604
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,820
She just finished a live interview.

605
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:03,919
In the interview,

606
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,740
she mentioned about it.

607
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,300
You can go now.

608
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,220
Mr. Tang.

609
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,959
About the issue of an original novel

610
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,820
suspected of plagiarism,

611
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,460
everyone knows how serious it is.

612
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,679
I think you should

613
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,119
clear up this issue

614
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,500
before we discuss other matters.

615
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,620
I will investigate this matter first.

616
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,199
In the next shareholder meeting,

617
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,540
I will definitely give everyone
a satisfactory explanation.

618
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,460
Then, we'll wait.

619
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,359
Isn't this the novel
suspected of plagiarism?

620
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:40,999
Yes.

621
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,799
It's still trending.

622
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,319
I paid attention a few days ago.

623
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,620
I even specifically
read "A Thought Three Lifetimes".

624
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,519
I must say,

625
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,340
the setting is exactly the same.

626
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,580
I think the author
just wants to get famous.

627
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,719
If she were low-key,

628
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,140
maybe nobody would have exposed her.

629
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,879
This book has only
been popular again for a while.

630
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,919
And now they're withdrawing.

631
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,279
I heard the publishing house's reprint
has a large circulation.

632
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,580
Isn't this a loss?

633
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,340
It's their own fault.

634
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,719
Either they didn't do enough research

635
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,980
before publishing,

636
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,599
or

637
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,500
the publishing house
and the author are in cahoots,

638
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,300
knowing she plagiarized long ago.

639
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,759
(Lu Studio)

640
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,340
Let me read to you.

641
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,959
The first chapter
of "A Thought Three Lifetimes"

642
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,660
was published two months earlier
than "A Dream for You".

643
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,719
When the latter started serialization,

644
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,719
"A Thought Three Lifetimes"
had already proposed

645
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,999
a complete world-building concept.

646
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,780
Here's the timeline
compiled by netizens.

647
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,999
Just because Tang Xin
published a little later,

648
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,759
they say Tang Xin plagiarized.

649
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,119
What kind of evidence is this?

650
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,140
He won't win a lawsuit
with this kind of evidence.

651
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,100
Dingding.

652
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,839
Stop going around in circles here.

653
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,039
My head hurts.

654
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,220
Please sit.

655
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,439
So, they don't intend

656
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,820
to take legal action.

657
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:55,879
You make it sound easy.

658
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,199
Even if they don't,

659
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,940
those rumors and speculations online...

660
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,740
Is there no other way?

661
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,439
Now the internet is in chaos.

662
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,820
There are people saying
that Tang Xin maliciously plagiarized.

663
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,719
There are mindless haters.

664
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,540
And those who just want
to join in the excitement.

665
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,660
Tang Xin's fans can't hold on anymore.

666
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:17,799
Tang Xin.

667
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,660
Look.

668
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,300
Half of your fans have already left.

669
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,260
Why are these people like this?

670
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,959
Why do they
believe everything they hear?

671
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,439
Isn't this online bullying?

672
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,079
My goodness, I beg you.

673
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,919
Can you stop exploding
at every little thing?

674
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,420
Sit down first.

675
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,980
Lu.

676
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,679
I think Dingding

677
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,860
has a point.

678
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,199
If this continues to develop,

679
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,900
it will get out of control.

680
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,439
Besides not taking legal action,

681
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,559
is there any other way?

682
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,740
Let me release a statement.

683
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,079
I didn't do this.

684
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,119
I don't feel guilty,
and I don't want to keep hiding.

685
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:56,919
Right.

686
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,399
We won't hide like turtles.

687
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,719
Those online who said

688
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,919
that we dare not explain,

689
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,260
let's give them a slap in the face.

690
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,540
Okay.

691
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,279
Let's do that

692
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,300
and see the effect.

693
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,760
(Sugar Heart's Respond to Plagiarism)
(Netizen: It's the 21st century.)

694
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,520
(Doesn't she know that after
releasing a statement, she'll be exposed?)

695
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,799
(Sugar Heart: I promise it's my original novel.)
(Netizen: She's anxious.)

696
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,160
(It's probably because the money
she's about to get went down the drain.)

697
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,299
(Netizen: Mr. Lu, you better run.)

698
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:27,980
(Don't let yourself be fooled
by such a woman.)

699
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,479
(Netizen: Purely original?)

700
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,979
(Purely original but published 2 months later.
And the concept is the same.)

701
00:32:31,979 --> 00:32:33,730
(If she's so capable,
why not create something again?)

702
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,279
(Netizen: Isn't this intrusion robbery?)

703
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,860
(She should be arrested.)

704
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,420
Come here.

705
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,100
Mr. Tang.

706
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,639
Have you found out
who owns the copyright

707
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,780
to "A Thought Three Lifetimes"?

708
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,679
I haven't found out.

709
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,879
It might not have been sold,

710
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,839
or the buyer hasn't made it public.

711
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,460
For a novelist,

712
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,620
even with Zhou Jialu
stirring up trouble,

713
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,860
it's not possible
to create such a big storm.

714
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,060
Find out

715
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,260
who's behind the marketing account
that first accused her of plagiarism.

716
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,460
Understood.

717
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,839
Why did Mr. Lu repost her post?

718
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,559
Plagiarism is her own business.

719
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,559
Now,

720
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,359
he's implicated

721
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,279
and can't get away.

722
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,039
Now,

723
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,060
every netizen is a symbol of justice.

724
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,919
She's already
facing a nationwide boycott.

725
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,959
If this movie is released,
it will face a nationwide boycott.

726
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,520
Maybe we won't even
recover the production costs.

727
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,119
Xin.

728
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,239
I was just looking for you.

729
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,340
Look at this person.

730
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,159
I always feel that the way he talks
is not right.

731
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,220
Don't you think so?

732
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,639
I'll think about it tonight.

733
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,580
After thinking,
I'll discuss it with you tomorrow.

734
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,399
Okay.

735
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,860
Then I'll work on other things for now.

736
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,820
Hello?

737
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,460
(Sugar Heart.)

738
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,700
(Are you okay?)

739
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,159
I'm fine.

740
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,220
What's up?

741
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,700
Well,

742
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,679
the chief editor talked to me
this afternoon.

743
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,340
He said the novel you revised

744
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,100
needs to be temporarily taken down.

745
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,380
(The payment also
has to be temporarily withheld.)

746
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,079
(But I managed to fight for it.)

747
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,279
But you know,

748
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,140
the publishing house
has also invested in it.

749
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,020
Now, with this incident...

750
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,420
It's okay.

751
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,140
It's quite normal.

752
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,719
It's my fault

753
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,780
for causing you so much trouble.

754
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,260
Tang Xin.

755
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,319
Something came up.

756
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,980
Let's talk later.

757
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,500
Let's go. I'll send you home.

758
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,140
Okay.

759
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,879
You don't need to accompany me.

760
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,679
I'm fine.

761
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,319
I didn't come to accompany you.

762
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,839
I came to freeload a meal.

763
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,439
Yu.

764
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,380
You're here.

765
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,220
What are you two doing?

766
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,759
Yu knows you're not in a good mood.

767
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,319
You haven't eaten all day.

768
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,500
He wants to make you...

769
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:35,980
He wants to make us a sumptuous dinner.

770
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,300
Try it.

771
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,999
Oh my god.

772
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,700
Why isn't anyone
helping me cut the steak?

773
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,580
How does it taste?

774
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,260
It's okay.

775
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,340
Something's missing.

776
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,420
Here.

777
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,580
Maybe I should go.

778
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,060
Try it again.

779
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,020
Dingding, what did you just say?

780
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,900
Let's eat.

781
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,279
Alright.

782
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,599
I'll leave then.

783
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,900
No need to see me off.

784
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,759
If you have anything,

785
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,119
give me a call.

786
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,239
If I don't answer,

787
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,420
you can find Yu.

788
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,260
I'll walk you.

789
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,119
No need to walk me.

790
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,900
You should hurry back.
Send Tang Xin home.

791
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,220
Bye.

792
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,119
Take care.

793
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,340
Let me know when you get home.

794
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,140
Let's go. I'll walk you.

795
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,020
Thank you for today.

796
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,159
I didn't have much appetite today.

797
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,820
I didn't even want to eat dinner.

798
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,140
Eat well, sleep well.

799
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,599
You don't need to worry

800
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,100
about anything else.

801
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,900
But this is my matter.

802
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,479
Now, Mr. Lu and the publishing house

803
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,759
are all affected because of me.

804
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,439
It's fortunate your investment
hasn't come in yet,

805
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,140
or I would drag you into this mess too.

806
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,740
I'm not afraid of what you mentioned.

807
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,180
Do you believe me?

808
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,020
No matter when,

809
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,540
I'll believe in you.

810
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,260
You all trust me so much,

811
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,860
but I have no solution to the problem.

812
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,220
Tang Xin.

813
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,740
You've just entered this circle
not long ago.

814
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,439
Many intricacies behind the scenes
are unknown to you.

815
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,420
The root of the matter isn't with you.

816
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,740
It will be resolved soon.

817
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,599
Don't worry.

(Hello, Mr. Tang.)

830
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:14,959
(I found it.)

831
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,759
Go on.

832
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,039
(These big marketing accounts)

833
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,879
(are all connected to Dajiang Pictures.)

834
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,339
The copyright
to "A Thought Three Lifetimes"

835
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:21,740
should have been sold
to Dajiang as well.

836
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,020
Help me arrange a meeting
with Zhu Jiang.

837
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,700
I must see him tomorrow.

838
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,140
Understood.

839
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,919
Mr. Tang. I've tried to make appointments
with you several times before,

840
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,359
wanting to discuss collaboration with you.

841
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,620
But you were always busy.

842
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,780
How come you're free to invite me today?

843
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,239
I came today

844
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,119
just to talk to you

845
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,380
about the recent scandal of plagiarism.

846
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,559
One of the novels involved,

847
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,260
"A Thought Three Lifetimes".
You have its copyright,

848
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,260
and it's already in development.

849
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,839
I must say,

850
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,580
you have remarkable connections.

851
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,700
Nothing escapes your knowledge.

852
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,799
But I want to make one thing clear.

853
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,999
We didn't plagiarize anyone.

854
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,260
Others copied us.

855
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,119
You're so confident.

856
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,780
Of course.

857
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,519
Haven't netizens already listed

858
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,540
all the evidence one by one?

859
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,380
But Mr. Tang,

860
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,999
the copyright of this novel

861
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,860
is no longer with Time, right?

862
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,700
Why are you so concerned about it?

863
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,620
Time is fully investing in this project.

864
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,580
Mr. Tang.

865
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,420
Are you kidding me?

866
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,100
It's a novel plagiarized
by a tainted author,

867
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,420
and you're eager to invest in it?

868
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,300
Do you have too much money?

869
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,020
Two novels.

870
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,559
It must be one of them

871
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,180
plagiarizing the other.

872
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,540
I believe Tang Xin didn't plagiarize,

873
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,580
but I don't know if you

874
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,220
believe in your author.

875
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,780
But online public opinion

876
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,060
is in our favor.

877
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,420
Or do you

878
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,820
have a way to reverse the situation?

879
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,100
Aren't you the one
manipulating public opinion?

880
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,900
The marketing account
that first started the plagiarism topic

881
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,620
is also from your side.

882
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,180
I've already investigated.

883
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,380
I have the evidence in my hands.

884
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,300
Actually,

885
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,900
buying a few marketing accounts

886
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,420
is not a big deal.

887
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,420
The key is that the marketing accounts

888
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,300
are telling the truth.

889
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,119
Even if you expose
all the evidence you have,

890
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,559
those affected will still be you guys.

891
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,900
I just said

892
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,700
that I believe in my author.

893
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,119
If you

894
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,860
don't intend
to remove those public opinions,

895
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,919
I can only resort to legal means

896
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,719
to resolve this matter.

897
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,559
So you mean

898
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,900
you invited me here today

899
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,140
as a gesture of diplomacy
before resorting to force?

900
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,980
Today is all about diplomacy,
no force involved.

901
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,180
In front of you
is a significant pitfall.

902
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,020
Whether to avoid it

903
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,399
or jump into it,

904
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,140
you should think about it yourself.

905
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,660
Tang Yu.

906
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,599
You're more than
10 years younger than me,

907
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,719
and your firepower

908
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,879
is stronger than mine.

909
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,180
Let's take a step back.

910
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,119
Even if I remove the marketing accounts,

911
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,359
the online momentum

912
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,599
has already been created.

913
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,180
Have you considered this?

914
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,900
Also,

915
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,119
I don't believe Time's shareholders

916
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,740
will agree to your investment
in this project.

917
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,220
Don't push yourself into a corner.

918
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,700
It seems I can't persuade you today.

919
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,580
Dad, I'm back.

920
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,900
Why are you suddenly
watching a romance movie?

921
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,719
I heard

922
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,519
young people like this nowadays.

923
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,119
I also need to keep up with the times

924
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,420
and learn something new.

925
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,220
You already know?

926
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,420
Know what?

927
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,239
That you want to invest 100 million

928
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,119
in a romance film
that you used to disdain,

929
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,100
or

930
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,599
that you are leading Time to transform

931
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,180
and step out of the comfort zone?

932
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,340
It's not a transformation.

933
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,100
I just hope to expand the audience.

934
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,420
Hasn't surpassing Dajiang

935
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,420
always been your goal?

936
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,900
Mr. Tang, dinner's ready.

937
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,599
You're back. Let's...

938
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,599
You're in time for dinner.

939
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,780
Why are you here?

940
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,140
I...

941
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,599
Dad, Yu.

942
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:38,599
I also cooked today.

943
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,820
Come and see.

944
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,660
Let's go.

945
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,780
Is that book plagiarized?

946
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,799
Absolutely not.

947
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:46,599
No?

948
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,420
Then why aren't you
expressing your stance?

949
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,700
You don't have evidence now,

950
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,300
but don't you have a clear stance?

951
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,279
The mastermind behind the scenes
can't be found,

952
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,780
but the front-end henchmen

953
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,420
can still be dealt with.

(Dajiang Pictures:

956
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:16,599
Come on, have something to eat.

957
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,079
You can't not eat at all.

958
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:18,759
Come on.

959
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,089
- I won't eat.
- This is driving me crazy.

960
00:44:20,089 --> 00:44:22,300
I'm so angry.

961
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,180
Don't they know that buying sock puppets
is against the law?

962
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,980
If they provoke me, I'll sue them all.

963
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,740
Is this Dajiang Pictures

964
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,100
that formidable?

965
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,300
I really don't know what to do now.

966
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,839
Wake up, Tang Xin.

967
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,479
If you retreat at this time,

968
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,959
then you're officially recognized
as a coward.

969
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,879
Understand?

970
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,239
Exactly.

971
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,919
Tang Xin.

972
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,559
That's your "child".

973
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,439
How can you, as the "birth mother",
back down?

974
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:52,979
This won't do.

975
00:44:52,979 --> 00:44:54,039
You quickly stand up

976
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:55,420
and shake yourself off.

977
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,540
But I can't pull everyone down.

978
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,180
If this were just about me,

979
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,079
I wouldn't be afraid to go online
and clarify the comments one by one.

980
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,100
I wouldn't be afraid
to face lawsuits either.

981
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:10,319
But now, this matter
has involved too many people.

982
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,340
I can't let everyone pay for my mistakes.

983
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,799
I suddenly remembered
that when you were in college,

984
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,660
you had a manuscript, right?

985
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,959
You were always scribbling during class

986
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,180
and were scolded by the teacher.

987
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,340
Where's the manuscript?

988
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,420
It's been missing for a long time.

989
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,260
Can we find it?

990
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:36,519
It's okay.

991
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,700
Let's figure out another solution.

992
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,060
Morning, Mr. Tang.

993
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,900
Mr. Tang.

994
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,479
The plagiarism issue

995
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,879
will have a significant impact
on the project.

996
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,239
So, I absolutely do not agree

997
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,399
with investment in this project.

998
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:53,839
That's right.

999
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,279
I share the same opinion.

1000
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,799
I believe if Mr. Tang Sr. were here,

1001
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,719
he wouldn't agree either.

1002
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,559
That's for sure.

1003
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,799
The so-called plagiarism
is just malicious gossip.

1004
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,039
We already have

1005
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,260
some basic evidence.

1006
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:03,799
Why...

1007
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,439
Why haven't you presented the evidence?

1008
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,079
Exactly.

1009
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:06,759
Mr. Tang, now...

1010
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,519
Once public opinion is solidified,

1011
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,439
it's hard to reverse the outcome.

1012
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,959
Moreover, we have a project now.

1013
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,679
Why wade into this muddy water?
Is it true what they're saying outside?

1014
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,820
Do you have
a special relationship with Tang Xin?

1015
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,039
I thought we made it clear

1016
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,020
at the last shareholder meeting.

1017
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,319
Our investment in this project

1018
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,340
is for Time's long-term development.

1019
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,140
It has nothing to do
with my relationship with Tang Xin.

1020
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,820
As for the plagiarism incident,

1021
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,620
we are already taking steps
to address it.

1022
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,319
I absolutely won't allow
anyone's malicious speculation

1023
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,540
to affect the progress of our project.

1024
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,079
Gao Heng.

1025
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:47,759
Here.

1026
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,340
Draft a document
for the shareholder meeting.

1027
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:53,879
If this project

1028
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,540
causes any damage to Time in the future,

1029
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,260
I will resign immediately.
