"I May Love You")

(Goodbye Tang Yu)

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,760
(Rich Lady's Diary)

24
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,700
(Going through a breakup
is really nothing.)

25
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,900
(Besides the emptiness in my heart,
like a blank slate.)

26
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:57,900
(Other than that, I go to work, eat,
sleep, and pet my cat as usual.)

27
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,660
Do you know who I am?

28
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,660
Should I ask who is your dad?

29
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,700
My dad?

30
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,380
Tang Haiming.

31
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,700
Tang Haiming?

32
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,900
Tang Haiming.

33
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,820
Isn't that Mr. Tang Sr.?

34
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,700
Then, Tang Yu is...

35
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,740
Tang Yu is my brother.

36
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,020
I'm Tang Dingding.

37
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,380
Tang Yu's sister.

38
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:25,216
I used his supplementary card
to make the payment earlier.

39
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,380
If you check the receipt, you'll see.

40
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,940
Oh, so you're Mr. Tang's sister.

41
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,660
What a coincidence.

42
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,300
I just made some handmade items.

43
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,740
Since you bought so many things,
I'll give them to you directly.

44
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,980
It's okay. Thank you.

45
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,140
No problem.

46
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,260
Let's be friends.

47
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,900
Is your idea of making friends

48
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:51,100
trying to make me come here
more often in the future?

49
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,900
You're really direct.

50
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,860
I like that.

51
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,860
Be real friends, of course.

52
00:02:56,864 --> 00:02:58,540
Whether you buy things or not,
it doesn't matter.

53
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,540
Feel free to hang out here.

54
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,140
Thank you.

55
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,460
Did you recognize me from last time?

56
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,500
No.

57
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,660
I originally thought you were Ming Zhu.

58
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,220
I called my brother

59
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,780
and realized I had made a mistake.

60
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:10,860
Is that so?

61
00:03:12,176 --> 00:03:14,490
Sorry for the trouble.
You came all this way to walk me here.

62
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,580
It's nothing.

63
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,900
Come often in the future.

64
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,980
If you buy so much again,
I'll deliver it like this too.

65
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,740
Here.

66
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,260
Thank you.

67
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,380
My brother said

68
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,180
I can buy freely at your place.

69
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,100
Reserve any new styles for me, okay?

70
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,740
Rest assured.

71
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,820
I'll notify you first.

72
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:29,940
Okay.

73
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:30,700
I'll be off.

74
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,140
Okay.

75
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:31,940
Take care on the way.

76
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,860
Bye.

77
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,260
It really is his sister.

78
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,260
What's wrong?

79
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,820
Regretting being too pushy?

80
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,140
No, it's opposite of what you said.

81
00:03:41,856 --> 00:03:43,260
But since it's a supplementary card,

82
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,220
Tang Yu must have received the message.

83
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,300
Didn't you hear what Tang Dingding said?

84
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,540
She mistook me for Ming Zhu.

85
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,060
Tang Yu reminded her.

86
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,340
He knew I was here,

87
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:54,820
and knew I sold
the most expensive clothes to his sister.

88
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,160
But he still let me push her to buy.

89
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,060
Do you think

90
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,620
he's feeling guilty,

91
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,100
so he wants to compensate me?

92
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,940
Do you want him to feel guilty,

93
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,100
or do you not?

94
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,420
Neither, I guess.

95
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,720
(Mr. Lu)
(Do you have time today?)

96
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,904
(Mr. Lu)
(Let's meet and chat.)

97
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,220
(Sure.)

98
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,500
I've read the project proposal.

99
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,180
Yes.

100
00:04:33,872 --> 00:04:35,700
Indeed, it's not the type
of project I want to do.

101
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,100
I understand, Mr. Wang.

102
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,180
I also know its IP value

103
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,900
is considered top-notch in the country.

104
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,780
But we have better opportunities
to collaborate later.

105
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:47,820
Okay.

106
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,780
Okay.

107
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,340
Thank you.

108
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,420
Bye, Mr. Wang.

109
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,140
You're here so early.

110
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,220
You're earlier.

111
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,820
Shall we order?

112
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,660
Sure.

113
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,380
Waiter.

114
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,460
Any dietary restrictions?

115
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,420
No.

116
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,340
You can order anything.

117
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,020
- Hello, sir.
- Okay.

118
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,420
Why don't you take a look

119
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,420
at what you like to eat?

120
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,820
No need. I'm not familiar
with this place. You order.

121
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:14,820
Alright.

122
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,500
Then I'll have the usual.

123
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,460
- Thank you.
- Sure.

124
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:23,700
About the copyright matter,
how have you been considering it?

125
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,900
Do you still want
to renew the contract with Time?

126
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,900
I really didn't expect

127
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,980
that I would have
such a difficult decision to make.

128
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,300
On one hand, there
is the internationally renowned director.

129
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,780
On the other, there
is the top domestic film company.

130
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,220
It really is...

131
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,420
A sweet dilemma.

132
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,580
To be honest,

133
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,500
it's quite sweet,

134
00:05:50,576 --> 00:05:51,780
but I'm not in a dilemma at all.

135
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,300
Does that mean

136
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,860
you've made a decision?

137
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,020
I told you last time.

138
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,940
I really like your novel.

139
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,180
Liking something

140
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,980
doesn't need so many reasons.

141
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,060
Sometimes, a feeling is enough.

142
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,700
(Don't ask me why I like you.)

143
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,540
You're handsome,

144
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,820
rich,

145
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,580
and not fickle.

146
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,540
So it's normal for me to like you.

147
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,660
Just because of this?

148
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,540
Of course, I never thought

149
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,340
to persuade you with lengthy arguments.

150
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:33,780
I'll respect your decision.

151
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,380
Mr. Lu.

152
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,020
I've made up my mind.

153
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,352
I won't renew the contract with Time.

154
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,740
After all, my novel has been with Time

155
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,780
for four years now

156
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,820
and still hasn't been filmed.

157
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,020
I have no idea
when it will happen if I keep waiting.

158
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,980
So I've decided

159
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:55,140
that once the copyright expires,
I'll sign with you.

160
00:06:55,568 --> 00:06:56,960
Looking forward to working with you.

161
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,460
You're not joking, right?

162
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,900
I'm not joking, of course.

163
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:03,460
Let me tell you.

164
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,420
Don't joke about this.

165
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,980
You can't go back on it
after we shake hands.

166
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,500
Rest assured.

167
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,020
I definitely won't go back on it.

168
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:11,180
I...

169
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:12,980
I can't.

170
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,700
I'm very happy.

171
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:13,980
Here.

172
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,940
Cheers.

173
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:21,008
I've already thought it through.

174
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,020
After our movie is released,

175
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,020
let's strive for an award.

176
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,760
Make that Tang Cu Yu regret it.
[*Sweet and sour fish]

177
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,140
Sweet and sour fish?

178
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,660
Tang Yu.

179
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,580
Your boss.

180
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,220
We were college classmates.

181
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,540
(Hello?)

182
00:07:39,952 --> 00:07:40,500
(Where are you?)

183
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,260
Coming.

184
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,540
Don't rush me.

185
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,180
Where?

186
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:44,980
Here.

187
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,060
Quick.

188
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,660
Start the car.

189
00:07:49,488 --> 00:07:50,580
Do you have to be like this?

190
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,980
Enough with the nonsense. Let's go.

191
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,300
Okay.

192
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,380
You make eating a meal
seem like something inappropriate.

193
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,780
You really hit the nail on the head.

194
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,420
My brother probably thinks that way.

195
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,980
If he misunderstands
that we're dating...

196
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,940
Do you have to be like this?

197
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,660
My brother won't tail me.

198
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,180
Why are you so afraid of my brother?

199
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,540
I'm not afraid.

200
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,300
My life principle

201
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,500
is that I'm not afraid of trouble,

202
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,020
but I also don't want to cause trouble.

203
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,180
By the way,

204
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,300
I wanted to ask you a question just now.

205
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,020
That...

206
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,032
That sweet and sour fish.

207
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,780
Back in college,

208
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,140
didn't he never have a girlfriend?

209
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,780
So why did he like to get jealous?

210
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:42,580
What?

211
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,340
He's not the type to be jealous.

212
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,780
He just...

213
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:47,648
He just really likes to eat vinegar.
[*To be jealous]

214
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,300
You see.

215
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,020
In college,

216
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,500
he would dip his buns in vinegar,

217
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,140
dip dumplings in vinegar,

218
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,180
and even when eating pizza,

219
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,700
he would replace the tomato sauce
with vinegar.

220
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,300
Isn't he a strange person?

221
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,580
And he always likes to experiment

222
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,900
with making dishes with a sour taste.

223
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,820
Like vinegar-sautéed shredded potatoes,

224
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,540
vinegar-sautéed Chinese cabbage,

225
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,340
and sweet and sour mandarin fish.

226
00:09:10,432 --> 00:09:11,580
During our four years in college,

227
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,900
- he fed us these sour dishes.
- Wait.

228
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,300
He's not a pregnant woman, but...

229
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,900
Sweet and sour mandarin fish?

230
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,660
When did he learn to make that?

231
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,860
It was in his fourth year of college.

232
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,940
He made it taste even better
than a restaurant's.

233
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,820
(Half a year ago)
First...

234
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,380
First, remove the scales
and gills from the fish.

235
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,260
Slit open the abdomen
and remove the innards.

236
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,220
Wash it thoroughly.

237
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,540
Slice diagonally from the pectoral fin
down the fish head.

238
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,260
From just below the chin,

239
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,890
follow its length
and make a longitudinal cut.

240
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,020
Use the flat side of the knife
to gently flatten it,

241
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:47,340
then cut flat slices along both sides
of the spine toward the tail.

242
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,540
Remove the spine

243
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,500
and the chest bones.

244
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:50,860
Done.

245
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:51,780
I've finished reciting.

246
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,780
Let's get started.

247
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,140
You're fast.

248
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:07,568
Sweet and sour mandarin fish.

249
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,380
It's done.

250
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,700
No wonder.

251
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,060
Actually, Tang Yu

252
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,580
is a bit

253
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,420
single-minded.

254
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,580
Just take the example

255
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,420
of him dancing.

256
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,500
Tang Yu can dance?

257
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,980
No, he can't dance,

258
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,220
but he's willing to learn.

259
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,740
Every night, he'd drag us

260
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,300
to practice until 3:00 a.m.

261
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,940
It was just a performance
for a cultural event.

262
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,660
But he acted like a male idol group
who was about to debut.

263
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,940
I really can't stand him, really.

264
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,020
He's just overly critical.

265
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,220
Making a mountain out of a molehill.

266
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,420
Here.

267
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,220
Does he dance badly?

268
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,100
No.

269
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,380
He dances quite well, actually.

270
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,060
Really?

271
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,540
So, according to what you're saying,

272
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,980
you can dance too.

273
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,660
- Me? I can't dance.
- Come on. Show me.

274
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,740
- No.
- Mr. Lu, come on.

275
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,300
Have a look.

276
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,060
Don't.

277
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,740
They're talking.

278
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,860
Let's go.

279
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,420
Let's go eat.

280
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,780
I'm inclined toward artistry,
where divergent thinking is prevalent.

281
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,300
Fine.

282
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:09,860
Yes.

283
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,820
Okay.

284
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,900
Enough about the dancing.

285
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,100
Let me tell you something

286
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,180
more outrageous.

287
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,620
During the college graduation exhibition,

288
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,900
Tang Yu

289
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,140
criticized my graduation work heavily.

290
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,500
He said

291
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:24,900
it was unrealistic,

292
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:27,180
out of touch with reality,

293
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,180
and incomprehensible.

294
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,980
He said such things,

295
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,180
and you didn't beat him up?

296
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,500
I did have that impulse at the time.

297
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,720
- But I held back.
- You can just...

298
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,180
Back then, the four of us spoiled him.

299
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,900
Spoiled him?

300
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,220
We're roommates, after all.

301
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,220
Come on.

302
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,380
Come on.

303
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,700
Let's drink.

304
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,100
Cheers.

305
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,860
(Screenwriting Department)

306
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,860
Did you hear?

307
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,780
Mr. Tang wants to renew the contract
for "A Dream for You".

308
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,224
The Copyright Department is negotiating.

309
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,620
Did Mr. Tang change his taste?

310
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,180
Is the company going to transform?

311
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,780
Bosses are always unpredictable.

312
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,460
Dan.

313
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,420
Are you interested?

314
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,180
I'm going to see Ms. Chen this afternoon

315
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,060
to recommend myself.

316
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,220
Since we're
developing "A Dream for You",

317
00:12:16,256 --> 00:12:17,860
I'm going to be the chief screenwriter.

318
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,300
After all, in terms of familiarity,

319
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,620
I'm second only to Miss Sugar Heart.

320
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,660
Then I'll be your assistant.

321
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:22,820
Thank you.

322
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:25,260
Tang Xin.

323
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,220
Mr. Du.

324
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,740
What's going on with you?

325
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,620
I told you to come to me

326
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,340
to talk about the contract renewal
when you arrive?

327
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,060
You're already here,

328
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,660
but why are you daydreaming?

329
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,820
I'm waiting for Ms. Chen

330
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,520
to discuss matters
about the drama team with her.

331
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,620
Give me a definite answer.

332
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,300
Do you want to sign or not?

333
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,100
Mr. Du.

334
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,020
Don't be anxious.

335
00:12:43,072 --> 00:12:45,220
Why are you looking for Tang Xin
about the copyright matter?

336
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,700
Tang Xin is the author
of "A Dream for You".

337
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,620
Ms. Chen took over the copyright

338
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,940
from Tang Xin.

339
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,220
You guys didn't know about this?

340
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,700
You're saying Tang Xin is...

341
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,780
Miss Sugar Heart?

342
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,260
That's right.

343
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,020
Tang Xin,
I've sent you several private messages.

344
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,180
I really like you.

345
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,980
So Tang Xin is really Tang Xin.
[*Sugar Heart]

346
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,020
I always thought it was a homonym.

347
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,340
I really didn't expect it.

348
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,180
Oh my God, I like you so much.

349
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,620
Tang Xin.

350
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,500
I've sent you several private messages.

351
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,540
By the way, Mr. Du,

352
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,260
please tell Mr. Tang

353
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,760
that I don't intend
to renew my contract with Time.

354
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,460
She won't sign?

355
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,100
She told Mr. Du

356
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,860
that she's in it for the money.

357
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,100
But compared to money,

358
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,500
she'd rather find someone

359
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,380
who understands her story to work with.

360
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,580
Has she found someone?

361
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,300
I don't know.

362
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,580
Go ask her.

363
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,420
Forget it.

364
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,380
Tell her

365
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,060
to come over.

366
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,540
I'll talk to her personally.

367
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,340
Don't hem and haw.

368
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,620
Just spit it out.

369
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,860
Actually, Miss Tang said something.

370
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,540
She said

371
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,700
she has already found

372
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,100
a boss to make a movie for her.

373
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,860
So she won't trouble you anymore.

374
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,820
Who is that person?

375
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,940
I don't know.

376
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,300
Go.

377
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,700
Inform the Screenwriting Department
to have a meeting.

378
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,500
You should look at the time now.

379
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,940
You work hard, ignoring everything,

380
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,008
and you want the whole company
to work overtime with you?

381
00:14:17,392 --> 00:14:18,432
It's time to go off work.

382
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,460
You go home first.

383
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,900
Tomorrow at 10:00 a.m.,

384
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,380
the entire Screenwriting Department
will have a meeting.

385
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,420
Understood.

386
00:14:30,608 --> 00:14:32,580
Why did you look for me
instead of leaving after work?

387
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,740
I came to see you.

388
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,100
Don't always look troubled
about work matters.

389
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:41,860
Let me tell you some gossip.

390
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,420
I'm not interested.

391
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,860
Yesterday, while I was having dinner,

392
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:47,300
I ran into Tang Xin,

393
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,780
Guess

394
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,100
who she was having dinner with?

395
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,620
Lu Zhixing.

396
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,580
Our college classmate.

397
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,700
Isn't it strange?

398
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,420
Do you know what they talked about?

399
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,900
I don't know about that.

400
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,660
But the place they chose yesterday

401
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,780
was a private kitchen.

402
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,100
And it's not cheap.

403
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,620
Elegant environment
and romantic atmosphere.

404
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,740
It was filled
with an ambiguous atmosphere.

405
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,060
There,

406
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,220
you can see the stars when you look up

407
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,020
and the sea when you lower your head.

408
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,540
They picked the seat with the best view.

409
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,860
Could it just be a casual dinner?

410
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,780
Some things

411
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,420
might not be what they seem.

412
00:15:23,424 --> 00:15:25,300
Besides, you don't know
what they were talking about.

413
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,460
So don't spread rumors.

414
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,580
I'm not spreading rumors.
I really saw it.

415
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,700
They were having dinner there.

416
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,024
If you don't believe me, ask Dingding.

417
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,220
Dingding?

418
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,820
So you had dinner with Dingding

419
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,060
in a place with an elegant environment
and romantic atmosphere,

420
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:45,500
filled with an ambiguous atmosphere?

421
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,980
I...

422
00:15:49,968 --> 00:15:51,376
I have something to do. I'm leaving.

423
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,500
Not a single one is reassuring.

424
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,180
(Thank you, Mr. Tang,
for your attention to my novel.)

425
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,980
(But you don't need
to feel indebted to me.)

426
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,420
(Isn't this giving myself away?)

427
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,260
(He didn't say he feels indebted.)

428
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,780
I heard that you are Miss Sugar Heart.

429
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,980
Seriously?

430
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,540
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

431
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,180
You hid it too well.

432
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,980
When I joined Time,
I wanted to start over as a screenwriter.

433
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,180
Being a web novel author
doesn't seem that important.

434
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,256
But thanks to Ms. Chen
for keeping it confidential for me.

435
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,060
You know,

436
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,580
now that I look at you,

437
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,140
it feels like I have a super big star
who's been hiding around me all this time.

438
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,100
From this moment on,

439
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,740
I'm your die-hard fan.

440
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,980
After so many years,
she only has one work.

441
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,416
She can't really be considered
a big star.

442
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,140
I didn't know about some things before,

443
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,980
but now that I know, let me advise you.

444
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,180
Leave the copyright with Time.

445
00:16:53,536 --> 00:16:55,100
This industry
is full of wolves and snakes.

446
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,220
If you find a small workshop

447
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,260
with a small producer,

448
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,340
your only work
will be completely ruined.

449
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,900
Don't be angry.

450
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,420
I think she's just jealous of you.

451
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,580
I don't mind.

452
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,540
Let's go home.

453
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,300
Let's celebrate.

454
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,220
What do you want to eat tonight?

455
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,100
Let's have Sichuan cuisine.

456
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,980
I give up.

457
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,500
Are you trying to kill me?

458
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,220
I really just wanted

459
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,740
to celebrate Dingding
completing her credits.

460
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:48,720
It's not a crime
punishable by death, right?

461
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,540
You're acting strange.

462
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,860
I just had a meal with Dingding.

463
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,860
Do you have to hit me like this?

464
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,460
Didn't I tell you before?

465
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,900
Stay away from Tang Dingding.

466
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,980
I'm only

467
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,780
this brave.

468
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,860
I'm not brave enough to mess
with your precious sister.

469
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,660
I think

470
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,792
you want to use this as an excuse
to vent your frustration.

471
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,780
Vent my frustration?

472
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,620
What am I venting?

473
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,740
Is it because of Tang Xin?

474
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,780
What's going on
between you and Tang Xin?

475
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,220
Something seems strange between you two.

476
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,500
Am I right?

477
00:18:34,432 --> 00:18:35,460
I hit the nail on the head.

478
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,060
(Mr. Du)
(Miss Tang, about the copyright matter,)

479
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,980
(Mr. Du)
(please reconsider it.)

480
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,020
(The contract
of "A Dream for You" with Time)

481
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,220
(will expire soon.)

482
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,100
(I won't renew with Mr. Tang anymore.)

483
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,820
(I'm considering giving it
to Mr. Lu for filming.)

484
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,260
(Mr. Lu? Which Mr. Lu?)

485
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,700
(Lu Jingcheng from Zhongce,
or the director Lu Zhixing?)

486
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,300
(Is it really going to be filmed?
Regardless of which boss it is,)

487
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,700
(as long as the film turns out good,
they're a good boss.)

488
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,300
Xin, tell me quickly.

489
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,300
Who is Mr. Lu?

490
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,220
Take a guess.

491
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,340
Just tell me.

492
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:27,940
I don't know.

493
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,140
Did Tang Xin

494
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,900
receive some reliable offers?

495
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,740
She's just playing mind games.

496
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,300
So much drama.

497
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,900
I'm really curious.

498
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,620
Who's Mr. Lu?

499
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,140
You don't know

500
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,500
how amazing your fans on Weibo are.

501
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,780
In just one night,

502
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,140
they went through the film companies,

503
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,220
producers, and directors.

504
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,380
As long as their last name is Lu,
they've checked them all.

505
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,460
They even created a spreadsheet

506
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,300
and analyzed one by one

507
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,100
who the real Mr. Lu was.

508
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,380
Do I have so many fans?

509
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,180
Why don't I know?

510
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,060
They're not all fans either.

511
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,060
A few entertainment influencers
also reposted.

512
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,780
Anyway, Weibo has already exploded.

513
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,780
Everyone is discussing.

514
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:06,900
Just tell me.

515
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,340
I want to know who Mr. Lu is.

516
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,140
I won't tell you.

517
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:09,980
I...

518
00:20:11,024 --> 00:20:11,740
Morning, everyone.

519
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,220
Morning, Mr. Tang.

520
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:13,820
Mr. Tang.

521
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,020
Please sit.

522
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,260
I believe everyone has heard

523
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,580
that we successfully
secured the rights to "The Beginning".

524
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,540
This is a well-founded

525
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:29,260
and timely anti-fraud-themed novel.

526
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,020
If anyone here is interested

527
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,140
in taking charge,

528
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,140
you can volunteer.

529
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,300
Tang Xin.

530
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,140
This is such a good project.

531
00:20:49,616 --> 00:20:50,620
Don't you want to take charge?

532
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,740
Me?

533
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,460
I'll pass.

534
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,700
I haven't been in the company for long,

535
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,220
and I found many areas

536
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,620
that I need to learn

537
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,140
during my time with "White Dew" team.

538
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,540
This is such a good project.

539
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,740
I won't get involved.

540
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,780
Get involved?

541
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,780
Is this the work attitude
of your department?

542
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,660
Mr. Tang.

543
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,300
I'm just being honest.

544
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,900
It doesn't concern other colleagues, right?

545
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,700
Everyone seems quite enthusiastic.

546
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,940
Just because I didn't volunteer,

547
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,020
you questioned the whole team.

548
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,900
I don't think that's right.

549
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:35,860
Besides,

550
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,420
my issue is about capability,

551
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,580
not attitude.

552
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,020
You need to distinguish that clearly.

553
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,700
Alright.

554
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:44,780
Those who are interested

555
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,260
can submit your proposals

556
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,660
to Ms. Chen for compilation.

557
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,640
We'll choose based on merit.

558
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,060
Meeting adjourned.

559
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,460
Tang Xin.

560
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,260
Come to my office.

561
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,140
Is Tang Xin that capable?

562
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,540
Mr. Tang singled her out

563
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,820
and called her to the office.

564
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,780
If he's so biased,
just give her the project.

565
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,140
Why go through the formalities?

566
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,700
Could it be related to
last night's Weibo post?

567
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,460
That doesn't matter.

568
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,060
She didn't show Mr. Tang any respect.

569
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,380
Why must she mention

570
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,500
some Mr. Lu?

571
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,420
Keep talking.

572
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,860
She'll be fired sooner or later.

573
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,060
Do your work.

574
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:32,980
Go.

575
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,660
Mr. Gao.

576
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,460
You look quite nice with glasses.

577
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,540
Have a seat.

578
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,460
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

579
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,460
I've said before

580
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,060
that if your novel's rights
are placed with Time,

581
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,460
it will be adapted and filmed.

582
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,900
Why don't you want to renew?

583
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,740
But it has been here

584
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,900
for four years.

585
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,460
That was before.

586
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,540
Now, Time has plans for it.

587
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,820
Mr. Tang.

588
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,180
I think you seem to be forcing yourself.

589
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,820
I know what type of script
you like to film.

590
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,700
My rights have been stored
with Time for so many years.

591
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,820
Maybe it's because it's not suitable.

592
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,460
So it hasn't been filmed.

593
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,220
Just like me and you.

594
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,980
If people aren't suitable,

595
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,380
you won't
appreciate their things either.

596
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,100
Tang Xin.

597
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,900
I've never said

598
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,300
that I don't appreciate your work.

599
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,940
Of course, I've never...

600
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:05,180
I've never been unappreciative
of you either.

601
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,860
Sometimes, being unsuitable

602
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,020
is different

603
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,700
from being unappreciative.

604
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,900
I've tried.

605
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,500
I have no regrets now.

606
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,580
Anyway, it's my book.

607
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,980
When the copyright expires,

608
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,820
I'll sign it over to whoever I like.

609
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,100
Before,

610
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,100
Time didn't have "The Beginning".

611
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,900
I did feel that at that time,

612
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,380
if I went all out

613
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,340
to develop "A Dream for You",
it would be risky.

614
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,020
But now it's different.

615
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,940
- Time has "The Beginning"...
- Mr. Tang.

616
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:50,300
You don't have to explain
so patiently to me.

617
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,180
Regardless of the reason,

618
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,180
the result is the same.

619
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,660
Is it because I rejected you?

620
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,460
Do you think you can reject me?

621
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:18,860
Alright.

622
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,460
If there's nothing else,
I'll leave first.

623
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:23,860
Wait a moment.

624
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,500
What is it?

625
00:25:30,144 --> 00:25:31,500
Who did you sell the copyright to?

626
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,540
It won't be worse than you.

627
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:34,580
Why are you asking so much?

628
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:36,656
From now on,
it has nothing to do with you.

629
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:37,780
Goodbye, Mr. Tang.

630
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,100
Mr. Gao.

631
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:49,940
Mr. Tang.

632
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,540
Help me find out

633
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,620
who the copyright was sold to.

634
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,220
It...

635
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:02,220
I heard it was sold
to someone surnamed Lu.

636
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:02,980
Who?

637
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,980
Miss Tang posted on Weibo yesterday

638
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,260
saying she's going to sign the copyright

639
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,620
to Mr. Lu.

640
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,580
Mr. Tang.

641
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,620
You should check this.

642
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,600
(Today's hot topic: Who Is Mr. Lu)

643
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,660
Netizens say this Mr. Lu

644
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:24,820
refers to Lu Jingcheng of Zhongce.

645
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,700
Mr. Tang.

646
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,740
I'll check it again.

647
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,660
No need.

648
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,580
Take a look at this.

649
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,860
(The Mr. Lu)

650
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,540
(Lu Zhixing)
(that Sugar Heart mentioned)

651
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,340
(is probably me.)

652
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,380
It's

653
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,520
Mr. Lu, the director?

654
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,780
Tang Xin, you're really amazing.

655
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,340
You're practically my idol.

656
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,860
It's Lu Zhixing, right?

657
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,860
Can you be a bit low-key?

658
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,700
Tell me.

659
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,340
Alright.

660
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:07,264
She really found someone influential.

661
00:27:07,264 --> 00:27:08,020
Tell me after work.

662
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,420
Fine.

663
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:08,860
But you,

664
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:09,740
be quiet for a moment.

665
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,900
Everyone is working.

666
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,140
Sure.

667
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,500
(The Mr. Lu
that Sugar Heart mentioned is me?)

668
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,300
(What a tactical response.)

669
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,140
(I'm really excited.)

670
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,540
(This is wonderful.)

671
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,904
(Waiting for the official announcement.)

672
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:29,940
(So,)

673
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,820
(is Mr. Lu is filming "A Dream for You"?)

674
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,340
(The director Mr. Lu stood out)

675
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,260
(from dozens of Mr. Lu's.)

676
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,460
(Impressive!)

677
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,500
(Looking forward to the movie.)

678
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,020
(Didn't you guys notice)

679
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:41,340
(that line Sugar Heart said,
"I won't renew with Mr. Tang anymore.")

680
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,660
(is quite heartbreaking?)

681
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,100
Hello, Mr. Lu.

682
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,380
Why don't you follow me back on Weibo?

683
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,580
Wait a moment.

684
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,660
(Lu Zhixing, Follow)

685
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,020
Done.

686
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,220
I've followed you.

687
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,500
You won't mind about my post, right?

688
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,740
(I didn't expect to trend.)

689
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,220
It's okay.

690
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,420
This is also a good thing for me.

691
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:08,740
Okay.

692
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,860
Now that it's official,

693
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,100
let's find a time to discuss the details
of the contract.

694
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,700
Okay.

695
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:15,020
I'm available anytime.

696
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,900
What's wrong?

697
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,740
Mr. Tang.

698
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,460
You look melancholic and agitated.

699
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,300
People will laugh at you
when they see you.

700
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:30,900
Quit it.

701
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,300
Did you have another argument
with Tang Xin?

702
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:37,620
But

703
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,100
she seems to be planning

704
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,660
to make a movie with Lu Zhixing?

705
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:55,980
Mr. Tang.

706
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,100
Hello, Mr. Huo.

707
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,220
Hello, Sugar Heart.

708
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,580
I'll leave now, Mr. Huo.

709
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:09,860
Go ahead.

710
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,940
These two have clashed.

711
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,380
It's going to be interesting.

712
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:54,980
(Hello, Yu.)

713
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,020
What's up?

714
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,140
I saw the trending list.

715
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,180
What's going on
between you and Tang Xin?

716
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,380
Nothing much.

717
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,780
I guess

718
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,340
maybe you didn't give her enough money.

719
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,180
Should I

720
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,460
(let her push me to buy more clothes?)

721
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,100
It's not about money

722
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,740
between Tang Xin and me.

723
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,740
Then why?

724
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,540
If there's nothing else,

725
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,220
I'll hang up.

726
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,140
(I know what type of script
you like to film.)

727
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,980
(My rights have been stored
with Time for so many years.)

728
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,140
(Maybe it's because it's not suitable.)

729
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,740
(So it hasn't been filmed.)

730
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,660
Just like me and you.

731
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,380
If people aren't suitable,

732
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:42,832
you won't
appreciate their things either.

Do you know

764
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,180
that after you reposted my post,

765
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,620
"A Dream for You"
started printing again.

766
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,580
Really?

767
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,220
Isn't that a good thing?

768
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,260
I just feel it's not very real.

769
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,340
I heard that Time is currently

770
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,620
interested in renewing the contract
at a higher price and filming.

771
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,180
Aren't you moved at all?

772
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,300
You're so sincere.

773
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,660
If I don't seize the opportunity,

774
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,540
won't I be foolish?

775
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,780
It seems that I am still a talent scout.

776
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,460
Speak up.

777
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,820
What is your ideal copyright price?

778
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,500
I think

779
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:32,220
let's go with the price
Time bought it for last time.

780
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,980
Are you sure?

781
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,620
The copyright price is rising now.

782
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,420
And your book is a bestseller.

783
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,140
Once you sign, there's no turning back.

784
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,060
How about I add a bit more?

785
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,180
How about this?

786
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:53,100
I'll prepare a contract
and send it to you for review.

787
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,020
Once it expires,

788
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,180
if you find the price suitable,

789
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,100
we'll sign the contract.

790
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,860
Besides the price,

791
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,300
I can assure you

792
00:33:59,344 --> 00:34:00,990
that we will start filming
next year for sure.

793
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,300
Alright.

794
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:04,820
Let's eat.

795
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:05,940
By the way,

796
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,660
Mr. Lu.

797
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,740
Take a look at this first.

798
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,380
(Adaptation and Elaboration
of "A Dream for You")

799
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,100
What's this?

800
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:14,980
These are some of my adaptation ideas.

801
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,980
After talking with Professor Feng
last time,

802
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,740
I made some modifications

803
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,060
to the version you saw.

804
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,780
I don't know

805
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,220
if it will help the project.

806
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:30,820
Not bad.

807
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,980
The modifications are quite accurate.

808
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,780
This is a qualitative leap
compared to the last time.

809
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,700
Tang Xin.

810
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,700
In the future, if you have time,

811
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,060
you can summarize more ideas for me.

812
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,780
I really need them.

813
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:44,820
Really?

814
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:45,660
Of course.

815
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,940
I'm not good at flattering others.

816
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,860
Alright, Mr. Lu.

817
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,220
From now on, my son

818
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,340
will be in your hands.

819
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,100
No problem.

820
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:53,940
Here.

821
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,660
Let's celebrate in advance

822
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:56,780
for a smooth contract signing.

823
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:57,740
Smooth contract signing.

824
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,220
Mr. Tang, this way.

825
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,020
Did you drive?

826
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,220
My car is parked downstairs.

827
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:08,980
Alright.

828
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,420
What a coincidence.

829
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:15,780
Yes.

830
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,008
Are you also here for dinner?

831
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,660
Long time no see.

832
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,380
Old classmate.

833
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,420
It hasn't been that long.

834
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,260
Didn't we just meet
at the charity banquet?

835
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,620
You're indeed forgetful, Mr. Lu.

836
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,060
Yes, indeed.

837
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,220
My brain capacity is limited.

838
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,940
I can only
remember some important things.

839
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:35,420
Such as the expiration date
of "A Dream for You".

840
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,860
I remember it clearer than Mr. Tang.

841
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,780
Before it expires,

842
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,780
the project is still Time's.

843
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,340
And the person

844
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,020
is also Time's.

845
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,860
Openly poaching

846
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:52,580
is not decent.

847
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,940
We're just having a casual meal
as friends.

848
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,140
Why is it not decent?

849
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,020
Or is it because

850
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,380
you have a big family and business,

851
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,060
so you became petty,

852
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,860
caring even about employees
having dinner after work?

853
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,020
It's about time. I should leave now.

854
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,860
If you want to have a reunion,

855
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:21,580
please go ahead.

856
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,620
Did you drive, Miss Tang?

857
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,420
I'll leave first, Mr. Gao.

858
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,020
Take care.

859
00:36:27,056 --> 00:36:27,980
Mr. Lu, I'm leaving first.

860
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:28,820

861

864
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,300
(Tang Yu, I'm in my rebellious phase.)

865
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,220
(I don't want to talk to you.)

866
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,580
No need to see me out.

867
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,140
Even if you did, it would be awkward.

868
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,140
Bye.

869
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:02,860
Mr. Tang.

870
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,820
Mr. Liu has arrived.
Let's go to the private room.

871
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:05,380
This way.

872
00:37:11,024 --> 00:37:12,300
(I won't renew with Mr. Tang anymore.)

873
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,512
(I'm considering giving it
to Mr. Lu for filming.)

874
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,820
(Anyway, it's my book.)

875
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,620
(When the copyright expires,)

876
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,380
I'll sign it over to whoever I like.

877
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,780
You don't have to explain
so patiently to me.

878
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,820
Regardless of the reason,

879
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,860
the result is the same.

880
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,900
Is it because I rejected you?

881
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,060
Do you think you can reject me?

882
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,500
(Did you drive, Miss Tang?)

883
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,620
Mr. Lu, I'm leaving first.

884
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,060

- Take care.

Let me tell you.

898
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,140
I have good news.

899
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,740
A great news.

900
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,500
Today, I had nothing to do,
so I wandered around the park.

901
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:45,540
Guess what happened?

902
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,140
There's a blind date corner in the park.

903
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,220
(Many men and women)

904
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,780
(are finding matches
for their children.)

905
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,900
Lady. Come here.

906
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,860
Look at the information.

907
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,220
Dad.

908
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,088
You wouldn't be forcing me to
go on blind dates like Mom did, would you?

909
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,140
Xin.

910
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,420
Why are you not in a good mood?

911
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,620
What happened?

912
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,620
Did someone bully you?

913
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,820
It's nothing.

914
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,420
Just encountered some issues at work.

915
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,420
So I'm a bit upset.

916
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,500
Lady, I'm sorry.

917
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,340
I'll talk to you later.

918
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,780

to work anymore,

924
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,380

00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,340
Can you support me for a lifetime?

927
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,980
(Why can't I?)

928
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,140
(Your mom and I
are still young and capable.)

929
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,740
(Supporting you)

930
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,300
(is absolutely not a problem.)

931
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,140
Also,

932
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,620
if one day,

933
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,780
when we're old

934
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,620
and passed away,

935
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,780
you still have our house

936
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,620
(and savings.)

937
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,260
(It's enough for you to live well.)

938
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,740
Dad.

939
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,900
I'm not a child anymore.
I can handle it.

940
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,740
Besides,

941
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,320
why do you want to support me?
I'm the one who wants to support you.

942
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,460
Wait a couple of years
until I'm successful,

943
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,620
I'll make sure you and Mom

944
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,900
have a comfortable retirement.

945
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,620
You're indeed my daughter,

946
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,780
wanting the best for us.

947
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,500
Alright.

948
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,540
I won't say anything more.

949
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,460
Keep a good mood.

950
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:20,380
(I'll hang up first.)

951
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,540
Bye.

952
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:30,900
(Right.)

953
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,540
(Relationship is nothing.)

954
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,460
(I'm still young,)

955
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,300
(so I should focus on my career.)

956
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,220
(I have to make my parents
live in a big villa soon.)

957
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,820
Have you guys noticed?

958
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,020
It's been a long time

959
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,940
since Tang Xin last came to find Mr. Tang.

960
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,980
Do you think

961
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,260
they fell out?

962
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,060
I think so.

963
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,660
Before, I always felt like

964
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,420
I could see her coming over
every few days.

965
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,260
Now,

966
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:20,980
it seems

967
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,820
it's been more than half a month
since I saw her.

968
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,340
Not half a month yet.

969
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,460
Didn't she come over
for a meeting a few days ago?

970
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,500
I remember now.

971
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,060
It was more than half a month ago.

972
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,100
Do you guys remember?

973
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,060
She came over to see Mr. Tang
on her own that day.

974
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,380
Since that day,

975
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,260
I've hardly seen her

976
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,860
coming over to see Mr. Tang.

977
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,620
Really?

978
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,420
Right.

979
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,140
Isn't Tang Xin calling someone else

980
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,380
her boss on Weibo?

981
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,860
She's not renewing the copyright either.

982
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,900
If I were Mr. Tang, I would be angry.

983
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,140
I also heard

984
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:49,020
that Mr. Tang asked Tang Xin
to help him pursue a girl.

985
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,020
Apparently, it's Tang Xin's best friend.

986
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,140
Speaking of which,

987
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,380
do you know what the two

988
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,140
most complex relationships
in this world are?

989
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:57,860
What are they?

990
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,380
What are they?

991
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:01,860
Mr. Tang.

992
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,780
There's one crucial step.

993
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,860
Flour.

994
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,940
This is really important.

995
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,460
You definitely won't be able to handle it.

996
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,220
I need to take care of it.

997
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:33,580
This...

998
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:40,900
Um...

999
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,100
I'm so...

1000
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:42,860
Don't move.

1001
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:43,940
I'll do it myself.

1002
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,100
What are you doing?

1003
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,220
You have flour on your face.

1004
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:53,980
See for yourself.

1005
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,660
Look.

1006
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,300
Right?

1007
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:56,980
