usually come with a cost.)

(Sometimes, I'm grateful to you,
Tang Yu.)

26
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,860
There's also a fifth option.

27
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,340
The male and female leads

28
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,900
don't reunite in a fantasy world.

29
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,900
Instead, it happens

30
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,740
on a speeding train in the real world.

31
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:08,220
Due to amnesia, the male lead
can't communicate,

32
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,140
so the female lead enters his dreams.

33
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:11,980
How

34
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,740
does that sound?

35
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,380
It still
doesn't sit quite right with me.

36
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,580
If we change the major setting

37
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,220
of the fantasy world,

38
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,150
the entire atmosphere of the film
will change.

39
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,900
What do you think, Mr. Lu?

40
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:30,700
Moreover,

41
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,020
even if we
alter some similar elements now,

42
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,740
the label of plagiarism will stick.

43
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,260
Let's put the plagiarism issue
aside for now.

44
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,380
Let's just focus

45
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,540
on whether Tang Xin's
new setting is feasible.

46
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,100
Alright.

47
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:49,780
How about this?

48
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,900
Let's take a ten-minute break

49
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,660
and continue later.

50
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:53,860
Sure.

51
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:05,820
Are you

52
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,060
feeling too much pressure?

53
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,820
Sorry, Mr. Lu.

54
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,140
I'm

55
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,180
not in the best condition.

56
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:12,860
Don't worry.

57
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,300
The current situation

58
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,100
is not something you can control.

59
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,460
How about this?

60
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,780
You

61
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,180
should take a break.

62
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,100
Go somewhere to clear your mind.

63
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,540
Sure.

64
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,700
Thanks, Mr. Lu.

65
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,180
No worries.

(Bili Hills 8)

67
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:45,980
She's here.

68
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,260
She's here.

69
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,460
Tang Xin.

70
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,300
Mom, Dad.

71
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,100
Honey.

72
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,100
Mom.

73
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,540
Why are you back all of a sudden?

74
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,700
Weren't you busy?

75
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,380
Remember that man,

76
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,980
the one who caused your heartbreak?

77
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,580
Are you still talking to him?

78
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,700
Alright. That's enough.

79
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,580
This is her home.

80
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,300
She can come back whenever she wants to.

81
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:08,340
Am I right?

82
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,460
Come on.

83
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,460
Let's go home.

84
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,310
- I prepared a lavish meal for you.
- Really?

85
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,150
- What?
- Yes.

86
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,940
It's been so long
since I had a home-cooked meal.

87
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,900
I feel like I've gained weight.

88
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,620
My cooking is great, isn't it?

89
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,140
They're tasty, aren't they?

90
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,340
(Tang Yu:
I heard that you went home)

91
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,450
(for a break. Rest well.)

92
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,060
(I'll handle everything else.)

93
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,380
Xin.

94
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,460
Let me show you something.

95
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,020
Come on.

96
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,900
What is it?

97
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,620
Tang Dawei.

98
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,220
What are you looking for?

99
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,980
Are you hiding secret money?

100
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,380
I'm telling you.

101
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,380
I won't keep your secret.

102
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,780
You better be honest with Mom.

103
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,300
Go.

104
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,220
I found it.

105
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,500
Have a look.

106
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,120
("A Dream For You" by Sugar Heart)

107
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,540
What are these?

108
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,540
("A Dream For You" by Sugar Heart)

109
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,620
(I read my daughter's book
for the first time.)

110
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,820
(350 thousand characters.)

111
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,900
(Xin is amazing.)

112
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,060
(In my whole life,
not to mention writing,)

113
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,220
(I've never even read so many words.)

114
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,980
(I read until page 12,)

115
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,740
(but I couldn't understand,)

116
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,820
(so I called my daughter.)

117
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,140
(She told me it was a fantasy novel.)

118
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,020
(I read until page 78 yesterday,)

119
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,300
(but it was late,)

120
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,620
(so I went to bed.)

121
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,020
(I actually entered the world)

122
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,820
(she wrote about in my dream.)

123
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,900
(I looked around,)

124
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,740
(but I guess)

125
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,180
(my imagination wasn't as rich as hers.)

126
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,180
(The places I went to must not
be as well-written as hers.)

127
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,860
(This is the second time
I've read her book.)

128
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,820
(It took me two days)

129
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,540
(to flip the book open
for the third time.)

130
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,900
(I read it again.)

131
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,420
(My wife said)

132
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,980
(that this would be my only bedside book)

133
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,820
(because I just couldn't finish it)

134
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,580
(even after multiple reads.)

135
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:33,940
Dad.

136
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,180
What have you been doing?

137
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,740
Your handwriting is terrible too.

138
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,300
How can it be the same?

139
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,260
This is a book written by my daughter.

140
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,820
I wasn't well-educated,

141
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,420
but my daughter is a great writer.

142
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,820
If I don't study carefully
and make up for it,

143
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,860
how can I brag to people?

144
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,700
What do you mean by "a great writer"?

145
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,500
That's nonsense.

146
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:04,980
What are you saying?

147
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,020
You, my daughter,

148
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,780
are greater than any

149
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,140
of the renowned writers out there.

150
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,620
Even I,

151
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,740
as an uneducated person,

152
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,300
read your novel

153
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,780
multiple times.

154
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,500
What does that mean?

155
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,860
It means you must be greater
than others.

156
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,260
Xin.

157
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,980
Your mom and I

158
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,860
read the news online.

159
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,780
Did you...

160
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:39,100
Did you read the news on Weibo?

161
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,660
Of course.

162
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,380
Everyday, we will post something

163
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,660
in your Super Topic.

164
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,460
Did you know that I

165
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,100
ranked first over 300 times?

166
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,140
What have you been doing?

167
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,260
Why would you do these

168
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,740
at your age?

169
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,060
Don't cry, alright?

170
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,140
You're a big girl now.

171
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,380
Aren't you embarrassed?

172
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,260
Of course, not.

173
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,420
What do you mean "big girl"?

174
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,020
I will be your little princess forever.

175
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:13,980
Right.

176
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,420
My little princess.

177
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,540
Both your mom and I

178
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,260
believe that you didn't plagiarize.

179
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,260
Besides,

180
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,060
I also believe

181
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,100
that you won't doubt yourself

182
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,250
because of what others say.

183
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,180
Right?

184
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,860
Dad.

185
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,980
Alright. No more crying, okay?

186
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,300
Hello?

187
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,660
Hey, Tang Xin.

188
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,580
Why didn't you answer my calls?

189
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,900
Did you check Weibo?

190
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,020
I was chatting with my parents
last night.

191
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,940
What happened?

192
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,300
Check Weibo now.

193
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,660
(My brother issued a directive.)

194
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,380
(Tang Yu: Plagiarism accusations)

195
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:35,260
(against "A Dream For You"
are all false statements.)

196
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,650
(My team will support the author
in protecting their rights.)

197
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,700
(We reserve the right
to pursue legal action)

198
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,100
(against rumor spreaders.)

199
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,540
(Seems like my brother
is taking a tough stance this time.)

200
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:45,700
Tang Xin.

201
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,100
You should come back soon.

202
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,380
When will you be back?

203
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,020
Dingding.

204
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,220
I'll be back this afternoon.

205
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,700
Coming.

206
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,940
You're back so soon.

207
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,580
Any drinks for you?

208
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,140
No, thanks.

209
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,340
I'm not here for a visit.

210
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,020
Tang Yu.

211
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,780
Why did you issue a directive

212
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,460
under such circumstances?

213
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,300
Are you worried about me?

214
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,380
I did it for you,

215
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,780
but not entirely for you.

216
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,500
I believe in you,

217
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,940
so I want the whole world

218
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,420
to know that I believe in you.

219
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,780
But the decision to invest

220
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,180
and whether I want to pursue you

221
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,740
are not directly related.

222
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,460
I did it in the perspective

223
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,860
of an investor and a producer.

224
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,620
I believe that this project

225
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,380
can generate income for Time.

226
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,300
That's it.

227
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,540
I misunderstood you then.

228
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,900
I thought it was because...

229
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,020
Because of what?

230
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,500
I wanted to make you happy,

231
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,140
but I wouldn't do it in this way.

232
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,660
You worked hard for "A Dream for You".

233
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,900
I wouldn't act recklessly.

234
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,300
What if you lost money...

235
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,220
Relax.

236
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,540
There's nothing to worry about.

237
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,740
If you're really worried,

238
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,180
just focus on writing the script.

239
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,420
Get the content right,

240
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,460
and leave the rest to me.

241
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,460
Why the hurry to see me?

242
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,260
Your brother has already
investigated those sock puppets.

243
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,580
The act of hiring sock puppets
is wrongful.

244
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,180
Can we use this

245
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,220
as evidence to sue them?

246
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,700
I see.

247
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,500
So, you want

248
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,540
to confront those sock puppets directly.

249
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,300
Right?

250
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,420
You're right.

251
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,060
Why should we allow them
to defame us like this?

252
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,180
Who do they think they are?

253
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:38,900
How about this?

254
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,180
Let's eat first.

255
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:40,860
Okay.

256
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,980
We'll discuss it later.

257
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,340
Let's go with this plan.

258
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,140
Okay.

259
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,820
Mr. Tang.
Here's the draft for the lawyer letter.

260
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,380
Have a look.

261
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,740
The wording is not precise,

262
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,100
and the tone needs to be firmer.

263
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,060
Revise it.

264
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,750
Sure, I'll get legal
to fix it right away.

265
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,940
Mr. Tang, Lawyer Zhang is calling.

266
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,540
Hello?

267
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,060
What's wrong?

268
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,540
Your brother found out about our dinner?

269
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,260
My brother just

270
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,980
sued all the marketing accounts

271
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,500
on behalf of Time Pictures.

272
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,020
Let me see it.

273
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,860
Your brother acts fast.

274
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,660
This is worth celebrating.

275
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,660
Let's eat.

276
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,780
Try this.

277
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,760
(Lu Studio)

278
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,860
Mr. Lu.

279
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,860
These are...

280
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,740
Your homework.

281
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,500
Read them through within a month

282
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,590
and write down your thoughts.
I'll check them.

283
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,780
All these?

284
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,540
I need to read all of them?

285
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,500
Any problems?

286
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,340
No problem.

287
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,580
No problem.

288
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,340
This is scarier than the assignments
in the final year of high school.

289
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,580
These books, stacked up,

290
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:41,340
are higher
than half the length of a door.

291
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:45,220
If anyone claims
being an actor has no barriers,

292
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,340
I'll be the first to call them out.

293
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,700
Mr. Lu.

294
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,260
I wasn't talking about you.

295
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,050
Don't take it wrong.

296
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,140
I will study hard and take it seriously

297
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,260
like how
I treated the college entrance exam.

298
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,180
No, even more seriously than that.

299
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,780
Remember what you said.

300
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,520
Don't forget to take the books with you.

301
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,260
Okay.

302
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:12,940
Mr. Lu.

303
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,900
You're leaving?

304
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,340
Yeah.

305
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,300
There are a lot of books here. You see.

306
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,780
I'll get you two bags.

307
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:25,620
Great.

308
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,140
Here.

309
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,460
Thanks.

310
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,500
That's all right.

311
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,100
Mr. Lu.

312
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,580
Can you give me a ride later?

313
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:35,220
Sure.

314
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,620
I was planning to take you anyway.

315
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,660
Otherwise, how would you

316
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,010
carry all these books by yourself?

317
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,820
I can drop you off directly at Time.

318
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,540
I have a meeting
with your brother later.

319
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,540
I'll pass if you're going

320
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,980
to my brother's company.

321
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,380
He's been incredibly busy lately.

322
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,140
I'll pass this time.

323
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,820
Are you sure

324
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,780
you don't want a ride?

325
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:56,940
No need.

326
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,700
Alright.

327
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,940
I'll walk you out.

328
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,100
Is that okay?

329
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,380
Thank you.

330
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:04,980
You're welcome.

331
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:05,660
Let's go.

332
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,340
We're done dealing
with the marketing accounts now.

333
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,540
We can focus the work

334
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,140
on content development.

335
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,220
We have to speed it up though.

336
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,420
I think our pace

337
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,860
is good at the moment.

338
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,680
Mr. Tang,
you suddenly mentioned speeding up.

339
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,780
Is there any concern you have?

340
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,090
I trust you two when it comes

341
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,540
to content creation.

342
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,140
But there's one thing.

343
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,580
The pace
of Dajiang's "A Thought Three Lifetimes"

344
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,500
is faster than ours.

345
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,820
The core plots
of the two projects are similar,

346
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,660
and the faster one

347
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:45,940
will have an advantage.

348
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,260
Any issues with your content?

349
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,100
No.

350
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,980
I'm just thinking about the core plot.

351
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,740
About that,

352
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,580
don't feel pressured.

353
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,300
We can stand out

354
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,540
in both content and production

355
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,740
without altering our core plot.

356
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:08,860
It's not difficult to win against them.

357
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,740
I'm not worried about that.

358
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,300
I just find it strange.

359
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,020
I came up with this plot

360
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,900
because of a dream.

361
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,380
I dreamt

362
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,060
I entered the novel I had written

363
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,740
and befriended the minor characters.

364
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,020
I found them

365
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,820
to be more humane than what I had set.

366
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,620
So, after waking up,

367
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,420
I decided to turn it into a novel.

368
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,180
I wonder

369
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,860
how do they come up with this plot.

370
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,660
Actually, I've been
wondering about this too.

371
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,380
Normally,
even in a case of similar ideas,

372
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,340
one wouldn't directly
frame the other for plagiarism,

373
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,380
unless they feel guilty themselves.

374
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,380
When I met Mr. Zhu last time,

375
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,540
I threw in a few deceptive lines,

376
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,620
and I realized
he really didn't know the situation.

377
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,420
But,

378
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,020
the release time
of "A Thought Three Lifetimes"

379
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,740
is earlier than "A Dream for You".

380
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,500
We can't deny that.

381
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,060
First of all,

382
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,500
we rule out the possibility

383
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,510
of you having
any spiritually connected siblings.

384
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,660
Could it be possible

385
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,300
that someone

386
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,740
knew about

387
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,500
your conception

388
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,940
of this work earlier?

389
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,500
If that's the case,

390
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,860
this person

391
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,060
must be someone close to you.

392
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,860
(Netizen:
I trust you, Miss Sugar Heart.)

393
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,660
(Sugar Heart: Thanks for the trust.)

394
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,100
(I won't let you all down.)

395
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,180
Hello?

396
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,740
What is it?

397
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,750
After the meeting, I checked the author
of "A Thought Three Lifetimes".

398
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,380
She's indeed someone close to you.

399
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,440
(She was a college classmate)

400
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,580
of yours,

401
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,260
(named Sun Jieping.)

402
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:01,580
Sun Jieping.

403
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:02,940
And also,

404
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,100
the girl in the sixth row from the back,
wearing a pink dress.

405
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,100
How come you two

406
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,420
always daydream during my class?

407
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,380
(Tyrant: Tang Yu.)

408
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,420
(I have a bold idea,)

409
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,100
(but it's a bit risky.)

410
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,820
(Tang Yu: Don't worry about it.)

411
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,540
(You've got me.)

412
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:36,820
(Tell me.)

413
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,900
(Sugar Heart: Apologies
for tying up public resources lately.)

414
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,900
(To bring this to a conclusion,)

415
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,850
(within three days, I will)

416
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,760
(compile the manuscript
from many years ago.)

417
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,860
(It will be the only copy.)

418
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,380
(I'll prove the inspiration)

419
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,620
(for "A Dream for You")

420
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,270
(predates "A Thought Three Lifetimes".)

421
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,620
(Attached is the plot comparison.)

422
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,410
(Thanks
for your understanding and support.)

423
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,610
(Netizens:
Finally, we have solid evidence.)

424
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,940
(Netizens:
The plot comparison proves it, right?)

425
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,940
(We're winning this.)

426
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,900
(We support you, Sugar Heart.)

427
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,940
(I doubt Shuangmu Feilin can
come up with evidence.)

428
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,580
(The real plagiarist
should face legal consequences.)

429
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,260
(Those who doubted Sugar Heart before,)

430
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,020
(you're proven wrong.)

431
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,020
(Time wouldn't
collaborate with a plagiarist.)

432
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,650
(Could this be
the author's own publicity stunt?)

433
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,940
(This time, it's a done deal.)

434
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,060
(Miss Sugar Heart will be cleared.)

435
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,700
Look.

436
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,940
When you compare these two,

437
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,860
they're

438
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,860
completely different novels.

439
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,020
I'll see what the netizens

440
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,340
claiming you plagiarized have to say!

441
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,340
Exactly.

442
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,180
This method is great.

443
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,320
Why didn't you do this earlier?

444
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,020
My brain was all mush earlier.

445
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,300
Now.

446
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:47,940
Here.

447
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,140
Seriously,

448
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,940
I really appreciate both of you today.

449
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,380
Without you two,

450
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,280
I'd be working until tomorrow
without finishing.

451
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,060
Don't say that.

452
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,340
We're good friends.

453
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:58,460
You're being too formal.

454
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,820
(Netizen:
Miss Sugar Heart proved herself.)

455
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,700
(Those who accused her
can shut up now, right?)

456
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,010
(Netizen: A fan for three years here.)

457
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,990
(I knew Sugar Heart
couldn't possibly plagiarize.)

458
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,260
Look.

459
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,180
After being sued by Mr. Tang,

460
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,850
the marketing accounts
deleted their articles.

461
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,780
If you search for keywords
related to this incident now,

462
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,940
you won't find much news.

463
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,940
But there are still a few small fries

464
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,180
trying to stir up trouble.

465
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,340
It doesn't matter.

466
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,500
Just let them continue.

467
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,340
This matter has been

468
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,940
suppressed for now

469
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,220
and won't cause anymore trouble.

470
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,900
As long as it
doesn't affect our project's progress,

471
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,990
they can do as they please.

472
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,780
Look.

473
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,180
Look at how open-minded
Miss Sugar Heart is.

474
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,180
My brother has such good taste.

475
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,100
You are such a devoted younger sister,

476
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,660
keeping your brother in mind all day.

477
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,340
Of course.

478
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,580
I can't help him with anything.

479
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,340
But if I could help him

480
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,260
settle things with his wife,

481
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,660
he would forever be in my debt.

482
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,780
You're only doing it
for more pocket money, right?

483
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,620
It would be good
if it comes with an extra friend.

484
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:59,700
That way,
when I buy fashionable clothes...

485
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,860
Not a bad idea.

486
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,130
We're off work now.
Why are you looking for me?

487
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,780
Did you see Tang Xin's post?

488
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,860
She announced her relationship?

489
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,580
Just kidding.

490
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,900
Why are you so serious?

491
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,600
Open and take a look.

492
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,900
So, she has a manuscript.

493
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,090
Why didn't she say so earlier?

494
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,040
No matter what channel you use,

495
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,620
try every means

496
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,460
to get this news to Zhu Jiang.

497
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,580
Try to do it naturally.

498
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:39,900
This is good.

499
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,780
So this means
the project is saved.

500
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,700
You've really thought it through.

501
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,300
Prevent a falling out with Dajiang

502
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,100
and, at the same time,
let Mr. Zhu hear rumors

503
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,920
and make him give up.

504
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,700
Great idea.

505
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,500
There are plenty of channels.

506
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,860
I'll get on it right away.

507
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,300
Have them sway him discreetly.

508
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,260
I'll leave now.

509
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,420
Hey, sweetheart.

510
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,340
Huo Chendong.

511
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,780
Did you really look at the post?

512
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,460
I did.

513
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,620
This matter must be settled tomorrow.

514
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,620
Three days.

515
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,460
I want to see the other party's cards.

516
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,260
Wait.

517
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,340
What do you mean?

518
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,420
Does this mean Tang Xin
does not have a manuscript,

519
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,420
and you're just
playing a trick on Zhu Jiang?

520
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,020
Do you think you're Mr. and Mrs. Smith?

521
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,460
This is indeed a bit risky.

522
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,540
Is this only risky?

523
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,940
You're playing with fire.

524
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,140
In that case,

525
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,460
you better explain clearly to me.

526
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,580
What are your arrangements?

527
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,220
What's the plan?

528
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,140
Is that okay?

529
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,860
You better not know.

530
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,980
You have too many people around you,

531
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,780
after all.

532
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,540
Okay, fine.

533
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,140
I didn't want to know that much anyway.

534
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,240
My worries were for nothing.

535
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,460
I'll handle the matter right away.

536
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,940
I guarantee Mr. Zhu
will firmly believe that Sugar Heart

537
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,820
has the manuscript.

538
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,260
As for other things, I won't interfere.

539
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,420
Let me warn you.

540
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,220
If things go awry,

541
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,740
I might have to sell my shares.

542
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,940
I'll get on it then.

543
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,220
Mr. and Mrs. Smith?

544
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,980
Not a bad title.

545
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,300
I'm in front.

546
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,700
In front! Hurry up!

547
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,500
You're so dumb.

548
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,740
Do you think this method will work?

549
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,580
I'm talking to you.

550
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,420
Didn't you hear me?

551
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,580
What did you say?

552
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,660
I said,
do you think this method will work?

553
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,020
It has been two days,

554
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,260
and that Sun Jieping

555
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,260
still hasn't appeared.

556
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,940
She did something bad,

557
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,060
so she must feel guilty.

558
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,940
Let's bet on it.

559
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,180
Then, are you

560
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,340
worried?

561
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,580
I'm fine.

562
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,900
There's still one day, right?

563
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,260
How come the two of you

564
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,140
end up talking about this again?

565
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:27,900
Just wait.

566
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,580
I have a plan.

567
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,420
Here.

568
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,220
Have some sweets.

569
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,860
Eating sweets can make you happy.

570
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,220
Here.

571
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:45,140
There's nothing
a can of beer can't solve.

572
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,540
If there is...

573
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,740
then drink one bottle.

574
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,900
Or drink one carton full.

575
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,220
Come on.

576
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,540
To our good mood. Cheers.

577
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,260
Let all frustrations be driven away.

578
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,700
Drive them away. Cheers!

579
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,520
(Time vs Dajiang: Who Will Win?)

580
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,580
Mr. Zhu.

581
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,420
You're here.

582
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,780
Come. Have a seat.

583
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,900
Here. Have some tea.

584
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,580
Sun.

585
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,420
It's been two days already.

586
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,340
So, what are your thoughts?

587
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,900
I stand by what I said on the phone.

588
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,300
She can't produce it.

589
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,660
Mr. Zhu, you have to believe me.

590
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,260
In her post, Tang Xin confidently

591
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,940
claimed she has a manuscript

592
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,220
so she must have

593
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,580
obtained some evidence.

594
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,940
Tell me honestly,

595
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,300
is the person suspected of plagiarism...

596
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:37,780
No.

597
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,260
I did no such thing.

598
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,220
I guarantee she
doesn't have the manuscript.

599
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,540
She doesn't have it?

600
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,060
So you mean

601
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,260
there is such a manuscript in existence.

602
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,620
Is it in your hands?

603
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,620
Yes.

604
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,100
That's right. You.

605
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,420
Which major are you from?

606
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,820
- I...
- I don't care what your major is.

607
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,950
You must pay attention

608
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,340
to General Studies.

609
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,980
That's it for today's class.

610
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:14,980
Class dismissed.

611
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,580
Let's release the manuscript
before she does

612
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,700
and get the upper hand

613
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,380
to secure our footing.

614
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,460
Mr. Zhu.

615
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,540
I don't want to release the manuscript.

616
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,100
Tang Xin and I were classmates.

617
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,350
I don't want to be so ruthless.

618
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,020
Now is not the time

619
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,370
to play the deep friendship card.

620
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,460
Once they manage

621
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,380
to prove their innocence before we do,

622
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,420
according to Tang Yu's personality,

623
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,260
he wouldn't forgive you for this.

624
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,620
By then,

625
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,900
whether it's a lawsuit
or court appearances,

626
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,740
you won't be able to escape either one.

627
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,100
The final result

628
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,580
will be you and Dajiang

629
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,980
taking a big blow.

630
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,500
Sun.

631
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:12,780
There is still a chance
for you to prove your innocence.

632
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,700
You'd better think about it.

633
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,260
Don't worry, Mr. Zhu.

634
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,140
I can prove

635
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,140
that she's the one plagiarizing.

636
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,500
Make a heart.

637
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,300
One, two, three.

638
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,860
Next pose.

639
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,340
I'll carry you.

640
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,660
Wait.

641
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:48,740
Tang Xin, quick.

642
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,260
What's up?

643
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:49,780
Sun Jieping.

644
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,740
Sun jieping made a post.

645
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,340
Hurry.

646
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,780
Let me see.

647
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,980
(Shuangmu Feilin: This is the manuscript
for my initial thoughts)

648
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,750
(of "A Thought Three Lifetimes,"
five years ago.)

649
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,980
(The core of the story had basically
taken shape.)

650
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,260
(Whether it's real or not,)

651
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,380
(I'm sure the netizens
will give me justice.)

652
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,180
She's so shameless.

653
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,260
He's calling.

654
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,100
Hey, Yu.

655
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,700
(Is Tang Xin with you?)

656
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,340
Yes, she is.

657
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,020
Quick.

658
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,150
What's the matter?

659
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,100
Sun Jieping posted the manuscript.

660
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,740
(I saw it.)

661
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,700
Is it yours?

662
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:23,780
Yes.

663
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,500
Alright then.

664
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,580
Leave it to me.

665
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,460
(Sure.)

666
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,460
We need to celebrate.

667
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,860
Is it going to be over soon?

668
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,460
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

669
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,100
Come on.

670
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:43,500
This is great.

671
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,860
Tang Xin.

672
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,420
No one else can defame you again.

673
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,180
I'd like to see who dares to defame you.

674
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,140
You're a genius.

675
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,740
This method is indeed effective.

676
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,740
Of course.

677
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,340
We have a clear conscience

678
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,420
and are not afraid of anything.

679
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,100
That's right.

680
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,260
Who does she think she is?

681
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:57,860
Yeah.

682
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,340
I can't let your two days
of accompaniment

683
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,980
go to waste, right?

684
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,460
Of course.

685
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,660
Treat us to a meal, then.

686
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,540
How about celebrating tonight?

687
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,660
Absolutely.

688
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,340
I bookmarked several trendy places

689
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,530
recommended online the other day.

690
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,570
Let's start with a barbecue
and then watch a movie, okay?

691
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,220
Did you just read my mind?

692
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,180
Hello.

693
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,620
I want to meet with her

694
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:24,340
and have a talk.

695
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:29,260
Sure.

696
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,460
I'll arrange for that.

697
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,140
Why did you want to meet me?

698
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,380
Aren't you afraid others might see us

699
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,380
and talk about it online?

700
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,100
The plagiarizer meets the plagiarized.

701
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,180
I'm sure you know very well

702
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,620
who the real plagiarizer is.

703
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,780
You have Mr. Tang's support,
so you're naturally confident.

704
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,860
But I have nothing to be scared about.

705
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,820
I've already posted the manuscript.

706
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,020
So, I clearly have the upper hand.

707
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,100
How can you claim
that the manuscript is yours?

708
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,900
Considering the handwriting,

709
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,540
it should resemble mine more.

710
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,700
Handwriting can change.

711
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,420
Maybe to win over me,

712
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,300
you practiced with my manuscript.

713
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,740
That's quite imaginative of you.

714
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,820
I don't have time for this.

715
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,650
You also have a manuscript, don't you?

716
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,620
Let's publish them,
and let the netizens judge.

717
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,700
But it doesn't seem that many netizens

718
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,780
support you now.

719
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,940
Forgery of a manuscript

720
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,980
will only embarrass yourself more.

721
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,580
I'm not trying to forge a manuscript,

722
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,670
nor do I have any other manuscripts.

723
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,020
The one I want to publish

724
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,140
is the same one you published.

725
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,100
I was just too careless

726
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,460
and lost the most crucial page.

727
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,100
Thank you for helping me find it.

728
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,220
Are you joking with me?

729
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,060
Do you think anyone will

730
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,980
believe your story?

731
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,780
They'll only think that you've mad.

732
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,340
Mr. Tang.

733
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,540
Do you still not see

734
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,740
what kind of person she is now?

735
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,220
You still want to help her?

736
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,380
I know very well
what kind of person Tang Xin is.

737
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,780
What if I can prove

738
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,900
the manuscript is mine?

739
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,660
Take a look.

740
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,700
Why did you give me this?

741
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,750
Flip it over and take a look.

742
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,020
(Tang Xin)

743
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,540
Miss You.

744
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,500
Your signature looks nice.

745
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,580
But I just can't identify your name.

746
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,740
This

747
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,660
is an exclusive signature
taught to me by my mentor.

748
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:11,820
Look.

749
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,380
From this angle,
it looks like artistic lettering.

750
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,540
Look at it from the back.

751
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,780
Isn't it my name?

752
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,300
(You Huan)

753
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,340
What do you think?

754
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:29,100
Can you help me design one too?

755
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,740
In case I write a book in the future,

756
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,300
I can use it during book signings.

757
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,420
Sure.

758
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,620
Writer Tang.

759
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,860
Let me think about it.

760
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,580
Tang Xin.

761
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,260
Tang Xin.

762
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:51,900
Look at this.

763
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,260
(Tang Xin)

764
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,820
(Since that day,)

765
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,550
(I've been practicing my signature
on the manuscript.)

766
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:04,940
(Coincidentally,)

767
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,780
(the one you picked up also has it.)

768
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,700
(Tang Xin)

769
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,660
If you didn't publish that manuscript,

770
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,500
I really wouldn't have a way

771
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,780
to prove my innocence.

772
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,020
But now,

773
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,260
with the picture you published,

774
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,140
I can prove that you copied me.

775
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,500
After the evidence is released,

776
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,940
I will sue you
on behalf of Time Pictures.

777
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,340
Get ready to receive a lawyer's letter.

778
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,220
Mr. Zhu will soon
receive the notice too.

779
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:37,740
Tang Xin.

780
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,500
Let's go.

781
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,500
Tang Xin.

782
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,780
I'm sorry.

783
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,180
I sincerely apologize to you.

784
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,020
I really didn't mean it at that time.

785
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,500
I didn't intend to copy you.

786
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,260
I was just

787
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,900
confused.

788
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,140
When I picked up your manuscript,

789
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,780
I just found it fun and interesting.

790
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,620
I didn't realize it was plagiarism.

791
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,950
You didn't know it was plagiarism.

792
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,460
Then why accuse me of plagiarism?

793
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,660
Let's resolve this privately, okay?

794
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,380
Don't sue me.

795
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,140
If you sue me,

796
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,420
my life will be ruined.

797
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,380
I won't develop this novel anymore.

798
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,660
I'll talk to Mr. Zhu.

799
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,780
Maybe you need money.

800
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,850
I can compensate you.

801
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,820
Tang Xin doesn't need anything.

802
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,340
Let go of her.

803
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,460
What are you thinking?

804
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,140
Tang Yu.

805
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,020
Can we not sue her?

806
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,180
Just let her return the manuscript,

807
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,340
retract the online statements,

808
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,750
and terminate the development of
"A Thought Three Lifetimes".

809
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:01,980
Do you sympathize with her?

810
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,300
Tang Xin, think it over.

811
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,540
She was determined to ruin you.

812
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,420
I'm not sympathizing.

813
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,220
Honestly,

814
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,580
when I saw the original manuscript,

815
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,980
I felt quite emotional.

816
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,900
When I wrote this novel initially,

817
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,340
I never thought that one day

818
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,180
it would actually be made into a movie

819
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,620
with such a great producer like you

820
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,900
and an excellent director like Mr. Lu.

821
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,020
I just wanted to write

822
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,860
a simple and beautiful story.

823
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,020
So when people in their times of despair
read it,

824
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,500
they can find a glimmer of hope.

825
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,420
I'm not a business person.

826
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,340
I'm just an author.

827
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,980
I really cherish my work

828
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:01,140
and feel lucky
that so many people like it.

829
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:09,020
This farce has gone on long enough.

830
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,860
If it continues,

831
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,980
I'm afraid that in the future,
people will associate

832
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,500
"A Dream for You" with this farce.

833
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,020
That's not what I want.

834
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,740
You're sure?

835
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,860
Are you really sure?

836
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,020
Okay.

837
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,500
I'll follow your lead.

838
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,660
Whatever decision you make,

839
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,420
I'll support you.

840
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,340
Alright.

841
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:39,980
Let's go.

842
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,180
Since the issue is almost resolved

843
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:44,940
now,

844
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,580
and shareholders are convinced,

845
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,820
after the vote,

846
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,060
should we move forward
with the investment contract

847
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,260
and Dingding's acting contract

848
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,300
soon?

849
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,580
Everyone has worked so hard.

850
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,620
I'll treat you all to a meal.

851
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:01,420
OK.

852
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,900
What do you have in mind?

853
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,540
Since it's a warm and happy ending,

854
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,700
let's not go to a restaurant.

855
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,090
I think warmth is the most important.

856
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,460
Are you sure it's for warmth

857
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,220
and not to save money?

858
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,340
Don't think badly of me.

859
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:18,860
Me?

860
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,560
(Lu Zhixing)

861
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,950
Looking forward to working together.

862
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,150
Looking forward to working together.

863
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,660
This is great!

864
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:47,420
Miss Sugar Heart
is my future sister-in-law.

865
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:47,940
I...

866
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,660
My brother is the producer,

867
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,260
and I'm the female lead.

868
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,260
Oh my god. This is amazing.

869
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,460
This movie will definitely become
a legend in the future.

870
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,180
So I'm the only outsider here?

871
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,300
Alright.

872
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,020
To welcome Dingding and Mr. Tang,

873
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,450
I'm inviting everyone to dinner.

874
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:04,100
Sure.

875
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:04,780
Okay.

876
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,820
Dingding, you have to seize

877
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,020
this last chance.

878
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:07,780
Here. Have more.

879
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,140
It's almost gone.

880
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,860
Let's eat.

881
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,820
The dishes are here.

882
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,820
Here. Cook some vegetables.

883
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,860
This is your so-called grand feast?

884
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,980
You're so stingy.

885
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:17,780
Yeah.

886
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,620
You didn't even prepare much meat.

887
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,140
That's enough.

888
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,660
You're all picking on me.

889
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,580
I promise today is just a warm-up.

890
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,940
I'll treat you all to something better
next time, alright?

891
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,140
- You promise.
- Remember that.

892
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:30,580
Let's dig in.

893
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,140
Dig in.

894
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,380
Finally.

895
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,660
Wait.

896
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,260
Let's have a toast.

897
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,140
Come on.

898
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:36,660
Okay.

899
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,180
I hope we'll have a great project.

900
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,420
Here.

901
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,660
- To a great project!
- To a great project!

902
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,940
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

903
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,140
Let's eat.

904
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,420
I've not eaten the whole day.

905
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,540
Let's eat.

906
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:53,500
Dingding, this is cooked.

907
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,260
Try this.

908
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:54,700
Hello.

909
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:54,980
Okay.

910
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:55,700
Here.

911
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,020
Try it.

912
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,340
We're having hotpot.

913
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:58,940
Thank you.

914
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,420
Is that so?

915
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:01,900
Alright.

916
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,260
Okay.

917
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,140
I got it.

918
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,460
What's wrong?

919
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,460
Feng Cheng said
Sun Jieping posted an apology.

920
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,260
So fast?

921
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,020
Really?

922
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,640
Dajiang's official account also posted

923
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,250
the termination
of "A Thought Three Lifetimes".

924
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,380
Let me see.

925
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,140
(Shuangmu Feilin's apology)
She posted it just like this?

926
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,340
(Miss Tang Xin is an adorable author.
Five years ago, I got her manuscript.)

927
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:19,860
Look at this.

928
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,260
(I learned her manuscript and wrote my work.)
She is quite sincere.

929
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,660
Your entertainment industry
are really something.

930
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,750
(Netizens' happy comments)
She changed her mind just like that.

931
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,860
It's time to change your lines,
Female Lead.

932
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,660
You are also in the industry now.

933
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,380
Here.

934
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:34,580
- Let's eat.
- True.

935
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,260
Alright.

936
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,420
The matter is finally resolved.

937
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,300
I can put all my life

938
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,140
into my creation now.

939
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,980
I disagree with sacrificing your life.

940
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,580
Wouldn't a capitalist like you

941
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,140
want all of us to work hard

942
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,500
for you?

943
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,860
Maybe I'm a conscientious capitalist.

944
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,100
I'm home.

945
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:00,940
Goodnight, Mr. Tang.

946
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,540
Think about it.

947
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,660
I helped you solve such a huge issue.

948
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,420
Can't the time

949
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,820
be changed to 30 minutes?

950
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,300
25 minutes.

951
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,340
Okay?

952
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,820
If you're here, you'll affect my work.

953
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:22,660
If my work is affected,

954
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,660
it'll affect my rest.

955
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,460
If I don't rest well,

956
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,940
my life will be sacrificed.

957
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,820
Please.

958
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,460
20 minutes.

959
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,100
Deal.

960
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:41,860
Don't bite.

961
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:43,860
Here.

962
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,780
Mr. Tang.

963
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,980
