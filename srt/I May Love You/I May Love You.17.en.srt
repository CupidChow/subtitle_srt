=I May Love You=

20
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,500
(Adapted from Mo Yanchuan's novel
"I May Love You")

00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,260
=Episode 17=

22
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,200
(So That's Your Secret)

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,760
(Tyrant's Diary)

24
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,060
(Tang Yu.)

25
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,760
(I want to date you and never break up.)

26
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,980
(But love, promises, and principles)

27
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:55,400
(are the most ethereal things
in the world.)

28
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,880
(So, this is my closest secret.)

29
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,660
Okay.

30
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,380
That's it for now.

31
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,940
Hear me out.

32
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,020
You have to understand

33
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,300
why you speak the lines out.

34
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,420
Some you speak for yourself.

35
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,620
Some you speak to the people
in front of you.

36
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,340
Some you speak to the audience.

37
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,740
Have you ever been
in a relationship before?

38
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,980
It doesn't matter.

39
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,460
Let's practice.

40
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,540
You try to express

41
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,140
the love you understand.

42
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,180
Sure.

43
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,580
It's a simple practice.

44
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,860
We just look at each other

45
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,220
and say "I love you".

46
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,380
"I love you"?

47
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,340
That's the way.

48
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,420
I'll go first.

49
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,220
Okay.

50
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,980
I love you.

51
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,660
I love you.

52
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,380
I love you.

53
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,740
I love you.

54
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,020
I can't say it.

55
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,340
It's okay.

56
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,940
Maybe

57
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,180
it's rare for you to say "love" daily.

58
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,840
Let's change the word.

59
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,740
Like. I like you.

60
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,000
Is that alright?

61
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,380
Come.

62
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,060
Begin.

63
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,540
I like you.

64
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,220
I think

65
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,860
I like you too.

66
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,100
I've liked you for a long while.

67
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:58,980
I thought

68
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,540
I'd lost you.

69
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,260
I thought

70
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,460
for my whole life,

71
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,860
I'd live alone.

72
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,140
I thought

73
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,540
you had forgotten about me.

74
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:32,980
Good.

75
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,060
That's a great performance.

76
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,140
The emotions are spot on.

77
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,340
Really?

78
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,020
For just this line,

79
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,580
your performance

80
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,660
is passable.

81
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,460
That's why

82
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,580
you're now the actress Tang Dingding.

83
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:53,980
Mr. Lu.

84
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,420
I won't lose my job now, right?

85
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,060
Right?

86
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,940
You won't.

87
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,140
Mr. Lu, you're hungry.

88
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:04,980
Lunch is on me.

89
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,450
To celebrate me not losing my job.

90
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,700
Sure thing.

91
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,900
Is this for me?

92
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,660
Actresses have to slim down.

93
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,700
I can understand that.

94
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,780
But directors don't have to.

95
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,580
I know.

96
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,340
But if I have to watch you eat nice food,

97
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,180
I'd drool.

98
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,020
Fine.

99
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,020
I have deliveries all the time.

100
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,020
Healthy meals are rare for me.

101
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:49,860
Mr. Lu.

102
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,460
You're still single?

103
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:53,860
Yep.

104
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,460
Been that way for years.

105
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:56,980
What's wrong?

106
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,820
I mean,

107
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,340
back at the rehearsal,

108
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,780
that line of yours...

109
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,860
"I thought

110
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,180
for my whole life, I'd live alone."

111
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,100
It's your real life, right?

112
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,380
No wonder

113
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,020
it was so sad and moving.

114
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,300
Sad?

115
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,700
How is single life sad?

116
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,820
I'm telling you,

117
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,780
if any friend of mine breaks up,

118
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,780
the first thing I'll do is to celebrate.

119
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,420
Modern guys

120
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,700
don't have time for themselves.

121
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,460
For example, there's something

122
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,020
for you ladies to slim down

123
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,900
called fasting, right?

124
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,050
It should be done not just physically,

125
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,660
but spiritually as well.

126
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,980
Single life is the best fasting
for your spirit.

127
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,220
Very healthy.

128
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,580
So Mr. Lu,

129
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,460
you're celibate?

130
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,830
Not strictly, no.

131
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,540
But I enjoy the single life.

132
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,380
That much is true.

133
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,300
Can you make good romantic movies, then?

134
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,100
Come closer.

135
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,180
You little...

136
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,580
naughty girl.

137
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,720
You're questioning my professionalism?

138
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:14,900
What?

139
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,740
Got a big head

140
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,240
because I praised your acting?

141
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:21,460
No. I was just acting.

142
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,180
So, what do you think? Good?

143
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,660
Great.

144
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,240
I almost want to switch actress.

145
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,100
No.

146
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,060
Mr. Lu, you can't abuse your power.

147
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,460
Let's talk about you.

148
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,280
Tell me about your relationships

149
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,860
from elementary to junior high

150
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,740
to high school. All of them.

151
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,020
So I can understand you better.

152
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,820
Me?

153
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,100
After elementary,

154
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,540
I got into junior high.

155
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,420
Then high school...

156
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,860
I had a lot of suitors.

157
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,820
But Yu didn't allow me to date.

158
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,340
I thought you were slimming down.

159
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,340
Why did you order this?

160
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:04,540
You have it, then.

161
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,900
Look out next time.

162
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,820
This is quite nice.

163
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,340
Why did you want me to pick you up?

164
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,260
Mr. Gao's gone to the airport.

165
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,900
This is redundant.

166
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,060
Mr. Gao is there to pick Mr. Huo up.

167
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,980
So what if you're the investor?

168
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,420
Can't even share a car with him.

169
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,860
Hey, you rubbed off on me.

170
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,380
Now I like carpooling too.

171
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,020
In a bad mood?

172
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:06,860
Because of me?

173
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,660
Mr. Tang.

174
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,860
When I'm driving,

175
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,660
please don't talk to me.

176
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,900
It'll severely affect my driving.

177
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,780
I think it's bad mood

178
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,860
that affects driving severely.

179
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,440
Why don't I take the wheel?

180
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,260
No.

181
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,540
I'll take you home safely, Mr. Tang.

182
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,020
Open up.

183
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,140
Hua Juan.

184
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,380
- Hua Juan.
- Good boy.

185
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,020
Let Daddy hug you.

186
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,540
Hey, Daddy.

187
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,180
Go back to your own home.

188
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,900
Hua Juan misses me.

189
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,300
Let me hug him for a bit.

190
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:05,980
Sure.

191
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,780
He's your cat.

192
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,140
You take him home, then.

193
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:13,080
You two can play all you want
back at your place.

194
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:13,980
Just remember.

195
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,260
Don't let his stepmom bully him.

196
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,180
Heard that?

197
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,660
Your mother's upset.

198
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,980
But it's alright.

199
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,100
Your mother

200
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,420
isn't abandoning you.

201
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,500
She's just upset.

202
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,260
Don't stay upset, alright?

203
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,060
You're still here playing with your son?

204
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,300
A harmonious family

205
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,620
is important
to the little one's growth.

206
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,420
Are you going to leave?

207
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,620
I can leave.

208
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,780
But I have to know

209
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,700
why you're so unhappy.

210
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,060
I don't want to talk to you.

211
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,620
Is it because of work?

212
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:07,980
Mr. Tang.

213
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,700
When you're at my home,

214
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,980
can you stay silent

215
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,380
and make no noise, please?

216
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,300
Hello? What is it?

217
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,380
How did it go?

218
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,140
That move came in handy, didn't it?

219
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,260
What move?

220
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,540
(Sugar Heart must be jealous.)

221
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,540
(Must feel the threat.)

222
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,420
(She wouldn't have)

223
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,050
(picked you up at the airport otherwise.)

224
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,500
What did you do this time?

225
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:40,500
Back when you

226
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,180
and Ms. Lin talked about the contract,

227
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,020
I took a pic and sent it to her.

228
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,740
(All in a day's work.)

229
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,820
(You're welcome.)

230
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,140
He hung up on me?

231
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,350
So this is what happened yesterday.

232
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,300
Ms. Lin...

233
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:01,940
I know.

234
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,050
She's a business partner.

235
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:04,280
You guys were negotiating.

236
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:06,660
Since you know,

237
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,180
then why are you upset?

238
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,740
Am I?

239
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,900
I am not.

240
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,100
I'm sleepy.

241
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,500
I should get some sleep.

242
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,340
Hey.

243
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,220
Can you give me one minute?

244
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,220
I can explain this.

245
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:24,540
Sure, explain it.

246
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,060
One minute's up.

247
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,140
Hua Juan.

248
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,260
Let's get some sleep.

249
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,060
You're leaving your phone?

250
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,300
(MyriadFlyerTXX)

251
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,300
(The Most Hurtful Thing My Crush Did)

252
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,140
(Today)

253
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,300
(is my first day at work.)

254
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:21,860
(He didn't join the new employee
training meeting.)

255
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,420
(He didn't come
to the cafeteria either.)

256
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,180
(His office is on another floor.)

257
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,460
(Fortunately,)

258
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,740
(I saw him after work.)

259
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,340
(I thought I was prepared.)

260
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,060
(But I was still excited.)

261
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,820
(So excited)

262
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,820
(that I almost cried.)

263
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,260
(We're having dinner together
the first time today.)

264
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,980
Hey, the girl with the bun?

265
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,540
It's late. Stop working.

266
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,900
Sit down and have dinner.

267
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,560
- Sure.
- Get another chair.

268
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,460
Thank you, Mr. Tang. Thank you, Mr. Huo.

269
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,860
Since everyone's here,

270
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,060
here.

271
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,140
(During the first meeting,)

272
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,100
(I think he noticed me.)

273
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,300
I think everyone has seen the video.

274
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,500
In the last quarter,

275
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,140
our company has built

276
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,740
a platform called
curated content creation.

277
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,820
In the last quarter,

278
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,060
it has brought success.

279
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,420
(Fifty check-in photos completed.)

280
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,260
(Today,)

281
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,700
(for the first time,)

282
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,180
(he summoned me to his office.)

283
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,620
(On the way there, I kept wondering)

284
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,860
(what he wanted to say to me.)

285
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,900
(I was looking forward to it.)

286
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:33,940
So you think

287
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,380
I make a good couple with Ming Zhu?

288
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,540
I...

289
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,020
(In the end,)

290
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,340
(he wanted my help
to court my best friend.)

291
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,380
(He's not enthusiastic about courtship.)

292
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,740
(But he's nice to her. Cares for her.)

293
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,120
(For example,
when he finds out she's hurt,)

294
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,260
(he sets his work aside and flies over
just to check on her.)

295
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,660
(I'm envious. Sad too.)

296
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,220
(I confessed to him.)

297
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,060
(I thought I might stand a chance
when I did that.)

298
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,660
Tang Yu.

299
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,020
(I thought, what if he likes me too?)

300
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,260
Do you think I am pretty?

301
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,860
Can I be your girlfriend then,

302
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,660
since you think I'm pretty,

303
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,660
and I think you're handsome?

304
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,020
We

305
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,060
aren't a good match.

306
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,780
(But he told me)

307
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,340
(we're not a good match.)

308
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:43,020
(No matter what I do, I'm wrong.)

309
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,580

he cares about.)

in the lobby of Time Pictures.

344
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,260
You

345
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,340
were at the entrance.

346
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,460
You were in my way.

347
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,660
Your eyes shone brightly.

348
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,340
If I'm right,

349
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,380
when you saw me that day,

350
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,060
you smiled at me.

351
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,380
You

352
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,420
remember?

353
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,540
Of course, I do.

354
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,820
But I have something to confess.

355
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,100
Just now,

356
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,900
I checked your Weibo alt account.

357
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,060
This is probably the secret
you wanted to tell me.

358
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,300
Sorry, Tang Xin.

359
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:44,580
I shouldn't have questioned
your love for me.

360
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,940
I shouldn't have refused you right away.

361
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,420
Nor should I have waited so long

362
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,900
before I found out everything.

363
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,940
When I flew to Ming Zhu's set
to see her,

364
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,140
were you really sad?

365
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,220
Even if it wasn't Ming Zhu,

366
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,740
but someone else was hurt,

367
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,780
I'd have to check it out anyway.

368
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,660
That's my duty.

369
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,340
About the picture Huo Chendong sent you.

370
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,820
You should know

371
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,750
the kind of relationship between us.

372
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,700
So you're still upset?

373
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,180
Don't worry.

374
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,420
After this...

375
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,540
No.

376
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,660
Don't let me get in the way
of your work.

377
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,500

378
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,140
I...

379
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,900
I just like you too much.

380
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,620
I've loved you for years.

381
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,500
I don't know if your love
for me is real.

382
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,580
That's why I get unreasonable.

383
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,220
Sorry.

384
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,300
I won't do this again.

385
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,180
Tang Xin, I like you a lot.

386
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,380
All the sadness and sorrow

387
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,840
you suffered because of me,

388
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,540
I will make it up to you.

389
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,420
I won't let you

390
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,140
get hurt again.

391
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,460
I'm sorry.

392
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,260
Can I come in?

393
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:58,780
Come in.

394
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,020
So, why the sudden mini golf?

395
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,020
My mom doesn't want me

396
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,500
to still be weak after I turn thirty.

397
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,540
So she wanted me

398
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,680
to move around in the office.

399
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,780
Okay, I'll tell you everything.

400
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,340
That move

401
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,260
didn't exactly

402
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,340
backfire, did it?

403
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,100
I was really confident back then.

404
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,020
And then you hung up on me.

405
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,580
I was uneasy.

406
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,740
That move

407
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,940
could work on regular girls.

408
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,540
But Tang Xin

409
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,340
isn't a regular girl.

410
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,540
So, how did last night go?

411
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,220
It was fine.

412
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,940
Oh, progress.

413
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,620
Told you that move...

414
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:59,020
It has nothing to do
with your stupid move.

415
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,900
You're lucky I'm in a good mood.

416
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,860
If it were any other time,
after that stunt you did,

417
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,780
you can say goodbye to being VP.

418
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:07,260
Alright, just set the move talk aside.

419
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,260
Tell me. What base are you guys at now?

420
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,020
Tell me everything.

421
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,180
Why should I?

422
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,780
You sound smug.

423
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,340
Tell me

424
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,700
and I can help you parse it down.

425
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,240
We're going
to the film festival tomorrow.

426
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,620
When are you free to leave?

427
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,300
I'll get Gao Heng to book the tickets.

428
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:29,740
Anytime's fine.

429
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,580
You do your job.

430
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,740
I'll be going.

431
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,340
Honey.

432
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,540
(It's your birthday in two days.)

433
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,620
(How will you celebrate it?)

434
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,700
(Want me to come over?)

435
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,900
No, thanks.

436
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,340
It's just a birthday.

437
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,300
Nothing special.

438
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,340
(I always go shopping)

439
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:57,300
(with You Huan and Ming Zhu.)

440
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,220
Then we'd have a meal,

441
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:00,940
go for karaoke, and have a cake.

442
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,220
That's all.

443
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,180
(That was in the past.)

444
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,540
(You have to make it celebratory now.)

445
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,020
Don't treat it like it's another day.

446
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,940
Why don't we go on a  family trip?

447
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,900
And relax for a bit.

448
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,460
I can't, Mom.

449
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,460
My project's starting soon.

450
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,500
I can't leave.

451
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,500
Why don't I do this?

452
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:23,780
I'll get my friends

453
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,140
to come over for a birthday party.

454
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,900
(That'll be celebratory, right?)

455
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,420
That's better.

456
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,340
(You have to be happy anyway.)

457
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,620
(I'm telling you,)

458
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,740
if your mood be ruined

459
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,780
during your birthday,

460
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:38,340
your whole year will be affected.

461
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,940
Got it, Mom.

462
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,300
Just don't worry about me.

463
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,040
If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up.

464
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:43,900
Sure.

465
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:44,980
See you.

466
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,100
Bye.

467
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,820
(He should remember)

468
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,580
(my birthday, right?)

469
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,860
(Can't be too sure.)

470
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,700
(He's so busy.
He might forget about it.)

471
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,740
(So what kind of relationship
are we in now?)

472
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,340
(What else?)

473
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,860
(He didn't ask me to be his girlfriend.)

474
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,460
(Why am I in a hurry
to give myself to him?)

475
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,100
(Maybe he'll bring it up
during the birthday?)

476
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,140
(It's a big day.)

477
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:33,260
(Miss it, and it's another year
of waiting.)

478
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,340
I made you the cake myself.

479
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,740
It has all my love for you.

480
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,460
To me, you're like an angel
who fell down to earth.

481
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:20,940
No.

482
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,940
You're prettier than any angel.

483
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,100
Gentler.

484
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,300
More confident.

485
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,780
And wiser, too.

486
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,980
Will you be my girlfriend?

487
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,380
If you do,

488
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,820
I will stay with you without regrets.

489
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,460
If you

490
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,140
don't want to...

491
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,620
I do.

492
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,260
I do.

493
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,500
I do.

494
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,940
(Mr. Tang Yu.)

495
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,460
(You are cordially invited...)

496
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,300
It's from Ming Zhu.

497
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,780
She and Captain Lu are training
in the desert.

498
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,700
She can't make it.

499
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,140
What about you?

500
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:45,940
What did you get me?

501
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,340
Take a guess.

502
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,100
No.

503
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:48,660
Just give me.

504
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,020
The party's at night, right?

505
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,420
Get changed before you leave.

506
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,300
You know me best.

507
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,380
I love this.

508
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,140
You said that before take a look?

509
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,660
Given our longtime friendship,

510
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,940
I know I'll love it.

511
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:04,980
Right.

512
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,140
Who'd you invite to the party?

513
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,780
I sent about eight invites.

514
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:10,860
Mr. Lu's one of them.

515
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,700
Dingding too.

516
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,420
Shen Fei.

517
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,180
Xiaoxiao.

518
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,740
That's not what I meant.

519
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,680
Did you ask Mr. Tang to come over?

520
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,220
Two days ago, I slid the invitation

521
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,540
through the crack under his door.

522
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,540
And?

523
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,580
Is he coming tonight?

524
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,460
After that night,

525
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,580
I haven't seen him.

526
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,680
He'll go to the film festival
with Huo Chendong.

527
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,620
Maybe he has no idea
it's my birthday.

528
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:34,940
It's alright.

529
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,340
Don't worry. He'll come.

530
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,700
Your birthday

531
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,900
is an important matter.

532
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:41,420
Maybe Mr. Tang

533
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,260
is setting up some surprise for you.

534
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,740
- Really?
- I'm here.

535
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,700
Happy birthday.

536
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,980
Here's the present.

537
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,340
Thanks.

538
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,020
You came early. Why?

539
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,660
Well, it's your birthday.

540
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,180
My brother's busy,

541
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,340
so I came for some early celebration.

542
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,860
So,

543
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,180
will your brother come tonight?

544
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,420
Ask him.

545
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:05,620
Forget it.

546
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,750
I don't want to look desperate
for his attendance.

547
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,540
Happy birthday to Xin.

548
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,780
Happy birthday.

549
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,900
Get this party started!

550
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,980
We're gathered together!

551
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,100
I am so happy.

552
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,460
Here.

553
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,980
Here, drink.

554
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,860
Are you stupid?

555
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,660
Give me that.

556
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,620
Alright, let's get some pizza.

557
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,620
Thanks.

558
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,180
Drink.

559
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,100
Come, it's my birthday today.

560
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,460
- Bottoms up.
- Happy birthday.

561
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,020
Bottoms up.

562
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,260
I'll do it.

563
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,820
Bottoms up.

564
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,660
Bottoms up.

565
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,980
Bottoms up for me.

566
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,700
Then I'll drink.

567
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,900
What?

568
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,020
What the heck?

569
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,540
Hey.

570
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,400
(Tang Yu sent you red packets.)
(Happy birthday, Rich Lady.)

571
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,960
(Happy birthday, Tyrant.)
(Happy birthday, Sugar Heart.)

572
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,580
(It doesn't matter.)

573
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,000
(Nothing to be disappointed about.)

574
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,100
(It's my birthday.)

575
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,980
(I have to be happy.)

576
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:37,940
(Tang Yu: Tyrant.)

577
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,340
(Happy birthday.)

578
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,740
(Do you miss me?)

579
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,660
You won't even show up.
These red packets mean nothing.

580
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,180
Tang Xin.

581
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,980
Happy birthday.

582
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,260
Thank you, Mr. Huo.

583
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,180
Happy birthday.

584
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,940
I thought you wouldn't come.

585
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,040
I wouldn't miss your birthday.

586
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,140
I thought you had
an award ceremony to attend.

587
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:17,740
So...

588
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,860
The ceremony is at night.

589
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,540
We can only stay for an hour.

590
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,400
We'll be going back soon.

591
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,460
So, are you moved?

592
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,380
Only an hour?

593
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:26,980
Only an hour.

594
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,140
Without me around,

595
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,340
your party must be boring.

596
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:36,660
I'll be going. You guys chat.

597
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:37,780
Give me the trash.

598
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,580
Give me. Don't hold the trash bag,
birthday girl.

599
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,340
See you.

600
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:51,120
I want to stay with you alone.

601
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,060
May I?

602
00:34:58,980 --> 00:34:59,780
Let's go.

603
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:29,980
Tang Xin.

604
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,500
Happy birthday.

605
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,460
You didn't have to come back
on purpose.

606
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,260
It's just a birthday.

607
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,420
No can do.

608
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,140
Everything about you

609
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,780
is top priority for me.

610
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,500
Come.

611
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,460
Make a wish.

612
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:53,060
First wish.

613
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:57,220
I hope everyone I love stays healthy.

614
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,940
Second wish.

615
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,460
I hope A Dream for You
is a box-office hit.

616
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,820
Then I can be a real rich lady soon.

617
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,460
Third wish.

618
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,500
Done?

619
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:23,940
Alright.

620
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,820
Blow the candles.

621
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,780
Happy birthday.

622
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:32,820
Thank you.

623
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,900
So what was the third wish

624
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,300
you made?

625
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,860
If I say the third wish out loud,

626
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,300
it won't come true.

627
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,260
But I want to be there
for all your wishes.

628
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,020
I want to fulfill them for you.

629
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,740
Tell me.

630
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:01,100
I see it's about me.

631
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,300
Tell me.

632
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,860
Why are you looking at me like that?

633
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,300
Why aren't you saying anything?

634
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,700
Do you have something
to ask me about?

635
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,580
Time to go.

636
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,300
Or we'll miss the flight.

637
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,260
I'll be out for a few days.

638
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,580
Take care of yourself.

639
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,140
I'll try to get back ASAP.

640
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,700
I know.

641
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,220
Wait for me.

642
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,220
Happy birthday.

643
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:02,540
See you.

644
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,020
Safe trip.

645
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,580
See you.

646
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,740
Hey, Dingding.

647
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,300
(Yu.)

648
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,980
(You're a failure.)

649
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,260
Hey, I'm at work here.

650
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,820
We'll talk when I get back.

651
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,140
(Yu.)

652
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,940
(Don't hang up.)

653
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,060
(I have something serious to ask.)

654
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,220
(Did you give Tang Xin
any birthday presents?)

655
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,340
I did.

656
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,020
(What did you give?)

657
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,460
Red packets.

658
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,580
(Red packets?)

659
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,460
(Yu, how dense can you be?)

660
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,500
What's wrong?

661
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:08,820
She's always happy
when someone gives her red packet.

662
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,550
Even posts them on her Moments
to celebrate.

663
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,300
(But you're not someone else.)

664
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,500
(Forget it.)

665
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,260
(Another question.)

666
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,580
You two were downstairs for ages.

667
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,340
Why didn't you confess to her?

668
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,740
Why didn't you

669
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,740
hold her hands

670
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
and pat her head?

671
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:23,820
(And then kabedon her and kiss her.)

672
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,300
(She was waiting for you,
you know?)

673
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:27,980
Waiting for me?

674
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,420
You're saying

675
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,180
she was waiting for me?

676
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,820
It's so obvious what she's waiting for.

677
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,500
Your confession.

678
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,300
You make me so mad.

679
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,860
If a girl

680
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,860
can't even get

681
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,820
a proper confession,

682
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,460
why would she be with you?

683
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,300
Why did you

684
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,060
chicken out when you were that close
to winning the game?

685
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,820
Watch it, Tang Dingding.

686
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,100
Talk later.

687
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,060
Waiting for me?

688
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,740
Get Mr. Huo here.

689
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:06,620
Yes, sir.

690
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,860
Alright.

691
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,180
I get the situation.

692
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,260
But one thing surprises me.

693
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,180
Why do you trust me so much?

694
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,420
You keep coming to me

695
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,420
for relationship advice.

696
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,200
You might be taking this the wrong way.

697
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,460
I don't trust you.

698
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,780
I just want someone to talk to.

699
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,340
And also to figure out

700
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,820
the kinks of my new ideas.

701
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:28,780
Of course,

702
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,710
if you don't want to talk about it,

703
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,100
go back to your office.

704
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,340
No.

705
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:36,100
I haven't even started.

706
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,780
You see,

707
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:40,100
you were wrong here.

708
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,140
You claim to like Sugar Heart.

709
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,500
But it's been so long,

710
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,300
and you haven't confessed to her,

711
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,180
have you?

712
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,540
If I were Sugar Heart,

713
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,780
I'd be dating someone else right away.

714
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,780
Just to spite you.

715
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,180
Don't worry about that.

716
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:55,180
I'd never fall for you if you were her.

717
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:58,580
Is that so? I'm leaving, then.

718
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,700
Let me finish.

719
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,300
It's not like I don't want to confess.

720
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,620
I just thought she wasn't ready.

721
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,500
I'm sure I like her.

722
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,460
I just don't want her

723
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,320
to give me an answer in a hurry.

724
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:19,100
Get it?

725
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,380
All are your assumptions.

726
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,260
At this point,

727
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,980
you should ditch

728
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,820
that gentleman attitude of yours.

729
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,100
Romance...

730
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,860
Romance is a selfish affair.

731
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,380
Romance requires you to pilfer.

732
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,460
Romance means you attack when it's time.

733
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:37,420
That's how you gain success
before anyone else.

734
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,060
You keep hesitating,

735
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:40,660
it would make

736
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:44,060
Sugar Heart think
you don't want to date her.

737
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:44,900
That's not it.

738
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,780
So what now?

739
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:47,820
Fortunately,

740
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,420
it's not too late to patch things up.

741
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,980
Good thing you have me.

742
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,540
Honestly,

743
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,700
confession is a simple affair.

744
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,540
Even if you missed her birthday,

745
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:02,540
it doesn't mean you can't
do anything about it, right?

746
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,460
Do you two have any

747
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,340
special anniversaries?

748
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,420
Think long and hard.

749
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,540
Anniversaries?

750
00:43:46,861 --> 00:43:48,531
♪Hastily encountering fate's design♪

751
00:43:49,061 --> 00:43:50,771
♪A glance turned, frozen in time♪

752
00:43:51,281 --> 00:43:53,691
♪A universe of tenderness
in that fleeting view♪

753
00:43:55,601 --> 00:43:57,281
