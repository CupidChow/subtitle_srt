(If someone were to ask me,)

25
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,760
(is secretly admiring someone
for four years lonely and bitter?)

26
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,240
(I thought carefully about it.)

27
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,320
(There are fleeting moments of sadness,
but most of the time, it's joyful.)

28
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,240
(Many have never felt the experience
of having feelings for someone,)

29
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,100
(but at least I have experienced it.)

30
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,660
Well, my...

31
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,020
My car...

32
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:07,700
It's...

33
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,700
It's...

34
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,980
maybe a bit different from others'.

35
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:14,820
Well...

36
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,380
Right.

37
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,220
Mr. Tang.

38
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,220
Miss Tang tricked you last time,

39
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,660
but it might be real this time.

40
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,580
Her car wasn't at the 4S Store
for maintenance before.

41
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,040
It was parked in the underground garage.

42
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,460
You...

43
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,060
Tang Xin.

44
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,260
Mr. Tang.

45
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Last time,

46
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,780
I didn't get a chance
to ride in your new car.

47
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,340
I just wanted to try it out.

48
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,300
It's not a crime, right?

49
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,940
Right.

50
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,140
Shall we?

51
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,608
Didn't you want to ride in my new car?

52
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,220
After you.

53
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,740
Just you wait.

54
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,900
I have finally

55
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,260
got in the exclusive girlfriend seat.

56
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,500
So happy, huh?

57
00:04:13,632 --> 00:04:15,744
A bit excited to ride the employer's car
for the first time.

58
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,580
Where are we going?

59
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:20,460
You can just drop me off
at that intersection

60
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,580
near your place.

61
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,180
Exact location.

62
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,020
Exact location?

63
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,300
Mr. Tang.

64
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,140
Are you going to take me home?

65
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,220
It's okay.

66
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,820
My place is very close.

67
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,980
Drop me at the intersection.
I'll be just a few steps away.

68
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,420
Okay.

69
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:41,020
Then I'll drop you off
at the intersection near my house.

70
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:44,220
(You give up pretty fast, don't you?)

71
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:44,860
(Mr. Tang.)

72
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,340
Your proposal today was well done.

73
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,660
Are you praising me?

74
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,980
There are structure and content.

75
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,580
The story and characters
are quite clear.

76
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,820
I can see that you put effort into it.

77
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,220
Mr. Tang, I didn't expect you
to be good at praising people.

78
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,260
You're making me feel a bit embarrassed.

79
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,140
I'm just being straightforward.

80
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,180
Doing things this way is more efficient.

81
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,180
I've experienced it before.

82
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,020
But your performance today,

83
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,220
I must say, I'm impressed.

84
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,940
Impressed?

85
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,580
That's quite a compliment.

86
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,060
Maybe I'm the kind of person

87
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,500
who likes to take on challenges.

88
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,500
I won't be happy
until I accomplish my goal.

89
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,700
This applies to both work

90
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,700
and relationships.

91
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,380
When I like someone,

92
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,940
I'll make sure to win him over

93
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,180
no matter how long it takes.

94
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:49,620
Mr. Tang.

95
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,220
That last sentence
was just something random.

96
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,328
Please don't take it to heart.

97
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,020
Your experience in proposal making

98
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,180
could be extended internally
within the company.

99
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,940
It could also improve the efficiency
of the Screenwriting Department.

100
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,180
That won't do.

101
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:05,460
This is my secret weapon.

102
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,700
I want to progress quietly

103
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,980
and amaze everyone.

104
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,460
Mr. Tang.

105
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,460
Since you like my proposal,

106
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,380
can we commence the development
of "A Dream for You"?

107
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,660
While your proposal is not bad,

108
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,540
what the company needs right now

109
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,592
is a project with developed content,
target audience,

110
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,820
and efficient production

111
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,060
that can expedite the process.

112
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,860
Your project has a huge fantasy element,

113
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,180
and the production cycle
would be quite lengthy.

114
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,220
Adaptation would also
require more professional skills

115
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,180
and a richer scriptwriting experience.

116
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:47,940
Got it.

117
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,580
Just drop me off
at the intersection up ahead.

118
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,900
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

119
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,740
Anytime.

120
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,140
(Your project
has a huge fantasy element,)

121
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,380
(and the production cycle
would be quite lengthy.)

122
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,460
(Adaptation would also
require more professional skills)

123
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,420
(and a richer scriptwriting experience.)

124
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,980
So, I was rejected.

125
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,900
(Though I've
faced plenty of skepticism,)

126
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,420
(the doubts coming from him)

127
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,740
(seem like a masterclass
among those criticisms.)

128
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,340
(Thanks for the reality check.)

129
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,340
(Sigh. Is there really no possibility)

130
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,420
(for my project in his eyes?)

131
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,380
Hello?

132
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,660
Hello, Ms. Chen.

133
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,340
Apologies for calling so late.

134
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,740
I was wondering

135
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,300
if I could join the crew
of White Dew to Frost

136
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,780
and learn from the team for a while?

137
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,420
Let me tell you,

138
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,180
everything is hard work on the set.

139
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,380
Other writers would avoid going
if they could.

140
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,460
(What's up with you
volunteering for it?)

141
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,300
It's nothing.

142
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,820
I'm not afraid of hard work.

143
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,540
I don't have much experience.

144
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,140
I want to experience the process

145
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,700
of bringing a script to life on set.

146
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,260
I hope you can give me this opportunity.

147
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,260
Okay.

148
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,780
I'll consider it.

149
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,780
Alright.

150
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,780
Thanks, Ms. Chen.

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,560
(Handsome and kind neighbor,
can you take me home, pretty please?)

152
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,040
(Mr. Huo's Schedule Itinerary)

153
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,020
(9:00 Attend Malaysia Cinema Opening)

154
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,140
Hello, who is this?

155
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,900
Hello, Yu.

156
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,980
Do you plan

157
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,620
on heading to Malaysia soon?

158
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,620
(Take me with you.)

159
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,700
How do you know I'm going to Malaysia?

160
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,980
I heard it from Dad.

161
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,100
Yu.

162
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,820
Just take me along.

163
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,900
(I promise I won't cause any trouble.)

164
00:10:26,992 --> 00:10:28,128
Let's talk about it later.

165
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,300
(I'd rather not wait to discuss it.)

166
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,860
(Let's talk about it now.)

167
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,860
I haven't been on vacation
for a long time.

168
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,180
You are on a business trip,
and me on vacation.

169
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,980
Yu, I think I heard a cat meowing.

170
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,420
Do you have a cat over there?

171
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,900
No idea who put it on my parking spot.

172
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,300
(Who else could it be?)

173
00:10:47,392 --> 00:10:48,020
(Definitely it's)

174
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:50,300
(one of those female neighbors
eyeing you.)

175
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,100
Yu.

176
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,220
Looks like things are looking up for you.

177
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,060
Someone is taking the initiative.

178
00:10:57,344 --> 00:10:58,900
If you have nothing else,
I'll hang up first.

179
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,540
(No, wait.)

180
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,420
Yu.

181
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,140
Can you check the breed
of the cat for me?

182
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,500
I don't know.

183
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,020
It's white, and its fur is a bit long.

184
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,340
(Could you bring it home for me?)

185
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,420
Bring it home for you?

186
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,660
Has Mom agreed?

187
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,660
If you bring it home, Mom will agree.

188
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,900
But if you don't bring it back,
what are you going to do?

189
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,460
(You can't just abandon it, right?)

190
00:11:21,568 --> 00:11:23,780
I'll give it to the property management.
Let them deal with it.

191
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,260
Don't. If you hand it over to them

192
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,780
and they can't deal with it,

193
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,500
they might abandon it again.

194
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,300
It may end up being abandoned
for the second time.

195
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,140
Yu, can't you have a bit of humanity?

196
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,100
I mean, can't you

197
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,980
have a little compassion?

198
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,660
Enough, Tang Dingding.

199
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,300
I'll hang up now.

200
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:46,128
Did he just hang up?

201
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,180
Is it a yes or no?

202
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,340
Feel your new home.

203
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,460
Isn't it quite soft?

204
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,300
(Stop looking at me.)

205
00:12:31,696 --> 00:12:32,700
(If you look at me again,)

206
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,820
(I'll risk bankruptcy)

207
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,180
(to buy dried fish for you again.)

208
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,060
(Did she have a pet cat too?)

209
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,260
Morning, Mr. Gao.

210
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:17,700
Morning, Miss Tang.

211
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:18,860
We need to talk.

212
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,500
Here, sit down.

213
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,420
Sit back, Mr. Gao.

214
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,740
Did you forget what happened

215
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,580
in the elevator yesterday?

216
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,820
You blatantly betrayed me.

217
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,580
Doesn't your conscience bother you?

218
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,980
Mr. Tang asked me about it.

219
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:37,740
I couldn't lie to him, could I?

220
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,860
He

221
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:41,940
asked you?

222
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,660
What did he ask?

223
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,180
He asked

224
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,020
why you brought me breakfast that day.

225
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,180
(Did he already)

226
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,820
(notice something?)

227
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,300
(Feelings of love
are hard to conceal, after all.)

228
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,340
Mr. Gao.

229
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,780
Do you think

230
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,780
I like Mr. Tang?

231
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:07,940
Well...

232
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,540
Do you

233
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:14,380
think he likes me?

234
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,140
I don't know.

235
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,900
Morning, Tang Xin.

236
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,780
Morning, Mr. Gao.

237
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,780
Morning.

238
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,820
Have a smooth trip, Miss Tang.

239
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:29,860
Thanks.

240
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,820
Looks like it's your first time on set.

241
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,780
Ms. Chen.

242
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,900
Life on set isn't as fancy
as you might think.

243
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,660
You're lucky that it's in Nangang.

244
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,860
If it were elsewhere,

245
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,580
how many things would you have to bring?

246
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,700
A good work environment

247
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,220
makes working comfortable, right?

248
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,860
But rest assured, Ms. Chen.

249
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,600
I might be inexperienced,

250
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,100
but I'm willing to learn.

251
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,220
You can trust me with it.

252
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,300
Take it easy.

253
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,740
Get used to it first.

254
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,980
The previous newcomer

255
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,140
ended up sobbing to me,
asking to quit the set.

256
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,620
Ms. Chen.

257
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,020
Here, have a seat.

258
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,580
I won't be that kind of person.

259
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:32,940
Okay.

260
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,660
Here.

261
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,780
Take these.

262
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,380
The shooting schedule and notice
for the next two days.

263
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,080
Let's hope you'll stay enthusiastic

264
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,260
in the next few days.

265
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,940
I'll make sure of it.

266
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,900
Can we cut down on the technical terms?

267
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,420
Excuse me.

268
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,220
Be careful.

269
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,980
You see, these technical terms

270
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,300
need to be memorized.

271
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,860
Look, there's an issue
with this dialogue.

272
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,580
This character wouldn't say this.

273
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,900

"The Beginning"

spans across 16 years.

303
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,640
Conveying the era

00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,540
okay?

but

316
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,360
you also need to think

317
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,380
about our actors, right?

318
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,340
As their agents, we

319
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:14,220
have a lot to worry about them.

320
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,420
We can't let them act
in uncomfortable scenes, right?

328
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,580
in the best way.

00:17:29,344 --> 00:17:30,660

382
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:21,820
Morning.

383
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:22,980
Miss Tang.

384
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:23,660
Liu Yang.

385
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,700
The letter the male lead
writes to the female lead,

386
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,420
can you please add more details to it?

387
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,860
Sure, no problem.

388
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,340
There's one more thing.

389
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,940
The actress in this scene is ill.

390
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,100
Is it possible to not have her appear
in the scene?

391
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:36,860
That won't work.

392
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,260
If she doesn't appear in this scene,

393
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,780
it'll affect the next scene,
the male lead's reaction when he sees her.

394
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,700
But we've already filmed that scene.

395
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,900
How about this?

396
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,280
I'll change her order of appearance

397
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,540
and send it to you in half an hour.

398
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,660
Thank you, Miss Tang.

399
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,864
Go on with your work.

400
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:51,580
Okay, thank you.

401
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:54,980
Come in.

402
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,780
The contract for "The Beginning"

403
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,780
has been finalized at last.

404
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:04,940
Well done.

405
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,460
Apart from "The Beginning",

406
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,060
there have been many new projects

407
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,100
targeting male audiences.

408
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,100
I heard they're of nice quality.

409
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,260
Should we pick a couple more

410
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,460
and shoot for the moon?

411
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,536
Once "The Beginning" and "White Dew"
are completed,

412
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,240
Time will be able to gain a foothold

413
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,540
in the male-oriented market.

414
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,900
To shoot for the moon,

415
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,180
we need to change our approach.

416
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,380
What approach?

417
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,900
Not bad.

418
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,340
You've started to care
about Time's long-term development.

419
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:34,700
Fine.

420
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,860
I won't bother myself with it.

421
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,980
But since

422
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,140
I've worked so hard,

423
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,060
you should share something happy

424
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,140
with me.

425
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,420
What do you mean?

426
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,700
Oh, stop pretending.

427
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,180
I'm not a drama queen like you.

428
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,660
I heard

429
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:00,220
you visited the set of "White Dew"
the other day.

430
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,860
Was it to check on Sugar Heart?

431
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,340
I was there for work.

432
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,140
Oh, come on.

433
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,420
I see you're interested in her.

434
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,660
Did you go there because of Ming Zhu?

435
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,180
Haven't you given up on Ming Zhu?

436
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,740
It had nothing to do with Ming Zhu.

437
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,540
So, you were there for Tang Xin.

438
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,860
Stop guessing.

439
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,460
I do think Tang Xin is pretty nice.

440
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,780
She's adaptable

441
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,780
and creative,

442
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,660
with a strong commitment to content.

443
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,380
She's also quite flexible.

444
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,140
A good screenwriting material.

445
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,780
Now you're praising her so directly.

446
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,140
You've changed.

447
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,060
I don't feel like
explaining myself to you.

448
00:22:43,056 --> 00:22:44,300
Turn off the computer for me.

449
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,420
Where are you going?

450
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,300
Home.

451
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,500
It's still early.
Why are you going home?

452
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:49,340
To feed the cat.

453
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,100
What?

454
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,300
He has a cat?

455
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,260
Maybe he's talking about his lover?

456
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:08,780
No way.

457
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,060
It would be

458
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,496
less absurd for him to keep a cat
rather than a secret lover.

459
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,300
Director, I have a call.

460
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:15,880
Go on.

461
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,340
Okay.

462
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,740
Hi, Mr. Lu.

463
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,500
(Tang Xin.)

464
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,380
Do you have time for lunch with me?

465
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:25,940
I have something to discuss.

466
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,300
I've been busy working on a film set,

467
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,780
so I can't go out easily.

468
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,260
You mean the set
of "White Dew to Frost"?

469
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,060
Jiang is there, right?

470
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:34,940
Yeah.

471
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,580
He's here.

472
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,260
Okay, I got it.

473
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,980
I'll help you ask him for leave.

474
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,340
Okay.

475
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,340
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

476
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,260
This is it.

477
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,340
Domaine Coche-Dury.

478
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,020
I'll bring it over
for your birthday tonight.

479
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,060
It's nothing.

480
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,260
A girl's 20th birthday is a big deal,

481
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:56,980
isn't it?

482
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,500
Yu.

483
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,540
Why are you here?

484
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,180
I was just on the phone.

485
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,420
What are you holding?

486
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,420
- Nothing.
-Stop hiding it. I saw it.

487
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,340
No, you're mistaken.

488
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,140
Hand it over.

489
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,740
I already saw it.

490
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:15,700
You're sneaking wine
from Yu's office again.

491
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,460
Sneaking wine? Who? Who's doing that?

492
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,420
We're partners.

493
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,860
What's his is mine.

494
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,220
Partners?

495
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,260
What are you doing here?

496
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,660
To see my brother, duh.

497
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,180
He's probably heading home now.

498
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,660
Well...

499
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,180
Come with me to his place
to get my cat.

500
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:31,740
Let's go.

501
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,580
No, no, no.

502
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,500
Not for tonight.

503
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,100
I have to go to a friend's
birthday party.

504
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,620
I'm busy.

505
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,060
Birthday party? Which friend?

506
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,020
Just a regular friend.

507
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,220
Why should I let you
pry into my personal affairs?

508
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,300
Then take me with you.

509
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,940
Why? You don't even know my friend.

510
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,820
I will when I get to the party.

511
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,540
Your friend's birthday party
must be at a bar.

512
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,780
I've been wanting to go.

513
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:53,740
And besides,

514
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,660
it looks so much fun
from your social media posts.

515
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,820
I want to have fun, too.

516
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:59,060
You're still a girl. Why go to a bar?

517
00:24:59,060 --> 00:24:59,740
No, you're not going.

518
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,420
I'm older than the 20-year-old girl

519
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,780
you talked about on the phone.

520
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:04,740
Fine.

521
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,740
You won't even grant me
such a small request.

522
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,820
We're not close anymore.

523
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,140
No, let's go another day, okay?

524
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,500
I promise I'll take you there.

525
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,220
No, I want to go tonight.

526
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,420
If you refuse, I'll smash this.

527
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,380
Oh, please spare me.

528
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,140
Really, I can't afford to offend you

529
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,100
or Tang Yu.

530
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,740
This is expensive.

531
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,660
Just let go, okay?

532
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,300
I'm begging you.

533
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,060
Fine.

534
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,300
If you won't take me there,

535
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,020
I'll go by myself.

536
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,020
Okay, fine.

537
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,060
We'll go together.

538
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,420
I'll take you there, okay?

539
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,260
Where are we going?

540
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,380
The place I'm taking you to
is surely the best.

541
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,500
Happy?

542
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,020
That's more like it.

543
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,900
Then let's bring this with us today.

544
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,540
No, forget it.

545
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,260
This is Mr. Tang's.

546
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,540
I'll pay tonight,

547
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,220
okay?

548
00:25:44,528 --> 00:25:45,200
Wait at the door.

549
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,952
I'll be right there.

550
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,300
Okay.

551
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,500
Just go.

552
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,340
(Sorry.)

553
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,340
(I can't make it tonight.)

554
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,260
(Put it on my tab.)

555
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,820
I often come here.

556
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,900
The scenery here is good,
and the air is fresh.

557
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,700
Tang Xin.

558
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,980
The reason I find you today is
that I want to discuss with you

559
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,220
about "A Dream for You".

560
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,420
I've read

561
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,180
your novel.

562
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,660
I really like it.

563
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,820
I want to adapt it into a film.

564
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:29,900
What do you think?

565
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:34,940
You see,

566
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,300
I'm the kind of person

567
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,980
who doesn't like beating
around the bush.

568
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,620
Many people say I'm subjective
in selecting projects.

569
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,700
But subjectivity

570
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,260
is the foundation of my creativity.

571
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,380
Your novel

572
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,900
falls into the category of stories

573
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,260
that I can never forget once I read it.

574
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,620
The fantasy elements are captivating,

575
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,300
and the nuanced character
psychological changes

576
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,500
also deeply moved me.

577
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,540
If I can't bring it
to the big screen myself,

578
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,540
I won't be content.

579
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,820
Is my novel

580
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,260
truly that good?

581
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:03,820
Yes, it is.

582
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,700
Why don't you have confidence in it?

583
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,540
It's not that.

584
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,060
But Mr. Lu,

585
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,060
do you genuinely
want to film "A Dream for You"?

586
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,300
Or are you thinking of buying the rights
and shelving it?

587
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,540
Oh, no.

588
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,300
I don't have the habit
of shelving rights.

589
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,460
As soon as I get the script,
I start filming immediately.

590
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,420
If you're fine with it,

591
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,820
I can start shooting within the year.

592
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,060
Really?

593
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:27,940
Yes.

594
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,820
But, Mr. Lu,

595
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,420
I remember

596
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,540
you've never been interested

597
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,460
in fantasy genre.

598
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,300
That's right.

599
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,060
The reviews and the box office record
of the movie I made last year

600
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:41,020
are not as good as before.

601
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,540
Maybe the audiences find it okay.

602
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,700
However,

603
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:48,060
when you make too many
of the same type of films,

604
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,060
it gets boring.

605
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,300
Is it "Imbalanced?"

606
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,060
Yes.

607
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,300
I've seen it, and I think it's good.

608
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,020
I'm going through a rebellious phase.

609
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,220
I want to try something different.

610
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,700
Mr. Lu.

611
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:06,620
I have to tell you the truth.

612
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,500
The rights to my novel

613
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,700
are still with Time.

614
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,460
I know.

615
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,780
It's only

616
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,940
two months left, right?

617
00:28:13,776 --> 00:28:15,140
Does Time want to renew the contract?

618
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,540
Probably not.

619
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,220
But you still lean toward giving it
to Time to film.

620
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,820
Am I right?

621
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,660
I want to.

622
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,020
But he doesn't.

623
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,820
What I mean is,

624
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:46,460
I definitely want my work

625
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,420
to be in the hands of someone
who truly loves it.

626
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,260
I'm with Time now.

627
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,140
I still have deep feelings for it.

628
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,460
It's okay.

629
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,300
Take your time to consider.

630
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,500
I'll wait for you.

631
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,060
Huo Chendong.

632
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,540
Didn't you promise to bring me
to the bar?

633
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:18,900
Bars are boring.

634
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,300
It's noisy and harmful to our health.

635
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,820
We have a few new games.

636
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,060
You're the first to experience them.

637
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,460
- Hurry. Give it a try.
- I don't play.

638
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,580
It's absolutely fun.

639
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,300
I swear to you.

640
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,500
Or a pinky promise? Alright?

641
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,260
Come on.

642
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:28,960
Turn on your phone.

643
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,260
Good. Select a character.

644
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,060
Choose one.

645
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,740
Pick the one you find attractive.

646
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,220
I choose this Sha Monk.

647
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,460
That's too fast!

648
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,180
Up, down, left, right.
Up, down, left, right. Follow me.

649
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,060
Yes. Follow me.

650
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:42,640
Yes, that's right.

651
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,380
Here are three skills on this side.

652
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:45,780
Good.

653
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:19,860
Look.

654
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,780
Look at what you've done to the house.

655
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,580
And look at here.

656
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,740
I told you.

657
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,020
Don't be naughty.

658
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,580
Are you hungry?

659
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,260
Be good. I'll get you something to eat.

660
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:50,940
Stop running around.

661
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,980
Hurry up.

662
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,420
It's okay.

663
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,656
Good.
Get the equipment after resurrecting.

664
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,620
Follow me and go up.

665
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,020
Up...

666
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,260
- Run. Come here.
- Yu.

667
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,900
Let me tell you, Tang Dingding.

668
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,780
Come over here right now

669
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,060
and take this cat away.

670
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,340
I'm hanging out with friends.

671
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,540
Tomorrow.

672
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,620
I'll definitely take it away tomorrow.

673
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,620
Dingding, what are you doing? Hurry up.

674
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,260
No, I...

675
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,820
Can't rely on her after all.

676
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,420
(It's just a cat.)

677
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,860
(Don't give it a hard time.)

678
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,460
(I'll buy a new chair for you tomorrow.)

679
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,580
Eat slowly.

680
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,580
No need to rush.

681
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,100
It's all yours.

682
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,020
Mr. Lu.

683
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,060
Are you bound to cooperate

684
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,776
with Mr. Feng Cheng
and Mr. Wan Li continuously?

685
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:42,500
Yes.

686
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,020
If "A Dream for You" is developed,

687
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,500
you can present your conditions

688
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,740
to them directly.

689
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,700
Do you have any other thoughts?

690
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,220
No.

691
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,780
I'm just thinking,

692
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,620
it's not easy to meet someone

693
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,952
who appreciates and understands me.

694
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,020
(It would be great)

695
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,136
(if that person were Tang Yu.)

696
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,940
Hello, Mr. Tang.

697
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,540
I remember you've had a cat before.

698
00:34:22,688 --> 00:34:24,340
What should I do if I get scratched
by a cat?

699
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,900
Did you get scratched by a cat?

700
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,580
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

701
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,180
Mr. Lu, I'm sorry. I have something urgent.

702
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,060
I'll leave first.

703
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,420
Okay.

704
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,340
We'll be in touch.

705
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:35,700
Alright.

706
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,860
Goodbye.

707
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,100
Tang Yu got scratched by a cat?

708
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,220
I'm coming.

709
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,540
Mr. Tang.

710
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,620
Come in.

711
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,140
Where did the cat scratch you?

712
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,100
It scratched my hand.

713
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,060
It's not that serious.

714
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,460
Let me see your hand.

715
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,260
It's okay.

716
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,980
Why is it okay?

717
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,380
Come on.

718
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,260
Let me see.

719
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,660
It looks bad.

720
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,780
Have you rinsed it?

721
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,460
Not yet.

722
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,980
That's common sense.

723
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,380
You have to rinse it with soapy water.

724
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,220
Let me take you there.

725
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,580
It's okay.

726
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,300
I'll rinse it myself.

727
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:20,820
Come on.

728
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:24,380
Make yourself at home.

729
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,940
What if the wound gets infected?

730
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,580
How did you get scratched by a cat?

731
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,660
Tell me if it hurts.

732
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,540
Okay.

733
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,580
Give me your hand.

734
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,900
I... I'll be gentle.

♪Wait you♪

753
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:42,980
No.

754
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,100
I just picked it up.

755
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,420
You just picked it up?

756
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,220
That won't do.

757
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,500
I have to take you to get a vaccine.

758
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:49,820
Is it necessary?

759
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,540
Even if you don't get the vaccine,

760
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,020
at least we should have the cat checked.

761
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:06,700
Let's go.

762
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:52,540
I think I saw

763
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,860
a pair of female slippers inside.

764
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,220
What's wrong with that?

765
00:38:59,020 --> 00:38:59,540
Nothing.

766
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,500
We're all adults.

767
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:03,860
I understand.

768
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:08,540
I have a sister.

769
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,540
Thank you.

770
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:40,860
Mr. Tang.

771
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,180
If we go in like this,

772
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:45,260
will there be news tomorrow?

773
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,300
The headline will be
"CEO of Time Pictures, Tang Yu,"

774
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,060
"Accompanies Girlfriend
for Cat Checkup."

775
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:51,900
No.

776
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,300
Even if there is,

777
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,580
I will issue a statement to clarify.

778
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,780
I won't damage your reputation.

779
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,740
This person looks familiar.

780
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:01,180
I seem to have seen him in the news.

781
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:01,820
Really?

782
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,780
No ringworms.

783
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,660
No ear mites.

784
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,980
No problems with the mouth too.

785
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,580
Looks very healthy.

786
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,300
But your hand...

787
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,340
We're going
to get the rabies vaccine now.

788
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,020
Thank you, doctor.

789
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,740
It's too late today.

790
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,500
Let's go another day.

791
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,060
A 24-hour epidemic prevention station
is beside us.

792
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,980
It's very convenient.

793
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,100
It's a minor injury.

794
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,220
Nothing serious.

795
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:26,940
Don't mind it.

796
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,420
How can this be a minor injury?

797
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:29,660
It's right across the street.

798
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:30,460
I'll go with you.

799
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,220
Hurry up.

800
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,460
Wait.

801
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,940
Doctor, this is fine.

802
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:39,900
This...

803
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,100
It's an intramuscular injection.

804
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,420
How can I do it without pulling up?

805
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:44,740
Listen to the doctor. Don't move around.

806
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:45,580
No.

807
00:40:45,616 --> 00:40:46,500
- Enough.
- Raise it.

808
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,220
That's enough.

809
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:47,980
Don't dawdle.

810
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:48,740
Here.

811
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,460
Gentler.

812
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,500
Mr. Tang.

813
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,420
So you didn't want to come over
for the injection

814
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,620
because

815
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,300
you're afraid.

816
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:01,860
I'm not afraid.

817
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:04,980
Doctor.

818
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:05,540
Slower.

819
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,420
Alright.

820
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,940
I just feel faint when I see needles.

821
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:09,980
Feel faint?

822
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:11,500
Here.

823
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,180
Mr. Tang.

824
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,140
Look at me.

825
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,140
What are you doing, Xin?

826
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,620
I'm helping you record it.

827
00:41:15,648 --> 00:41:17,140
- Don't record it. Don't.
- This angle is good.

828
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,260
No, look at the camera.

829
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:19,300
This angle is good.

830
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,580
Put the phone away.

831
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,380
No, I'm recording this for you.

832
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,700
You rarely get an injection.

833
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:24,940
Very good.

834
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,380
Alright, it's done.

835
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:27,060
Press it.

836
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:27,900
It's done?

837
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,540
Yes.

838
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,980
- It's done?
- We're done.

839
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,580
Yup.

840
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,380
- Thank you.
- Thank you, doctor.

841
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,060
You're welcome.

842
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,820
Delete the photos in your phone
from just now.

843
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,660
I didn't take any.

844
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,340
I was just distracting you.

845
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:01,620
This cat is of such a good breed.

846
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,700
It's even better looking
than my previous cat.

847
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,380
It doesn't look like a stray at all.

848
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,980
I wonder who left it in my parking lot.

849
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:11,220
(It must be a female neighbor
who likes him)

850
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,340
(that intentionally left the cat.)

851
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:15,180
(Why didn't I think of this way
to get closer to him?)

852
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,580
Mr. Tang.

853
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,300
You don't like cats, do you?

854
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:19,500
What do you think?

855
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,100
Then can you give it to me?

856
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:22,860
I like it.

857
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,860
You want it?

858
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,460
(Of course.)

859
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,340
(I won't let that female neighbor)

860
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,300
(use the cat as a reason)

861
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,380
(to enter his home.)

862
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:38,740
Sure.

863
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,020
Take it home.

864
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,540
Really?

865
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,820
From now on, you're my little kitten.

866
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,340
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

867
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:53,140
I've troubled you today too.

868
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:53,900
Thank you.

869
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,820
Go back early and rest.

870
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,300
Okay.

871
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,060
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

872
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,180
I'll leave now.

873
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,740
Drive safe, Mr. Tang.

874
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:25,260
Yu, I'm here to pick up the cat.

875
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,500
Mimi.

876
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:28,700
Mimi.

877
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:30,900
I'm here to bring you home.

878
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,500
Yu.

879
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,900
Where's my cat?

880
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,700
You're making so much noise
in the morning.

881
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:46,740
Stop looking.

882
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:47,660
I threw it away.

883
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,140
How could you throw it away?

884
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,100
Where did you throw it?

885
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,380
It's a life.

886
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,540
I'm going to pick it back.

887
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:57,700
Come back.

888
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,100
Why are you like this?

889
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,820
You already promised me.

890
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:05,660
- Give it back to me.
- Tang Dingding.

891
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,380
How could you throw it away?

892
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:11,900
You already promised me.

893
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,140
So annoying.

894
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,060
You already promised me.

895
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,660
I've already told Mom.

896
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:25,460
You've never allowed me to raise one
since young.

897
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,620
Mom also didn't allow it.

898
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,660
I finally convinced her,

899
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,460
but you threw it away.

900
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,540
Give it back to me.

901
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:34,500
Go on.

902
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:36,660
Keep the act up.

903
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,540
Return the cat to me!

904
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:43,300
Did Mom really agree?

905
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,300
Yes.

906
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:48,900
Fine. If Mom agrees,

907
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,380
I'll buy another one for you.

908
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:51,660
Really?

909
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,780
Have I ever lied to you?

910
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:58,180
Yu.

911
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:01,620
Did the cat scratch your hand?

912
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:03,780
I got the vaccine. Don't worry.

913
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:06,380
It looks quite serious, though.

914
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:07,780
Let's go to the hospital.

915
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,580
I just said I've gotten the vaccine.

916
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,300
Tang Dingding, you're so noisy.

917
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,860
Leave after you've drank the water.

918
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,060
Yu.

919
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:18,220
What is it?

920
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:20,300
Did you really throw it away?

921
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,660
Someone wanted it.

922
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,820
I gave it to her.

923
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,900
Who was it?

924
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,180
Tang Dingding,
you have so many questions.

925
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,580
How many times have I told you

926
00:45:33,616 --> 00:45:34,900
to change your shoes when you enter.

927
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,580
Remember it next time.

928
00:45:37,488 --> 00:45:38,620
Close the door when you leave.

929
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:42,660
Who did you give it to?

930
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,520
None of your business.

931
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,980
(My brother is like a tiger.)

932
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,580
(Who understands my suffering?)

933
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:06,820
(I've got a kitten!)

934
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,220
(Yu: It's cute.
Rich Lady: Like its owner.)

935
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,140
He chose romance before sister.

936
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:20,620
Mr. Tang.

937
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,820
The Copyright Department sent over

938
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:23,820
a batch of soon-to-expire IPs.

939
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:26,780
They've classified them
and conducted market research.

940
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,496
Our department
also gave professional opinions.

941
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,260
Mr. Du also annotated those suggested

942
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:31,020
for us to keep.

943
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:31,740
Please take a look.

944
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,700
When are these expiring?

945
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,380
In about two months.

946
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:53,740
Done.

947
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,580
Remember to inform Mr. Du.

948
00:46:56,704 --> 00:46:58,020
For those that need contract renewal,

949
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,328
schedule a discussion at the soonest.

950
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,540
Understand.

951
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,380
Mr. Tang, there's one more thing.

952
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:05,740
Speak.

953
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,340
Do you know that you were photographed?

954
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,220
When was it?

955
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:15,660
Last night.

956
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,540
If I'm not mistaken, the title is

957
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,020
"CEO of Time Pictures"

958
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,300
"Accompanies Girlfriend for Cat Checkup".

959
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,580
How did you know?

960
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,020
It's fine. Just ignore it.

961
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:32,780
Understood.

962
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,060
She really got it right.

963
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,020
You're finally out of the crew.

964
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,340
You don't have anywhere to go?
You just had to disturb my work.

965
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,620
Do you think

966
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,900
that a boss will ask a normal employee
for help

967
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:53,060
after getting bitten by a cat?

968
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,660
Fine.

969
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,700
Hand over your phone.

970
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,140
Let me, the love theory master,

971
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,220
analyze it for you.

972
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,620
Let me tell you.

973
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:10,500
Last night was really complicated.

974
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:12,220
At first, he told me

975
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:14,660
the shoes belonged to his sister
as if he was afraid I'd misunderstand.

976
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:15,300
(Tang Yu liked all her posts.)

977
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,740
Immediately after that, he said

978
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,060
if there were rumors about us,
he'd clarify right away.

979
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,060
It's like he looks down on me.

980
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,660
So what exactly is he...

981
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,140
It's quite obvious.

982
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,580
What do you mean?

983
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,140
Men are the type of creatures

984
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,180
to be quite confident
even when they're ordinary.

985
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,900
Not to mention someone like Tang Yu

986
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,180
who is good-looking,

987
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:35,900
capable,

988
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:36,500
and rich.

989
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:38,020
For men like him,

990
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,660
any random woman

991
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:40,900
who walks passes him

992
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:41,860
and takes a second glance,

993
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:43,660
will make him think she likes him,

994
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,220
let alone girls like you

995
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,140
who hang around him every day
like a fangirl.

996
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,180
So he really figured out
that I like him.

997
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,020
Also,

998
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:56,300
didn't you see

999
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,020
that he was flirting with you in Moments

1000
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,820
by asking you to watch the cat?

1001
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,620
He's a real jerk.

1002
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,580
Well, what should I do then?

1003
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:06,900
It's simple.

1004
00:49:07,008 --> 00:49:08,340
When you encounter someone unreliable,

1005
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,460
cut your losses in time.

1006
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:11,060
Why put all your eggs in one basket?

1007
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:21,380
Hello.

1008
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:22,180
Mr. Du.

1009
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,740
The company wants to renew my contract?

1010
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,020
To renew or not,

1011
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:29,900
it depends on you.

1012
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,540
Because, you see,

1013
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,820
you know Mr. Tang's preferences.

1014
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,420
But if you stay with us,

1015
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,220
there might not be opportunities
to film.

1016
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,100
Then why did you

1017
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,740
bring up the contract renewal?

1018
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:43,820
It's Mr. Tang's orders.

1019
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:45,780
Mr. Tang's orders?

1020
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,380
Yes.

1021
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:57,380
Has Mr. Tang read this novel?

1022
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,180
I don't know about that.

1023
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:00,780
He has never mentioned it.

1024
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,340
He just told me

1025
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,500
to discuss the details

1026
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,620
of the contract renewal with you.

1027
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,020
Tang Xin.

1028
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:12,740
Tang Xin.

1029
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:15,580
Mr. Du.

1030
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,340
I think

1031
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:20,100
you can consider it.

1032
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:28,300
(Why did he suddenly
want to renew the contract with me?)

1033
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:30,700
(The shoot hasn't ended yet,)

1034
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:32,500
(and I haven't proposed a new plan.)

1035
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,980
(Could it be like what You Huan said,)

1036
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,500
(that he knows I like him?)

1037
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,460
(It's possible.)

1038
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:41,100
(Even Mr. Gao noticed it.)

1039
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,300
(Maybe he knew it a long time ago.)

1040
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:47,380
(But he doesn't like me.)

1041
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,900
(This might be a compensation for me.)

1042
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,740
(Or maybe,)

1043
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,620
(he does like me a tiny bit.)

1044
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:57,100
(Which was why he broke his own rules)

1045
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:58,540
(and changed his mind.)

1046
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:59,540
Xin.

1047
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:00,820
Let's go eat.

1048
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,380
I still have work. You go ahead and eat.

1049
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:05,580
Okay.

1050
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,700
Remember to eat then.

1051
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,580
Bye.

1052
00:51:12,672 --> 00:51:13,540
(I don't care anymore.)

1053
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,660
(After all, the fact that I like him)

1054
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:16,420
(won't stay a secret.)

1055
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:18,300
(Why not be direct about it?)

1056
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:22,540
(Tang Yu.)

1057
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:24,860
(Here I come.)

1058
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,260
(Six months ago.)
I emailed the arrangements to you.

1059
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,180
Mr. Tang. Mr. Gao.

1060
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,940
Mr. Tang, please have a look.

1061
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,860
This here is the result
of my careful planning

1062
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,780
and thorough research
throughout the night.

1063
00:52:09,856 --> 00:52:11,460
(Tang Yu's Grand Pursuit of Love)
A perfect plan designed for you

1064
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,260
to capture Ming Zhu's heart.

1065
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:18,380
Weren't you reluctant

1066
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,300
when I told you about it yesterday?

1067
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:22,860
That's because I wasn't aware of

1068
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:23,940
how good you are, Mr. Tang.

1069
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,300
A perfect boyfriend

1070
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,060
like you with no weaknesses

1071
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:30,180
has everything it takes
to pursue someone.

1072
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,260
But now

1073
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:34,940
I've brought the cherry on the top.

1074
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,740
Capturing Ming Zhu's heart

1075
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:38,060
is only a matter of time.

1076
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,980
Mr. Gao, let's look at this together.

1077
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:40,780
Okay.

1078
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,900
(Tang Yu's Grand Pursuit of Love.
Process)

1079
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,220
To pursue someone you like,

1080
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:51,180
what's the most direct way?

1081
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:55,740
Of course,
it's to attract her attention.

1082
00:52:56,060 --> 00:52:57,940
So how can you attract her attention

1083
00:52:57,940 --> 00:52:59,180
in the shortest time?

1084
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,500
Understand her preferences
and cater to them.

1085
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,260
This way, you can share many

1086
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,580
common memories with her.

1087
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:08,740
Then...

1088
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,540
Alright, Mr. Tang.

1089
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:46,140
Do you have any questions

1090
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,260
about my presentation today?

1091
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,340
No, I don't.

1092
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:53,340
Good.

1093
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,540
Starting from tomorrow,

1094
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,180
we'll implement the first plan.

1095
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,380
