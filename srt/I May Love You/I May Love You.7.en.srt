I didn't do anything.

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,260
I was just cleaning the trash,

59
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:14,980
and

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,740
Mr. Tang told me not to touch it.

Don't worry, madam.

00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,940
Just get to work.

00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,380

00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,460

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,420
Okay.

72
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,460
The most in need of cleaning
in this room

73
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,180
is the shattered heart
of a young man.

74
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:44,860
What did you say?

75
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,580
Nothing.

76
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,060
You were hearing things.

77
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,900
What brings you here early
in the morning?

78
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,660
Last week's box office premiere
for "Light of Tomorrow" wasn't ideal.

79
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,820
What are your plans?

80
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,620
Isn't it as expected?

81
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,660
After all, this genre
isn't easily accepted by the public.

82
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,580
And due to the change of actors before,

83
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,140
it generated some negative publicity.

84
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,580
Tell the PR department

85
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,420
to take it seriously.

86
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:17,140
Alright.

87
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,260
I'll give them a wake-up call.

88
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,940
Let's aim for a turnaround next week.

89
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:21,940

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,580
If there's nothing else,

91
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,300
I'll get going.

92
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,460
Huo.

93
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,260
Tell Gao Heng

94
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,500
to get me another cup of coffee.

95
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,500
Are you

96
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,740
addicted to coffee?

97
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,220
Just thirsty.

98
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,100
Sure.

99
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,620
Yes. Just deliver it to this address.

100
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,020
I'll bear the postage.

101
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,500
Sure.

102
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,300
Mom.

103
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,780
Did you see the stack
of new delivery slips

104
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,700
I brought back today?

105
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,700
How would I know?

106
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,440
Can't you just order items online
and have them delivered?

107
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,050
What era are we living in?

108
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,490
Why would you order
and deliver yourself?

109
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,420
No way.

110
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,500
This is for Sugar Heart
to put up a front.

111
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,780
It must have a sense of ritual.

112
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,930
What are you up to, Dingding?

113
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,700
(Since Tang Xin
just resigned yesterday,)

114
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,340
(he doesn't look like he's in a good mood.)

115
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,580
(I would be)

116
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,500
(bringing trouble to myself)

117
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,900
(if I said that her book)

118
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,380
(is gaining popularity
and needs additional printing.)

119
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,780
Why are you so quiet?

120
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,780
You never liked reading

121
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,340
but you suddenly
wired 50 thousand to a publisher.

122
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,700
Did you forget

123
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,660
you were using my supplementary card?

124
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,700
Well, it's Tang Xin's book,

125
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,980
the one
you didn't get the copyright for.

126
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,220
I saw her posting an ad on Weibo

127
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,540
regarding a reprint sale,

128
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,100
so I organized a lucky draw.

129
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,900
Would you like one copy?

130
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,140
No, thanks. I have one.

131
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,580
I'll help out in the kitchen.

132
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,300
Mom.

133
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,020
The way you look at me
is making me quite nervous.

134
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,620
Let's eat.

135
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,780
Dad, let's eat.

136
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,500
Your mom has something to tell you.

137
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,490
The company's financial crisis
has been resolved.

138
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,660
Don't give me any more excuses.

139
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,260
You're turning 30 soon.

140
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,660
This year, at least,

141
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,860
bring a girlfriend back.

142
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,700
You're not dwelling on that girl
you didn't manage to get, are you?

143
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,380
Mom, I've told you.

144
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,420
It was a misunderstanding.

145
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,000
Just because you're young, handsome,

146
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,180
and successful in your career

147
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,640
doesn't mean you don't have to worry.

148
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,220
Do you know that latecomers
can easily surpass you?

149
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,820
When you're over 30,

150
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,660
there'll be younger people who are
more handsome and successful than you.

151
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:51,300
By then, you'll be anxious.

152
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,220
Dingding, it's about you.

153
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:54,900
It's you.

154
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,260
Mom.

155
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,420
Every time Yu comes home, you rush him.

156
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,520
Even I can't bear to listen.

157
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,540
Besides, for matters of the heart,

158
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,380
a forced melon won't be sweet.

159
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,260
Dingding is right.

160
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,500
But since you know that,

161
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,060
why do you
keep hanging out with Huo Chendong?

162
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,100
Me?

163
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,260
Huo?

164
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,860
Yeah.

165
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,020
(Yu. Tang Yu.)

166
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,380
(I just helped you.)

167
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,540
(What are you saying?)

168
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,640
Why are you glaring at me?

169
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,260
Isn't he your best friend?

170
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,580
He's my best friend,

171
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,500
so I know him best.

172
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:40,940
Stay away from him.

173
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,940
Do you hear me, Dingding?

174
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,540
I agree with your brother
on this matter.

175
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,180
Huo is unreliable.

176
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,260
I agree too.

177
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,540
You.

178
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,740
Don't be so harsh
on your sister, will you?

179
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,860
She's still young and naive.

180
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,300
As her elder brother,
can't you take good care of her?

181
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,300
Can't you make me worry less?

182
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,620
Exactly.

183
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,540
Dad.

184
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,060
Your mom is right.

185
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,500
Alright.

186
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,020
Mom.

187
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,580
Don't worry.

188
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,860
Perhaps Yu already has a new target.

189
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,900
Tang Dingding, how...

190
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,500
Who is it?

191
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:21,140
No one.

192
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,700
I'm full. I'll head upstairs now.

193
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:26,700
Anyway, Mom.

194
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,500
Mom.

195
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,740
You probably know this person.

196
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,060
You've seen her photo.

197
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,220
Tang Dingding, stop...

198
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,060
I've seen her photo?

199
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,020
I've seen her photo?

200
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,460
Don't listen to her.

201
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,900
They're nonsense.

202
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,100
Let's eat, mom.

203
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,380
Who?

204
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,380
Let's eat.

205
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,860
(Dingding: Something is off between you
and Tang Xin.)

206
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,500
(At the mention of each other,
you both stutter)

207
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,620
(and change the topic.)

208
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,450
(You become completely different
from usual.)

209
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,700
(If you bully me again,)

210
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,580
(I'll share Tang Xin's WeChat to Mom.)

211
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,740
Who is Dingding referring to?

212
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:05,860
Dad. Mom.

213
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,620
I'm full. You guys should eat.

214
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,700
(Working with your brother
won't be pleasant.)

215
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,700
(Perhaps sparks will fly)

216
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,500
(if I work with Mr. Lu.)

217
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:32,300
I'm coming.

218
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,220
Come here.

219
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,060
There are ten more copies here.

220
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,220
- These are for my classmates.
- Oh, my.

221
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,928
This is the content you have to write.

222
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,340
Just write according to this.

223
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,380
Okay, no problem.

224
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,260
I'll sign them.

225
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,500
Let me take a photo of you.

226
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:53,820
Done.

227
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,300
Anyway,
have you finished this book?

228
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,740
Of course.

229
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,860
I finished it
when you and Yu were trending.

230
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,580
It was so interesting. I enjoyed it.

231
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,940
(Dingding: Who wants Miss Sugar Heart's
signed copies?)

232
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,220
(I have one more slot.)

233
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,500
(First come first served.)

234
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,980
Why are there only nine copies here?

235
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,220
Didn't you say 10?

236
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,580
The last book was originally
for my brother,

237
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,930
but I refuse to give it to him now.

238
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,040
(Yu: Get me a new book.)

239
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:40,940
What's wrong?

240
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,820
Forget it.

241
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,420
Sign him a copy or whatever.

242
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,540
What's wrong?

243
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,700
Put it back.

244
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,020
I'm not drinking.

245
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,180
If you're not in the mood,

246
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,020
don't force yourself to work.

247
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,340
Everyone

248
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,140
needs to have a work-life balance

249
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,020
and be concerned

250
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,700
about their mental health.

251
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:00,850
Think about it.

252
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,660
If your constant bad mood

253
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,940
turns into a mental illness

254
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,780
and you fall sick,

255
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,620
what happens to Time?

256
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,260
It'll fall into my hands eventually.

257
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,900
How can you tell I'm not in the mood?

258
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:12,740
Alright.

259
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,020
Look at me

260
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,220
and tell me what's wrong with me today.

261
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,140
Since when have you been normal?

262
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,420
Why are you denying
that you're not in a good mood?

263
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,260
When I came in,

264
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,580
I bumped into an accountant,

265
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,060
and coffee spilled on my collar.

266
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,500
For a perfectionist like you,

267
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,660
you would've made me change long ago.

268
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,620
Wait a minute.

269
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,060
Change into this.

270
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,740
That's what I'm saying.

271
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,260
Hurry up and change.

272
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,740
I will take you somewhere later.

273
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:03,900
Where to?

274
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,740
It's not that you didn't want to drink.

275
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,220
We were in the office, a workplace.

276
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,260
Then why do you have a liquor cabinet?

277
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,340
That was Dingding's idea.

278
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,220
Alright.

279
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,740
Dingding's romantic sense
is much better than yours.

280
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,540
Huo, I'm warning you again.

281
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,740
Stay away from Dingding.

282
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,620
I know.

283
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,340
You say it every day.

284
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,660
I'm telling you.

285
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,260
I'm not interested in
being your brother-in-law.

286
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,520
Or I must have
committed a huge sin in my past life.

287
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,100
If you become a part of my family,

288
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,530
I'll make sure you have a hard time.

289
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,300
I think

290
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,460
someone else wants to
be the Tang family's son-in-law.

291
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,780
No way.

292
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,580
So you're admitting
that you like Tang Xin?

293
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:53,540
Bro.

294
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,300
Be more proactive if you like her.

295
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,900
You can't just sit in the office.

296
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,350
Can you win a girl's heart like that?

297
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,460
Her novel's copyright has expired,

298
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,460
and she has already resigned.

299
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,980
My good brother.

300
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:10,660
Let me ask you.

301
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,260
Must you pursue a girl

302
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,980
who is your employee

303
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,420
or your business partner?

304
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,820
Even if she went to the moon,

305
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,900
you could still buy a spaceship
to pursue her.

306
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,500
Got it?

307
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,460
Listen to me, and you'll be fine.

308
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,380
Be more proactive. Come on.

309
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:42,820
(Mr. Tang.)

310
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,020
(Regarding the new collaboration)

311
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,340
(with another company,)

312
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,180
(there are new developments.)

313
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,500
(They submitted a project proposal)

314
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,680
(and want to present it in a meeting
next week.)

315
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,460
(But currently, the proposal)

316
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,740
(still needs some improvement.)

317
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,900
(We're thinking of meeting)

318
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,780
(their screenwriter in charge
tomorrow.)

319
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,940
(What do you think?)

320
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,100
(Mr. Tang.)

321
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,340
(Mr. Tang?)

322
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,060
Gao Heng, what were you saying?

323
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,620
(I was saying that the new project)

324
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,140
(will be presented
next week.)

325
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,920
(Should we review the proposal
tomorrow?)

326
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,060
Let's decide on that
when we get to the office.

327
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,220
I'm busy right now.

328
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,180
(Okay.)

329
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,460
Something's not right.

330
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,180
(My bestie is on her honeymoon
a thousand miles away)

331
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,100
(but sent me a red packet
to congratulate me)

332
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,140
(for finally
being her career competition.)

333
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,300
(Kisses!)

334
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,580
(This is a great idea.)

335
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,580
(200 yuan. Send red packet.)

336
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,340
(200 yuan. Send red packet.)

337
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,580
(200 yuan. Send red packet.)

338
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
(200 yuan. Send red packet.)

339
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,460
(200 yuan. Send red packet.)

340
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,100
(Let's send one more.)

341
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,780
(200 yuan. Send red packet.)

342
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,260
(Incoming red packets.)

343
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,510
(Why aren't you accepting them?)

344
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,340
(Why should I?)

345
00:19:18,352 --> 00:19:19,420
She's not replying anymore?

346
00:19:24,336 --> 00:19:25,580
I'll give you three seconds.

347
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,620
Three. Two. One.

348
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,180
10 more seconds.

349
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,020
I'm here.

350
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,060
Tang Dingding, this is my home.

351
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,060
Didn't I use to come in directly before?

352
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,860
What's wrong?

353
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,180
Now there's someone in your heart,

354
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,620
I can't even enter your home anymore?

355
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,740
I still have work. Don't bother me.

356
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,660
What should I do
with these copies of "A Dream for You"?

357
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,060
Thank you.

358
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,020
I just remembered.

359
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,300
I gave your book to someone else.

360
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,740
Which one?

361
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,780
Don't get angry after you see it.

362
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,820
This one.

363
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,580
(Tang Yu.)

364
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
(Tang Yu.)

365
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,100
(Tang Yu.)

366
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,580
Tang Yu, are you crazy?

367
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,900
Besides calling me a pig head and crazy,

368
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,580
is there nothing else
you want to say to me?

369
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:34,860
No.

370
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,940
If you want to call me anything else,

371
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,340
go ahead and let it out.

372
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,780
What do you mean?

373
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,540
It's a first to hear someone
asking to be scolded.

374
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,180
Right now, you're like a hedgehog.

375
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,140
If I want to get close to you,

376
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,140
I have to let you poke me first.

377
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:55,820
Mr. Tang.

378
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,100
I have resigned.

379
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,900
(If you really want someone to poke you,)

380
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,500
(go find your current employees.)

381
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,010
They will be more than happy to do it.

382
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,940
Has he gone mad?

383
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,100
Why is reconciliation so difficult?

384
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,340
(Promotional post
for "A Dream for You")

385
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,700
(Tang Yu reposted the post.)

386
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:20,860
Come in.

387
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,740
What's wrong? Is everything okay?

388
00:24:23,776 --> 00:24:24,580
Is something wrong?

389
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,660
What could be wrong?

390
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,180
What?

391
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,940
So it means Time is in trouble.

392
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,104
Time is going bankrupt.

393
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,580
I need to see

394
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,540
if I can sell my shares.

395
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,260
Time is fine.

396
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:36,240
Change your shoes.

397
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,780
Why did you call me over
so late at night?

398
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,860
Let's head inside first.

399
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,820
Don't be like this.

400
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,140
I'm not used to it.

401
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,900
Oh, right. What do you want?

402
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,020
Beer or red wine?

403
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,460
I just happened

404
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,860
to open a new bottle of whiskey.

405
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,700
Try it.

406
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,140
Wait a moment.

407
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,140
Let me prepare myself.

408
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,820
Am I in trouble?

409
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,540
Tell me.

410
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,820
Relax. It has nothing to do with you.

411
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,300
I remember you telling me

412
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,340
that you recently got a girlfriend.

413
00:25:14,272 --> 00:25:15,100
Why are you suddenly

414
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,140
concerned about my personal life?

415
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,540
I also remember you saying

416
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:26,340
that you took her
to a hot spring or go hiking.

417
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,700
Or was it a short trip?

418
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,540
How is your relationship now?

419
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,580
We are doing alright.

420
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,420
I just did some research

421
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,530
and knew she liked the outdoors.

422
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,540
Then I suggested to go to a mountain

423
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,180
for a trip and enjoy the breeze.

424
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,860
I don't think she likes sports.

425
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,340
What did you say?

426
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,700
Nothing.

427
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:47,830
That won't work.

428
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,500
Oh, right.

429
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,900
Do you have any killer moves?

430
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,300
How did you pursue
your previous girlfriends?

431
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,700
I think I understand now.

432
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,180
I know what you're trying to do.

433
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,620
It may seem like
you're concerned about me,

434
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,940
but you're trying to get information

435
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,220
from me

436
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,060
to pursue Tang Xin. Am I right?

437
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,460
Who told you it's Tang Xin?

438
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,500
Not her?

439
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,540
Who

440
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,060
could it be then?

441
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,460
Come on.

442
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,980
Just admit it.

443
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,980
You have special feelings

444
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,340
for her.

445
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,460
I can help you if you'll admit it.

446
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,020
That's the spirit.

447
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,620
Let me tell you.

448
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,140
I think she is a good fit for you.

449
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,980
The first time...

450
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,220
She is not.

451
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,900
This has nothing to do
with compatibility.

452
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,460
I just feel

453
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,700
that Tang Xin is...

454
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,620
She's very...

455
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,540
She's very...

456
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,540
She's very...

457
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,980
Very special.

458
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,500
Special.

459
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,340
That's it.

460
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,180
Actually,

461
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:14,500
here's the thing.

462
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,620
Pursuing a girl

463
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,500
can be very simple.

464
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,820
Just like I said earlier.

465
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,180
Cater to her preferences. That's it.

466
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:24,700
Cater to her preferences.
What does that mean?

467
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,980
Just like

468
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,820
when Tang Xin helped you
pursue Ming Zhu,

469
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,860
didn't she create

470
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,900
a love pursuit plan?

471
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,340
That's catering to her preferences.

472
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,300
(Tang Yu's Pursuit of Love)
This is the result of my planning

473
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,450
and thorough research last night.

474
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,900
A perfect plan designed for you

475
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,660
to capture Ming Zhu's heart.

476
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:48,700
Capturing her heart
is only a matter of time.

477
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,700
(Process)
To pursue someone you like,

478
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,380
what's the most direct way?

479
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,620
Of course,
it's to attract her attention.

480
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,820
So how can you attract her attention

481
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,180
in the shortest time?

482
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,740
Understand her preferences
and cater to them.

483
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,500
This way,

484
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,740
you can share
many common memories with her.

485
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:12,992
Good thing I didn't delete it.

486
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,300
Is this the one?

487
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,620
Yes.

488
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,660
The first step.

489
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,620
Cater to her preferences.

490
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:25,540
Are you familiar with Tang Xin?

491
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,140
I can be both.

492
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,620
Depends on your needs.

493
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,820
Do you know what she likes?

494
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,540
I heard Gao Heng say
that she likes hitching rides.

495
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,180
Get lost.

496
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,020
Whatever.

497
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,740
I'm leaving.

498
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,432
I'll figure this out myself.

499
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,580
Mr. Tang, where are we going?

500
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,660
Fasten the seatbelt first.

501
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,340
Cut.

502
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,860
How can I let a girl do this

503
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,180
on her own at a time like this?

504
00:29:06,784 --> 00:29:07,984
It's not courteous at all.

505
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,380
Mr. Tang, where are we going?

506
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:42,780
Cut!

507
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,140
To be or not to be is a question.

508
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,660
If you're too nervous,
how will girls like you?

509
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,860
They like the domineering CEO types.

510
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,260
So, the male leads in idol dramas

511
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,220
are a good example.

512
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,860
Take note of that, Tang Yu.

513
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,420
Cheer up.

514
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,180
Think about those male leads in dramas.

515
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:09,500
You can do it.

516
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,460
Where are we going, Mr. Tang?

517
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,100
I'll go where I want.

518
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,100
But I'm going to your heart.

519
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,340
Stop.

520
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,300
Why are you so cheesy?

521
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,020
Cut.

522
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,020
I'm cheesy?

523
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,860
But aren't those male leads

524
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,980
all the same?

525
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,380
It seems like girls

526
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,420
don't like them cheesy.

527
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,220
Perhaps those drama male leads

528
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,820
didn't teach us too many truths,

529
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,980
so let's try a different method

530
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,820
and see how it goes.

531
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,180
Where are we going?

532
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,940
Tang Xin.

533
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,060
This is the love train.

534
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,820
There's only one destination

535
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,580
which is your heart.

536
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,700
Sit tight.

537
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,460
We're departing.

538
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:05,980
Wait.

539
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,020
I want to change the destination.

540
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,100
Where to?

541
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,180
Anywhere is fine.

542
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,100
But as far away as possible from you.

543
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,900
As far away as possible.

544
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,460
I failed again.

545
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,500
Tang Yu, you failed again.

546
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,700
Step two.

547
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,940
Create something out of nothing.

548
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,020
Conquer the stomach with delicious food.

549
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,460
This spaghetti looks good.

550
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,820
Duck breast is not bad.

551
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,180
But this shrimp

552
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,940
is hard to peel.

553
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,620
Allow me.

554
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,900
This pizza looks good too.

555
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,340
I like the toppings

556
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,180
but the crust...

557
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,340
The crust might be hard.

558
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,260
I have a tough jaw.

559
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,100
I'll have it.

560
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,180
Beef is good too,

561
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,900
but the appetizer bread...

562
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:53,100
Bread is high in carbohydrates.

563
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,420
It could lead to weight gain.

564
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,180
You have the meat,

565
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,220
and I'll have the bread.

566
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,220
The squid isn't bad too.

567
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,180
But...

568
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,580
Squid tentacles aren't easy to chew.

569
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,940
You won't like it.

570
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:07,980
But don't worry.

571
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:08,860
I'll have it.

572
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,220
Cut.

573
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,980
No wonder men with girlfriends

574
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,980
tend to gain weight.

575
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:18,100
Turns out

576
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,050
they eat everything their girlfriends
don't like.

577
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,540
So Tang Yu,

578
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,140
if you do this,

579
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,460
you might end up like this.

580
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,320
(Calorie +50)

581
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,860
No way.

582
00:32:31,984 --> 00:32:32,850
I wouldn't look good.

583
00:32:33,824 --> 00:32:34,980
I know you love spicy food,

584
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,040
so I've ordered spicy dishes for you.

585
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,780
Did you know

586
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,460
that they say love

587
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:45,180
is sharing three meals a day together?

588
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,340
A relationship can be sustained
if you share food.

589
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,700
You're right. Let's dig in.

590
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,260
Let's eat.

591
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:02,700
Delicious.

592
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:04,900
Fits my taste.

593
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,260
Let me get you some more.

594
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,060
Cut.

595
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,460
Therefore,

596
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,980
do not lie easily.

597
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,460
Lying comes with a price.

598
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,100
You can choose something
she doesn't like

599
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,540
and give it a try.

600
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,340
It might work.

601
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,100
What am I thinking?

602
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:36,780
This is bad.

603
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,020
I beg you.

604
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,700
Can't you let me sleep for a while?

605
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:49,540
Hey.

606
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,860
You're bullying your mentor.

607
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,940
I even taught you generously just now.

608
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,540
Why can't you let me take a nap?

609
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,220
You taught me generously?

610
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,300
Huo Chendong.

611
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,140
I was reading the proposal alone,

612
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,940
but you

613
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,900
were sleeping in bed.

614
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,420
Don't even mention it.

615
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,820
Your bed is quite comfortable.

616
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,220
I might come to sleep here often.

617
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,980
I'll give you the blanket.

618
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,220
My bed is not an option.

619
00:34:13,008 --> 00:34:13,950
Are you leaving me here?

620
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,580
What's going on?

621
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,700
(Time Pictures' Tang Yu)

622
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,860
(reposts
Sugar Heart's re-issuance news.)

623
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,800
(Will "A Dream for You"
undergo changes?)

624
00:34:55,100 --> 00:35:00,480
(Tang Yu reposted:
@Rich But Not Stupid: Support Sugar Heart!)

625
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,260
(Netizen: Is Mr. Tang)

626
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,740
(trying to reclaim the copyright?)

627
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,660
(Netizen: That's so dominant of him!)

628
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,130
(Or did Sugar Heart breach the contract?)

629
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,180
(Netizen: This is amazing.)

630
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,940
(I've never seen an author)

631
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,240
(having such immense popularity.)

632
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,940
(Netizen: Even Zhou Jialu and Peng Zhou)

633
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,140
(reposted Mr. Tang's post.)

634
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,180
(Netizen: Anyway,
who is Rich But Not Stupid?)

635
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,900
(Mr. Tang reposted her post.)

636
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,780
I must be dreaming.

637
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,220
I haven't woken up yet.

638
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,300
Let's go back to sleep.

639
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,620
Come here, Hua Juan.

640
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,940
Let's sleep a little longer.

641
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,580
Come here.

642
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,340
Come here.

643
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,980
Hi, Mr. Lu.

644
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:45,940
(Tang Xin.)

645
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,620
Mr. Lu, you didn't call to gossip,
did you?

646
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,460
You're right.

647
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,740
Tang Yu

648
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,300
hasn't posted on Weibo for centuries.

649
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,700
(Why did he willingly advertise
for you?)

650
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,100
(It can't be that simple.)

651
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,220
Maybe he got dumbfounded by my scolding.

652
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,820
Hey, Tang Xin.

653
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,060
But seriously,

654
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,100
You're not leaving with the contract,
are you?

655
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,140
Why would I?

656
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,260
Am I that kind of person?

657
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:10,860
(Mr. Lu.)

658
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,940
(Don't believe the rumors online, okay?)

659
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,260
Alright.

660
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,020
After you're done with the resignation,

661
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,300
come to the studio, alright?

662
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,100
(Get to know everyone
in the project team.)

663
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,610
(We're preparing to start officially.)

664
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,248
So soon?

665
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,330
I'm worried about trouble
that follows a delay.

666
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,300
Rest assured

667
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,100
that I won't flee.

668
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,180
Sure.

669
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,260
(Bye, Mr. Lu.)

670
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,300
(Thanks for the farewell gift,
Mr. Tang.)

671
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:50,100
(Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Farewell!)

672
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,740
You're here. Come in.

673
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,820
Everyone, let's gather around.

674
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,300
Let me introduce our new partner.

675
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,300
The author of "A Dream for You",
Tang Xin.

676
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:02,540
Please welcome her.

677
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,300
Mr. Lu.

678
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,820
I didn't expect you to bring her in.

679
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,300
No wonder I only saw you parking

680
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,420
but didn't see you come in.

681
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,820
Tang Xin. We're so glad to meet you.

682
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,220
Please lead us to new heights.

683
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,260
Thank you.

684
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,660
But shouldn't Mr. Lu be the one

685
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,820
leading us to new heights?

686
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,860
Me, leading you guys?

687
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,300
Two of my movies have flopped.

688
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,940
They've long lost confidence in me,

689
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,500
but after reading your novel,

690
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,560
everyone finds it amazing.

691
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,140
It's so interesting.

692
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,940
- Thanks.
- Interesting, is it?

693
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,100
No wonder it's so lively here.

694
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,180
It feels like the new year.

695
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,060
Turns out Tang is here.

696
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,940
How about work?

697
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,820
Get back to work and stop looking.

698
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,620
Mr. Feng Cheng, it's been a while.

699
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,780
Welcome, Tang.

700
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:48,140
This way.

701
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,300
How does it feel, Tang?

702
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,820
Our studio isn't bad, right?

703
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,820
It's nice.

704
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,940
Come and have a seat.

705
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,660
Sure. Thanks.

706
00:37:59,180 --> 00:37:59,940
Tang Xin.

707
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,180
Don't be too reserved here with us.

708
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,300
Just relax.

709
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,140
Okay.

710
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,300
We have no outsiders,

711
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,780
and you're familiar with Feng.

712
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,640
He's the chief screenwriter
for this project.

713
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,420
By the way,

714
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,300
Isn't Mr. Wan Li here too?

715
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,540
Why didn't I see him?

716
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,820
Well, Mr. Wan Li

717
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,500
has a minor stomach issue,

718
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,140
- so he's at the hospital now.
- Thanks.

719
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:19,640
Here you go.

720
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,940
Is it serious?

721
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,300
Just an old problem.

722
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,180
Those of us in this line of work

723
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:24,980
often stay up late.

724
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,260
Wan is also a workaholic.

725
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,460
Don't follow his example, okay?

726
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,580
Hear that? Take care of yourself.

727
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,300
Don't pretend to be compassionate here.

728
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,180
If you

729
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,460
don't keep rushing me,

730
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:34,820
I might live a few more years.

731
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,620
Here's the thing, Tang.

732
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:38,940
This is a summary

733
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,820
I made with Mr. Wan

734
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,820
about the concept

735
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,040
and positioning of the project.

736
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,100
You may take a look first.

737
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,540
We're eager to hear the original

738
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:47,300
author's opinions.

739
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,180
Sure. Let me take a look.

740
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:55,660
Take your time reading it.

741
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,780
Feng and I won't distract you anymore.

742
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:58,900
Once you're done,

743
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,180
just knock on our office doors.

744
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,820
My office is on the second floor.

745
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:02,540
Okay.

746
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,780
I'll digest it myself first.

747
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,300
- Go ahead and read them up.
- Okay.

748
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,220
You can get going.

749
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:06,740
Sure.

750
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,500
Later...

751
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,820
Mr. Lu Zhixing's recent short film
has a niche theme.

752
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,620
The theaters couldn't schedule it
at all.

753
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,810
The money he invested on his own

754
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,660
may be to foot the bill
for his passion,

755
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,820
so he'll likely request investment
for his new film.

756
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,420
Mr. Tang.

757
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,620
Are you seeking his studio's

758
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,260
recent market research data

759
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,940
for potential investment?

760
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,300
Do you really think his commercial films

761
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,420
lack investment?

762
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,300
At least in our company,

763
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:41,060
shareholders probably won't easily
approve this investment.

764
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,980
"A Dream For You"

765
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:45,540
may seem like a light fantasy novel,

766
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,100
but the special effects
require a costly price.

767
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,460
Moreover, Mr. Lu's two recent works

768
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,700
did not perform as well as expected
at the box office.

769
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,020
I actually think this is an opportunity.

770
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,580
After all, Lu Zhixing's awards and works

771
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,420
are evident.

772
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,340
Following Tang Xin's IP popularity,

773
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,500
her book is selling like hotcakes.

774
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,060
You're right, Mr. Tang.

775
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:10,940
Come in.

776
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,060
I'll get going, Mr. Tang.

777
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,060
Wait.

778
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,700
Book me a time with Lu Zhixing.

779
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,500
Tell him that I'd like to work with him.

780
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,020
Sure.

781
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,660
You don't usually make a move,

782
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:27,940
but when you do, it's a grand gesture.

783
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,620
Any objections?

784
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:33,100
Sugar Heart is a tough one.

785
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,940
She took the copyright
and ran off to seek refuge with Mr. Lu.

786
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,340
Now, Mr. Tang is chasing after her
with the funds.

787
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,580
Based on your previous views
and preferences,

788
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,420
you wouldn't touch projects
like this at all.

789
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,820
Didn't you just say

790
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,980
that was before?

791
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,700
It's time to expand our market.

792
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,220
We need
to try different types of projects.

793
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,700
You're the boss, anyway.

794
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:55,136
You have your strategic deployment,

795
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:57,940
but I can't guarantee that Tang Xin

796
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,140
will accept it.

797
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,980
Those were some of my thoughts
on the project's positioning.

798
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,300
The original author is indeed different.

799
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,300
What she suggested
for the story's concept

800
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,060
were aspects
we hadn't thought of before.

801
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,460
Right. Lunch is on me today

802
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:17,100
- Sure.
- to celebrate our project's progress.

803
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,500
After Wan comes back,
we'll officially start the project.

804
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,340
- Alright.
- Great.

805
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,300
Is something the matter with you today?

806
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:24,460
Usually when we bug you to treat us,

807
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:27,220
you'd tell us to save up for film works.

808
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,820
You act so stingy.

809
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,220
I'm telling you.

810
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,780
You're being biased now.

811
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,660
I'm not used to it.

812
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:35,020
I think you're right, Feng.

813
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:35,820
How about you treat?

814
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:36,780
Get lost.

815
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,300
Stop arguing. Lunch will be on me.

816
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,460
I'll buy lunch, alright?

817
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,500
No way.

818
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,140
Don't worry.

819
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:42,880
I'm not that broke.

820
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,260
Wait a minute.

821
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:45,420
I have a call.

822
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,780
Speak of the devil, and he shall appear.

823
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,940
It's a call from Wan.

824
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,460
Invite him for lunch.

825
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,140
Yes, hello.

826
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,500
Wan, join us for lunch.

827
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,540
Do you hear him?

828
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:57,980
What?

829
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,380
Feng and I will be right there.

830
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,020
Calm down.

831
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,020
Okay.

832
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,460
- Why?
- What's wrong?

833
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,220
I'm afraid we can't have lunch today.

834
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:11,860
Feng Cheng.

835
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,820
Wan's test results are out.

836
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:14,820
