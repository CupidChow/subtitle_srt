(I'd like to confess to Tang Yu
when he likes me a little more.)

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,000
(Even if just a little more.)

26
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,820
Did you agree?

27
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,620
For real?

28
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,180
As long as your script is good,

29
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,820
I'll follow the company's process

30
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,980
and assign you a suitable producer.

31
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,900
No.

32
00:02:05,088 --> 00:02:05,980
I don't want anyone else.

33
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,660
I want you.

34
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,940
You

35
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,980
only want me?

36
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,180
What I mean is,

37
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,980
I only want you to be my producer

38
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,900
because you're really good.

39
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,540
The total box office of the movie
you produced last year

40
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,660
exceeded three billion.

41
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,820
You're the most talented person I know,

42
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:45,260
and I'm closest to you.

43
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,020
So,

44
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,540
I only want you

45
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,940
to be my producer.

46
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,540
Help me shoot my own script.

47
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,780
I don't want anyone else.

48
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,860
I only trust you.

49
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,020
That's it?

50
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,180
What if I don't agree?

51
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,900
What do you mean?

52
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,500
Tang Yu.

53
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,060
Are you burning the bridges now?

54
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,100
Did I even do anything?

55
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,580
I don't care.

56
00:03:38,096 --> 00:03:40,380
You're the boss of a company
with assets worth over 100 million.

57
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,340
Don't you feel ashamed?

58
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,344
Even if the deal fails,
one must stay righteous.

59
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,260
You'll be laughed at
if this gets leaked.

60
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,300
You know I'm your boss,

61
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,820
yet you treat me so harshly.

62
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,020
If it were someone else,

63
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,300
I would've fired him.

64
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,140
(If it were someone else,)

65
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,780
(I wouldn't be so cautious
in dealing with them.)

66
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,140
So, will you agree or not?

67
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,580
The company has its own production team.

68
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,140
I will find you a suitable producer.

69
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,700
If you don't agree, just say so.

70
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,020
I was just bringing it up
casually anyway.

71
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:21,060
Pretend I didn't say anything.

72
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,620
I'm leaving.

73
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:25,420
Come back.

74
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,700
What?

75
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,780
Weren't you going to chat with me?

76
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,140
I was in a good mood,

77
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,260
so I wanted to chat with you.

78
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,260
But I'm in a bad mood now,

79
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,300
so forget it.

80
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:01,980
I'm so hungry.

81
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,740
I've prepared food for you.

82
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:06,660
Go and have it.

83
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,180
Alright.

84
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:08,820
Go ahead.

85
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,340
Not in the mood?

86
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,900
Why?

87
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,540
Are you upset?

88
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,220
Not really.

89
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,900
I just can't figure it out.

90
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,740
Is it because of Tang Yu again?

91
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,940
You've been down the whole night.

92
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,420
I just don't understand.

93
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,740
How could he reject me so decisively?

94
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,900
He didn't even

95
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,940
give me a chance
to discuss the project with him.

96
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,820
I still don't understand.

97
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,900
What do you like about Tang Yu anyway?

98
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,580
Is the impact of love at first sight

99
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,700
so strong?

100
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,460
Before I met him,

101
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,780
I didn't believe it either,

102
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,340
but it happened.

103
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,580
Four years ago,
I brought "A Dream For You"

104
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,940

The moment

118
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,140
I saw him for the first time,

119
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,820
it was as if Cupid had shot an arrow
into my heart.

120
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,380
Later, after I joined Time Pictures,

121
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,580
I gradually got to know him.

122
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,460
The more I knew,

123
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,020
the more I discovered his strengths.

124
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,660
He's excellent

125
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,140
and ambitious.

126
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,860
As a producer,

127
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,300
he's skilled in content creation

128
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,340
and filming.

129
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,180
He always thinks deeper and further

130
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,060
than others.

131
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:41,940
- Stop.
- He...

132
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,780
If this goes on,

133
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,848
you could praise him all day.

134
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,460
Haven't you thought

135
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,740
about confessing to him?

136
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,660
I have no chance of winning.

137
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,180
I'm afraid that confessing
will ruin the current situation.

138
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,060
Our relationship might change

139
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,540
after ruining the current situation.

140
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,740
I'm an insignificant D-list screenwriter

141
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,660
while he's a billionaire boss.

142
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,980
The amount of fans you have

143
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,540
doesn't put you in the D-list.

144
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,820
I'd like to confess

145
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,060
when he likes me a little more.

146
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,860
Forget it.

147
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,940
Let's not talk about him.

148
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:25,500
I've figured out the pattern.

149
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,980
Whenever everything goes smoothly

150
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,620
and it puts you in a good mood,

151
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,940
you give discounts to my customers,

152
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,820
making me lose a few thousand.

153
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,540
But today, it's fine the way it is.

154
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,620
You're preoccupied,

155
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,580
so any wealthy customer who walks in,

156
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,940
you'll ensure she'll leave
with the priciest outfits.

157
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,220
True.

158
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,380
Selling clothes

159
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,500
can change my mood.

160
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,180
Sounds good.

161
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,700
Don't think too much

162
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,260
about the producer.

163
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,500
If Tang Yu doesn't take it,

164
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,780
there are plenty of others who can.

165
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,300
He's not the only producer

166
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,392
in the whole of China anyway.

167
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,980
Forget about matters of the heart.

168
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,780
In work, don't tie yourself to one tree.

169
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,180
But I just want Tang Yu.

170
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,420
From the very start,

171
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,780
I only wanted him.

172
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,500
You're hopeless.

173
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:15,860
I can't stay any longer.

174
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,340
The factory released a batch of goods.

175
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,140
I need to monitor them.

176
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,060
I'm leaving. Bye.

177
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,100
Watch the store.

178
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,500
If sales are good,
you'll get a bonus.

179
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:24,940
Sure.

180
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,420
Be careful on your way.

181
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,300
Got it.

182
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,260
(Business is here.)

183
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,300
That's the store I told you about.

184
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,220
Each piece of clothing
is a unique handmade design.

185
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:21,900
You'll never clash.

186
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,540
Really?

187
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,100
Then I must try on a few pieces.

188
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,100
The store is perfectly located

189
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,060
by the seaside.

190
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:35,620
Exactly.

191
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:38,700
Have a look.

192
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,580
Welcome.

193
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,580
Good day.

194
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,460
Do look around.

195
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,580
The designs in this store
are really unique.

196
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,100
Yes.

197
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,460
The owner isn't here today,

198
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,980
so I can exercise a little authority

199
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,340
and give you guys a discount.

200
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,700
Is the owner away?

201
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,300
Are you a designer here?

202
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,100
No.

203
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,180
I'm the owner's friend.

204
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,300
I'm just here to watch the store.

205
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:02,180
You're lucky that I'm here today.

206
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,140
Let me show you a little surprise.

207
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,100
This way, please.

208
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,340
These

209
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,860
are seasonal limited editions

210
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,940
by our chief designer.

211
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,460
Pick any.

212
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,380
This floral one is nice.

213
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,820
Yeah. I think it looks good too.

214
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,020
We have some new arrivals too.

215
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,020
Should I bring them out?

216
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:22,500
This one here

217
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,220
is the latest design from our designer.

218
00:11:24,336 --> 00:11:25,700
Only these two colors are available.

219
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,300
How about

220
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,060
trying them together?

221
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,540
Sure. Bring me

222
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,060
all of them.

223
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:44,860
It's pretty.

224
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,500
How is it?

225
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,180
Do you

226
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,700
like this one?

227
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,420
Yes.

228
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,580
This is our exclusive piece.

229
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,460
It's the only one.

230
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,340
Looks good on you.

231
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,180
Really?

232
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,340
What should I do?

233
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,980
I like all of them.

234
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,180
I want them all.

235
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,180
I can reserve them for you.

236
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,100
Really?

237
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,820
Can you reserve all of them for me?

238
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,900
I'm in charge today,

239
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,820
so I can even exercise minor authority

240
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,100
and offer you a discount.

241
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,260
Sounds good.

242
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:08,500
I'll pay.

243
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,500
Sorry

244
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,780
to keep you waiting.

245
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,260
Here's the bill.

246
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,460
Are they all inside?

247
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,380
So expensive?

248
00:12:20,464 --> 00:12:22,220
It wasn't this costly
when I bought it before.

249
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,700
The last dress you tried on just now

250
00:12:24,752 --> 00:12:26,260
is the most expensive one in our store.

251
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,860
Last week, a model said she wanted it,

252
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,900
but our store

253
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,100
doesn't accept online reservations.

254
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:33,340
You have to come to the store
to try it on.

255
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,700
We only sell it to you if it fits.

256
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,380
I saw that you really liked it,

257
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,820
and it looked great on you,

258
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,860
so I kept it for you.

259
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,020
How about this?

260
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,500
If you find it too expensive,

261
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,020
I'll keep the dress for the model

262
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,260
since she'll be coming over soon.

263
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:45,980
Don't.

264
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,740
I'll pay by card.

265
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:48,980
Sure.

266
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,540
Forget it.

267
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,380
I'm going all out

268
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,620
for the limited edition.

269
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,260
Wait.

270
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,820
Do you want all these?

271
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,100
Of course.

272
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,620
Didn't you hear what the promoter said?

273
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,180
That model eyed it for a long time.

274
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,300
If I don't buy it this time,

275
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,700
I won't have another chance.

276
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,900
This is a limited edition.

277
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:18,780
I don't want to regret it later.

278
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,500
Okay.

279
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,180
Please sign here.

280
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:22,860
Here you go.

281
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,460
Miss.

282
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,900
Can you add me on WeChat?

283
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,500
If you have new arrivals in the future,

284
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,460
can you notify me first?

285
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,780
Of course, no problem.

286
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,900
Should I add you?

287
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:32,620
Sure.

288
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,900
You're amazing,

289
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,740
Sugar Heart.

290
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,460
Why would you be a screenwriter?

291
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:43,980
You should be in sales

292
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,260
and become a sales champion,

293
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,380
earning a million-dollar salary.

294
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,340
Calm down.

295
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,420
This is just a routine operation for me.

296
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,260
The pieces I recommended to them

297
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,180
are all treasures
from your hidden collection

298
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,980
and are seasonal limited
handmade high-end designs.

299
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,900
They are young, love fashion,
and have purchasing power.

300
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,740
Wearing quality clothes

301
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,260
to friend gatherings
makes them look prestigious.

302
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,380
You get what you pay for.

303
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,580
They understand it better than us.

304
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,140
You're right.

305
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,260
It makes sense.

306
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,460
High-end handmade collections

307
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,780
require a high cost too.

308
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,380
But I must thank them

309
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,500
for appreciating my designs.

310
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,340
If Mr. Tang knew about

311
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,140
your ability to promote products,

312
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,900
he'd probably be impressed with you too.

313
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,220
He's only been here for a few years,

314
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,620
and his net worth has doubled.

315
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,540
Why would he be impressed

316
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,820
by my insignificant skills?

317
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:37,740
Anyway.

318
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,740
I'll remember your efforts.

319
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:39,660
Tell me.

320
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,500
What reward do you want?

321
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,620
Any amount at your convenience.

322
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,340
No problem.

323
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:45,900
You'll definitely be rewarded.

324
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,300
I'll transfer it to you now.

325
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,140
Transfer me a big amount.

326
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,740
Of course.

327
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,700
- I've been drinking champagne lately.
- Is that so?

328
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,580
Long time no see.

329
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,060
Yeah.

330
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,100
It's a pity

331
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,780
that I've been occupied by work lately.

332
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,500
Don't worry.

333
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,940
I'll come often after this.

334
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,900
Yeah, please do.

335
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,860
Long time no see, Mr. Huo.

336
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,780
Everyone is here. Come on.

337
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,180
Cheers.

338
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,180
Today's drinks are on me,

339
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:11,660
alright?

340
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,820
Sure. Bottoms up.

341
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,820
- You're cool.
- Bye.

342
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,620
Dong.

343
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,620
You're all here. Come on.

344
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,380
Cheers.

345
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,180
An important friend of mine
is here today.

346
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,780
I'll introduce him to you guys, alright?

347
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:29,700
Sure.

348
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,260
Order whatever you want.

349
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,340
(Huo Chendong)
I'll pay the bills.

350
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,220
- Sure.
- Go on.

351
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,660
(Vice President of Time Pictures)
See you later. Bye.

352
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,888
Bye, Dong.

353
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,700
Don't be so tense. Relax.

354
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,540
Indulge yourself.

355
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,300
The fireworks are all for you,

356
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,780
and there's an additional surprise.

357
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,220
Hold up.

358
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,980
Are you introducing a girl to me?

359
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,260
Isn't Ming Zhu enough?

360
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,220
Alright. My mistake.

361
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,500
Have you ever thought about it?

362
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,060
Your mom is pressuring me
about your marriage.

363
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,740
If I don't
solve your relationship issue,

364
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,340
I'll be doomed.

365
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,620
I think you are not busy enough.

366
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,580
Alright.

367
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,420
Bottoms up.

368
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,580
Come.

369
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,140
Besides me,

370
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,260
no one can handle your personality.

371
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,260
With your traits,

372
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,580
forget about finding someone at thirty.

373
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,780
You're destined to grow old alone.

374
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,420
Still bothered about the project?

375
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,100
You mentioned before
about the proposal from Tang Xin.

376
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,660
How about considering it?

377
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,140
It would benefit everyone.

378
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,340
This is a matter of principle.

379
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,060
Trying to cut corners with me

380
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,580
won't work.

381
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,820
If I were Tang Xin,

382
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,140
I'd be feeling stifled now.

383
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,340
You're

384
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,340
just too indifferent.

385
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,260
You were the one seeking help before,

386
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,820
and now you're pushing her away.

387
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,780
You're just

388
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,860
so difficult to deal with.

389
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,100
(I only want you to be my producer.)

390
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,620
The total box office of the movie
you produced last year

391
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,780
exceeded three billion.

392
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,060
You’re the most talented person I know,

393
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,340
and I’m closest to you.

394
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,220
So,

395
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,660
I only want you

396
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,300
(to be my producer.)

397
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,380
(Netizens' comments on Tang Yu.)
What do they mean by Mr. Perfect?

398
00:17:17,392 --> 00:17:18,340
(Netizens' comments on Tang Yu.)
These netizens

399
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,020
(Netizens' comments on Tang Yu.)
are so irresponsible.

400
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,100
Why not accept him if he's so great?

401
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,860
They probably think Yu is too old.

402
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:26,820
Mom.

403
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,860
Don't bother about him.

404
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,140
He likes someone now.

405
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,820
He just hasn't won her over yet.

406
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,460
I guess he's still healing
from the last try.

407
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,740
Who did he pursue but failed with?

408
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,660
How come I didn't know?

409
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,020
I heard it from his friends.

410
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,380
That's Huo, right?

411
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,780
What did he say?

412
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,860
Who's the girl?

413
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,780
Seems like

414
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,980
she's the screenwriter
he collaborated with before.

415
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,500
Pretty talented.

416
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,180
Yu even asked her friend for help,

417
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,100
employing some indirect tactics.

418
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,020
He's quite innocent.

419
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,860
Is the girl attractive?

420
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,420
Can you show me her picture?

421
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,460
How would I know her?

422
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,540
I don't know her name either.

423
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,860
Ask Huo. He must have it.

424
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,540
Quick, have Huo send the photo.

425
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,100
Mom, eat first.

426
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,460
Honey.

427
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,780
Your brother is 30 now.

428
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:16,660
Even if you're not in a hurry, I am.

429
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,260
Hurry. Come on.

430
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,900
Okay.

431
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,140
I'll get it for you.

432
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,660
Hurry.

433
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,180
Geez.

434
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,580
(Dong.)

435
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:34,740
(What are you doing?)

436
00:18:35,312 --> 00:18:36,580
(My mom wants to see Ming Zhu's photo.)

437
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,660
Ming Zhu's photo.

438
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,900
What Ming Zhu?

439
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,940
Ming Zhu?

440
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,260
Did you say Ming Zhu?

441
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,900
What Ming Zhu?

442
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:50,220
You got drunk after a sip of alcohol.

443
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,620
I think

444
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,700
it's probably work stress

445
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,900
and a rough patch in love

446
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,540
making you old.

447
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,280
It's all in your head.

448
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,940
I don't trust you.

449
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,380
I'll go out for a bit.

450
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,220
You're not going to leave me here alone,

451
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,260
are you?

452
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,860
How could I?

453
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,020
I just drank too much water
after boxing this afternoon.

454
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,940
I'll go to the restroom.

455
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,220
I'll be right back.

456
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,020
(Dingding on the phone.)

457
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,620
(Dingding on the phone.)
(Can you do it?)

458
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,020
(Why is it so difficult for you
to send a picture?)

459
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,740
Haven't you received it yet?

460
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,180
I've sent it five or six times.

461
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,780
No, I haven't.

462
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,700
Is there an issue with your WeChat?

463
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,780
Maybe try restarting it.

464
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,900
Send it again.

465
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,700
Still nothing?

466
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,220
I've sent it.

467
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,540
The first one is Ming Zhu.

468
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,140
(The second one)

469
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,980
(is the friend helping him pursue her.)

470
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,460
Why did you send her friend's photo?

471
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,780
(I thought she looked pretty.)

472
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,020
(She is suitable for your brother.)

473
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,220
(So I wanted to show you.)

474
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,460
(Have you received it?)

475
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,660
(Alright, enough chit-chat.)

476
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,460
(I'll hang up now.)

477
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,500
Okay.

478
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,020
Honey.

479
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,860
Did you get the picture?

480
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,220
My face mask is already getting messy.

481
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,260
Did you get it yet?

482
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,740
His network isn't great.

483
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,500
Here it is.

484
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,700
The first one is the one

485
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,100
Yu likes.

486
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:29,700
The second one is her friend,

487
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,780
who helped him pursue her.

488
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,420
Let me see.

489
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,540
This girl looks quite pretty.

490
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,100
Your brother seems to like this type.

491
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,740
No.

492
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,900
I feel like I've seen this girl before.

493
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,420
I think

494
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,540
she's the one
who recommended me clothes.

495
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,500
Isn't she a screenwriter?

496
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,940
Why would she recommend clothes for you?

497
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,380
Are you mistaken?

498
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,100
Let me see.

499
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,780
No.

500
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,220
It is her.

501
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,980
Let me find her WeChat.

502
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,180
What...

503
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,340
What's going on with her?

504
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,260
Why did she reject Yu?

505
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,740
He's outstanding,

506
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,220
good-looking,

507
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,940
and the CEO of a listed company.

508
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,500
Come on.

509
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,020
Other than being handsome and wealthy,

510
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,220
there's nothing special about him.

511
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:33,100
I'm certain

512
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,940
she's the person.

513
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,020
You know how to come back, huh?

514
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,100
What's wrong?

515
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,660
Remember her past kindness?

516
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,700
She's never seriously helped me.

517
00:21:48,512 --> 00:21:49,940
She's been deceiving me for so long.

518
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,620
She definitely has ulterior motives.

519
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,140
I'm certain about it.

520
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,380
The ancient saying is so true.

521
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,210
Keeping close to power
is like staying near a tiger.

522
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,220
However,

523
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,940
she still contributed.

524
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,540
You won't treat me like this
one day, right?

525
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,260
That depends on you.

526
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,140
Enough chit-chat.

527
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:14,820
Let's drink.

528
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,420
I must make Tang Yu

529
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:24,220
see the value of my project.

530
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,660
What should I do?

531
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,660
Hello.

532
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,300
Ming Zhu.

533
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,060
Help.

534
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,740
(What's the matter?)

535
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,620
(You haven't said anything
in the group all night,)

536
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,872
(and now you suddenly need help?)

537
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,300
I'm writing the script.

538
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,660
I finished it,

539
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,500
but it still feels like
something's missing.

540
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:58,220
I don't think this script
deserves a perfect score,

541
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,700
let alone passing at Tang Yu's.

542
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,780
(That's normal.)

543
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,580
(Remember when you
started writing your novel?)

544
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,100
(You never thought it was good enough.)

545
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,340
(You had a bunch of versions)

546
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:09,060
(hidden in a computer folder,)

547
00:23:09,072 --> 00:23:10,460
(too afraid to even look at them.)

548
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,660
How do you know me so well?

549
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,060
Right.

550
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,700
I called to ask

551
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,460
if you knew any professional teachers

552
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,380
who could guide me.

553
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:20,860
(Sure.)

554
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,220
(I'll send you the contact.)

555
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:22,660
Okay.

556
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,580
Thanks.

557
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,096
(You're welcome.)

558
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,420
- Bye.
- (Bye.)

559
00:23:28,192 --> 00:23:29,580
(Renowned screenwriter Feng Cheng will)

560
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,740
(give a lecture
at Nangang Film Academy tomorrow.)

561
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,100
(I've already spoken to him.)

562
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,540
(You can contact him directly.)

563
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,540
(Renowned screenwriter Feng Cheng)

564
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,904
Your idea is interesting.

565
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,180
However,

566
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,940
it can be quite difficult

567
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,500
if you want

568
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,460
to adapt it into a movie.

569
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,140
For example,

570
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,140
the structural issues in this script.

571
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,260
You're still confined

572
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,180
within the framework
of the novel's story

573
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,300
and have applied it to the screenplay.

574
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,700
Hence, the plot feels fragmented,

575
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,700
and

576
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,220
the pacing isn't optimal.

577
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,460
Professor Feng.

578
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,340
I'd like to ask.

579
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,020
If

580
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,100
this structure doesn't work,

581
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,860
how can I improve it in the short term?

582
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,780
How about this?

583
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,420
I've compiled a book list

584
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,460
for my students some time ago.

585
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,180
I can send it to you via WeChat.

586
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,860
Check your phone.

587
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,460
Sure.

588
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,100
Especially the second one.

589
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,060
You should read it.

590
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:17,500
Okay.

591
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:17,980
Got it.

592
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:18,740
Mr. Lu.

593
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,180
About the pacing issue
you mentioned in class,

594
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,312
do you have sample clips
we can refer to and learn from?

595
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:23,940
Mr. Lu.

596
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,780
Can you show us

597
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,700
your director's cut?

598
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,580
(Is that Lu Zhixing the director?)

599
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:45,860
Mr. Lu.

600
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,140
A top-tier director is truly different.

601
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,060
Look, students still

602
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,460
constantly surround him after class.

603
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,020
Unlike me.

604
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,380
I'm a loner.

605
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,420
How about this?

606
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:58,980
Send your questions to Mr. Zheng.

607
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:00,464
I'll give him the responses later.

608
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:00,940
Okay?

609
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,860
Okay.

610
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:04,848
(Lu Zhixing, rising international director)
Feng.

611
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,100
Lu.

612
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,660
Which talented lady are you seeing now?

613
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:09,700
Come on.

614
00:25:09,968 --> 00:25:11,104
Allow me to introduce him.

615
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,140
International renowned director
Lu Zhixing.

616
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,380
This is our web novel goddess,

617
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
author Tang Xin,
who wrote "A Dream for You".

618
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:17,980
Miss Tang.

619
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:19,700
I'm Tang Xin.

620
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,620
Nice to meet you.

621
00:25:20,656 --> 00:25:21,312
Nice to meet you.

622
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:21,940
Have a sit.

623
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,660
"A Dream for You"?

624
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,500
Sounds familiar.

625
00:25:27,504 --> 00:25:29,568
She's the writer. She wants to
adapt it for the screen.

626
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,940
I've heard about this novel.

627
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,100
It was quite popular.

628
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,300
When I was filming previously,

629
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,860
many young girls were reading it.

630
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,300
During my free time, I heard them saying

631
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,300
your book had a vast imagination

632
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,300
and was quite intriguing.

633
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,980
So, it's you who wrote it.

634
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,940
When did you learn

635
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,260
to eavesdrop?

636
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:58,260
Mr. Lu's films have an artistic touch.

637
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,860
It's just

638
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,580
that he's whimsical.

639
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,100
If I weren't whimsical,

640
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,580
I wouldn't be here chatting with you.

641
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,940
I wouldn't have met her.

642
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,780
Why do I feel like

643
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,740
I'm unnecessary here?

644
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,380
Why don't you two exchange WeChat?

645
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,940
I mean it.

646
00:26:13,024 --> 00:26:14,900
You're professionally suited
to guide and mentor her.

647
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,500
Hurry and add each other!

648
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:18,900
Let me scan yours.

649
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,500
Sure.

650
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:22,780
Alright.

651
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,460
It's done.

652
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:24,420
Okay.

653
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,140
I'm outta here.

654
00:26:26,048 --> 00:26:27,580
I actually have
an urgent matter tonight.

655
00:26:27,888 --> 00:26:29,152
You're not treating me to a meal?

656
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,980
Yes, I don't want to waste money
on treating you.

657
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,220
Go on.

658
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:33,780
Alright, I'm off.

659
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:35,020
- Bye.
- Have a safe trip.

660
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:35,780
Bye.

661
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,060
Professor Feng.

662
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,780
Are you familiar with Mr. Lu?

663
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:46,140
We're old friends.

664
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:47,660
Back then,

665
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,100
when he was just a young fellow,

666
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,376
we used to drink together,
talking about movies and literature.

667
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,380
Things are different now.

668
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,220
After a few films, he rose so quickly.

669
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,260
I throw in the towel.

670
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,020
You said you met Ming Zhu yesterday?

671
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,500
Yes.

672
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,260
I went to buy clothes yesterday,

673
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,380
(and happened to run into her.
It seemed like)

674
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,820
(she was looking after a friend's store.)

675
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,620
I spent all the pocket money

676
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,580
you gave me yesterday.

677
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:19,460
Yu.

678
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,780
Do you think she ripped me off?

679
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,060
You think she ripped you off?

680
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,620
Not entirely.

681
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:29,940
After all, the quality of those clothes
is pretty good.

682
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,140
It's worth the price.

683
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,460
(But when I thought)

684
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,860
about what if she ends up with you

685
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,700
and becomes my sister-in-law?

686
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,540
(She could have given me a discount.)

687
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,620
(So I could be left
with some pocket money.)

688
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,900
Isn't that right, Yu?

689
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:46,820
Okay.

690
00:27:47,136 --> 00:27:49,040
I'll transfer you
some pocket money tomorrow.

691
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,260
Yu, I knew you're the best to me.

692
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,060
You know me the most.
You're the best brother in the world.

693
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,220
Cut it out.

694
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,700
But are you sure

695
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,740
the person you met was really Ming Zhu?

696
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,340
(Of course.)

697
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,220
I even saw her post on Moments.

698
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,300
She drew a faceless man.

699
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,260
(I even left a comment.)

700
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,140
(You can go check it out.)

701
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,220
Got it.

702
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:10,940
Bye, then.

703
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:19,980
(Miss.)

704
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,300
(What did you draw?)

705
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,780
(Isn't this Tang Xin?)

706
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,120
(Miss, what did you draw?)

707
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,100
(My boyfriend.)

708
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,780
(You got a boyfriend so soon?)

709
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:47,820
(Right.)

710
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,820
(You're so pretty.)

711
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,420
(But why doesn't your boyfriend
have a face?)

712
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,620
(Well, he does.)

713
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,540
(But I'm afraid he won't agree.)

714
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,420
(Because)

715
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,700

742
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,344
No one else
in the Screenwriting Department?

743
00:31:21,472 --> 00:31:22,500
So many came in for reports

744
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,620
the whole day,

745
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,780

Mr. Tang.

00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,780
This is my new proposal.

752
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,980
I've studied it carefully.

753
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,140
The story logic
of "Nightmare" is very solid,

754
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,260
and the difficulty of adaptation
and remake is not high.

755
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,980
The time period will be greatly reduced.

756
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,300
If I remember correctly,

757
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,540
the crime motive in "Nightmare"

758
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,460
is closely related
to the country's historical background,

759
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:48,500
social issues, and lifestyle habits.

760
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,140
Immigration issues,

761
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,860
economic downturn,

762
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:53,460
individual serving system.
These key backgrounds

763
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,020
do not exist in our country,

764
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,820
making it challenging to adapt.

765
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,780
Adapting is not about copying verbatim.

766
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,060
Our department will

767
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,140
localize the original film,

768
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,820
such as by incorporating...

769
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,540
So you want
to modify the core of the movie?

770
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,680
What's the use of imitating
without grasping the essence?

771
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,860
Take it back and modify it.

772
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,780
You're right.

773
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,260
I'll think about it again.

774
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,340
Mr. Tang.

775
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,500
This is my proposal.

776
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,420
I want to write a spy film.

777
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:20,740
The male lead
is originally in the enemy camp.

778
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,540
After receiving the baptism
of the female lead,

779
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,580
he changes sides

780
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,660
and stages a spy plot in the enemy camp.

781
00:32:27,248 --> 00:32:29,300
It sounds like the theme
and character relationships

782
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,500
are very outdated.

783
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,740
Don't you know innovation?

784
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,500
Do you understand what I mean?

785
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,540
I'll go back and think about it.

786
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:41,820
Mr. Tang.

787
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,300
Inform everyone.

788
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,940
If the proposal is not mature,
don't come over.

789
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,660
Don't waste everyone's time.

790
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,100
(This time,
I must make you approve of me.)

791
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,020
Mr. Gao.

792
00:33:12,048 --> 00:33:13,180
I'm here to report a project.

793
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,180
Mr. Tang.

794
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:16,940
Mr. Tang.

795
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,340
I'm here to report a project to you.

796
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,460
This is my proposal.

797
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,660
"A Dream for You".

798
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,020
Tang Xin.

799
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,940
I thought we made it clear last time.

800
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,340
Your project, I temporarily...

801
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,180
Mr. Tang.

802
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,540
This is unfair.

803
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,140
What's unfair?

804
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,020
Other colleagues in our department
have the opportunity

805
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,980
to formally present their topics
in your office.

806
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,620
I should have this opportunity too.

807
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,180
As for whether to accept it in the end,

808
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,580
you should decide
after listening to my report.

809
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,460
Are you sure your proposal is mature?

810
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,100
Won't it waste everyone's time?

811
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,020
Mr. Tang, rest assured.

812
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,180
I'm ready.

813
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,740
4:20 p.m.

814
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,980
You have only five minutes.

815
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,060
Start.

816
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,100
Five minutes?

817
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,580
But I've prepared a lot.

818
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,820
I won't be able to finish.

819
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:06,860
Mr. Tang.

820
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,540
How about this?

821
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,420
Let me draw a picture.

822
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:08,900
After that,

823
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,060
I'll tell you my ideas.

824
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,740
I'm afraid
I won't be able to explain it. You...

825
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:14,340
I didn't expect presenting a proposal
to involve drawing.

826
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:18,340
Mr. Tang.

827
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,740
Can you please

828
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,020
give me a sheet of paper and a pen?

829
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,460
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

830
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,060
I'll be quick.

831
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,860
(Adaptation and Elaboration
of "A Dream for You")

832
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:52,620
Mr. Tang.

833
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,100
Can you give me a marker?

834
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:55,980
Thank you.

835
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,780
You can't even
draw your boyfriend's face.

836
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,500
Are you sure others

837
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,220
can understand what you draw?

838
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,300
It's fine.

839
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,500
If a face is necessary,

840
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,100
I can use a pig's head as a substitute.

841
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,260
What?

842
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,100
Can't I do that?

843
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,300
Who are you calling a pig's head?

844
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,500
Did it hurt?

845
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,060
I hit you.

846
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:41,740
Did it hurt?

847
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,580
Yes.

848
00:35:50,688 --> 00:35:51,888
Count it as a work injury.

849
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,620
Okay.

850
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,940
Then I want some compensation.

851
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,220
What do you want?

852
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:02,100
You said you'd give me five minutes.

853
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,380
But if I want to tell my story

854
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,420
thoroughly,

855
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,580
that's not enough time.

856
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,220
So I want a little more time.

857
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:08,940
Is that okay?

858
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,620
Then let's start.

859
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,980
Don't waste any more time.

860
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,260
Okay.

861
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,380
Wait for me a moment.

862
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,100
I'll be quick.

863
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,720
(CEO Office)

864
00:36:33,088 --> 00:36:34,140
What are you looking at?

865
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,060
Mr. Huo.

866
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,820
- Mr. Huo.
- Acting all secretive.

867
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,500
Are you looking for Mr. Tang?

868
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,260
Yes.

869
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:41,152
There are some documents
that need his signature.

870
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,340
What's he doing?

871
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,780
What is Tang Xin
talking to him about?

872
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,100
Reporting a project.

873
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,500
Again?

874
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,820
Tang Xin is something else.

875
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,460
She just got scolded by Mr. Tang,

876
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,940
and she's not giving up.

877
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,336
Instead, she's becoming more courageous.

878
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,140
But seriously,

879
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,820
Tang Xin's persistent personality,
like chewing gum,

880
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,020
is almost catching up with mine.

881
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,336
What are you laughing at?

882
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:07,740
Mr. Huo.

883
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,020
You said you're like chewing gum.

884
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,900
I don't think that's a compliment.

885
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,620
Really?

886
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:15,620
I...

887
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,780
I'll go back to work.

888
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:23,700
In conclusion,

889
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,380
Mr. Tang,

890
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,740
the core of the story is

891
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,180
what I wrote in my proposal.

892
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,900
A boy crosses into the comic he drew

893
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,540
and finds the malicious
second female lead inside,

894
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,380
now possessing her own thoughts
and soul.

895
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,700
After a period of interaction,

896
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,660
he realizes her genuinely
kind inner self.

897
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,060
Let me ask you.

898
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:42,900
What is this drawing?

899
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,180
This?

900
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:45,540
A beautiful appearance.

901
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,660
And this?

902
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,740
Soft interior.

903
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,540
This is the soft interior?

904
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,420
What is drawing?

905
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,900
Is my drawing that ugly?

906
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,220
My four-year-old nephew

907
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,540
draws better than you.

908
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,220
I'm not an artist.

909
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,656
I don't need to open an art exhibition.

910
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,820
This drawing is functional.

911
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,380
It helps to understand
characters relations and motives.

912
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,260
Mr. Tang.

913
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,180
Do you understand
relationships and motives now?

914
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,660
Of course.

915
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,580
That's good then.

916
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,180
Mr. Tang.

917
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,860
When you and your true love

918
00:38:22,032 --> 00:38:23,220
discover that neither of you is

919
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,620
the person you used to know,

920
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,020
will you continue to be with her

921
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,020
and try to accept her again?

922
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,740
I haven't really considered this.

923
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,180
Then think about it.

924
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,300
This is another question

925
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,900
in my proposal.

926
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,300
When you love someone,

927
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,300
are you in love
with the person in front of you

928
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,020
or with their unknown side?

929
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,220
Mr. Tang.

930
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:58,180
I think these questions
that you haven't considered

931
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,140
are probably ones
that the audience hasn't either.

932
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,340
But these questions
are actually quite interesting.

933
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:06,580
Especially with
interesting fantasy plots in the novel,

934
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,304
it should be able
to attract the audience.

935
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,900
I'll think about it.

936
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:13,900
Okay.

937
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:14,900
Take a look.

938
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,740
If you have any more questions,

939
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,220
I'm willing to answer them anytime.

940
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,020
Mr. Tang.

941
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,380
Actually,

942
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,100
I have many good qualities.

943
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,060
For example?

944
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,740
For example,

945
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,900
I can play the piano,

946
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,260
and I sing well too.

947
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,380
I have many more...

948
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,020
Forget it.

949
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,900
I can't draw anyway.

950
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,860
You're right.

951
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,900
You really don't draw well.

952
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,140
What did you say?

953
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,180
I don't draw well?

954
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,020
Not only do you not draw well,

955
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,380
you're not very smart either.

956
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,060
You can even draw on your own face.

957
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,020
Where?

958
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,580
On the right side.

959
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,800
It's okay. You don't need to
worry about these details.

960
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,496
Just remember my project.

961
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:27,940
Mr. Tang.

962
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:32,780
Mr. Tang.

963
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,400
Mr. Jiang said he has something
to discuss.

964
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,940
He's waiting for you
in the conference room.

965
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,112
Ask him to wait for me for a while.
I'll go down in a moment.

966
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,060
Okay.

967
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,060
Go back first.

968
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,620
We'll talk about the project tomorrow.

969
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:45,820
Alright.

970
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:49,540
Wait a moment.

971
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,540
The book.

972
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,820
Mr. Tang, take another look.

973
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,220
Remember to wash your face.

974
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,540
Okay.

975
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,420
Mr. Tang.

976
00:41:21,072 --> 00:41:23,020
When Mr. Huo
asked for your signature this afternoon,

977
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,300
he saw Miss Tang drawing in your room.

978
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,220
So he left.

979
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:31,780
What did she draw for you?

980
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,180
She was presenting a project.

981
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:37,020
She was afraid
she couldn't explain it well,

982
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,220
so she drew it for me.

983
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,220
But today,
I got to see her drawing style.

984
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,140
Indeed, it's quite touching.

985
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:50,020
Mr. Tang.

986
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,140
Why are you smiling?

987
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,740
Did I smile?

988
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,580
No, you didn't.

989
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,340
It seems that Miss Tang
is quite special to you.

990
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,940
I have a question I want to ask you.

991
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,620
Are you and her...

992
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:24,980
Are the two of you...

993
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,540
Miss Tang and I?

994
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,820
There's nothing between us.

995
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,700
I don't like her, and vice versa.

996
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,780
Then that day...

997
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,180
Oh.

998
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,260
She bought breakfast for me because...

999
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:46,220
Mr. Tang.

1000
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,340
Mr. Gao.

1001
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:49,980
Work's over.

1002
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,140
The artist is here.

1003
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:10,980
Mr. Tang.

1004
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:12,820
Are you going home later?

1005
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,540
Can you give me a ride?

1006
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,460
It's on your way.

1007
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,620
Where's your car?

1008
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,300
I sent it for maintenance.

1009
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,180
Again?

1010
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,300
Is your car transporting goods?

1011
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,380
Maintenance twice a month.

1012
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:29,260
Well, my...

1013
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,580
My car...

1014
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:32,980
It's...

1015
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,060
It's...

1016
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:36,860
It's...

1017
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,340
maybe a bit different from others'.

1018
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:40,500
Well...

1019
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:41,900
Right.

1020
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:43,700
Mr. Tang.

1021
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:45,780
Miss Tang tricked you last time,

1022
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,220
but it might be real this time.

1023
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,140
Her car wasn't at the 4S Store
for maintenance before.

1024
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:50,656
It was parked in the underground garage.

1025
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:52,580
You...

1026
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,100
Tang Xin.

1027
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:26,900
Aries and Scorpio clash.

1028
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:31,660
Be wary of evoking any negative emotions
in the other person.

1029
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,500
It could lead to a sudden downturn
in the relationship.

1030
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,900
Tang Yu is blood type A.

1031
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,020
I'm blood type O.

1032
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,460
The article I read earlier

1033
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,700
said that these two blood types

1034
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,008
are very suitable for advancing
their relationship this month.

1035
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,700
(This astrologer is inaccurate.)

1036
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:51,660
(Inaccurate.)

1037
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,180
(Last month,
she said my boyfriend and I)

1038
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,420
(would
have conflicts and break up,)

1039
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,900
(but he proposed to me instead.)

1040
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:58,940
See.

1041
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:00,860
I knew this is definitely inaccurate.

1042
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,200
(Tang Yu)

1043
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:36,020
