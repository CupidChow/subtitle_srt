25
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,199
(You must love me too much now.)

26
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,460
(I won.)

27
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,720
Thank you for taking my undesirable son.

28
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,640
Tang Xin.

29
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,240
When are you two getting married?

30
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,539
Don't worry.

31
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,080
We're not urging you.

32
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,339
But you know how it is.

33
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,539
Once you get to that point,
you get hitched.

34
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,459
Whether you want a Chinese wedding

35
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,179
or a Western one, it's fine.
As long as you like it,

36
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,560
we're fine with it.

37
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:34,440
I...

38
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,659
It's not like we
don't want to get married.

39
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,440
We just haven't thought that far.

40
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,760
So you do want to get married.

41
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,939
Okay, okay. I'm not urging.

42
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,320
We're in no hurry.

43
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,459
Yeah.

44
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,299
You two call the shots.

45
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,419
But you should decide
on the date soon.

46
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:52,939
Right.

47
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,720
So we can prepare.

48
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,120
Tang Xin.

49
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,120
Food's almost ready.

50
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,600
Why are you still here?

51
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,040
Where's my brother?

52
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,560
He went and made a call.

53
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,299
Tang Xin.

54
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,419
Tell me.

55
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,760
Since you two
have met each other's parents,

56
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,000
and my brother wants to marry you,

57
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,880
his love for you is at nine points.

58
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,539
No, wait.

59
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,219
Not just that.

60
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:37,219
He loves you so much.

61
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,659
That's full ten points.

62
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,579
Really? Really?

63
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,920
What are you talking about?

64
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,200
That was so hard.

65
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,920
What do you mean ten points?

66
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,680
Nothing.

67
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,099
Nothing?

68
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,520
I saw you two.

69
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,280
Are you hiding something from me? Tell me.

70
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,680
Tang Yu.

71
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,179
Take the food.

72
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,800
Tell them lunch is almost served.

73
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,840
Okay.

74
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,720
Go.

75
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,400
Tell me later.

76
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,059
Let's go.

77
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,080
Have lunch.

78
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,360
Tang Xin.

79
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,120
Do you know that?

80
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,360
What?

81
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,499
Mom.

82
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,720
I'm telling Dad.

83
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,139
Tang Xin is here.

84
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,480
Your dad won't even lecture me.

85
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,339
Come.

86
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,560
Drink with me.

87
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,459
Usually,

88
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,480
it's the son-in-law and father-in-law
drinking a ton,

89
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,720
but it's the other way around for us.

90
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,080
Doesn't feel good, does it?

91
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,019
Get some sleep.

92
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,440
I'll wake you when we get there.

93
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,840
Tang Yu.

94
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,480
Tang Yu.

95
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,520
I'm here.

96
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,880
I like you so much.

97
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,320
Me too.

98
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,480
It's not the same.

99
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,480
The feelings I have for you

100
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,600
can't be described with words.

101
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,600
We're home.

102
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,240
Careful.

103
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,920
You drank so much.

104
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,080
Turn on the lights.

105
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,280
What's wrong?

106
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,299
It's too bright.

107
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,720
Don't turn on the lights.

108
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,080
I want water.

109
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,640

Do you want it?

151
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,920
Answer me.

152
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,120
What's the deal
with the nine and ten points?

153
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,920
It means you want to marry me.

154
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,680
It's not that simple, is it?

155
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,400
Ask Tang Dingding.

156
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,760
She told me that.

157
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,000
You drank today.

158
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,800
Can't be too impulsive.

159
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,800
Be good.

160
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,320
Get some sleep.

161
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,720
Will you stay with me?

162
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,720
Of course.

163
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,600
I'll stay with you
until you fall asleep.

164
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,040
Good night.

165
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,840
You're awake.

166
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,320
I made some noodles for you.

167
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,440
You must be starving.

168
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,680
Done.

169
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,640
Here.

170
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,400
Here's supper.

171
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,440
Okay.

172
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:13,160
I'll give it a try.

173
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,360
How is it?

174
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,200
Just like my dad's cooking.

175
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,019
He gave me the recipe.

176
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,219
Years of experience made this.

177
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,280
It's your favorite flavor.

178
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,480
My dad is really something.

179
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,080
I made that bowl of noodles.

180
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,720
And you're not bad too.

181
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,320
Right.

182
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:57,200
So what kind of proposal do you prefer?

183
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,139
I'm asking for your preference

184
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,720
so I can prepare.

185
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,880
Is that a question you ask me?

186
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,659
At moments

187
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,840
and places like this,

188
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,840
shouldn't proposals be a surprise?

189
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,440
You are so dense.

190
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,379
You're right.

191
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,600
I'll come up with a plan.

192
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,400
Why don't we

193
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,400
look into it more

194
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,200
and narrow down the scope?

195
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,019
Some proposals

196
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,779
are really mortifying.

197
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,040
I don't trust you on this.

198
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:40,640
Me neither.

199
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:43,160
So I made some preparations.

200
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,280
Check it out.

201
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,160
This is too retro.

202
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,600
You don't like retro?

203
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,160
Look at this one then.

204
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,179
This is the one.

205
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,720
This is the mortifying one
I told you about.

206
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,720
Hey.

207
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,400
Don't tell me
you used to have this idea.

208
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,160
No? Good.

209
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,720
- Next.
- Next one, please.

210
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,459
This looks too fake.

211
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,480
Not good enough.

212
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,320
But it has some merits.

213
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,000
If that's the case,

214
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,139
I'll go through

215
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,059
all the most popular proposal ideas

216
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,200
from the last six months with you.

217
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,800
Just kidding.

218
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,339
If it's you,

219
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,480
I'm fine with anything.

220
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,840
I don't need flowers.

221
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,600
I don't need a lot of people.

222
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,920
As long as there's you

223
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,920
and me,

224
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,920
that's enough.

225
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,560
Okay.

226
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,040
I think there's nothing for you to worry
about in relationships now.

227
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,600
Is that work?

228
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,219
"A Dream for You"
has its airing date set.

229
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,659
The promotional material's out.

230
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,979
A few companies' producers

231
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,200
added me on WeChat

232
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,680
and asked me to write them a new script.

233
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,240
They added you on WeChat?

234
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,080
Which companies' producers?

235
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,000
Why do you want to know?

236
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,859
I have to ask them myself.

237
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,219
How dare they

238
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,120
try to steal you from me.

239
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,720
Don't they know you're the wife
of Time Pictures' boss?

240
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,040
I still am not your wife.

241
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,920
Don't get in the way of my career.

242
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,800
Sure.

243
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,400
Since you're not giving me any leeway,

244
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,920
I'll extend a formal invitation.

245
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,379
On behalf of Time Pictures, I now

246
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,560
invite you to join our development team.

247
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,960
Will you take it, Ms. Tang?

248
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,080
I'll think about it.

249
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,080
Sure.

250
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,779
I see I'll have to give you

251
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,560
a copy of the company's intro

252
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,360
so you can know more.

253
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,880
That's good.

254
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,000
Knowing more is always nice.

255
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,880
Mr. Tang.

256
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,040
Do you need my resume

257
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,280
so you can know me more?

258
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,200
I'm amenable to that.

259
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,440
(Lu Studio)

260
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,000
Mr. Lu.

261
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,640
Mr. Lu.

262
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,760
Dingding.

263
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,720
Mr. Lu.

264
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,800
Why's there no one here?

265
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,539
Because it's the weekend.

266
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,520
Everyone's taking a break.

267
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,080
Oh, right.

268
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,560
Present.

269
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,600
Thanks.

270
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,560
Have a seat.

271
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,179
Feng can't make it. Sudden business.

272
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,000
Tang Xin and your brother
are on their way.

273
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,920
You came early.

274
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,640
By just about ten minutes.

275
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,800
They're a couple.

276
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,680
So maybe they'll be slow.

277
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,480
Sit.

278
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,120
It'll be a while before they come.

279
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,120
You can look around.

280
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,960
You haven't gone to the second floor,
have you?

281
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,280
Check out the second floor.

282
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,080
Sure.

283
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,520
I'll call you when it's done here.

284
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,499
(Dingding:
Tang Xin, please get here soon.)

285
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,539
(Feng's not coming.)

286
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,499
(I can't stay in a room
with Mr. Lu alone.)

287
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,419
(I can't control myself.)

288
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:08,400
Hey.

289
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,480
It's a good chance.

290
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,320
What are you saying?

291
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,040
It's about Mr. Lu.

292
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,859
He just texted me.

293
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,499
The hard disk has gone wonky.

294
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,299
It can't be used.

295
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,680
He tells us to skip the meeting.

296
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,800
(Your brother and I have sudden business
to settle. Can't make it.)

297
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,960
- (Seize the chance.)
- What about Dingding?

298
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,040
I'm texting her right now.

299
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,499
There are a few hours
until your meeting.

300
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,120
Why don't we go for the Japanese eatery
at the food district last time?

301
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,440
Anything you want.

302
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,080
What do you think?

303
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,000
It's good. I like it.

304
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,699
You have a lot of stuff here.

305
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,619
Looks expensive.

306
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,899
Aside from these,

307
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,680
I have a collection of old movies.

308
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:29,219
All the old movies you can think of,

309
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,840
I have their disks.

310
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,619
Really? That's good.

311
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,920
Anything you want to see?

312
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,019
If I don't have it, tell me.

313
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,219
I'll try to get a copy.

314
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,400
You can come over and watch it.

315
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,160
Come over here?

316
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,920
My editing room is a theater too.

317
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,360
Want to check it out?

318
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,600
Can I?

319
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,699
I asked you guys here
to see the edited version of the movie.

320
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,960
Of course you can check it out.

321
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,240
Let's go.

322
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,720
I made this video back in university.

323
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,720
It must've been ten years.

324
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,920
Ten years.

325
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,640
I was barely older than ten back then.

326
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,640
Yeah.

327
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,320
I remember a line in this video.

328
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,080
How should I describe

329
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:34,360
this scene I see?

330
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,160
It's a beautiful scene

331
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,480
I've never seen before.

332
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,720
This file

333
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,600
and the folder here

334
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,219
contain all my released

335
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,000
and unreleased works and BTS
over recent years.

336
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,320
Check them out.

337
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:22,760
Hello?

338
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,160
(How's it going, boy?)

339
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,859
Good news.

340
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:29,579
Tang Xin texted me.
She and Tang Yu won't go to the studio.

341
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,699
They're making a chance for you.

342
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,080
Seize it.

343
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,779
What? You guys can't
just make a chance like this.

344
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,419
If you aren't coming, why'd you call?

345
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,120
To check on the progress?

346
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,019
(No. I've been thinking about it,)

347
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,320
(and I'm worried about you.
You might fumble the ball.)

348
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,459
(Right, Lu.)

349
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,699
(Honestly,)

350
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,219
age isn't a problem.

351
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,480
It's the modern era.

352
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,200
What girls need is romance.

353
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,360
We'll talk later.

354
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,360
I...

355
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,880

Delete it,

or keep it around,

380
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,600

You sure you don't want me
to send you off?

420
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,880
Yeah. Just go back.

421
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,659
Yu is getting off work now.

422
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,859
If he finds out,

423
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,680
we'd be selling out Tang Xin.

424
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,040
Fine.

425
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,360
Dingding, this one's for you.

426
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,379
I'll get cavities, Mr. Lu.

427
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:27,979
You won't.

428
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,440
Just brush your teeth.

429
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,000
Alright, go back now.

430
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,200
Bye. Be careful.

431
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,620
(Tang Yu)

432
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,520
Hello?

433
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,720
I'm here.

434
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:04,080
You're picking me up, alright?

435
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,280
Okay, I'll be waiting.

436
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,160
What?

437
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,979
You want to film a proposal video?

438
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,240
And a secret filming too?

439
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,320
That is correct.

440
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,499
Even though Tang Xin

441
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,739
wants it to be simple

442
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,739
and private,

443
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,259
I think

444
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,120
we should at least record it.

445
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,939
My request is simple.

446
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,240
Edit it so it looks pretty.

447
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,280
But not too exaggerated.

448
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,179
Or just make it look lively.

449
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,560
That suits her better.

450
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,880
However,

451
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,160
don't make it flippant. Make it serious.

452
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,720
Alright, I'm stopping you there.

453
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,739
I think you should hire someone else.

454
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,160
I'm busy.

455
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,080
I can't trust anyone else.

456
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,440
I...

457
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,000
I can pay.

458
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,640
I take your silence as agreement.

459
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,800
Hey, that's just forced transaction.

460
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,160
NDA. Sign it.

461
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,000
Fine.

462
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,440
We've known each other for so long.

463
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,160
I'm not checking the contract.

464
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,600
I'll get you the gear.

465
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,339
I'll place the cameras

466
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,699
somewhere hidden.

467
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,240
Try not to have Tang Xin notice it.

468
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,779
And also,

469
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,800
I'll set a few things up
in some hidden spots.

470
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:26,880
Remember.

471
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,960
Find the mark during the proposal.

472
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,920
Alright.

473
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,920
You agreed fast.

474
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,819
I thought

475
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,280
I'd have to hash things out more.

476
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,720
Tang Xin's my friend too.

477
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,440
Just skip the formalities.

478
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,160
Lu, something feels off with you today.

479
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,000
Something's wrong.

480
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,720
You actually

481
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,080
smiled at me.

482
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,179
You were imagining things.

483
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,200
Move.

484
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,539
Just as well.

485
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,579
Look at this.

486
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,059
I picked this ring for Tang Xin.

487
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,640
What kind do you think is better?

488
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,120
You want me to pick a ring for Tang Xin?

489
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,440
You think she'll like what I pick?

490
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,600
You have a point.

491
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,120
I think I need to brush up
my requirements.

492
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,659
You mentioned hiding the cameras?

493
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,040
That's a good idea.

494
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,339
Can you up the number of cameras?

495
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,440
How does eight cameras sound?

496
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,939
How many do you want?

497
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,040
Eight.

498
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,859
Eight?

499
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:45,779
Is that too little?

500
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,040
No, it's enough.

501
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,240
Honestly, you...

502
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,360
Fine.

503
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,459
I'll come up with a plan.

504
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,219
We'll talk after that.

505
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:55,960
Okay?

506
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,280
If nothing else, you can leave now.

507
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,600
Or I'll leave.

508
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,459
Put your back into it.

509
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,360
I want the plan next week the latest.

510
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,539
(Tang Dingding: Mr. Lu.
What are you doing?)

511
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,299
(I think...)

512
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,440
(I think I miss you a little bit.)

513
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,800
I miss you too.

514
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,280
Who's missing you?

515
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,440
None of your business.

516
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,880
Not missing you, that's the point.

517
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,200
Cheeky.

518
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,760
You...

519
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,560
Just buying it?

520
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,800
Buying things out is insincere.

521
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,880
Listen to me, buddy.

522
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,259
If you have no money,

523
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,419
and you buy a gift for the lady,

524
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,640
then it's a rare treasure.

525
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,459
Problem is, you're filthy rich.

526
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,040
And you're still going to just buy stuff?

527
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,699
That's just flippant.

528
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,480
Especially when it's a wedding ring.

529
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,320
So you're saying

530
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,099
I have to make one myself?

531
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,739
Yep. You have tons of talented guys
working for you.

532
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,440
Why not use them?

533
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,160
A toast

534
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,640
to a successful proposal.

535
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,360
Should we engrave something here?

536
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,979
That's so cliché.

537
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,120
I think we should have a film here.

538
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,299
They started dating
during the movie's production.

539
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,339
- Right?
- Is this your proposal

540
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,800
or Tang Yu's proposal?

541
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,480
We'll go with this one.

542
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,760
Beautiful.

543
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,680
I'm prettier.

544
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,240
You're prettier.

545
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,059
One more problem.

546
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,760
Do you know the size of her finger?

547
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,120
Size?

548
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,600
What are you looking at?

549
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,960
Variety show.

550
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,419
You're a movie screenwriter.

551
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,440
Why are you watching variety shows?

552
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,240
It's called getting inspiration.

553
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,979
Maybe one of my future characters

554
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,120
is a variety show producer.

555
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:57,960
Oh, right.

556
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,139
You don't like the new project

557
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,360
and the topic selection the company
gave you two days ago?

558
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,539
I kind of don't want
to write romance for now.

559
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,640
I want to try something new.

560
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,579
Like thriller,

561
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,720
martial arts, or even sci-fi.

562
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,440
Fresh stuff.

563
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,320
You want to transform
Time Pictures again?

564
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,720
Never said I'd write for you guys.

565
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,200
Alley oop.

566
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,840
I can't get your new stuff
even when I'm your boyfriend?

567
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,200
Why don't we do this?

568
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,059
I'll tell Gao Heng to make you

569
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,600
a new screenwriter contract tomorrow.

570
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:49,339
All the original stories you write,

571
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,080
must be given to me first.

572
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:52,059
Unless I don't like them,

573
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,400
then you cannot give it to anyone else.

574
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,379
Even if you
want to take adaptation jobs,

575
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,000
you have to leave some slots for me.

576
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,240
Unless you don't want any projects
in our reserves,

577
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,760
then you can give your slot
to someone else.

578
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,360
But don't worry.

579
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,840
Anything you write,

580
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,880
I'll love it.

581
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,299
This isn't a contract signing.

582
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,880
You're being a bandit.

583
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:21,800
I just don't want you to be duped.

584
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,760
I want you to be a protected girl.

585
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,080
I applaud the thought.

586
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,160
But...

587
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,760
But...

588
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,499
I want to be an independent woman.

589
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,720
I can't rely on you forever.

590
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,619
In case my son

591
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,280
doesn't want to inherit the family,

592
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,819
at least his mother has enough money

593
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,400
for him to chase his dreams.

594
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,120
But then,

595
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,560
his father isn't a stubborn guy.

596
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,379
If he wants to,
he can inherit my wealth.

597
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,000
If he doesn't want to,

598
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,960
he can do what he wants

599
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,080
and date who he wants.

600
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:12,979
What's that?

601
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,720
Nothing.

602
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,760
It's this wide.

603
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:50,440
So you didn't get to measure it?

604
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,840
What was I supposed to do?

605
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:52,779
Tang Xin's smart.

606
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,219
If she finds out,

607
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:55,600
the surprise is ruined.

608
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:56,899
It's alright.

609
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,080
This is fine.

610
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:58,779
Mr. Tang.

611
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,280
The ringmaker I hired is a pro.

612
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:04,080
He only makes three custom rings
like this every year.

613
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,699
If we don't hand in our design,

614
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,200
someone will take up our slot.

615
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,760
How long will it take?

616
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,320
Before "A Dream for You" airs.

617
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,720
I see. Thanks.

618
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,040
I hope we can get the stuff on time.

619
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:16,579
Okay.

620
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,459
We have work to do,

621
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,219
so we'll be leaving.

622
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,080
You do your work.

623
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:19,880
Okay.

624
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,059
Don't worry.

625
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,659
I will not

626
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,600
botch my best friend's happiness.

627
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,200
I'm counting on you.

628
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,280
Aren't you leaving?

629
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,760
Nope.

630
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,800
You...

631
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:39,459
I've gone through the contracts
of the two new artists signing on with us.

632
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,779
I've also given the promotional gifts

633
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,779
for "A Dream for You".

634
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,779
I've also given Mr. Gao the feedback.

635
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,419
Also,

636
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:45,779
the marketing plan you wanted me to do

637
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,499
is in progress now.

638
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,880
I have no work. Just let me
have the day off.

639
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,760
Fine.

640
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,400
Good weather today.

641
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,000
Let's have some coffee.

642
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:19,960
Coffee.

643
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,040
Thanks.

644
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,960
I think the first set's nice.

645
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,779
The lines are clear.

646
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,320
The style's new.

647
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,779
The patterns

648
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,600
have a retro air too.

649
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:36,259
If this is paired with jewelry,

650
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,600
it'll be great.

651
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,040
If we go with the first set,

652
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,600
I can recommend it to some magazines
and get you a cover photo.

653
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,520
It'll be great for marketing.

654
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,080
Thanks, Mr. Huo, but no thanks.

655
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,939
My talents haven't fallen to the point

656
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,880
of needing your recommendation
to survive.

657
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,080
But you do have an eye for aesthetics.

658
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,600
I prefer the first set as well.

659
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,280
I put too much thought
into the two sets after that,

660
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,200
so they feel redundant.

661
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,280
Then the first set it is.

662
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,280
I guess I'm not totally useless.

663
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,219
I've never denied

664
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:17,760
that everyone has flaws and strengths.

665
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,360
But some people

666
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,600
have more of flaws than strengths.

667
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,800
You have a point.

668
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,520
But I think

669
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:31,040
you haven't seen all my strengths yet.

670
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,560
Why don't we try it out?

671
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,699
Try what out?

672
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,080
You're single.

673
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,320
I'm single.

674
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,960
I'll stop you right there. No.

675
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:43,760
If it's fun you want, stay away from me.

676
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,600
All you get from me is a beating.

677
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:02,200
Why are you staring at me?

678
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,600
You talk a lot.

679
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,600
It feels weird when you stop talking.

680
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,019
The best part about me

681
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,280
is I know when to shut up.

682
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,760
You refused me clearly,

683
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,200
and I don't hound people.

684
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:18,720
However,

685
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,800
I have another strength.

686
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,240
I am patient.

687
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,760
Then I'd like to see

688
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,600
if that is really a strength.

689
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,340
(A Dream for You
ETA: 10 days)

690
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,520
I think

691
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,840
it's normal for us to lose out
to Indie Jones 5.

692
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:56,160
It's a Hollywood production,
and our airing slot is the same as theirs.

693
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,939
I've seen that movie.

694
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,739
I don't think

695
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,440
it's better than "A Dream for You".

696
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:01,520
Yeah.

697
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,019
Local movies are on the rise.

698
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,600
We can't give up so easily.

699
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,440
Well said.

700
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,459

00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,000
to this meeting.

702
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,800

00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,000
and celebrate, can't I?

749
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,160
Sweetie.

750
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,339
I thought you said

751
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,339
you wanted to get some fruits
from the supermarket tonight.

752
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,099
Go.

753
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,480
It's late.

754
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,560
But I'm watching the show.

755
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,259
Can I buy it tomorrow?

756
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,440
Of course.

757
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,760
It's so painful all of a sudden.

758
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,379
What's wrong?

759
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,480
Where does it hurt?

760
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:00,680
My teeth.

761
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,339
Your teeth hurt? Here.

762
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,680
Open up. Let me see.

763
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:04,699
Open up and let me see.

764
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,319
Do we have anything
to treat hurting teeth at home?

765
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:07,560
I don't think we have.

766
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,059
I can go down and get some for you.

767
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:10,619
Sure.

768
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:11,779
A hurting tooth

769
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:12,979
can kill.

770
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:13,579
Yeah.

771
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,059
There's ice in the fridge.

772
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:16,699
- Just put them on your cheek.
- Okay.

773
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:17,699
It hurts here too.

774
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,080
I'll go right now.

775
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:19,939
Wait for me.

776
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:21,040
Be careful.

777
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:23,299
Wait for me.
I'll be back as soon as possible.

778
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,400
I'm not in a hurry.

779
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:30,779
Twenty minutes.

780
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:31,520
Done.

781
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,520
Bubble gun.

782
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,080
Good.

783
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:33,720
Where's the ring?

784
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,000
Tang Yu.

785
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,579
I'm back with the meds.

786
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:51,560
Does your tooth still hurt?

787
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,419
Here.

788
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,320
Check it out.

789
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:56,040
This can work.

790
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:58,040
Why are you sweating so much?

791
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,840
Does it hurt a lot?

792
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,000
Um...

793
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:03,800
I was exercising.

794
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:06,579
It helps with the pain.

795
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:06,979
Right.

796
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:07,960
Now it doesn't hurt anymore.

797
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:08,859
It's alright.

798
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:09,179
Sit down.

799
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,120
Thanks for the help.

800
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,600
But...

801
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,120
I'll get you some tissue

802
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,319
- to wipe your sweat.
- It's alright.

803
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:15,099
I'll exercise some more.

804
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:15,880
Go.

805
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,000
It doesn't hurt now.
