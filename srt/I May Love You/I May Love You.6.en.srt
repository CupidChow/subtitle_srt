Mr. Tang asked Tang Xin
to help him pursue a girl.

30
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,100
Apparently, it's Tang Xin's best friend.

What are they?

What are they?

37
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,300
Mr. Tang.

38
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,220
Miss Chen.

00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,060
What were

40
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,900
those two complex relationships

41
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,060
you mentioned?

42
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:28,860
I...

43
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,460
It's...

44
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,180
It's nothing.

Mr. Tang.

59
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,180
Don't agree?

00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,100

101

Answer me.

102
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,140
Why did I only

103
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,860
receive this document to sign just now?

104
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,700
It arrived this morning.

105
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,900
I couldn't send it earlier.

106
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,820
Look over there.

107
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,660
It's three in the afternoon now.

108
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,860
When did your work efficiency
become so low?

109
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,900
Next month's overtime pay
will be deducted.

110
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,500
Come here.

111
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,980
Did you order
this Dragon Boat Festival gift box?

112
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,260
Am I praising you?

113
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,220
When did your taste become this bad?

114
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,016
The overtime pay
for the month after next is also cut.

115
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,620
Mr. Tang.

116
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,460
It's not that bad.

117
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,500
How can these leaves

118
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,980
wilt like this?

119
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:37,980
Mr. Tang.

120
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,060
It's just a little yellowish.

121
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,340
There aren't any other issues.

122
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,260
There's a little.

123
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,220
When did your work attitude

124
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,140
and standards drop so low?

125
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,980
The overtime pay for next quarter...

126
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,740
Mr. Tang.

127
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,460
Please spare me.

128
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,820
If you keep deducting,

129
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,060
I'll end up doing ten years
of free overtime.

130
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,700
So, you're not unwilling?

131
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,100
I've reviewed all
edited "White Dew" pages you had open.

132
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,980
The changes are very accurate.

133
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,620
Thanks, Ms. Chen.

134
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,980
I've discussed these
in advance with the director,

135
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,260
so the modifications are accurate.

136
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,380
No need to be modest.

137
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,140
This morning,

138
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,580
I already discussed it
with the director.

139
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:28,140
He kept praising you,

140
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,220
saying you are diligent and serious,

141
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:32,540
and your script-writing skills
are pretty good.

142
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,780
Even though you lack experience,

143
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,220
the good outweighs the bad.

144
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,660
Thank you for your affirmation.

145
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,580
I've gained a lot

146
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,740
of inspiration from my time
with the crew.

147
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:46,900
Keep up the good work.

148
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,180
At this pace,

149
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,740
you'll soon be able
to handle projects independently.

150
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,260
Handle projects independently?

151
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,100
Yes.

152
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:56,176
You've worked hard
for "White Dew" for so long.

153
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,340
It can't be for nothing.

154
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,140
I'll talk to Mr. Tang later

155
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,660
to fight for a co-writing credit
for you.

156
00:09:02,544 --> 00:09:04,144
Once "White Dew"
is completely wrapped up,

157
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,220
you can
join the new development project.

158
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,820
Even if we can't start right away,

159
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,980
we have other projects
to work on, right?

160
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,300
Thank you for your trust
and acknowledgment.

161
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,500
But

162
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,780
honestly,

163
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,580
the project I most want to work on

164
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,700
is still "A Dream for You".

165
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:29,580
However, I heard
this project won't stay with Time.

166
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,180
Mr. Tang.

167
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,420
Miss Tang is here.

168
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,100
Let her in.

169
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:00,700
Mr. Tang.

170
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,460
I want to request
to leave the current project team.

171
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:06,380
The shooting for this project
is already two-thirds done,

172
00:10:06,448 --> 00:10:08,100
and the script hardly
needs further work.

173
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,900
Hold on.

174
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,820
Leaving the project team?

175
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,540
What's next?

176
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,780
What do you mean?

177
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,060
Why leave the project team?

178
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,940
My script has been almost fully revised.

179
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,664
You can rest assured
on Mr. Jiang's side.

180
00:10:29,664 --> 00:10:31,020
I've confirmed with him.

181
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,700
He said my further involvement
isn't required.

182
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,500
So, I want to step back.

183
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,020
Mr. Tang, what do you mean by that?

184
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,700
Isn't it normal

185
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,020
for a writer to leave a project?

186
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,500
Some writers have done the same
in previous projects.

187
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,060
Where to

188
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,140
after you leave?

189
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,540
To meet Mr. Lu, right?

190
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,420
If you want to leave, go ahead.

191
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,300
If there are good projects
in the future...

192
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:36,820
Okay.

193
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:37,940
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

194
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,940
I just thought about it.

195
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,420
Maybe what you said is right.

196
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,060
I might indeed leave Time.

197
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,500
After signing with Mr. Lu,

198
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,120
I'll apply to join the project team.

199
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,540
He should agree.

200
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,060
I am the author, after all.

201
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,540
What do you mean, Tang Xin?

202
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,220
I said I want to resign.

203
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:59,620
(Huo Chendong)

204
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,820
I'm not in such a rush to resign though.

205
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,060
I'll get busy downstairs.

206
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,220
Wait.

207
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,120
(Huo Chendong
Reject)

208
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,660
Anything else, Mr. Tang?

209
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,120
(Huo Chendong
Reject)

210
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:24,940
Are you sure?

211
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,900
You want to resign?

212
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,580
I'm going to shoot my movie.

213
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,700
It's better than staying here, right?

214
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,420
Mr. Tang.

215
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,980
Don't you feel uncomfortable

216
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,980
seeing me?

217
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,580
Well, seeing you

218
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,780
does make me uncomfortable.

219
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,060
Mr. Gao.

220
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:53,860
You're not wearing contact lenses now.

221
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,220
You look good.

222
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,580
Thanks.

223
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,180
I'll go downstairs now.

224
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,060
(I just told Tang Yu
that I'm resigning.)

225
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,220
Are you done calling me?

226
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,300
What do you want?

227
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,060
Why are you so angry?

228
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,140
I just wanted to remind you
about the class reunion later.

229
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,580
Mr. Tang.

230
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,540
You have to tell us

231
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,740
if you have any good projects.

232
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,380
That's right.

233
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,460
We also want to make money.

234
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,140
Mr. Lu is here.

235
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:02,300
Mr. Lu.

236
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,340
Mr. Lu.

237
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,460
Mr. Lu is here.

238
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,020
What's going on?

239
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,460
What's with this commotion?

240
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,220
Mr. Lu.

241
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,540
Your masterpiece "Imbalanced"

242
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,580
won two major awards.

243
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:13,460
Congratulations.

244
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,460
It's nothing.

245
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,460
We're all counting on you now.

246
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,580
You need to win awards
globally and locally.

247
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:18,980
Right?

248
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,900
Let me tell you.

249
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,980
Don't make fun of me.

250
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,820
"Imbalanced"

251
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,900
is leveraging its past reputation.

252
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,820
Outsiders might not see it,

253
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,980
but can't you?

254
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,860
He's being modest.

255
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,340
Have a seat.

256
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,540
Come, Mr. Lu. Have a seat.

257
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,260
Come, Mr. Lu.

258
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,060
Take a seat, Mr. Lu.

259
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:40,580
Come on.

260
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,180
I have to say.

261
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,060
Tang Yu's vision

262
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,500
has always been excellent.

263
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,380
Look at his Time Pictures.

264
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:50,900
Their films in the last two years

265
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,340
have been high-grossing hits.

266
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,540
Yeah, it's a sure bet.

267
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:54,900
- Right?
- Yeah.

268
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,260
Time Pictures

269
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,700
won't take long

270
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:59,580
to take the top spot
among local film companies

271
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,740
within two years, right?

272
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,700
You bet. In our school days,

273
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,380
Mr. Tang's vision
was already different from ours.

274
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,180
While we were focused

275
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,020
on academic artistic expression,

276
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,260
he was already
conducting market research and analysis.

277
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,500
Yeah.

278
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,340
Being ahead

279
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,580
isn't always the best.

280
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,540
In certain aspects,

281
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,260
Mr. Lu is indeed exceptional.

282
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,340
I want to ask something.

283
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,820
How are things between you two?

284
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,580
It's been trending for days.

285
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,780
Don't you know

286
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,540
about their drama?

287
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,860
Back in school, they...

288
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,580
By the way, Zhang.

289
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,140
You're getting married soon.
Where are the invites?

290
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,340
Where are they?

291
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,500
We haven't received it.

292
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,180
The red packets are already readied.

293
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,780
I'm trying to get married in secret.

294
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,060
And you, Tai.

295
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,180
You have a second child now.

296
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,100
Why didn't you tell us?

297
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,500
Aren't we classmates?

298
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,140
I already have three children.

299
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,820
Three.

300
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,740
Congratulations.

301
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,780
Everyone's here.
Let's get in seats and start ordering.

302
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,780
Have a seat.

303
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,940
Let's order.

304
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,940
I want sweet and sour fish.

305
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,420
Thanks.

306
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,780
Some people

307
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,260
are used to being superiors
and see others as assistants.

308
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,740
This isn't a good habit.

309
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,740
You're unwilling
to lend a helping hand.

310
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,100
You sure are a big name, Mr. Lu.

311
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,740
Nice move.

312
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,780
The project's taken.

313
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,180
So is the talent.

314
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,380
Birds choose trees to roost.

315
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,420
If your company's talent
wants to join me,

316
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,940
it means one thing.

317
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,900
I'm more attractive than you.

318
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,220
Birds choose trees to roost?

319
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,540
I believe it's the wind
not stopping when the tree wants calm.

320
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,140
If Tang Xin sees you like this,

321
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,420
she might not choose
to continue working together.

322
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,540
Is that so?

323
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,500
Tang Xin is coming?

324
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,180
That's fantastic.

325
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,460
Thanks, Mr. Tang,

326
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,300
for being generous.

327
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,540
Don't get too excited too soon.

328
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,380
I never said to be generous.

329
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,740
"A Dream for You" is about to expire.

330
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,100
Shall we hold a transition ceremony?

331
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,420
We're trending on Weibo.

332
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,580
Your Time Pictures can catch the hype

333
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,848
and get the attention for free.

334
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,940
At my side, I'll try harder

335
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,980
to lure her over as soon as possible.

336
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,340
What do you think?

337
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,180
Mr. Lu.

338
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:00,860
As expected from an artistic director.

339
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,180
You criticized

340
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,140
without resorting to vulgar language.

341
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,700
We've been classmates for years,

342
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,140
so there is friendship, right?

343
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,860
It's rare to see Mr. Tang reluctant.

344
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,220
Let him keep her, will you?

345
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,980
What is this?

346
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,580
I finally found a talent that fits well.

347
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,220
I refuse.

348
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,700
Where are you going?

349
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,900
Mr. Tang, why are you leaving?

350
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,300
Why did he leave?

351
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,740
It's fine.

352
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:31,820
He went to the restroom.

353
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,420
Let's eat first.

354
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,460
Narrow-minded.

355
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,340
Good morning.

356
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:43,552
Where are you going?

357
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,620
Where are you going?

358
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:54,940
(Tang Xin.)

359
00:18:55,104 --> 00:18:56,140
(Contract sent to your email.)

360
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,220
(Take a look first.)

361
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,300
(If it's okay,)

362
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,232
(we'll discuss it further.)

363
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,500
(Party A invite Party B to join the writing team)
Inviting me to join the writing team?

364
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,100
Hua Juan.

365
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,700
Did you hear?

366
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,460
Did you hear?

367
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,340
Did you hear?

368
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,500
Mr. Lu is inviting me
to join the writing team.

369
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,660
Hua Juan.

370
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:34,980
Hold on.

371
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,448
Let me reply to a message.

372
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,060
Wait for me.

373
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,420
I'll reply to a message.

374
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,140
(I've read the contract.)

375
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:44,980
(There's no problem.)

376
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,460
(Thanks for appreciating me, Mr. Lu.)

377
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,060
(I'll work hard after signing)

378
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,980
(and repay your kindness
for scouting me.)

379
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,500
(Signing in two days.)

380
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,140
Signing?

381
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,340
Tang Xin has been absent lately, huh?

382
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,260
If you're really concerned
about the copyright,

383
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,060
you should have a proper talk with her.

384
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,100
You're nosy.

385
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:22,860
Pfft.

386
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:23,900
Tang Xin.

387
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:26,940
Mr. Tang.

388
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:27,580
Mr. Huo.

389
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,860
We'll have lunch later.

390
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:56,940
Join us.

391
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:58,860
No thanks.

392
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,592
I'm here to get something,
and I'll leave.

393
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,420
Tang Xin.

394
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,180
How can you just leave
with someone so easily?

395
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,740
Mr. Tang is still here.

396
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:18,980
People aim higher.

397
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:22,480
I've reached.

398
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,700
I'll leave now.

399
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:24,260
Bye.

400
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,060
Okay.

401
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:25,860
Bye.

402
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,420
Tang Xin.

403
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,420
Anything else, Mr. Tang?

404
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,820
If you sign with Time,

405
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,520
the project will start immediately.

406
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,940
As the lead scriptwriter,

407
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,580
you can negotiate any terms.

408
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,500
Also,

409
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,580
I'll be your producer.

410
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,660
You don't have to.

411
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,860
I remember what you said before.

412
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,500
I've never given up

413
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,260
on this project.

414
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,180
Tang Xin.

415
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,580
I can see your progress

416
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,780
during this period.

417
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,740
Besides, the commercial value
of "A Dream for You"

418
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,100
has indeed improved.

419
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,500
As the one in charge of Time,

420
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,420
I believe it's time

421
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,740
to develop this project.

422
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:54,740
No need.

423
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,500
I want Mr. Lu to direct it.

424
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,340
Give me a reason.

425
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,260
When I was talking to him,

426
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:04,900
I could feel

427
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,860
that he genuinely loves this book

428
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,980
and wants to adapt it into a movie.

429
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,140
Of course.

430
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,260
I know you take every project
seriously too.

431
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,180
But one is for business,

432
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,900
and the other is for art.

433
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:19,700
If you were me,

434
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,500
who would you choose?

435
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,660
Tang Xin, how do you know

436
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,500
that I'm not genuinely
interested in this project?

437
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,380
Tang Yu.

438
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,460
You've never read my novel, have you?

439
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,460
Have you ever thought

440
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,780
about understanding my world?

441
00:23:37,056 --> 00:23:38,220
You say we're not a good fit.

442
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,300
Maybe you're right.

443
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,180
Since that's the case,

444
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,540
we're not suitable
for a collaborative project.

445
00:23:44,112 --> 00:23:46,020
My earlier suggestion
of having you as my producer

446
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,168
was an oversight on my part.

447
00:23:48,048 --> 00:23:49,140
Just forget I mentioned it.

448
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,460
(Tang Yu, you big oaf.)

449
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,380
(I'm done with you.)

450
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,940
Surprisingly,

451
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,940
Tang Xin is quite brave.

452
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,860
She's chasing her dreams.
It's worthy of encouragement.

453
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,340
Good for her.

454
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,460
It's good for her
to gain experience out there.

455
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,340
Even if she's not doing well out there,

456
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,700
she still has you, who's waiting here.

457
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,820
Right?

458
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,340
Ignore what I said.

459
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,700
If you really want
to keep the copyright,

460
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,500
you can be a bit more forceful
in your approach

461
00:24:37,552 --> 00:24:39,184
by setting up the project team
right away.

462
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,232
It never occurred to you?

463
00:24:45,008 --> 00:24:46,540
I don't want
to complicate things for her.

464
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,820
("A Dream for You")

465
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,860
(May you have a vibrant life and someone)

466
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,020
(who can share the richness together.)

467
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,540
(Tears glisten in the eyes of Yi)

468
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,300
as she looks at Su Yu.

469
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,500
Su Yu.

470
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,780
I know you haven't fallen asleep yet,

471
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,180
so I want to chat with you.

472
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,620
I know what you're resentful about.

473
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,820
But this world, for me,

474
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,340
is a completely new place.

475
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,020
(Since I arrived here,)

476
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,980
(I've been questioning the life)

477
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,100
(I've known for the past 25 years.)

478
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,260
(Yet, I still haven't adapted
to this place.)

479
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,940
(I don't know what my future holds.)

480
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,260
(I feel that it is uncertain.)

481
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,980
(Su Yu looked earnestly into Yi's eyes.)

482
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,260
If you ask me whether I still love you,

483
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,300
the answer is a definite yes.

484
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,460
(Hearing this,)

485
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,380
(Yi smiled
with tears streaming down her face.)

486
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,420
(Didn't you want to pursue Ming Zhu?)

487
00:27:21,776 --> 00:27:22,940
(Six months ago)
I didn't say that.

488
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,180
You've been emphasizing
that we're a good fit.

489
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,140
Let me introduce you.

490
00:27:27,344 --> 00:27:29,100
This is Tang Xin
from Screenwriting Department,

491
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,100
Ming Zhu's best friend

492
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,180
since childhood.

493
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,700
I've told her about you.

494
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,900
So, you're on the same page as him,

495
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:39,296
believing that Ming Zhu and I
make a good match?

496
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,020
I...

497
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:46,580
I...

498
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,580
Mr. Tang, I feel that you two...

499
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,900
You two make a good match.

500
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,220
A perfect match.

501
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,340
One is a producer,

502
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,900
and the other
is a promising screenwriter.

503
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,500
When "White Dew to Frost" is out,

504
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,140
imagine the marketing synergy
you two could create!

505
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:58,860
Don't you agree?

506
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,180
I'm not asking you.

507
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,260
I'm asking her.

508
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,380
What do you think?

509
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:13,820
Mr. Tang.

510
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,860
I can help you pursue Ming Zhu,

511
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,900
but pursuing a girl is not easy.

512
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,620
So,

513
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,500
you'll have to listen to me from now on.

514
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,420
Follow my instructions.

515
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,060
Sure.

516
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,540
This one's for you.

517
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,080
("A Dream for You")
What's this?

518
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,500
It's my novel.

519
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,620
It's a gift for you.

520
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,020
(Hello.)

521
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:08,780
(Tang Yu.)

522
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,060
(Welcome to my world.)

523
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,220
Congratulations to Miss Sugar Heart

524
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,780
for the reprint of "A Dream for You".

525
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,928
The new copies
will be in the factory tonight.

526
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:32,420
By the way,

527
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,180
I have some good news for you.

528
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:35,300
Do you know

529
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,300
you have a fan who has a lot of money?

530
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,020
This fan called the publishing house,

531
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,860
ordered a thousand copies,

532
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,540
and even organized some kind

533
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,060
of lottery to post on Weibo.

534
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,340
Why don't you repost it now
and thank that fan?

535
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,980
You really don't know about this?

536
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,100
(Rich but Not Stupid)
(I'm here to support Miss Sugar Heart.)

537
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,420
(Share this Weibo post,)

538
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,060
(and 1000 lucky readers
will receive free copies)

539
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,340
(of the book along with all the products
on the activity page.)

540
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,380
Take a closer look.

541
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:03,980
This account is called

542
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,420
"Rich but Not Stupid".

543
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:07,660
I must

544
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,060
thank her well.

545
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,260
(Sugar Heart)
(Miss Rich. Hello there.)

546
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,060
(It's so generous of you
to offer 1000 free copies.)

547
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,580
(I don't know what to say.)

548
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,860
(If there's a chance,
let me treat you to a meal.)

549
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,380
(Dingding)
(You're welcome.)

550
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,700
(I'll accept the meal offer.)

551
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:42,580
(I see many fans are doing this kind
of reposting activity.)

552
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:43,700
(I thought about it.)

553
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,660
(If we're doing this,)

554
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,980
(why not go all out?)

555
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:49,020
(This amount of money is nothing
compared to what I spent)

556
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,980
(at You Huan's shop once.)

557
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,660
(You sure handle money well.)

558
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,820

(So, can you tell me what happened
between you and my brother?)

561
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,940
(Why didn't you
renew the contract with him?)

562
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,820
(I've asked him.)

563
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,140
(He wanted to renew the contract,)

564
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,780
(but you didn't agree.)

to buy gossip with money?)

581
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,020
Hey, Mr. Lu.

582
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,540
I saw you posted on Weibo,

583
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,500
so I shared it.

584
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,940
(Once I finish the work at hand,)

585
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:42,420
we will form a project team.

586
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,540
At the latest,
by the middle of next month.

587
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,780
So soon?

588
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,380
I'll wait for your notice.

589
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,500
I'm available anytime.

590
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,220
Do you not have any work at hand?

591
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,020
(I'm planning to resign.)

592
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,180
Great.

593
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,100
Come join me then.

594
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:01,540
Sure.

595
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,300
I look forward to working with you.

599
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,340
Miss Chen.

600
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,540
Hey, Tang Xin.

601
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,700
I'm here to see Mr. Tang.

602
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,140
Sure.

603
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:36,780
Just a moment.

604
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,500
Mr. Tang.

605
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,460
Miss Tang Xin is here.

606
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,580
Alright.

607
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,140
Miss Tang.

608
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:52,672
Mr. Tang asked you to come in.

609
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:08,460
What's going on?

610
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,340
You don't have work?

611
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,900
I'm just curious. Is that not allowed?

612
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:17,340
Curious?

613
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,020
The last time you were curious,

614
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,980
it cost me a month's overtime pay.

615
00:34:21,168 --> 00:34:22,460
You said you'd treat me to a meal,

616
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,340
but in the end, I paid for it myself.

617
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,500
You're stingy.

618
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,260
I'm stingy?

619
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,260
Yeah.

620
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:37,340
Mr. Tang.

621
00:34:40,064 --> 00:34:41,100
Would you like some juice?

622
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,740
I'll ask them
to pour you orange juice.

623
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,420
No need.

624
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:45,260
It just takes a minute.

625
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:53,820
What is it?

626
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,620
You want to resign?

627
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:56,980
So you know.

628
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,820
Impressive.

629
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:12,580
I'll be joining Mr. Lu's project team
in a few days.

630
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,620
My work here is almost done.

631
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,908
(Resignation Letter)
So, I'm resigning.

632
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,820
You don't have to resign
to join his project team.

633
00:35:22,464 --> 00:35:23,820
You can finish the work there first,

634
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:24,980
and then come back.

635
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,540
No need.

636
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,180
I don't want to return.

637
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,460
Why not?

638
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:31,168
Our situation is kind of awkward now.

639
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,180
It's not good for me to stay.

640
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,260
Besides, Time doesn't really suit me.

641
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:39,940
I mean the type of projects.

642
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,100
That's all.

643
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,420
I'm leaving.

644
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,980
See you around.

645
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,140
Just like that?

646
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,780
You're leaving just like that?

647
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,580
What else can I do?

648
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,340
Continue clinging to you?

649
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,020
Tang Xin, I just said it.

650
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,180
You can join his team

651
00:36:06,896 --> 00:36:08,060
and return here once you're done.

652
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,340
You don't have to quit.

653
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,540
There will be projects that suit you.

654
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,780
Projects that interest you.

655
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,220
If you want,

656
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,420
they will come.

657
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:49,820
You're hurting me.

658
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:04,820
You rejected me.

659
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,660
Isn't it better for me to stay far away?

660
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,180
Or do you like persistent pursuers?

661
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,420
Don't label me like that.

662
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,820
What are you doing now then?

663
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,580
I don't like persistent pursuers.

664
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,140
But Tang Xin,

665
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,540
don't you feel like your feelings

666
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:35,780
for me are shifting too fast?

667
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,540
What do you really like about me?

668
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,540
I've told you before.

669
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,220
You're good-looking

670
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,620
and worth over a billion.

671
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,260
What do I like about you?

672
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,300
Of course, I like your face and figure.

673
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,180
And your money, too.

674
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,740
It's easy to like you.

675
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,780
It's also easy to dislike you.

676
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,580
After all, there are plenty of rich
and good-looking men.

677
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:10,980
That's it?

678
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,100
What else?

679
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,940
What about the words

680
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,180
written inside the book

681
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,620
you gave me?

682
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,620
When you called me
into the office back then,

683
00:38:23,936 --> 00:38:25,300
I thought you had feelings for me.

684
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,180
Right, you can see it as my imagination.

685
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,860
But no one would help their crush

686
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,340
chase after their best friend.

687
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,420
I couldn't turn you down face-to-face,

688
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,860
so I gave you that book.

689
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,140
If you had read that book at the time,

690
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,648
maybe all those absurd things later on
wouldn't have happened.

691
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,060
You like me,

692
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,820
but in less than half a month,

693
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,260
you gave up.

694
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:01,940
Isn't half a month long enough?

695
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,380
It took me an instant to like you

696
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,340
and half a month to give up.

697
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,900
That's quite long.

698
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,220
I could have emailed you
my resignation letter

699
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,420
or handed it to the HR department.

700
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,540
But, I wanted to say goodbye to you.

701
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:20,860
Mr. Tang.

702
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,780
Thank you for your care all this time.

703
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,060
So, you're done with the monk's flesh
after tasting it?

704
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:43,780
Yeah, I'm done.

705
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,620
You only like my face and money?

706
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,340
Yes.

707
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,940
It only took you an instant to like me

708
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,500
and half a month to give up?

709
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,220
That's right.

710
00:39:52,464 --> 00:39:53,900
You don't like anything else about me?

711
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,860
Yeah.

712
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,780

00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,340
