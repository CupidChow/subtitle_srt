Of course.

00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,679
I don't understand why the celebs

47

never want to go public.

48

Besides,

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,239
dating is a beautiful thing.

I am worried

it might affect you.

54
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,500
Maybe you'll lose fans.

55
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,319
I'm not scared.

56
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,279
And I've enrolled into an acting class.

57
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,239
I will gain my fans through my acting.

58
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,860
I don't want to do it
through real life drama.

59
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,399
Hello, everyone.

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,399
I'm Tang Dingding the actress.

61
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,919
Today, I'd like to formally introduce

62
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,100
this guy beside me.

63
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,660
As you can see,

64
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,260
we're dating.

65
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,860
We

66
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,919
got to know each other

67
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,740
during A Dream for You's cast selection.

68
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,300
He wouldn't admit it,

69
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,580
but I think

70
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,220
he fell in love with me at first sight.

71
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,380
(When he first saw me,)

72
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,519
(he)

73
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,620
(tapped on my shoulder.)

74
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,220
(He said hey.)

75
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,999
(I turned around and saw)

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,420
(a guy looking at me sheepishly.)

77
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,420
Isn't that right?

78
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,479
Yeah.

79
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,039
I fell in love with her
at first sight.

80
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,980
Did you just admit that?

81
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,199
I hope we'll get your blessing.

82
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,180
Bye.

83
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,820
Why are you so nervous?

84
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,639
I'm not an actor.

85
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,500
I don't face the camera a lot.
Not like you guys.

86
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,359
It's Lu.

87
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,060
Can't believe it's Lu.

88
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,679
Dingding has a good eye.

89
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,919
Lu's not bad.

90
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,399
When we went to the set,

91
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,140
he was so welcoming.

92
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,420
Welcoming?

93
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,500
I think

94
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,439
it was back then,

95
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,820
he was up to something.

96
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,220
That brat.

97
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,140
I'll whoop him.

98
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,340
Where are you going?

99
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,660
To get my weapon.

100
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,020
They made an announcement.

101
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,580
Saw it.

102
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,079
You're calm.

103
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,300
It can't be.

104
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,119
I see Dingding as my sister.

105
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,959
We grew up together.

106
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,919
She's scared of Tang Yu
since she was a kid.

107
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,140
Whenever she had something
in her mind, she'd come to me.

108
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,540
I just feel

109
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,780
that the girl who used to play with me

110
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,940
has grown up.

111
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,620
And she's dating someone now.

112
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,180
I feel

113
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,700
conflicted.

114
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,799
However,

115
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,879
I can change girlfriends,

116
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,020
but I can only have

117
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,980
one sister.

118
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,220
Fine.

119
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,399
Since you've never hurt

120
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,060
Dingding all these years,

121
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,140
I think you're a good brother.

122
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,879
I'm telling you,

123
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,279
sooner or later, you'll see

124
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,140
that I have many strengths.

125
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,220
I'm turning a new leaf.

126
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,580
That statement means nothing.

127
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,300
This fits well.

128
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,660
Sell it to me.

129
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,479
How much does it cost?

130
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,559
Give me a 10% discount.

131
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,340
A hundred million, no discount.

132
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,500
A hundred million, no discount?

133
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,740
You're getting cuter, Hua Juan.

134
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,980
Done cleaning?

135
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,279
He just had a shower today.

136
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,220
Smells like a cinnamon roll.

137
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,359
He has some eye booger here.

138
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,159
Don't move.

139
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,140
I'll wipe it off.

140
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,340
Here.

141
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,780
Good boy.

142
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,100
What's wrong?

143
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,020
Why are you staring at me?

144
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,180
Nothing.

145
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:24,980
Good boy.

146
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,820
Why are you so calm today?

147
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,679
Dingding talked to me a lot

148
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,119
because she's worried you might get mad

149
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,140
after seeing the announcement.

150
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,540
I think Lu Zhixing's not bad.

151
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,420
He can marry my sister.

152
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,799
That's why I support them.

153
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,860
They can go public.

154
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,239
Besides,

155
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,959
since they choose to be together,

156
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,940
keeping it a secret makes it
more dangerous.

157
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,359
I just hope Dingding

158
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,839
can work hard to be a good actress.

159
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,300
I don't want her work
to affect her life.

160
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,780
You're a good brother.

161
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:01,999
Here,

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,180
Hua Juan.

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,399
Isn't that right?

164
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,940
Is he a good brother?

165
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,319
Here.

166
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,620
Eat here.

167
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,540
I'm sleepy.

168
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,100
Let's go to bed, shall we?

169
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,700
You're in a hurry.

170
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,340
It's not even late.

171
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,260
I haven't chatted with you yet.

172
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,660
We can talk tomorrow.

173
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,799
We went through a dozen roadshows
this week.

174
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,300
My legs are almost worn out.

175
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,879
Now I

176
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,020
need a good sleep to recharge.

177
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,940
Best if we have a vacay on the side.

178
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,980
Approved.

179
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,340
From today onward,

180
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,540
no,

181
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,860
from this moment onward,

182
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,980
you are on vacation.

183
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,180
It's boring if I go on a vacation alone.

184
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,500
You're so busy, and you
won't stay with me.

185
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,860
Come with me.

186
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,220
We're here.

187
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,100
Three, two, one.

188
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,900
Alright, strap this safety harness on.

189
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,620
Didn't think you were an expert
in this field, Tang Yu.

190
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,500

Tang Xin.

193
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,980
You've been watching me alone

194
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,740
for four years.

195
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,220

00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,020

(Prenuptial Agreement)
Mr. and Mrs. Tang.

223
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,940
What I'm holding is a pre-nup.

224
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,839
I know you two

225
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,660
gave everything for Tang Xin.

226
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,799
But don't you worry.

227
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,100
From today onward,

228
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,679
our family

229
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,980
will also give everything
for Tang Xin.

230
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,900
Here, have a look.

231
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,420
Mrs. Tang.

232
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,460
You gave all your assets to me?

233
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,660
If you cheat on me after we get married,

234
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,460
you'll break up
and take not a single cent.

235
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,660
That's right.

236
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,479
This isn't a game, Mr. and Mrs. Tang.

237
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,620
Mrs. Tang.

238
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,679
It's alright.

239
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,399
We

240
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,359
never get in Tang Yu's business.

241
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,860
We'll support his actions.

242
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,039
And I know Tang Yu.

243
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:50,639
He'll never cheat on Tang Xin,

244
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,700
so don't worry about that.

245
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,300
Mr. Tang.

246
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,199
As you can see,

247
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,460
my son is very sincere about this.

248
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,100
He really

249
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,740
wants to marry your daughter
into our Tang family.

250
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,759
Bro.

251
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,559
We're Tangs too.

252
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,980
- That's true.
- That's true.

253
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,119
We don't even have to decide
whose last name the kids are taking.

254
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,519
Yeah.

255
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:13,999
That's right.

256
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,479
Tell them to have more kids.

257
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,359
Sure.

258
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,580
Anything you say.

259
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,360
We'll have to decide
on the wedding date.

260
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,759
- Are you happy?
- Acceptable. No problem.

261
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,079
We'll hold the wedding in summer.

262
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,159
We'll look good in gowns.

263
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,380
- Yeah.
- Great!

264
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,580
We should pick a date.

265
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,519
- As soon as possible.
- Okay.

266
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,900
I haven't prepared yet.

267
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,980
When Tang Yu was little,

268
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,719
he was scrawny.

269
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,959
The other kids bullied him.

270
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,839
But he wasn't a fighter.
Couldn't argue either.

271
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,180
So what did he do?

272
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,300
He bought people out.

273
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,519
He used the money

274
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,879
his father and I gave him
to buy bubblegums.

275
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,500
He snuck it into kindy

276
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,279
and gave one to anyone
who was nice to him.

277
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,919
He gave one gum
to anyone who was nice to him,

278
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,679
and not too long, all the kindy kids

279
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,660
became his good friends.

280
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,260
However,

281
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,519
his teacher talked to me
not too long after that.

282
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,220
She told me,

283
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,079
"Mrs. Tang, can you not give him money
to buy bubblegum?

284
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,279
At this rate,

285
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,719
all the kids will have cavities.

286
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,580
I can't face the other parents."

287
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,100
Our girl had tons of embarrassing
stories when she was a kid.

288
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:16,959
At first,

289
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,759
- the other kids bullied her.
- She's talking about you.

290
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,399
She came home and asked her dad

291
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,660
to get her a fake tattoo.

292
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,999
She pasted that sticker

293
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,239
on her arm

294
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,220
and made it look gangsta.

295
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,799
She mustered up her courage

296
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,220
and taught the bullies a lesson.

297
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,039
And everyone called her

298
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,140
boss.

299
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,799
Okay.

300
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,740
So from now on,
the boss will be in charge of you.

301
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,319
Alright.

302
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:44,919
What's wrong?

303
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:45,999
Stuffy?

304
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,820
Why don't I take you around?

305
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,999
We'll be going for a stroll.

306
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,860
You guys eat.

307
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,519
Okay.

308
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,319
Go.

309
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,799
You won't like our conversations anyway.

310
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,079
Yeah.

311
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,199
You two go out and chat.

312
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,079
Okay.

313
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:00,879
Go.

314
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,479
Go.

315
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,879
The young have their own world.

316
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,639
Yep.

317
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:04,559
- Come.
- Come on.

318
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,159
Let's eat.

319
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,220
Here we go.

320
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,380
Did you do that on purpose?

321
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,780
Getting touchy in front of my parents.

322
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,540
Because you looked uncomfortable.

323
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,759
You cheeks were red as an apple.

324
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,020
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you had a fever.

325
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,039
Honestly,

326
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,999
they could've just had a chat,

327
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,180
but they had to joke
about our childhood stuff.

328
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,479
You were brilliant as a kid.

329
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,260
You dealt with things smart.

330
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,380
Nothing interesting about my childhood.

331
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,599
You're not stupid.

332
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,119
You actually used a fake tattoo

333
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,300
to make yourself look menacing.

334
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,900
Stop talking.

335
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:46,820
Alright.

336
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,839
Our parents

337
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,500
don't know each other much.

338
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,799
Besides talking about us,

339
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,980
what else can they talk about?

340
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,060
You have a point.

341
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,420
Right.

342
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,599
When did you prepare that pre-nup?

343
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,660
I had no idea.

344
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,679
It's an important file.

345
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,620
I couldn't let you know in advance.

346
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,799
I've prepared it

347
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,260
before the proposal.

348
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,460
Now, my money and soul

349
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,860
belong to you.

350
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,940
Okay.

351
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,940
You're mine,

352
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,260
and I'm yours.

353
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,060
That's a promise.

354
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,620
So,

355
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,820
do I have to give you allowance?

356
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:47,860
Sure thing.

357
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,860
How much are you giving me?

358
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,860
Let me think.

359
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,279
When I watched
the variety show last month,

360
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,180
a super rich celeb

361
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,999
only gets about 5000 from his wife
every month.

362
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,820
So...

363
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,540
Is 6000 enough?

364
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,100
Sure thing.

365
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,900
Really?

366
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,500
Whatever you say.

367
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,780
I would give my life for you,

368
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,100
so what do I care about money?

369
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,780
- Did you bring your household register?
- Yep.

370
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,199
And ID?

371
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,100
Yep.

372
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,660
Anything missing?

373
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,060
Witnesses.

374
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,740
I want to show you something.

375
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,900
Sure thing.

376
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,380
Am I pretty?

377
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,660
Yes.

378
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,159
Okay.

379
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,140
If we don't go now,
they're going to clock out.

380
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,620
Someone's shy.

381
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,079
Congratulations.

382
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,300
For marrying a pretty wife.

383
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,660
My honor.

384
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,959
This time,

385
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,460
it's official.

386
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,440
(Marriage Certificate)

387
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,140
Taking a picture?

388
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,580
Take a picture of this page.

389
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,220
Can I?

390
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,500
Of course.

391
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,100
You said

392
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,479
your boyfriend has no face.

393
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,599
Now that we're married,

394
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,860
it's time to show your hubby's face.

395
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,820
You still remember that?

396
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,239
Okay.

397
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,599
I'll reluctantly allow you

398
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,180
to appear in my Moments.

399
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,920
(Rich Lady: Just married.)

400
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,719
(Dingding: Congrats brother
and sister-in-law.)

401
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,479
(Give us a mini Sugar Heart soon.)

402
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,840
(You Huan:
I want to be the maid of honor.)

403
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,960
(Ming Xiaosheng: Congratulations.)

404
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,519
(Han Xiaoxiao: I feel like crying.)

405
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,559
(You're married.)

406
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,439
(I haven't even gotten a boyfriend.)

407
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,600
- So nice
- (Congratulations!)

408
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,780
- to get so many blessings.
- (Congratulations!)

409
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,439
(Tang Yu's Moments)

410
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,900
I don't see you posting every day.

411
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,900
It's a special day today.

412
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,340
Should I post it on Weibo?

413
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,439
Fans of my book

414
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,599
DM'ed me. Oh, and comments too.

415
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,039
They want me to show my love more.

416
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,340
Post it more on Weibo.

417
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,660
I'm showing off.

418
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,580
(Sugar Heart: I'm married.)

419
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,060
That's one ticket to trending search.

420
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,799
(Tang Yu reposted Sugar Heart:
I'm married)

421
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,660
Done.

422
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,079
Alright.

423
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,740
We'll go high profile for once.

424
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,940
But Tang Yu,

425
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,500
my dad said

426
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,300
that even though we're married,

427
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,439
if you bully me,

428
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,500
he'll come to Nangang and cut you down.

429
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,980
He might not even pass the safety check.

430
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,620
Try telling that to my dad.

431
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,999
If you want to,

432
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,100
then challenge accepted.

433
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,300
Stop bluffing.

434
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,079
You think I don't know

435
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,839
you chat with my dad every day?

436
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,359
You even replied
to his unreliable health recipes.

437
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,479
Of course I had to.

438
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,820
If I didn't,

439
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,180
how would they know
the recipes are unreliable?

440
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,060
I have to correct you, though.

441
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,620
He's not just your dad now.

442
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,340
He's mine too.

443
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,660
Okay.

444
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,279
You're the best son-in-law
in the universe.

445
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,740
Stamp of approval given.

446
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,140
Should I get a reward, then?

447
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,420
What kind of reward?

448
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,460
Tell me.

449
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,660
What did you tell Tang Xin about me?

450
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,839
Huo Chendong told me

451
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,740
there's a ten-point law of love

452
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,180
that's suitable for you.

453
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,460
Elaborate.

454
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,900
If you break down love
into a scale of one to ten,

455
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,999
five points

456
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,300
means you want to woo her.

457
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,719
Six points

458
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,799
means you start making moves.

459
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,340
Seven points

460
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,060
means you want to kiss her.

461
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,119
Eight points means

462
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,660
you have the urge to hanky panky.

463
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,879
Nine and ten points

464
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,919
mean you want to marry her.

465
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,580
That's the gist of it.

466
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,460
I see.

467
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,220
Dingding, come here.

468
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,700
Ow.

469
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,199
From now on,
your secondary cards are revoked.

470
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,500
You're not getting another cent from me.

471
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,980
Hey, if you're restricting my cards,

472
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,340
at least give me my pay for the movie.

473
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,420
In your dreams.

474
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,100
Mr. Tang, you're back.

475
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,639
I made dinner.

476
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,860
We can eat soon.

477
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,140
What are you doing?

478
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,639
So you have to use this

479
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,500
to prove that I love you?

480
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,380
Don't be rash.

481
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,060
Almost forgot.

482
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,740
You're crazy for shirts.

483
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,460
Should I wear a shirt when we do it?

484
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,940
What are you doing?

485
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,980
Five points of love

486
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,020
means I want to woo you.

487
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,420
Seven points

488
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,300
means I want to kiss you.

489
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,719
Nine points

490
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,900
means I want to marry you.

491
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,999
Huo Chendong made that up
to fool Tang Dingding,

492
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,100
and you bought it.

493
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,700
Um...

494
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,580
He has a point.

495
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,340
What point?

496
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,559
If you really like me,

497
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,300
you won't be afraid
of getting labeled by numbers.

498
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,180
Then I'll have to label you
with a number.

Welcome back to Time Pictures,

531
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,039
Ms. Tang Xin.

532
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,060
I'll be in your care.

533
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,119
Is this a new card?

534
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,300
Never seen this before.

535
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,599
To be precise,

536
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,740
this is the first card.

537
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,340
Mr. Tang told me to give it to you.

538
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,199
It's not the first card.

539
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,220
It's the only one. For Tang Xin.

540
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,559
Mrs. Tang.

541
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,020
Happy marriage.

542
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,860
Mrs. Tang?

543
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,719
You guys

544
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,860
got hitched?

545
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,359
Ms. Chen, I'll give you
the candy sometime.

546
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,220
I'll have to go now.

547
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,860
Got hitched.

548
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,239
At this point,

549
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,079
why lay low?

550
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,340
You posted it to your Moments.

551
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,639
Ms. Chen doesn't check Moments
that much.

552
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,700
She knows it late.

553
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,900
Congratulations, Mrs. Tang,
the wife of the boss.

554
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,399
See?

555
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:03,119
This is the wedding gift we prepared.

556
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,260
Do you like it?

557
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,860
I do.

558
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,519
What is this?

559
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,500
Check it out.

560
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:13,399
This is the badge
Mr. Tang made for Tang Xin.

561
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,540
There are even hearts on it.

562
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,119
This means

563
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,639
Tang Xin is his.

564
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,039
And her scripts belong to him.

565
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,319
It means you are firmly in his hand.

566
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,079
- My god.
- My god.

567
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:27,260
I am so shipping the boss and his wife.

568
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,359
Please, don't call me that.

569
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,700
Don't think you can slack off
because you're married to the boss now.

570
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,039
We're happy for you.

571
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,919
Thanks.

572
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,940
I wish you happiness.

573
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,940
Alright.

574
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,799
Since you guys are calling me Mrs. Tang,

575
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,000
I can't be stingy.

576
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,880
Do you guys have anything
you want to eat next week?

577
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:44,900
It's on me.

578
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,439
Thank you, Mrs. Tang.

579
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,860
You're the best, Mrs. Tang.

580
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,959
- Come on.
- It's here.

581
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,540
Last dessert coming up.

582
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,140
You're awesome.

583
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,559
Everyone's a couple here.

584
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,900
Show some mercy for the singles.

585
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,399
They're married.

586
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,799
So when's your turn?

587
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,940
Hey.

588
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,079
I thought you were celebrating us.

589
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,100
Why's everyone talking about Mr. Lu?

590
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,980
So what if we just want to gossip?

591
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,920
You jealous of your brother-in-law?

592
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,519
Brother-in-law?

593
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,399
He's not my brother-in-law yet.

594
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,159
I don't recognize him,

595
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,780
and so are my parents.

596
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,999
Yeah, can't call him your brother-in-law.

597
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,420
From what I know,

598
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,460
Yu,

599
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,980
you're a few months younger than him.

600
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,559
And you guys were friends in school.

601
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,860
Close like brothers.

602
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,100
Why don't you call me

603
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,580
your sister-in-law?

604
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,599
Tang Dingding.

605
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,559
You're overstepping it.

606
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,980
You're taking his side a lot now.

607
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,319
Just kidding.

608
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,359
Come one, just humor me.

609
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,079
Come on.

610
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,460
Just do it.

611
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,340
Just say it.

612
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,959
- Say what?
- Alright.

613
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,879
Come on, friends.

614
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,660
On to the meat of the conversation.

615
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,839
Ladies and gentlemen,

616
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,999
our brothers and sisters,

617
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,839
yesterday, Mr. Tang Yu and Ms. Tang Xin

618
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,399
officially got hitched.

619
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,940
- Round of applause.
- Congratulations!

620
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,159
So,

621
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,159
the four of us

622
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,679
will be saying well wishes.
No repeat wishes.

623
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,679
I go first.

624
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,559
I wish you a happy
and everlasting marriage.

625
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,399
- Good.
- Seriously?

626
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,039
You got the simplest one.

627
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,239
What can we say now?

628
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,999
Just pick one and run with it.

629
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,879
I'll go.

630
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,479
Okay.

631
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,839
The lovers finally got together.

632
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,919
I hope you'll be blessed with kids soon.

633
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,519
- This one's good.
- This one is nice.

634
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,679
- No kids soon.
- This one's nice.

635
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,359
I wish you get kids later.

636
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,580
Have some lovers time first.

637
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,980
That's my bestie.

638
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,279
Alright.

639
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,940
My turn.

640
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,799
I hope you two have smooth careers

641
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,679
and make tons of money.

642
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,279
Then I can have more allowance.

643
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,039
Tang Dingding.

644
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,440
You little miser.

645
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,080
- I'll give you allowance.
- Alright, look at me.

646
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,319
I'm jealous.

647
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,260
And done.

648
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,420
On to the most important segment.

649
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,860
Let's enjoy the proposal video
of our couple.

650
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,060
Why does that exist?

651
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,300
I have to see this carefully.

652
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,980
What the heck is this?

653
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,660
Do you know what he is looking for?

654
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,439
I thought it's a proposal. What is this?

655
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,559
- He lost his ring that day.
- Yu.

656
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,799
This is supposed to be a proposal video,

657
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,340
not comedy hour.

658
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,159
You lost the ring here?

659
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,300
Yeah.

660
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,580
I couldn't find the ring
when I was about to propose.

661
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,420
- He was panicking that day.
- My god.

662
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,879
Don't tell anyone this is my setup.

663
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,820
I consider this a failure in my life.

664
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,639
Not your problem.

665
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,359
A good director needs good actors.

666
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,540
They are not.

667
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,039
Tang Dingding's brave now.

668
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,799
Aren't you doing anything, Tang Yu?

669
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,079
What did Dingding do this time?

670
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:56,879
It's true love.

671
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,359
Why can't she be brave?

672
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,239
Besides, you're not Mr. Lu.

673
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,359
Oh, come on.

674
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,239
I realize that true love

675
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,980
might happen anytime.

676
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,679
If you don't mind,

677
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,879
we can try again

678
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,919
and see if we can make a couple.

679
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,799
Oh, shut it.

680
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,140
We have a situation here.

681
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:11,799
Okay.

682
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,159
We've seen the video

683
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,119
and had dinner.

684
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,799
Then it's time to drink till we drop.
Here we go.

685
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,039
- Drink.
- Let's go.

686
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,620
It's getting late.

687
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,679
Everyone go home.

688
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,239
Hey.

689
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,959
You're kicking us out?

690
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,740
Drinks aren't finished yet.

691
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,319
They just got hitched,

692
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,959
and you want to drink till we drop?

693
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,180
Something's wrong with your head.

694
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,679
Let's go, then.

695
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,479
We're leaving.

696
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,439
Time to scoot.

697
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:32,399
You guys are leaving?

698
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,479
- Happy marriage, you two.
- Happy marriage.

699
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,559
- We're going now.
- Hey, cleanup.

700
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,420
You need to do cleanup.

701
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,519
- Bye.
- Be careful.

702
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,759
- Bye.
- Remember to eat the tart.

703
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,119
- Bye.
- Remember to eat it. It's sweet.

704
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:44,220
- Bye.
- Bye.

705
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,300
It's only ten. Why'd you chase them off?

706
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,820
I was going to party through the night.

707
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,620
If that's what you want,

708
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,060
I can do it with you.

709
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,460
Tang Yu.

710
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,980
You can't wait any longer, can you?

711
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,740
Of course I can't.

712
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,780
Hold on.

713
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,919
You called my dad Dad.

714
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,940
What about me?

715
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,300
Honey.

716
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:27,900
Honey.

717
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,260
Marriage is good.

718
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,540
You want to get married?

719
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,100
No.

720
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,460
I'm just saying

721
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,260
it's nice that Yu and Tang Xin
are married.

722
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,820
My brother

723
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,919
used to be a boring guy.

724
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,439
He wouldn't even crack a joke.

725
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,140
But now he changed.

726
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,559
He acts like a kid sometimes

727
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,980
and cheers his wife up.

728
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,340
He knows everything about love.

729
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,860
Yeah.

730
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,719
A good relationship

731
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,340
changes someone.

732
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,940
So have I changed you?

733
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,679
In the past,

734
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,599
I never thought

735
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,799
I would watch dramas I hate

736
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,140
with someone else.

737
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,340
I never thought
that someone would talk so much.

738
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,260
Never thought I'd shop online with her
and pick out clothes.

739
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,500
And then, we'd order supper on a whim.

740
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,140
Then the next day,

741
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,540
we'd starve and lose weight.

742
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,220
So are you blaming me?

743
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,940
No.

744
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,220
Dingding.

745
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,220
I like my life now.

746
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,340
I want to be with you

747
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,140
and live like this for life.

748
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,340
So do you want to get married?

749
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,740
When you're ready,

750
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,220
then I am.

751
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,780
Thank you.

752
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,060
For what?

753
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,380
Thank you

754
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,460
for picking me in the film academy.

755
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,420
Thank you

756
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,940
for leading me to the career I love.

757
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,620
Thank you

758
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,300
for giving me the best relationship
in the world.

759
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,900
Why did you ask me out at this hour?

760
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,319
Mr. Tang wants me to tally

761
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,020
the next movie's costume budget with you.

762
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,580
He's urging me.

763
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,919
You love your work.

764
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,140
It's unlike you.

765
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,900
Hello, Mr. Chen.

766
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,599
(Mr. Huo.)

767
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,639
(This party can't go on without you.)

768
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,559
(Come over quick.)

769
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,199
I have to decline.

770
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,300
I'm weaning off booze lately.

771
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,159
- You guys have fun. Alright?
- You're weaning off?

772
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,180
Sure.

773
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,580
What's wrong?

774
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,460
Nothing. Blackout, maybe.

775
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,900
My files are in the computer.

776
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,679
I guess the budget

777
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,820
can't be tallied today.

778
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,700
We'll talk some other day, then.

779
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,180
That door probably can't be opened now.

780
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,060
- Um...
- Well...

781
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,380
Why don't we...

782
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,700
I thought you said you weaned booze off.

783
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,540
You have to drink

784
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,700
with someone important.

785
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,100
How important?

786
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,820
How about

787
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,260
we give this a try?

788
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,740
Just kidding.

789
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,220
Really?

790
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,300
Not half bad, sir.

791
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:10,060
Broad shoulders, slim waist, long legs.

792
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,020
On par with my husband.

793
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,060
What about looks?

794
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:15,540
Looks?

795
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,420
My husband's the best.

796
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,260
Do you think I'm good-looking?

797
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,780
Of course.

798
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,319
I see Ms. You

799
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,260
has designed pretty clothes.

800
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,180
The woman is prettier than the clothes.

801
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,020
Do you know what I was thinking?

802
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,239
You were thinking

803
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,599
I am lucky

804
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,660
to marry a wife this pretty.

805
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:52,860
Of course not.

806
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,460
I was thinking

807
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,260
if you hadn't hung on for four years,

808
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,060
I might have missed you.

809
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,740
But it's good now.

810
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,340
I'm lucky.

811
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,660
No.

812
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,260
From the moment we met four years ago,

813
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,460
I knew

814
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:20,260
you were the most important
person in my life.

815
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,540
Even if we hadn't met four years ago,

816
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,060
we'd still find each other.

817
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,060
Tang Yu.

818
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,359
You are the person

819
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,180
I'm destined to find in my life.

820
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,740
It has always been you.

821
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:43,900
It can only be you.

822
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,199
Alright, bride.

823
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,300
Hold the groom.

824
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,780
Good, good.

825
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,020
Alright.

826
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,540
Now smile.

Let me go through.

835

Tang Yu.

836
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,180
The makeup artist said
we're perfect together.

837
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,020
So?

838
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,759
Not just the makeup artist.

839
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:39,559
The stylist,

840
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:40,999
and even the photographer said it.

841
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,020
Didn't you hear?

842
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,060
I did.

843
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,060
And you said we weren't a good match.

844
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,060
We look perfect together.

845
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,199
You did say

846
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:52,500
it was in the past.

847
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,660

Of course I would.

Mr. Tang.

887
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,700
Stop looking.

888
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,940
It's here. Come.

889
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,420
Quick, hold it.

890
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:15,140
Why is it so naughty?

891
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,599
Let me show you something.

892
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,140
As a cat, you have to be obedient.

893
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,279
Is it a good match with me?

894
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,140
I thought the ring was unique.

895
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:29,039
Do you remember the day

896
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,700
I asked you to get some meds for me?

897
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:31,879
Then when you came back,

898
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,879
I was exercising.

899
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,039
I was going to propose that day.

900
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,199
But I lost the ring.

901
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,540
Then I got another ring
of the same model.

902
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:44,940
What I'm saying is
I have proposed once,

903
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,940
and you should return the favor.

904
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,500
Sure. Sit down.

905
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,639

00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,900
Will you marry me?

907
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,119
Come on, director.

908
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,140
That's just perfunctory.

909
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,020
I do, I do.

910
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:07,639
Hey.

911
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,519
Let's make one that's not perfunctory.

912

Three, two, one, start.

913
