(His affection level is only six points.)

26
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,080
(Six points barely
meet the minimum standard!)

27
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,760
(If he dares lay a finger on me,
I'm sure to get angry!)

28
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,380
Has my brother been here?

29
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,820
Your brother?

30
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,100
No.

31
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:00,380
No way.

32
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,180
I just saw his car downstairs.

33
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:06,980
Yu.

34
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,500
Don't go.

35
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,220
Yu.

36
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,780
Why are you here?

37
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,260
I just moved in today.

38
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,700
So, you're my new neighbor.

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,100
You don't live in your big apartment
and villa.

40
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,300
Mr. Tang, you're interesting.

41
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,980
Yu, what's going on with you?

42
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,980
You've left me feeling confused.

43
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,360
Nothing's going on.

44
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,580
I get it.

45
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,740
You did this on purpose, didn't you?

46
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,500
It was premeditated.

47
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,060
Hey, bro.

48
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,500
The property listing
Dingding just mentioned,

49
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,750
I want two units
right next to each other.

50
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:23,860
And also,

51
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,860
don't tell Dingding about this property,

52
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,620
and don't inform her buyer friend.

53
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,100
You have many properties,

54
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,700
and all in the best locations.

55
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,940
(Why do you want to buy two more?)

56
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,440
(Venturing into real estate?)

57
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,860
It's not just me buying.

58
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,020
It's one for me,
and one for Dingding's friend.

59
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,380
Now I understand.

60
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,620
Tang Yu.

61
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,100
(You're not
into Dingding's friend, are you?)

62
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,900
(Are you pursuing her by getting close?)

63
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,180
Bro, you know me.

64
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,540
(Really?)

65
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,540
(Who is this young lady)

66
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,620
that can make you,

67
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,100
go to such lengths to pursue her?

68
00:03:59,380 --> 00:03:59,940
She

69
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,700
is quite impressive.

70
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,740
Now, it's hard
to pursue her and please her.

71
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,540
I really don't know what to do.

72
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,210
I can only try to get close to her.

73
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,700
That's how things stand.

74
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:11,540
I'll go.

75
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:12,700
Wait, Yu.

76
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,420
You're really something.

77
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,540
You even lied to me, your own sister.

78
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,540
I was wondering why our cousin

79
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,740
agreed so readily.

80
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,460
Turns out, it's not because of me.

81
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,460
I'll go now if that's all.

82
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:26,980
Dingding.

83
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,580
Why aren't you coming in?

84
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,180
Coming.

85
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,840
Aren't you going
to invite my brother in?

86
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,140
I didn't prepare for him.

87
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,420
Come on in.

88
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,540
I'm certain now
that my brother is pursuing you.

89
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,900
Stop teasing.

90
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,460
Change into the blue ones.

91
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,940
He moved just for you.

92
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,500
And also,

93
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,380
this apartment complex

94
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,540
was sold out by the end of last year.

95
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,180
Besides, it's quite a challenge

96
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,660
to find two adjacent units
within this complex together.

97
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,780
Yu must have spent a lot
of money and effort.

98
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:24,300
He's the CEO of Time Pictures.

99
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,330
Surely,
someone is handling these for him.

100
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,820
It's not like that.
I understand my brother.

101
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:31,660
He's here.

102
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,560
I'll open the door.

103
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,100
Coming!

104
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,340
Yu!

105
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:37,900
Dingding.

106
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,140
You welcomed me so affectionately.

107
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,620
I don't have anything for you though.

108
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,580
Enough, Huan. Stop teasing her.

109
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,500
Put on the beige slippers yourself.

110
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,060
Dingding.

111
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,420
Xin.

112
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,020
Xiaoxiao.

113
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,660
I brought you a gift.

114
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,100
Thank you.

115
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,980
Let me have a tour around.

116
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,180
Dingding, what are you looking at?
Close the door.

117
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:57,860
Coming.

118
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,820
- Not bad. It's quite cozy.
- Come in.

119
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,740
Everyone is here.

120
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,580
Come on in.

121
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,460
I prepared this table
of food carefully for you all.

122
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,220
It smells good.

123
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,140
This must be the cooking

124
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,260
of Chef from Xiaoxianghong.

125
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,900
Stop exposing me all the time.

126
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,940
I made this soup myself.

127
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,340
Impressive.

128
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,620
Your place is really nice.

129
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,460
When will I be able

130
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,380
to purchase such a good unit too?

131
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,900
Just work hard,

132
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,460
and you'll

133
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,220
get one soon.

134
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,020
Is Xiaoxianghong's food delicious?

135
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,140
Yeah. This one.

136
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,070
I'll try it then.

137
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,140
I'll take a look.

138
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,060
What are you thinking?

139
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:35,260
It smells nice.

140
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,260
Xin.

141
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,340
Why is she here?

142
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,780
Let me try this chili.

143
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,440
What's wrong?

144
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,900
How do you know Tang Dingding?

145
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,500
Don't you know?

146
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,540
When she was at Time,

147
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,820
just like you did,

148
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,880
she'd go to Mr. Tang's office
whenever she had time.

149
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:49,940
What are you saying?

150
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,500
Zhou Dan said she is Mr. Tang's new one.

151
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,380
That wasn't the same.

152
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,620
Don't talk nonsense.

153
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,100
I caught you, Tang Xin.

154
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:01,740
Speak.

155
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,220
Why do you always
go to my brother's office?

156
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:05,900
Your

157
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,620
brother?

158
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:09,260
You are Mr. Tang's sister?

159
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,700
Alright.

160
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,620
The soup is ready.

161
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,580
Clear the space now.

162
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,940
- Here.
- Clear the space.

163
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:15,540
Hurry.

164
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,260
Clear the space.

165
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,020
This is the soup I made by myself.

166
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,700
Each of you should
have two bowls at least.

167
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,140
- Be careful.
- Here.

168
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,100
- It smells so good.
- It smells so good.

169
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,740
Is it delicious?

170
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,340
Very delicious.

171
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,260
It's great.

172
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:30,820
Thanks.

173
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,620
I love you.

174
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:31,940
Here.

175
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,340
- I want it too.
- I want meat.

176
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:33,780
Here.

177
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,700
Finish yours first.

178
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,700
What's the rush?

179
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,860
Be careful. It's hot.

180
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,900
- I want meat.
- I want meat.

181
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,660
I want meat too.

182
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,700
Me too.

183
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,820
Here's the wine.

184
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,780
Here's to Xin
settling into her new home.

185
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,340
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

186
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,220
Keep everything clean, okay?

187
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,820
Or you'll clean it up with me tomorrow.

188
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,340
Deal?

189
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,860
Okay, no problem.

190
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,540
(Moments)

191
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,580
(Rich Lady:
Almost everything made me happy today.)

192
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,580
(Like)

193
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,500
Almost?

194
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,180
Why are you drinking?

195
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,180
Aren't you driving today?

196
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,300
It's okay.

197
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,320
I have a backup plan.

198
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,500
Tang Dingding?

199
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,420
Tang Dingding.

200
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,500
Why did you drink so much?

201
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,060
I only had a little.

202
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,420
Take this.

203
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:05,930
I don't want that.

204
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,100
Drink it.

205
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,620
Now.

206
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,700
It's sweet.

207
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,060
I've contacted the driver.

208
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,540
You can't stay here tonight.

209
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,300
Yu.

210
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,420
Yu.

211
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,940
Are you pursuing Tang Xin?

212
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,620
Yes.

213
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,500
I knew it.

214
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:58,860
Well.

215
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,580
Did you...

216
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,940
Are you pursuing her

217
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,340
because you think you two make a match?

218
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:07,860
No.

219
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,380
It's because I like her.

220
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:13,740
Really?

221
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,180
You wouldn't know.

222
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,660
Just tell me.

223
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,380
It's the first time I hear you admitting

224
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,260
you like someone.

225
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,740
I like her. That's all.

226
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:24,900
What's there to say?

227
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,740
But Tang Xin

228
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,060
doesn't seem to like you.

229
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,090
She won't sign your copyright contract
and even joined someone else.

230
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,060
Leave.

231
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,740
My bag and my shoes are still inside!

232
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:55,660
Here.

233
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,580
Wait for the driver downstairs.

234
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,660
I'm your sister.

235
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:18,060
Why are you looking so sad?

236
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:21,780
Here.

237
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,380
I'll put you on the table.

238
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,100
Here you go.

239
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,140
Comfortable?

240
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,180
Here he comes.

241
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,240
(Tang Yu. Accept, Decline)

242
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,540
Hey, it's me.

243
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,480
Open the door.

244
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,620
Why? It's late.

245
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,380
Just open the door.

246
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:18,940
(I won't go in.)

247
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,780
I just have a few things to say to you.

248
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,300
Are you still there?

249
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,220
New neighbor.

250
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,420
What do you want to tell me?

251
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,300
Must it be so harsh?

252
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:58,420
Is it because I offended you once,

253
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,340
so it's hard
to mend the relationship now?

254
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,460
It's not just once.

255
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:31,740
What did you say?

256
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,100
Do you know?

257
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,220
My dad has a nickname called Bandit.

258
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,900
I've always
called him Bandit Dad since little.

259
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,860
Guess what my nickname is.

260
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:44,860
Rich Lady?

261
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:46,540
No.

262
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,620
When I was little,

263
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,100
I wasn't as outgoing as I am now.

264
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,140
I didn't speak up
even when I got bullied.

265
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,100
My dad always stood up for me.

266
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,940
After a while,

267
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,780
my personality slowly changed.

268
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,650
I would confront them

269
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,780
when they bullied me.

270
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:04,220
So, they gave me a nickname.

271
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,380
Tyrant.

272
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,100
My dad used to say

273
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,660
"Bandits are never suppressed,

274
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,860
and Tyrant never suffers losses".

275
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,420
Alright.

276
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,520
I should go to sleep.

277
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,240
You should go back.

278
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,500
Good night.

279
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,060
Tyrant.

280
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,220
Three, two, one.

281
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,020
This doesn't look great.

282
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,380
Another one.

283
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,140
It will work.

284
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,860
Is it cooked?

285
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,300
Yes, it is.

286
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,180
Three, two, one.

287
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:08,820
There we go.

288
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,060
Mr. Tang.

289
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,380
Good morning, Mr. Gao.

290
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,860
Do you like eggs?

291
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,020
Yeah.

292
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,060
I'll bring you breakfast.

293
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,300
No need to prepare.

294
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,450
(See you later.)

295
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,380
Is she still not leaving?

296
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,780
Does she need not to be
on time at Lu Zhixing's?

297
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,420
No.

298
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,220
What a coincidence.

299
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,020
I brought you breakfast.

300
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,420
A sandwich.

301
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:39,900
I made it.

302
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,420
No need.

303
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,260
Thanks.

304
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,580
Take it.

305
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,780
You're about to be late.

306
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,200
You won't have time to eat.

307
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,500
Mr. Lu isn't strict about working hours.

308
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,780
But you, Mr. Tang,

309
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,730
are about to be late.

310
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,060
I'm good.

311
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,450
I don't have the morning meeting today.

312
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:06,780
Take it.

313
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:10,540
Alright.

314
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,460
Thanks.

315
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,100
I remember

316
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,100
you don't do morning meetings

317
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,220
and you aren't often late.

318
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,660
That was before.

319
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,620
It's different now.

320
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,100
Thanks.

321
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,260
This time,

322
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,950

You said it yourself before

328

that I'm not your type

329
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,460
and we're not compatible.

330
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,340
I accepted all that.

(Anyone here with the surname Tang
isn't ordinary.)

361
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:16,780
I'm bored.

362
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,100
Xiaoxiao, do you want anything to drink?

363
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,060
No, thanks.

364
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,060
Do you guys want anything to eat?

365
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,840
I can order for you.

I've eaten.

00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,740
No, thank you.

369
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,780

370
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,740
I can order for you.

371
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,740

379
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,650
Do you need anything...

380
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,380
No.

381
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,580
Do you need to make copies of this?

382
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,340
No need.

383
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,100
It's okay.

384
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,820
No need.

385
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,580
Really.

386
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,220
I'm just an employee. Please spare me.

387
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,220
Tang Xin.

388
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,700
Mr. Lu.

389
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,580
I checked with Zhou Jialu's agent.

390
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,060
She isn't free to participate.

391
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,150
But I made an appointment
with the film academy

392
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,820
to choose the female lead next week.

393
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,340
Okay.

394
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,980
Choosing a newcomer is not bad.

395
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,980
There might be surprises.

396
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,180
Right.

397
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:27,660
Okay.

398
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,660
Some friends told me

399
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,980
that Time's new movie,

400
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,180
"Light of Tomorrow," is great.

401
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,260
Why not
watch it together sometime?

402
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,420
I'll invite Feng, too.

403
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,300
Okay.

404
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,540
Let's watch it together.

405
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,380
Sure.

406
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,020
Go on with your work.

407
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,420
Okay.

408
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,420
(It's all your fault.)

409
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,540
(My identity got exposed.)

410
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,860
(All the employees know who I am now.)

411
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,220
(You have to compensate me.)

412
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,940
(What do you want?)

413
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,180
(Last night, I asked my brother,)

414
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,620
(and he admitted to pursuing you.)

415
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,660
(Are you going to be my sister-in-law?)

416
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,340
This time,

417
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,800
it's my turn to pursue you.

418
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,180
(Do I have to agree to his pursuit?)

419
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,500
(It's okay if you don't want to talk.)

420
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,650
(Shen Fei is having a party
this weekend.)

421
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,780
(She wants to invite you.)

422
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,460
(This is my first time
as lead screenwriter.)

423
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,820
(I wish there
were forty-eight hours in a day.)

424
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,720
(I don't have time to attend a party.)

425
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,580
Come in.

426
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,100
Mr. Tang.

427
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,180
Zhou Jialu's agent called.

428
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,450
They want to terminate the contract

429
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,620
we previously signed.

430
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,460
The reason?

431
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,820
They say Zhou Jialu
has been in poor health lately.

432
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,300
The workload of our film is too high.

433
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,540
But I've found the real reason.

434
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,700
They say Mr. Lu asked Zhou Jialu's team

435
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,940
about Zhou Jialu's schedule.

436
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,220
The team wants her
to act in Mr. Lu's movie

437
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,460
as the female lead.

438
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,140
The protagonist there,

439
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,020
and a supporting role here.

440
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,620
It's a reasonable decision.

441
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,530
But don't worry, Mr. Tang.

442
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,880
The contract has been signed.

443
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,220
If we disagree,

444
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,050
it'll be an unaffordable penalty.

445
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,940
Let her terminate it.

446
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:40,860
Got it.

447
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,020
Mr. Gao.

448
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,820
It's all thanks to you.

449
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,460
Please thank Mr. Tang for me.

450
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:58,780
Sure.

451
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,220
Let's have a meal together next time.

452
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,130
Jialu has been saying she
wants to treat Mr. Tang to a meal.

453
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,540
Shanshan, that'll do.

454
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,220
Great. You must come.

455
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,500
Sure thing.

456
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,380
See you next time.

457
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:16,740
Tian.

458
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,780
Did Time
agree to terminate the contract?

459
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,420
Yes. Once this event is over,

460
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,490
we'll go
and sign the termination contract.

461
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,860
But do we have to terminate it?

462
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,580
Actually, the previous role

463
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,460
was quite nice.

464
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,850
You said it would be a hit.

465
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:33,340
Even if it does,
it's still just a supporting role.

466
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,620
You know how many times
Sugar Heart's book

467
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:36,400
has trended online.

468
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,260
Even Tang Yu helped her promote it.

469
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,780
I think

470
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,740
Time is probably going to invest it.

471
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:43,900
In the end,

472
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,340
it's still produced by Time.

473
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,940
Moreover, with Lu Zhixing's reputation,

474
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,300
even if the movie flops,

475
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,650
there'll still be five or six billions
in box office sales.

476
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,620
So, you should weigh
which is more important.

477
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,260
You're right.

478
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,140
But if I do that,

479
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,300
will Mr. Tang think less of me?

480
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,780
Taking the initiative
to breach a contract isn't a good.

481
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,540
Will he think
I lack professional commitment?

482
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,380
Jialu.

483
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,060
Don't even think about it.

484
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,740
He won't date anyone in the industry.

485
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,260
How many times you've been
in rumors with him?

486
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,420
Has he ever responded?

487
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,620
If you really want that,

488
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,300
why not try Huo Chendong?

489
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,900
Look at Zhao Feiyu.

490
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,660
She was just a model,

491
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,580
but now she has a lot of resources,

492
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,540
which is considered

493
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,100
gaining recognition.

494
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,940
No way.

495
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,820
Fine. Let's go.

496
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,700
We're running late.

497
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,900
Go.

498
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,220
Here.

499
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,300
"What kind of man are you"?

500
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,620
Who were you singing to?

501
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,420
Exactly, who were you singing to?

502
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,680
Didn't you say you weren't coming?

503
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,300
Didn't you say you

504
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,020
wanted to introduce business
to You Huan?

505
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,100
I stayed up several nights
to finish my script

506
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,420
and squeezed out one night's time.

507
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,540
Go ahead.

508
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,580
- Go where?
- It's fine.

509
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,300
There's no rush.

510
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,860
Here. Have some.

511
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,500
Let's drink.

512
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,220
Come on.

513
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,540
Dingding has introduced some to me,

514
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,220
so don't worry.

515
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,060
Let me ask you.

516
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,180
Why did you

517
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,540
refuse my brother's pursuit?

518
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,020
Do you think he's
not trying hard enough?

519
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,240
At how many points
will you consider him?

520
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:33,900
Points?

521
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,420
Don't you know?

522
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:40,220
My brother rates his feelings
in points.

523
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,580
Ten points in total.

524
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,300
Let me explain.

525
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,900
It starts with first impressions.

526
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,580
If his first impression is good,
that's five points.

527
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,460
Six points

528
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,500
mean ready to make a move.

529
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,900
Seven points

530
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,540
are when he wants to kiss you.

531
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,540
Eight points

532
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,940
mean...

533
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,540
mean

534
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,100
he feels an urge toward you.

535
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,740
Nine points mean
he wants to marry you.

536
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,100
Aren't you guys curious?

537
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,300
I am not finished yet.

538
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,390
Ask me about the ten points.

539
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,020
How does that concern me?

540
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:29,960
Forget it.

541
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,780
Where are you going?

542
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,380
(His feelings for Ming Zhu
is at least six points.)

543
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,090
(But what about me?)

544
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,880
(Nothing different.)

545
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,460
(Just a rebound.)

546
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,580
I heard Mr. Tang had previously
pursued Ming Zhu.

547
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,100
I don't think so.

548
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,620
Where did you hear that from?

549
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,300
Don't try to fool me.

550
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,700
When Ming Zhu
was injured the last time,

551
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,060
Mr. Tang disregarded work
and flew right over.

552
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,470
Doesn't that count as pursuing?

Alright.

590
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,580
This is how powerful Miss Tang is.

591
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,540
She has the top executives
of Time Pictures

592
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,540
serving as her drivers.

593
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,500

594
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,940

00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,220
What are you doing?

597
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,460
Aren't we picking Dingding up?

598
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,300
I bet there are many drunkards there.

599
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,240
One isn't enough.

600
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,440
You drive this one.

601
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,140
I thought I could have a little fun,

602
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,250
but you're making me the driver?

603
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,380
How could you...

604
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,700
I can still drink a little more.

605
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,340
Tang Xin.

606
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:54,820
I can drink more.

607
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:56,940
Get me another one.

608
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,460
Isn't it too soon for you to get drunk?

609
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,980
Tang Xin.

610
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,580
Shen Fei told me yesterday

611
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,820
the reason you didn't say yes
to my brother

612
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,700
was because

613
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,380
he asked for your help
to pursue Ming Zhu, right?

614
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:13,740
Right?

615
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:14,820
Yes.

616
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,660
It must be the reason.

617
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,380
Put yourself in her shoes.

618
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:19,380
If it were Huo asking you

619
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,650
to help him pursue another girl,

620
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,620
what would you do?

621
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,100
I would send him a flying kick.

622
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:26,820
Then,

623
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,580
I'll punch Huo...

624
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,300
What about me?

625
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,020
in the left

626
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:29,980
and in the right.

627
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,740
That's enough.

628
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,860
Why are you so drunk?

629
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,900
I'll smash his head.

630
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,860
Smash his head.

631
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,620
How did I offend you, ladies?

632
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,940
- Stay still.
- Come over

633
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,100
to the karaoke room.

634
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,580
Smash his dumb head.

635
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,780
- Smash his dumb head.
- Tang Dingding.

636
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,020
Did I not tell you to drink less?

637
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,820
Did you ignore my advice?

638
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,940
You look like my brother.

639
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:56,740
How...

640
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,020
Alright.

641
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:58,820
Come here.

642
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,460
Take a rest.

643
00:34:59,460 --> 00:34:59,860
No way.

644
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,020
I must be hallucinating.

645
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,820
This person looks familiar.

646
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,860
I just talked bad about him,
and he showed up.

647
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,300
He appeared
after I talked bad about him.

648
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,100
Did I just see...

649
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,060
Tang Yu.

650
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,620
Why can't you understand me?

651
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,340
Did you know how hard it was

652
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,740
for me in the past few years?

653
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,940
You jerk.

654
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,020
Tang Xin. I'll take her home.

655
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:44,620
It's alright.

656
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,620
Let's go.

657
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:46,740
She stays next door.

658
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,740
I'll send her home.

659
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,940
Tang Yu.

660
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,140
You jerk.

661
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,580
You're a nasty jerk.

662
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,420

663
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,140
Mr. Tang.

664
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:57,920
Dingding is inside.

665
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:58,860
Send her home.

666
00:35:58,860 --> 00:35:59,260
Sure.

667
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,580
Nasty jerk.

668
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:02,980
You're nothing

669
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,220
but a nasty jerk.

670
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,740
Be careful.

671
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,540
Are you really Tang Yu?

672
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,300
I'm not.

673
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,340
I'm a fake.

674
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,860
I'll send you home.

675
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,980

676
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,500

00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,380

678
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,700
Passcode?

679
00:37:59,380 --> 00:37:59,980

680
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,140

681
