(Tyrant's Diary)

(I feel like I'll be stuck in the ordeal
brought by Tang Yu for life.)

25
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,190
(Enduring it is grueling.)

26
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,570
(Tang Yu has to suffer a bit, too.)

27
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,110
Mr. Tang.

28
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,030
Do you know when a man is the sexiest?

29
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,510
When?

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,270
When he's scooping cat litter.

31
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,710
Got it.

32
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,870
Finish it.

33
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,230
Okay.

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,070
You can't eat anymore.

35
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,350
No more food.

36
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,270
I'll only be here for twenty minutes,

37
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,630
yet you're still working?

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,239
My superior is at my place.

39
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,510
I have to perform well.

40
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,430
What are you looking at?

41
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,030
I'm not looking at anything.

42
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,350
Don't look.

43
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,870
I invested in it.

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,350
Can't I see the script?

45
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,990
Not now.

46
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,310
Why not?

47
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,310
Because

48
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,230
it's not good enough yet.

49
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,950
Actually, every piece of work

50
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,070
is like a creator's child.

51
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,310
You gotta be confident in yourself.

52
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,070
Are you confident

53
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,319
in me raising my child

54
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,679
plump and healthy?

55
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,750
Of course.

56
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,190
This is your child

57
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,670
and also mine.

58
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,030
We both need to work hard on it.

59
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,950
Don't take advantage of me.

60
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,750
Okay.

61
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,310
You go ahead.

62
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,670
I'll be here with you.

63
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,950
Just a friendly reminder.

64
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,110
You only have five minutes left now.

65
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,790
Five minutes?

66
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,590
No wonder you are a tyrant.

67
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,670
You truly are heartless
and unreasonable.

68
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,390
You think I'm unreasonable?

69
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,950
At least, I deserve credit
for efforts, right?

70
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,990
Can't you add another five minutes?

71
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,830
Fine.

72
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,879
I'll add another ten minutes for you,

73
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,230
making it half an hour.

74
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,390
Consider it my generosity.

75
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,270
Really?

76
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,990
That's quite a deal.

77
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,350
Tang Yu.

78
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,750
Thank you.

79
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,630
For always believing in me.

80
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,719
Starting from tomorrow,

81
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,990
it'll officially be thirty minutes.

82
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,230
No way.

83
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,790
These superficial things
are not that meaningful.

84
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,679
Right?

85
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,190
That's how I feel, too.

86
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,359
Artistes shouldn't just talk the talk.

87
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,350
Instead, they need to walk the walk.

88
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,199
You know so many artistes.

89
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,439
You must know the ropes.

90
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,439
Could you find
a reliable acting teacher for me?

91
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,479
You can do it, right?

92
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,670
There's no need to find a teacher.

93
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,839
I've got a core solution

94
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,519
for your issue.

95
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,639
A core solution?

96
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,639
What is it?

97
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,719
Abandon this unrealistic idea

98
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,039
of being an artiste altogether.

99
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,070
No way.

100
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,199
I've thought it through.

101
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,110
I am determined to become one.

102
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,199
I was discovered by director

103
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,519
Lu Zhixing, himself.

104
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,439
Director Lu Zhixing.

105
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,790
If he thinks I'm suitable,

106
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,919
then I definitely am.

107
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,230
I will absolutely not give up.

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,079
Are you persisting

109
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,230
just because of some words
from that director?

110
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,279
It's not just his words.

111
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,310
It's his approval of me.

112
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,070
He trusts me so much.

113
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,870
I can't let him down.

114
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,550
Hey, can you help me or not?

115
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,070
Let me think again.

116
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,230
I disagree.

117
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,830
I oppose Dingding entering showbiz.

118
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,390
Dad.

119
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,830
Dingding.

120
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,110
Your dad is saying

121
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,750
the entertainment industry
is a mixed bag.

122
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,830
Plus, your acting skills
aren't that great.

123
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,399
You'll invite criticism by then.

124
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,470
Mom.

125
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,430
Yu.

126
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,910
Mom, it's not right.

127
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,279
If the entertainment industry
is a mixed bag,

128
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:08,879
our family

129
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,559
will be a kaleidoscope.

130
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,550
He's right.

131
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,030
(Dingding.)

132
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,590
(Don't blame me
for being old-fashioned.)

133
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:17,519
(In our family,)

134
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,550
(there are only two girls
in your generation.)

135
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,150
(The other one joined the military.)

136
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,270
(She lives like a man.)

137
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,879
(Now, we only have you.)

138
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,870
(You're a treasure in our family.)

139
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,310
(Being an artiste is tough.)

140
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,359
(Why not work at your brother's company)

141
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,430
(to learn a few things from him?)

142
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,559
Grandma.

143
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,359
(That's right.)

144
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,639
(Moreover, kissing and bed scenes
might be required.)

145
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,919
(It's infuriating to think about it.)

146
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,559
(Tang Yu, don't you care
about Dingding?)

147
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,710
Whether I can even be an artiste
is uncertain.

148
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,719
Okay, I understand everyone's concerns.

149
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,390
Let me ease your worries.

150
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,839
Dingding's project involves

151
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,230
friends of mine
as the director and screenwriter.

152
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,959
Furthermore,

153
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,710
I'm the investor and producer
of this project.

154
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,390
No one would dare to bully her.

155
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,270
Additionally,

156
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,310
Dingding won't sign with my company.

157
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,710
I'll let her establish hers.

158
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,950
Why?

159
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,790
- Is it because the talent director is...
- No particular reason.

160
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,079
I allow you to set up your own studio

161
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,079
under Time.

162
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,839
You'll have creative control.

163
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,870
Isn't that good?

164
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,919
But that's...

165
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,070
No "buts". It's settled now.

166
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,510
However, Mom is right.

167
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,870
Your acting still needs refinement.

168
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,759
Dad, I have dinner to attend tonight.

169
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,750
I'll leave first.

170
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,830
Go ahead.

171
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,470
Yu.

172
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,030
Wait up, Yu.

173
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,270
Wait up.

174
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,590
What's wrong?

175
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,119
Come to my birthday party

176
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,630
with Tang Xin this weekend, got it?

177
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,430
Do you need to personally

178
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,310
remind me about your birthday?

179
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,710
Of course not.

180
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,830
I have other information.

181
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,039
For this birthday party,

182
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,399
my besties will dress

183
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,110
in sweet princess style.

184
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,630
I asked Tang Xin
what she wanted to wear,

185
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,910
but she was secretive
and wouldn't tell me.

186
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,759
Yu, that's all the help I can offer.

187
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,470
The rest is up to you.

188
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,430
Wear a matching suit.

189
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,190
You'll steal the spotlight.

190
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,430
Is that it?

191
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,550
Just talking tough.

192
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,470
Why are you here?

193
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,999
I got a new scoop for the cat litter

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,310
and want to try it out.

195
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,710
He doesn't need it.

196
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,550
What is that?

197
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:18,910
Hey.

198
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,230
What is that?

199
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:23,879
Tang Yu.

200
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,990
That's the bedroom.

201
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,750
The litter box is over there.

202
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,670
Over there.

203
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,990
Tang Yu.

204
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,430
What are you looking at?

205
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,799
Nothing.

206
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,550
I'm about to scoop litter.

207
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,590
By the way,

208
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,919
have you picked your dress

209
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,870
for Dingding's birthday party?

210
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,350
Yeah, I have.

211
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,670
Great.

212
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,119
How about trying it on now?

213
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,150
I'll see

214
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,150
how it looks.

215
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,670
If it doesn't fit, we can alter it.

216
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,070
My best friend is a fashion designer.

217
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,830
She already sorted it out for me.

218
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,430
I see.

219
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,230
Tang Yu.

220
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,679
Are you scooping cat litter
or producing it?

221
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,990
Can you hurry up?

222
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,390
The cat litter smells a bit today.

223
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,159
Uh.

224
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,630
Aren't you busy with your job?

225
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,319
How about this?

226
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,119
You go work in the study first.

227
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,359
After I finish scooping,

228
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,030
I'll clean up everything and go back.

229
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,310
Just go.

230
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,519
Hua Juan.

231
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,079
Why does your poop smell so bad today?

232
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,750
Are you having digestive issues
recently?

233
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,670
Hurry up.

234
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,110
Okay.

235
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,470
Mr. Tang.

236
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,790
Scooping cat litter all the way
to my room, huh?

237
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,430
Hua Juan...

238
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,199
Hua Juan just went in.

239
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:50,799
Hua Juan?

240
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,399
Is that so?

241
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,350
Hua Juan?

242
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,830
Hua Juan.

243
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,870
Hua Juan?

244
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,990
Hua Juan.

245
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,110
Looks awful.

246
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,430
Why are you dressed up like this?

247
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,790
What's wrong?

248
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,990
Isn't it nice?

249
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,390
Yes, it is. But wait.

250
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,390
Dingding told me

251
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,230
it'd be princess style.

252
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,599
With so many princesses around,

253
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,759
wouldn't they need a witch like me

254
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,950
to balance things out?

255
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,479
But wasn't there

256
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,199
a different dress

257
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,879
hanging in your room that day?

258
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,150
That's Dingding's.

259
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,150
She took it to You Huan
to tighten the waistline.

260
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,959
Let's go, Mr. Tang.

261
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,470
We'll be late if we don't hurry.

262
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,390
Wait a second.

263
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,439
What are you doing?

264
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,670
Okay, let's go.

265
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:26,719
Wait.

266
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,399
How can I walk
with you dragging me like this?

267
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,310
You can.

268
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,830
We're here.

269
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,630
By the way,

270
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,750
do your parents know

271
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,990
about us?

272
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,310
What about us?

273
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,310
I like you?

274
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,630
Or I'm pursuing you?

275
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,230
Scared?

276
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,070
You think you scare me?

277
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,310
They don't know.

278
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,350
Let's go.

279
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,710
(Happy 23rd birthday, Tang Dingding)

280
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,630
Seriously?

281
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,030
These two are getting addicted
to playing Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

282
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,710
Dingding.

283
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,830
What's the relationship
between Tang Xin and your brother?

284
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,950
Take a guess.

285
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,750
Hey, that's not nice.

286
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,599
Honestly,

287
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,159
are they in a romantic relationship?

288
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,550
No.

289
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,710
Don't tell me

290
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,230
they're in that kind of relationship?

291
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,350
What do you mean?

292
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,039
The special kind

293
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,750
where they care deeply
about each other.

294
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,679
What are you talking about?
That's impossible.

295
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,070
Just say it's not if it isn't.

296
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,230
Tang Yu.

297
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,319
I'm going over there.

298
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,510
Take care of yourself.

299
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,870
Let's go.

300
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,599
Some friends are here.

301
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,639
Let me introduce them to you.

302
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,350
Okay.

303
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,239
Here, let me introduce to you guys.

304
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,470
This is my cousin.

305
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,310
Mr. Tang from Time Pictures.

306
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:41,999
Nice to meet you, Mr. Tang.

307
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:42,910
Welcome.

308
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,470
By the way,

309
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,710
is Huo Chendong not coming today?

310
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,590
That's right.

311
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,679
Darn you, Huo Chendong.

312
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,230
How dare you be late on my birthday!

313
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,350
You're finished.

314
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,519
Here comes Li Wei and the rest.

315
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,270
Let's go.

316
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,399
Dingding, happy birthday.

317
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:01,999
Let's go there.

318
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,230
Alright, let's go.

319
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,619
Dingding said
her brother would take care of you.

320
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,030
He actually drove you here, eh?

321
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,550
We were heading the same way, okay?

322
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,799
Wearing matching outfits
along the way, huh?

323
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,310
You call these matching outfits?

324
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,710
It looks more like we happen
to wear the same color.

325
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,390
I'm telling you,

326
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,879
among these young ladies,

327
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,550
there's a lady Tang Yu's parents
are trying to set him up with.

328
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,390
Really?

329
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,179
Excuse me for a moment.

330
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,030
Okay.

331
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,170
Where's Dingding?

332
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,630
She was here just now.

333
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,830
That's the girl
you helped find a house, right?

334
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,670
You know what?

335
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,879
You two seemed like a perfect couple

336
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,910
when you came in.

337
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,510
Of course.

338
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,870
But I'll tell you what,

339
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,479
I heard that among the young ladies

340
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,750
who came today,

341
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,990
there's one your mom's trying
to set you up with.

342
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,710
Don't worry.

343
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,590
I'll talk it out with my mom.

344
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,990
Okay. Cheers.

345
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,390
You're here.

346
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:16,919
Mom.

347
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,079
Come with me.

348
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,159
- Aunt.
- I'll be back in a sec.

349
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,310
Come with me.

350
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,510
Xiaowen.

351
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,350
This is my son.

352
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,479
- Hi.
- Yu, this is Xiaowen.

353
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,799
She graduated
from the Beaux-Arts de Paris

354
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,630
and has just returned from France.
- Mom.

355
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,070
I have something to tell you.

356
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,150
Excuse me.

357
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,399
Please give us a minute.

358
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,630
We'll be back right away.

359
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,350
I have to confess something to you.

360
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,239
The girl I'm pursuing
is also here today.

361
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,630
The girl you're pursuing?

362
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,710
You mean the one from last time?

363
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,250
- Not that one.
- Where is she then?

364
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,439
Is she here?

365
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,270
She's there.

366
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,470
The one with a sweet smile.

367
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,790
You've seen her picture before.

368
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,910
I remember now.

369
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,750
Mom.

370
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,070
What are you doing?

371
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,959
I'm going to talk
to my future daughter-in-law.

372
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,199
Can you leave us alone?

373
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,679
She hasn't agreed to be my girlfriend.

374
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,070
Don't scare her away.

375
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,839
Look at you. You're already 30,

376
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,319
yet you're unable to get a girlfriend.

377
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,750
At this rate, you'll stay single.

378
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:21,910
Fine.

379
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,510
I'll leave you two alone.

380
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,110
I'll just stand here and watch.

381
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,999
You have to hurry.

382
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,550
Okay, I promise you.

383
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,719
Do you want to try this?

384
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,519
Tang Xin, You Huan.

385
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,470
No, I'll pass.

386
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,679
There are too many guests today.

387
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,239
I haven't had time
to take care of you two.

388
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,999
It's okay.

389
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,830
We can take care of ourselves.

390
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,199
Happy birthday to our birthday girl.

391
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,199
Happy birthday.

392
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,430
Thank you.

393
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,710
Honey.

394
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,519
What's the matter?

395
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,479
The girl Tang Yu is pursuing

396
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,839
is here today.

397
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,750
Is that so?

398
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,990
Where is she?

399
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,790
Not bad.

400
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,870
Don't stare like that.

401
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:06,799
Right.

402
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,070
Be more natural.

403
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,199
I'll go over there first.

404
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,110
Sure.

405
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,719
Tang Xin.

406
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,870
There's

407
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,990
a special guest today.

408
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,150
Look over there.

409
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,150
There's

410
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,390
a girl in a champagne dress.

411
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,470
Don't look too intentionally.

412
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:31,279
What's wrong?

413
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,079
That's the girl my mom

414
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,790
introduced to my brother.

415
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,910
Why are you telling me this?

416
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,750
Don't want to hear?

417
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,550
Yu.

418
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,590
Let's go.

419
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,190
You two go ahead.

420
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,910
Is she your type?

421
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,350
I'll like

422
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,910
whatever type you are.

423
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,630
I dare not.

424
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,710
Take it.

425
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,110
Why?

426
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,190
You've been drinking since entered here.

427
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,230
You haven't eaten properly in days.

428
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,750
Replenish some sugar,

429
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,350
or it'll affect your mood

430
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,870
and your creativity.

431
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,750
None of your concern. I'm on a diet.

432
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,910
No need to diet.

433
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,470
You already look good.

434
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,430
Take it.

435
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,950
Yu.

436
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,199
Serve me, too.

437
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,630
You've got hands.

438
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,270
Dingding.

439
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,150
Don't you have hands?

440
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,630
Are you sure your mom knows nothing?

441
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,630
I have to attend to the elders
for a while.

442
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:07,790
Stay put.

443
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,110
We'll go home together tonight.

444
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,190
Who said I'd go home with you?

445
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,630
I'll assume you agreed.

446
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:15,950
I...

447
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,830
Goodnight, Mr. Tang.

448
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,710
Why are you here again?

449
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,519
Didn't we agree

450
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,670
I could come for half an hour each day?

451
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,839
Don't you feel tired

452
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,750
of running around today?

453
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,190
I do,

454
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,950
but not as much as you.

455
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,110
Are you jealous?

456
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,430
Twenty-three years old.

457
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,190
Graduated from Beaux-Arts de Paris.

458
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,870
Currently managing an art gallery.

459
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,150
Her mom and mine
were college classmates.

460
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,630
Sounds pretty good.

461
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,910
Seize the opportunity.

462
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,550
I don't want you to misunderstand,

463
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,150
so I'm keeping you informed.

464
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,950
My mom didn't know I was pursuing you.

465
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,230
But don't worry.

466
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,350
I've explained everything to her today.

467
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,430
No wonder your mom
has been watching me all day.

468
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,399
Rest assured. My mom isn't the kind
to approach you secretly

469
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,830
and offer you a million to leave me.

470
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,630
So, you're just worth a million.

471
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,150
Looks like I'm worth more

472
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,990
than that to you.

473
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,070
Who boasts about themselves like that?

474
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,639
If you're that free,

475
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,110
why not help me out a bit?

476
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,350
Sure.

477
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,670
I'd love to.

478
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,830
What?

479
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,110
Write it.

480
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,070
Do I have to be like this?

481
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,910
It's my writing habit.

482
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,830
What kind of habit is this?

483
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,559
It has to watch me write

484
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,950
and help me find inspiration.

485
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,790
Let it watch from the front, then.

486
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,270
See if this works.

487
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,230
Let me see.

488
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,950
No.

489
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,470
See what you wrote here?

490
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,639
It's "where to",

491
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,430
not "where are you going".

492
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,710
Is there a difference?

493
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,430
Of course there is.

494
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,350
Look.

495
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,879
When you add two words,

496
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,759
it becomes questioning in this context.

497
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,870
Don't you think so?

498
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,190
The words must be precise.

499
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,550
It's like

500
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,390
"love you" and "I love you".

501
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,830
Do you think the grammar
and usage are the same?

502
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:14,950
I do.

503
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,070
Both mean "love you".

504
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,350
Work is work. Don't mess around.

505
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,670
Delete it.

506
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,230
Is this okay?

507
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,190
What are you doing?

508
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,110
Bullying my baby.

509
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:35,879
But

510
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,679
it's wandering around.

511
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,519
What if it damages the script?

512
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,510
You can rewrite it.

513
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,239
If you lack this little patience,

514
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,510
don't work for me.

515
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,830
Right, Huan Juan?

516
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,950
Have you heard the saying

517
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,950
"indulgent moms breed trouble"?

518
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,110
What are you saying?

519
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,670
You are the trouble.

520
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,310
Your baby is the trouble.

521
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,839
You're cursing me.

522
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,750
Be careful, or you'll regret it later.

523
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,199
Thirty minutes are up.

524
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,119
You should leave.

525
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,990
How could 30 minutes be that fast?

526
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,319
Besides, I've saved up so much time.

527
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,190
Let me stay.

528
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,750
Time can be recharged now, huh?

529
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,590
When will you use up
all that saved time?

530
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,039
I've lost count of it.

531
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,639
I believe there's still plenty left.

532
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,270
Besides, this time limit

533
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,599
is too unreasonable.

534
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,470
How about we cancel it?

535
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,790
Tang Yu.

536
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,430
I've noticed
you're getting more shameless.

537
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,870
How coincidental.

538
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,070
Me, too.

539
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,470
Actually,

540
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,910
I'll have a business trip tomorrow

541
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,670
for something crucial

542
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,350
and will be away for a few days.

543
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,630
So, could you

544
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,830
spend more time with me today?

545
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,759
Mom, Dad.

546
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,750
What's the matter?

547
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,270
(Can't we just contact you?)

548
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,590
That's not what I meant.

549
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,630
Xin.

550
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,239
I saw online

551
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,999
that those who accused you

552
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,319
of plagiarism have apologized.

553
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,510
Are you okay now?

554
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,550
I am.

555
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,630
You can rest assured.

556
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,790
Good to hear that.

557
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,159
You can embark

558
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,550
on a new journey in life, then.

559
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,230
What do you mean?

560
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,710
Listen.

561
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,999
Ms. Lin's son's company

562
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,039
has moved to Nangang.

563
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,999
How about I

564
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,110
set up a meal for you two?

565
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,190
Mom.

566
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,550
Another blind date?

567
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,439
If Ms. Lin's son

568
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,430
is as great as you said,

569
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,310
why's he been single for half a year?

570
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,510
Aren't you single, too?

571
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:50,799
(Tell me.)

572
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,310
(Are you still thinking about that man)

573
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,230
who made you heartbroken?

574
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,799
Is...

575
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,079
Is his last name Lu or Tang?

576
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:58,839
Exactly.

577
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,959
Don't overthink.

578
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,750
It's not Lu.

579
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,319
It must be Tang, then.

580
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,190
Right?

581
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,550
Mom.

582
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,159
Can you and Dad

583
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,599
stop prying into my love life

584
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,310
when you have nothing to do?

585
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,670
You see.

586
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,950
The plagiarism incident
has just settled recently.

587
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,470
I have to focus on work now.

588
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,430
Don't make excuses.

589
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,479
You can't avoid this one.

590
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,279
Your dad and I

591
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,550
have got tickets for tomorrow's flight.

592
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,710
(This time, you're going
to meet him no matter what.)

593
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,110
What?

594
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,190
Tomorrow?

595
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,070
Mom, Dad.

596
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,390
How long do you plan to stay this time?

597
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,879
What do you mean?

598
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:42,430
Are you pushing us
to leave as soon as we've arrived?

599
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,879
That's not what I meant.

600
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,039
That depends

601
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,230
on your progress with Lin.

602
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:49,959
Mom, Dad.

603
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,150
I'm only 24.

604
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,230
You make it sound
like nobody wants to marry me.

605
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,030
We're here.

606
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,719
It's about letting you meet more people

607
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,959
and experience dating.

608
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,190
We're not rushing you
to marry right away.

609
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,470
Have you ever heard this saying?

610
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:01,919
Come in.

611
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,039
The best way to forget about a past love

612
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,670
is to start a new one.

613
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,279
Our main goal this time

614
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,599
is to help you change your mood

615
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,999
and move on.

616
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,519
We won't leave

617
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,239
if we don't achieve that.

618
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,150
We want you to overcome the lovelorn
as soon as possible.

619
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,030
Mom, Dad.

620
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,830
Who told you I was upset
about the lovelorn?

621
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,919
We're your parents.

622
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,710
We can tell.

623
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,759
No, I wasn't.

624
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,199
You were.

625
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,319
Mom, I wasn't upset.

626
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,870
You were.

627
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,479
Xin.

628
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,519
What's the big deal

629
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,919
about a lovelorn?

630
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,719
No need to put up
a tough front about it.

631
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,319
Seriously.

632
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,399
Exactly.

633
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,879
You're young.

634
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,839
You should meet more people,

635
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,839
date,

636
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,039
and broaden your horizons.

637
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,919
That way, you won't easily get hurt

638
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,759
by men.

639
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,150
Just listen to your mother.

640
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,319
We're planning

641
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,150
to train you
into a love expert this time.

642
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,150
Yes.

643
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,679
Mom, Dad.

644
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,239
You're so right.

645
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,230
Right?

646
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:06,959
But

647
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,350
don't you want to explore my home now?

648
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,679
Look around.

649
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,919
This is my study.

650
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:13,039
You can take a look.

651
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,870
I even have childhood photos.

652
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,479
Dad.

653
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,039
This is my bedroom.

654
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,639
Feel free to look around.

655
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,919
I have work messages to attend to.

656
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,150
You know.

657
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,039
Xin is quite skilled in design.

658
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,230
She has good taste.

659
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,950
My girl has grown up.

660
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,910
Tang Xin.

661
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,150
Tell me.

662
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,199
What does your neighbor do?

663
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,510
Do you get along?

664
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,310
We're fine.

665
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,950
Is it a guy or a girl?

666
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,439
A guy.

667
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,710
A guy.

668
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,950
Do you...

669
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,110
Xin.

670
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,639
Do you only have snacks
in your fridge?

671
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,670
There are no green veggies at all.

672
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,070
Everyone is like this, right?

673
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,990
Take a look at this girl.

674
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,399
- Look at this.
- Let me check.

675
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,399
See, it's even moldy.

676
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,990
It's expired.

677
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,750
Geez.

678
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,030
Oh dear.

679
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,999
What does she do every day?

680
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,879
Let me take a look at that.

681
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,390
(You'd better not stay here temporarily)

682
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,070
(after returning from your business trip.)

683
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,790
(Tang Yu: No way.)

684
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,440
(Rich Lady: I mean temporarily.)

685
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,199
(Temporarily.)

686
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,039
Your dad and I are going to grab
some groceries for you.

687
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,310
Tell us what you want to eat.

688
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,679
Anything is fine for me.

689
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:34,470
I enjoy whatever you cook.

690
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,639
Okay.

691
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,480
Let me throw it.

692
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,239
(It's up to you whether
you want to stay next month.)

693
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:38,559
Come on.

694
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,439
(It doesn't matter to me.)

695
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,740
(Tang Yu: ueidrhfeihfvdjhf)
Where's the garbage can?

696
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,679
I've found it.

697
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,110
(Rich Lady: Just a heads-up to you.)

698
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,830
(My parents are with me.)

699
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,479
(Tang Yu: That's great.)

700
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,830
(I want to meet them.)

701
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,599
(Rich Lady: No problem.)

702
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,360
You can meet them.

703
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,800
(Just be sure
you won't regret it later.)

704
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,970
(Lu Studio)

705
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,510
The main challenge is to connect
these two scenes seamlessly.

706
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,750
Alright.

707
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,239
I'll adjust the transition

708
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,159
and refine the emotions in this part.

709
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,479
Sure. Feel free to start your lunch.
I need to go to the restroom.

710
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,679
No worries. I'll wait for you.

711
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,710
Alright, sure.

712
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,059
(Lu Chuning won the Best Actress
at the Golden Cat Awards yesterday,)

713
00:35:29,059 --> 00:35:31,319
(which has propelled her to become
the new rising star of the screen.)

714
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,320
(Later that night,
Tang Yu, the CEO of Time Pictures,)

715
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,399
(visited her on the set)

716
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,799
(to celebrate her win.)

717
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,279
(They spent two hours together in the RV)

718
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,100
(before heading to Lu Chuning's hotel.)

719
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,759
(Along the way, they shared
laughs and conversation)

720
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:43,959
(and appeared to be a perfect match.)

721
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:44,710
Honey.

722
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,599
Come here.

723
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,199
What is it?

724
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,150
Take a look at this.

725
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,350
Look.

726
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,750
He seems to be...

727
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,519
The boss of the company

728
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,070
(Secret Hotel Date)
where Xin used to work.

729
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,870
I'll have a business trip tomorrow

730
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,630
for something crucial

731
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,230
and will be away for a few days.

732
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,359
Come on.

733
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,670
Let's go. It's time for lunch.

734
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,790
What would you like for lunch?

735
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,550
Anything works. You decide.

736
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,990
Look at you.

737
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,479
Xin craved fried chicken,

738
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:30,919
but

739
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,399
we ended up with only vegetables.

740
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,679
What are you talking about?
Enough about fried chicken.

741
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,079
She's going to date Lin.

742
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,679
Isn't fried chicken fattening?

743
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,950
Plus, she's still consuming carbs.

744
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,310
Dad, Mom.

745
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,150
Nice to meet you.

746
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,950
Isn't he...

747
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,190
He...

748
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,079
Dad.

749
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,039
Oh, you're back.
Let's get inside and cook.

750
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,950
I'm starving.

751
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,719
There's nothing here.

752
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,679
I'm starving to death.

753
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,070
Let's get in.

754
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,390
Goodbye.

755
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,599
He greeted us.

756
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,750
Why did you usher us inside?

757
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,039
I barely know him.

758
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,470
Come on, let me carry it for you.

759
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,630
Dad, give it to me.

760
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,110
Xin.

761
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,550
Why are you so jittery

762
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,110
since you barely know him?

763
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,239
Dad.

764
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,599
Didn't you promise
to get me fried chicken?

765
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,679
Where is it?

766
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,599
Fried chicken is junk food.

767
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,110
You should cut it down.

768
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:41,790
Yes, madam.

769
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,590
Sit here.

770
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,110
I have something to ask you.

771
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,439
I've recognized him a while back.

772
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,879
Your mom and I spotted him on TV

773
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,830
in the entertainment news.

774
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,350
Please be honest with us.

775
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,630
Were you heartbroken

776
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,750
because of him?

777
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,910
No.

778
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,830
Are you sure?

779
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,439
I'll ask him.

780
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,710
Dad.

781
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,350
Please calm down.

782
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,190
I...

783
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,190
Yes.

784
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,759
I used to have feelings for him,

785
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,990
but he turned me down.

786
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,510
We've resolved this matter.

787
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,150
What do you mean by "resolved"?

788
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,270
If that's the case,
why is he still living next door?

789
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,430
Well...

790
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,270
There's something wrong
with him mentally.

791
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,310
He seems fine.

792
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,759
He looks like a normal person

793
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,310
and is quite handsome.

794
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:44,390
It's just that there are too many
gossips surrounding him.

795
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,390
He rejected Xin.

796
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,799
He doesn't know how to cherish Xin.

797
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,079
Even though he is handsome,

798
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:52,950
in my opinion,

799
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,590
he doesn't deserve Xin at all.

800
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,350
Dad.

801
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,990
Why are you being so harsh?

802
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,799
That's enough.

803
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,830
Let's not talk about him.

804
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,599
How about going on a blind date?

805
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,990
Today,

806
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,639
Ms. Lin

807
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,039
sent me another photo.

808
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,990
Look at this.

809
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,110
Look,

810
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,639
he's thirty-something,

811
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,999
six feet tall,

812
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,590
and handsome.

813
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,279
He's your type.

814
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,230
I think...

815
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,470
Mom.

816
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,830
I don't want to go.

817
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,439
Please let her know quickly.

818
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,510
You...

819
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,150
What?

820
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,119
The more I dwell on it,
the angrier I get.

821
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:29,639
I can't take it.

822
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,879
I need to talk to him.

823
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,479
Dad, where are you...

824
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,790
Why does your temper
fluctuate so quickly?

825
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,190
Calm down.

826
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,390
Tell me,

827
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,310
are you going or not?

828
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,670
Are you going or not?

829
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,230
Make a decision.

830
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,110
I...

831
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,030
I'll go.

832
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,110
I'll go.

833
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,950
I said I'll go.

834
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,430
Please make dinner now.

835
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,159
I'm hungry.

836
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,190
Please make dinner now.

837
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,990
Well done.

838
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,670
(Tang Yu: Can you come out for a while?)

839
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,870
(Tang Yu. Do not disturb.)

840
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,079
My mom is going over the top.

841
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,479
I'm going on a blind date.

842
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,519
She has chosen an outfit for me

843
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,950
as if I'm accepting
the Best Screenplay Award.

844
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,190
Mr. Gao.

845
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,630
Why are you staring at me?

846
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:01,990
Don't you recognize me?

847
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,710
Miss Tang.

848
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,390
Are you going on a blind date?

849
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,350
Yes, indeed.

850
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,550
Isn't Mr. Tang pursuing you?

851
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,839
But he

852
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,670
is also flirting with other girls.

853
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,510
I'm still single.

854
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,790
Why can't I going on a blind date?

855
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,990
Aren't you coming in?

856
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,599
I left something at Mr. Tang's house.

857
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,710
You go ahead.

858
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,030
Weirdo.

859
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:42,790
Mr. Tang.

860
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,070
Why have you returned?

861
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:51,999
Mr. Tang.

862
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,070
I ran into Miss Tang Xin
in the elevator.

863
00:41:58,720 --> 00:41:59,510
Go on.

864
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:02,830
She... She seems to be

865
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,630
going for a blind date.

866
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,870
A blind date?

867
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,110
Hua Juan.

868
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,390
Hua Juan.

869
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:38,790
Hua Juan.

870
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,279
I'm sorry.

871
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,830
You must be starving.

872
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,990
Fetch some cat food for him.

873
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:52,919
Sure.

874
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,390
I'll get it now.

00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,999
(Elite Magazine)

876
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,510
Little troublemaker.

877
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,790
Hua Juan.

878
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,030
Come here.

879
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,470
Come over here and eat.

880
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:21,030
Your appetite is growing.

881
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,710
I'm almost broke from feeding you.

882
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,110
Enjoy your meal.

884
00:43:29,689 --> 00:43:30,590
Did you buy this magazine?

885
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,279
No, I didn't buy it.

886
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,919
I don't know who left it
at my house the other day.
