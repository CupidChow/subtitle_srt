42

Yep.

43
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,959
He saved my life.

44
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,660
I'd be dead otherwise.

45
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,860
I have to get him something as thanks.

46
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,599
I was ad-libbing at the hotel,

47
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,620
but I never thought
that accident would happen.

48
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,719
I'm telling you,

49
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,879
after your brother heard of it,

50
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,039

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,359
after he comes back
from his business trip,

54
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,820
he'll talk to Mr. Lu.

55
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,319
Oh no.

56
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,020
Please don't let him do that.

57
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,479
It's normal for actors

58
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,180
to run into accidents during shootings.

59
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,959
Besides,

00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,820

That's my brother.

83
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,340

Hey, it looks like him.

85
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,780
Look at the eyes.

86
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,780
Doesn't look like him. Look at me.

87
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,420

96

start a shoot first?

97
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,380
It's alright. We're in no hurry.
Have you eaten anything?

98
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,380
- Mr. Lu, eat something.
- Food's ready.

99
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,559
Thanks.

100
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,460
Dingding.

101
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,199
I got you pizza.

102
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,780
I come and see you guys,

103
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,199
knowing night shift's going to be hard.

104
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,319
Fill yourselves up.

105
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,279
I'll grab something to eat.

106
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,140
Go.

107
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,919
This is durian pizza.

108
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,940
Here, Dingding.

109
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,580
Thanks.

110
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,220
You're taking a liking
to all things durian lately, aren't you?

111
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,100
This is nice.

112
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,340
Dingding.

113
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,319
I heard an episode happened
a few days ago.

114
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:14,999
How did it go?

115
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,100
Everything alright?

116
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,620
If you're tired, you can take a day off.

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,919
I'm fine.

118
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,420
I'm fine, aren't I?

119
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,439
Besides,

120
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,460
I can't let the whole crew
wait for me a whole day.

121
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,719
You're growing up.

122
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,900
You're more mature now.

123
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,100
Of course.

124
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,060
I am a brilliant actress

125
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,999
who grows stronger with every obstacle.

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,020
Aren't I?

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,860
This is for you.

128
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,820
Oh, I get something too?

129
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,359
This is the local product.

130
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,759
I think it's nice.

131
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,759
If you don't like them,

132
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,020
give them to your girlfriend.

133
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,199
I don't have a girlfriend.

134
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,140
With how fast you're moving,
you will have one soon.

135
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,660
Going back to your room?

136
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,180
I'm giving the candies to Mr. Lu.

137
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,199
The candy he ate at the shooting site

138
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,220
was from you?

139
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,620
Yep.

140
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,300
I'm a newbie.

141
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,519
I don't have experience.

142
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,100
I caused him tons of trouble
during the shoot.

143
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,399
If I don't cheer him up,

144
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,580
he'd lecture me.

145
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,660
He dares lecture you?

146
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,140
I'll talk to him.

147
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,359
No, wait.

148
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,820
It's nothing.

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,319
I was kidding.

150
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,700
Besides, nothing bad
with having some candies.

151
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,039
I realize

152
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,100
Mr. Lu's mood has taken a turn
for the better lately.

153
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,159
I'll be going now.

154
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,279
You get back to work.

155
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,220
Bye.

156
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,660
Who's there?

157
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,540
Mr. Lu.

158
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,940
I'm here to bribe you.

159
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,180
I thought you'd only
come with that tomorrow.

160
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,999
Once every ten days.

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,239
It's only

162
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,420
the ninth day today.

163
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,620
You count the days?

164
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,940
However,

165
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,020
I have cookies this time.

166
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,639
I tried it out, and it's nice.

167
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,420
You...

168
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:26,460
You should taste it a bit later.

169
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,860
Do you know what is the first thing

170
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,900
I want to do after I get to Nangang?

171
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,220
What is it?

172
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,620
Forget it.

173
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,839
Why aren't you telling?

174
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,719
Why don't you finish your sentences?

175
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,020
Come on, spill.

176
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,140
I'm not leaving until you do.

177
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,980
The first thing I want to do
after going back to Nangang

178
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,620
is to get my teeth checked.

179
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,260
Lately,

180
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,900
I ate too many candies.

181
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,780
Maybe I'll get cavities.

182
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,020
Sorry. I'm not going
to tease you anymore.

183
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,020
Then I keep them for myself.

184
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,919
Come on.

185
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,300
You bought them already.

186
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,540
It's a waste not to give them away.

187
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,140
I'll give you something else then.

188
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,460
Example?

189
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,260
For example...

190
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,340
Bitter tea.

191
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,620
Bitter gourd.

192
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,340
Black coffee.

193
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,860
The bitter stuff

194
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,100
can cancel out the sugar.

195
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,700
I'd rather take the sugar.

196
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,260
Filmmaking is a hard enough job.

197
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,620
Don't make it any more bitter than it is.

198
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,140
Um...

199
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,580
Mr. Lu.

200
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,620
It's getting late.

201
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,439
I should sleep.

202
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,700
You get some rest too.

203
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,900
Sure.

204
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,840
Hi.

205
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,680
- Hi.
- Hi.

206
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,900
Hey.

207
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,380
It's late. What do you want?

208
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,540
Dingding came to give you candies again?

209
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,940
I saw them. Give me some.

210
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,140
No. It's not enough for even me.

211
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,060
Sleep tight.

212
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,740
She's not replying.

213
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,460
Coming.

214
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,260
What's wrong?

215
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,340
You stepped on my foot.

216
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,580
Sorry.

217
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,340
Why do you look like
you did something wrong?

218
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,220
I did do something wrong.

219
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,100
I steal your hearts.

220
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,100
I thought you were going to give me
some presents.

221
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,940
You're a shy person.

222
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,959
When I pounced on you
and gave you a kiss,

223
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,500
you didn't even respond.

224
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,900
Where's the present?

225
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,340
So, does it look like you?

226
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,460
It's hideous.
Doesn't look like me at all.

227
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,900
It looks exactly like you.

228
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,900
Look.

229
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,479
Those droopy eyes.

230
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,300
It looks just like you
when you lecture your employees.

231
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,919
That sneer goes to the chin.

232
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,479
Looks just like you when you're mad.

233
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,660
It doesn't look like me at all.

234
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,599
- Can't believe you'd say that.
- It looks just like you.

235
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,319
Just like you.

236
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,580
Give it back.

237
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:33,860
Not a bad position.

238
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,740
Stay here for a while.

239
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,220
It's late.

240
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,500
I'm going back to sleep.

241
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,540
You were so brave earlier, though.

242
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,820
Why are you getting shy now?

243
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,860
I am not shy.

244
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,519
I just don't want You Huan
and the others

245
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,140
to find me missing
when they get to my room.

246
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,540
They know where you are anyway.

247
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,100
Nothing to be scared of.

248
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,740
Why don't you stay here

249
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,500
for the night?

250
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,660
I'll get showered.

251
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,620
(Don't tell me
Tang Yu's eight points is...)

252
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,820
Are you ready?

253
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,020
What are you thinking?

254
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,700
Dry my hair for me.

255
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,359
Who's there?

256
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,340
Me.

257
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,599
Got you some good wine
from a nice vineyard.

258
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,220
I want to chat with you.

259
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,140
I don't have time.

260
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,879
Hey, don't be like that.

261
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,999
Don't you care about your friend?

262
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,559
Have a drink with me.

263
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,980
You have too much time.

264
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,340
Why don't I get you a plane ticket
to Africa to survey the new project?

265
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,460
Alright, see you around.

266
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,279
I must be stupid.

267
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,500
Why'd I want to talk to him
about Dingding's stuff?

268
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,319
Good thing I didn't go in.

269
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,020
Or he'd kill me.

270
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,300
He's gone.

271
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,380
So...

272
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,780
I'll be going back.

273
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,580
Let me see the front.

274
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,279
Nice.

275
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,279
You're pretty.

276
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,380
I'm nervous.

277
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,500
I'm still nervous. What should I do?

278
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,980
I can't believe the biggest test
for my acting came so fast.

279
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,180
It's alright.

280
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,340
Calm down.

281
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,900
Let's hug.

282
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:25,959
Your hands are shaking.

283
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,300
Come on, hugs.

284
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,420
- Calm down.
- Is my brother really not coming?

285
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,260
He said

286
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,260
he doesn't want to see
your kissing scenes.

287
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,519
My brother's not coming,

288
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,580
but he is.

289
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,439
He's probably here to see
your kiss scene.

290
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,359
I have to practice.

291
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,279
Tang Xin.

292
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,420
Dingding.

293
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,540
I'll talk to her.

294
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,700
You go first.

295
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,719
Sure.

296
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,919
I'll get to work.

297
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,959
You guys talk.

298
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,799
I'll be going.

299
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,580
Go.

300
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,700
So what's up?

301
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,460
You...

302
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,820
Have you thought this through?

303
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,639
If you can't do it,

304
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,580
tell Sugar Heart to change the script.

305
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,180
You can't change the script
just like that.

306
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,460
Why don't you...

307
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,460
Do you know how to fake a kiss?

308
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,260
This is your first kiss, after all.

309
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,940
That has nothing to do with you.

310
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:26,519
I know.

311
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,999
It's none of my business.

312
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,580
I just want to remind you.

313
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,039
I'm an actress now.

314
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,780
I am prepared for this.

315
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,919
I think giving my first kiss

316
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,119
to the big screen

317
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,300
is cool.

318
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,820
Cool?

319
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,719
Miss Dingding.

320
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,639
The set is ready.

321
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,439
You may start now.

322
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:43,999
Okay.

323
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,940
You're sure about this?

324
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,700
Yes.

325
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,500
Alright, get into positions.

326
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,340
Tang Xin.

327
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,100
This scene cannot be changed?

328
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,079
The plot requires it.

329
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,100
I can't change it.

330
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,100
It doesn't look too good.

331
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,359
The lighting's not optimal.

332
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,000
Give us a moment.
We'll need to check things out.

333
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,399
Tuck that umbrella away, thanks.

334
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,100
Come.

335
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,180
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

336
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,479
Here's the thing.

337
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,540
I'd like you to spin around.

338
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,319
- Okay.
- Like this?

339
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,519
You'll have to exert your right hand.

340
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,020
Put it around her waist.

341
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,839
Good. And don't overlap your hands.

342
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,060
Is the spin easy?

343
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,199
Mr. Lu, this is a slope.

344
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,559
My right hand's hurt
from the last shooting.

345
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,780
I can't exert it.

346
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,999
What about your left hand? Try it out.

347
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,860
I think my left hand's alright. Try it out.

348
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,319
What do you think, Dingding?

349
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,780
What's more comfortable for you?

350
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,279
Left hand feels really bumpy.

351
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,079
But this...

352
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,079
This position is a little...

353
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,260
A little awkward.

354
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,359
Something feels off.

355
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,580
I'll get up there. Give me a second.

356
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,060
No suitable...

357
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,420
It's fine.

358
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,980
Mr. Lu's showing the moves himself.

359
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,879
- Ji.
- I'll have to get some salve, Mr. Lu.

360
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,399
Go.

361
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:53,759
Okay.

362
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,599
Ji.

363
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,879
Where do you think we should move to?

364
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,319
Do you think

365
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,199
you can move backward?

366
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,340
A bit more inside, right?

367
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,860
Yes.

368
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,119
Are you alright?

369
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,399
Mr. Huo.

370
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,639
Alright, it's fine.

371
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,420
It's fine now. Get down, Mr. Huo.

372
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,300
It's fine, it's fine.

373
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,199
- Mr. Huo.
- Don't drag me.

374
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,260
I know this set more than you do.

375
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,239
Thanks for pulling me up, Mr. Lu.

376
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,060
I'd have fallen down otherwise.

377
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,380
It's alright.

378
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,319
What do you mean?
You think I didn't see that?

379
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,519
Leave. If you're not leaving,

380
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,140
I'll tell Tang Yu to send you to Africa.

381
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,060
So you were in the room that night?

382
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,679
Stop talking and leave.

383
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,239
Leave.

384
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,060
Leave.

385
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,239
Go.

386
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,919
Ji.

387
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,119
Was that position alright?

388
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,460
Yes, Mr. Lu.

389
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,860
That's alright.

390
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,380
Alright, then get shooting.

391
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,799
Alright, get ready for the shoot.

392
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,279
It's starting.

393
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,959
Peng Zhou, hold her waist
with your left hand.

394
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,020
Okay, Mr. Lu.

395
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,119
Need an umbrella, Zhou?

396
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,839
No, thank you.

397
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,900
Alright, okay.

398
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:25,919
Mr. Lu.

399
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,359
I just need to act
where you stood, right?

400
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,100
Right?

401
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:28,839
Okay, sure.

402
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,140
I'll check the surveillance cams.

403
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,100
Okay.

404
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,279
Talk to me.

405
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,460
How's your first kiss on the screen?

406
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,879
I think she doesn't remember

407
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,300
any first kiss on the screen.

408
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,740
All she thinks is her first kiss

409
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,180
with Mr. Lu.

410
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,759
- I'm not listening, lalala.
- What is going on?

411
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,580
Um...

412
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,860
What's the meaning of this?

413
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,300
Don't say anything stupid.

414
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,980
It was just an accident.

415
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,319
If you say anything stupid,

416
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,100
Mr. Lu will get mad if he finds out.

417
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,700
You're worried about him getting mad
instead of you getting kissed?

418
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,100
Something's off with you.

419
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,820
Hold up.

420
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,740
You and Lu Zhixing kissed?

421
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,900
That was just an accident.

422
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,879
Good thing I have no scenes tomorrow.

423
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,340
Or I'd be awkward.

424
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,580
Here.

425
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,140
Tell me the truth.

426
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,359
Do you think

427
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,980
you were taken advantage of or not?

428
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,100
You were going to do the scene
with Peng Zhou,

429
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,100
but Mr. Lu took it away.

430
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,759
Why don't

431
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,340
I talk to your brother?

432
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,839
No.

433
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,919
Please don't tell him.

434
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,980
Don't tell him, please.

435
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,199
What's wrong with you?

436
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,660
Why are you laughing so happily?

437
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,740
I just remembered.

438
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,599
I saw Huo Chendong just now,

439
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,199
and he had this weird look.

440
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,420
He was pulling a long face.

441
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,460
So this is why.

442
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:49,679
I'm telling you,

443
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,119
if I hadn't stopped him,

444
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,780
he would've punched Mr. Lu.

445
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,719
Is that right?

446
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,660
Is that right?

447
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,319
Is that right?

448
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,999
Now that you say that,

449
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,500
it's a good feeling.

00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,860
You didn't record it?

562
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,319
How's the cat's socialization?

563
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,300
Does it get along well
with other kittens?

564
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,439
He gets along with them fine.

565
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,700
He's the kitten with the best
personality here.

566
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,519
If he sees new friends,

567
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,260
he'll groom them after a few days.

568
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,060
Groom?

569
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,260
Do you use hairball paste, then?

570
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,540
Yes.

571
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,100
We'd give it hairball paste
on the regular.

572
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,599
We bathe it every week.

573
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,700
Every week?

574
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,580
Don't you know
cats cannot be bathed regularly?

575
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,319
You'll ruin the sebum it excretes

576
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,580
and expose it to diseases.

577
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:23,980
Yes.

578
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,239
Alright, that's enough, Daddy.

579
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,500
Relax.

580
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,519
I told her to give Hua Juan

581
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,719
a total checkup.

582
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,820
He's healthy.

583
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,519
Thanks.

584
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,540
We'll be going now.

585
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,860
See you.

586
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,260
Let's go home.

587
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,620
I thought you hated cats.

588
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,940
You sounded like an expert back there.

589
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,500
Anything you like,

590
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,700
I like too.

591
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,519
If you like cats,

592
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,980
can we get another one?

593
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,639
When I was a kid,

594
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,740
my mom took me to a fortune teller.

595
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,500
He said I would have two kids.

596
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,300
I need one more to fulfill the prophecy.

597
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,319
No.

598
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,780
If you take one more cat,

599
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,340
what about our own kid?

600
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,460
If I marry you,

601
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,020
I won't be tasked
with continuing the bloodline

602
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,239
and keep making babies

603
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,780
until we have five kids, will I?

604
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,420
I'm telling you,

605
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,159
no matter the gender,

606
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,540
I'll only give you two more kids at most.

607
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,380
Just kidding.

608
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,340
If you don't want kids,

609
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,780
it's fine too.

610
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,879
Really?

611
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,740
Of course.

612
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,860
I'm not kidding.

613
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,660
Of course.

614
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,580
If you'd like to,

615
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,900
give me a mini Sugar Heart.

616
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,260
A girl

617
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,940
as mischievous as you.

618
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:57,820
No.

619
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,260
If that girl steals your love from me,

620
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,900
I'll be upset.

621
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,220
She won't.

622
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:30,400
(Tang Dingding's follower: keep growing)

623
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,320
(Felicia's brand ambassador:
Tang Dingding)

624
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,759
(So, megastar, have you picked
the fan reward for three million followers?)

625
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,340
(Which set of photos
do you want to post?)

626
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,140
What's wrong?

627
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,260
Can't get used to the rising popularity?

628
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,700
I am not.

629
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,020
But it's rising a bit too fast.

630
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,799
I thought

631
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,999
it would only happen

632
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,700
after the movie aired.

633
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,180
Now I can't even go out feeling free.

634
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,060
It's like I'm being watched
from all angles.

635
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,399
Which means your brother

636
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,100
did a good job promoting you.

637
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,500
What's there to be upset about?

638
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,820
Nothing.

639
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,399
My brother and agent

640
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,220
told me about this.

641
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,079
Besides,

642
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,580
who wouldn't want to be famous?

643
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,740
I just get a bit

644
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,359
nervous.

645
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,879
I'm worried after the movie airs,

646
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,220
everyone feels disappointed in me.

647
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,540
So you don't have confidence in me?

648
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,799
That's not what I meant.

649
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,340
I didn't mean that.

650
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,260
Just kidding.

651
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,700
Mr. Lu.

652
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,100
Why'd you ask me out for dinner this time?

653
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,540
Well,

654
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,740
it's an apology.

655
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,740
Another apology?

656
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,500
I'm not that petty.

657
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,220
This apology

658
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,559
is for the weight loss

659
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,940
I told you to do before
the shooting began.

660
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,559
I lost so many weight before shooting.

661
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,660
I'll have to put them all on back.

662
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,639
It'll take about

663
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,860
70 to 80 meals.

664
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:29,780
Sure thing.

665
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,500
Mr. Lu.

666
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,020
Have you seen a dentist?

667
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,500
Yes.

668
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,380
No cavities, I hope?

669
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,140
No.

670
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,199
Next time,

671
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,540
if you want to bribe me,

672
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,420
you can give me more candies.

673
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,940
Sure thing.

674
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,519
If you can be bribed with candy,

675
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,220
it's worth all the money.

a one-hour thank-you livestream

Let's go.

711
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,820
Dingding.

712
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,519
Nothing, I just...

713
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,940
I have something for you.

714
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,540
What is this?

715
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,580
Don't open it.

716
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,940
Check it out after you get home.

717
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,500
Okay.

718
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,820
Let's go.

719
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,460
I'm tired.

720
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:12,999
Sis.

721
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,319
Your schedule's packed
from morning to night.

722
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,479
You have to change outfits
about seven times a day.

723
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,519
Working out and facial care

724
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,559
are work requirements now.

725
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,220
This is too hard.

726
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,060
You had it hard too.

727
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,740
Go home and get some rest.

728
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,220
I'll be going now.

729
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,279
Bye.

730
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,700
Bye.

731
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,340
(This thing)

732
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,559
(is the token of love
given by the male lead)

733
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,540
(to the female lead
in Mr. Lu's last film.)

734
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,159
The original is in a local film museum.

735
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,260
I can't get it.

736
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,600
I went through hoops

737
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,710
just to get the original maker
to make a one-to-one ratio replica.

738
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,740
How is it?

739
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,580
I'm happy with it.

740
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,460
I checked it out.

741
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,780
The craftsmanship is marvelous.

742
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,220
And it's retro enough.

743
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,300
What are you doing this for?

744
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,740
Feng.

745
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,460
How goes the selection for the topic?

746
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,020
Understood.

747
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,700
I'm not going
to look into your private life.

748
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,220
(Tang Dingding:
Three-million-follower perk is here.)

749
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,879
(I can't believe you didn't tell us
you were dating.)

750
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,820
No, Mom.

751
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,860
I wasn't going to hide this
from you guys.

752
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,430
I only found out
about my daughter's relationship

753
00:39:50,430 --> 00:39:53,900
through the wefie of her movie crew.

754
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,980
(I guess my girl's all grown up now.)

755
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:58,439
No, Mom.

756
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,359
I...

757
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,639
I didn't get to explain in time.

758
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,799
Don't take this the wrong way.

759
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,260
(Whatever you say.)

760
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,519
We can't rein you in anymore.

761
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,239
You're going to marry someone else

762
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,839
and be their family instead.

763
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,959
Mom.

764
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,359
(You forgot)

765
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,999
(about your own parents.)

766
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,999
No, Mom.

767
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,159
(That's it.)

768
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,300
Bye.

769
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,980
What should I do?

770
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,500
I'm telling you,

771
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,639
after my parents found out
about us dating,

772
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,220
they're furious.

773
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,260
I'll have to go back
for Spring Festival earlier.

774
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,300
Dad.

775
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,260
Mr. Tang.

776
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,860
I think he has his earphones on.
Maybe listening to his playlist.

777
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,100
Hold on.

778
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,580
Hold on.

779
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,540
I'll straighten you out.

780
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,719
So, how do I look?

781
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,679
Fine. Good.

782
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,580
Okay.

783
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,860
Go.

784
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,700
Your hand.

785
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,300
Dad.

786
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,660
Who's there?

787
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,660
Hello, Mr. Tang.

788
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,580
(I want to tell you a little secret.)

789
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,820
(Tang Yu.)

790
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,660
(When I first saw you,)

791
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,540
(I thought you looked like my husband.)

792
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,740
(Before this,)

793
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,660
(I thought Tang Yu
was like a moon in the sky.)

794
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,660
(I had to look up to him.)

795
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,100
(But now,)

796
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,780
(he's finally mine.)
