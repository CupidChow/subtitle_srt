I can do it well.

30
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,180
You're confident, Mr. Tang.

31
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,740
On your birthday,

32
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,540
I kept you downstairs for so long.

33
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,900
Tang Dingding said

34
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,980
that I didn't confess to you,

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,220
didn't hold your hand,

36
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,580
didn't give you a head pat,

37
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,860
and didn't give you a Kabe-Don.

38
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,380
She said you had been waiting for me
for a long time.

39
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,540
Don't listen to her nonsense.

40
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,380
I was just waiting for you to confess.

41
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,660
I wasn't waiting for anything else.

42
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,180
If I had known you're this clingy
when you date,

43
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,780
I wouldn't have gotten involved.

44
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,500
So?

45
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,660
You regret it?

46
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,380
Can I?

47
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,700
It's not up to you.

48
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,540
Mr. Lu, you're still awake?

49
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,879
Yes.

50
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,540
- See you tomorrow, Mr. Lu.
- See you tomorrow.

51
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,780
Mr. Lu.

52
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,919
Limited conditions.

53
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,999
There's only the hotel's tea.

54
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,879
Try it.

55
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,780
Thank you.

56
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,700
Mr. Lu.

57
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,519
Why did you come for Mr. Tang so late?

58
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,700
Did something happen?

59
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,700
Nothing major.

60
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,300
The crew has a day off tomorrow.

61
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,780
I just wanted to inform you.

62
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,340
I know.

63
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:04,839
I replied

64
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,460
in the group chat that I saw it.

65
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,780
Is that so?

66
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,180
I probably

67
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,439
have too many messages.

68
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,260
I didn't see it.

69
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,399
Alright.

70
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,860
There's nothing else.

71
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,980
I'll leave now.

72
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,620
Thank you for your concern.

73
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,860
I'm fine.

74
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,420
Who asked you?

75
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,300
It's fine.

76
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,799
As a director,

77
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,860
it's normal to care about your producer.

78
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,820
After all, I'm your investor now.

79
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,420
That's true.

80
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,420
We're about to start shooting.

81
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,140
If something suddenly happens to you,

82
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,180
I'll be quite passive here.

83
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,260
Your producer is doing fine.

84
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,279
You can come visit

85
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,639
until he's paralyzed.

86
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,380
Alright, you two.

87
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,020
You two men are really strange.

88
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,980
When he had an accident this afternoon,
you were as anxious as I was.

89
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,759
You had to make it thrilling

90
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,580
to realize each other's importance.

91
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,060
Who was worried?

92
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,460
Who was anxious?

93
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,420
Yeah.

94
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,420
I wonder who was worried and anxious.

95
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,420
Alright, I think he's fine.

96
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,300
I'm leaving.

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,180
Mr. Lu, take care.

98
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,940
It's the producer
who decides the break, right?

99
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,540
Is Mr. Lu afraid that you'll be angry

100
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,580
because he decided the break?

101
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,500
Lu shouldn't be.

102
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,999
It's considerate of him

103
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,340
to come see me.

104
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,199
Even if he didn't announce a break,

105
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,780
I still need to give everyone a day off.

106
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,919
Liu Yang just came out
of the emergency room.

107
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,660
I need to let him recover.

108
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,580
You and Mr. Lu really think alike.

109
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,380
It's a little secret between men.

110
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,180
Since we have a day off tomorrow,

111
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,820
how about going out for a stroll?

112
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,780

00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,159
this is Tang Xin's first film.

188
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,420
It's important.

189
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,759
But no matter what,

190
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,820
always remember

191
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,639
to not

192
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,879
pressure yourself too much.

193
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,439
Okay.

194
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,540
I understand, Dad.

195
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,999
Mr. and Mrs. Tang.

196
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,759
Huo.

197
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,780
Why are you here?

198
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,820
I came to drive you to the airport.

199
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,519
Okay.

200
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,180
I'll feel at ease with Huo driving you.

201
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:37,879
Alright.

202
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,060
I'm leaving, Mom.

203
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,999
I'm leaving, Dad.

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,140
Have a safe trip.

205
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:41,759
Bye.

206
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,879
Be sure to call us often.

207
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,879
Alright, I know.

208
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,639
Bye.

209
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,820
Bye, Mr. and Mrs. Tang.

210
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,420
Are you nervous?

211
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,340
Not at all.

212
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,940
I'm a little excited.

213
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,079
Relax.

214
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,140
Just try your best.

215
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,060
Not just trying my best.

216
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,660
This is Tang Xin's first time
as the main movie scriptwriter.

217
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,940
It's also Mr. Lu's comeback film

218
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,180
and the movie my brother pledged for.

219
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,639
I must work hard

220
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,740
and achieve perfection.

221
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,740

(Celebrated today in Xiacheng,
the highly anticipated film "A Dream for You",)

229
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,680
(Netizen: Great! Good luck for shooting!)
(based on a trending IP,)

230
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,079
(directed by famous director Lu Zhixing,
and produced by Time Pictures,)

231
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,840
- (commenced its grand opening ceremony,)
- Today, is a windy day.

232
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,679
(capturing widespread attention.)

233
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,620
Thank you all for being here
and witnessing the start of a dream.

234
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:43,199
Firstly, I'm deeply honored to participate
in such a romantic and special project

235
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,079
as a director.

236
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,639
Can't you just smile?

237
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,119
Those unaware

238
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,759
might think
you don't want to be with me.

239
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,879
I'm also very honored

240
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,740
to have met a group
of like-minded partners.

241
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,940
Is this okay?

242
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,039
Let go.

243
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,700
It's adapted from the renowned author
Sugar Heart's novel of the same name,

244
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,260
which has received widespread acclaim
in literary circles.

245
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,079
Of notable mention is

246
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,279
the process of adapting the novel
into a screenplay

247
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,199
was personally helmed
by the original author,

248
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,479
Sugar Heart.

249
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,700
Thank you, Sugar Heart.

250
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,439
We aim to retell and redefine
this romantic and heartwarming love story

251
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,700
(through the lens of cinema.)

252
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,540
(We aim to fulfill expectations.)

253
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,359
Thank you all.

254
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,360
("A Dream for You" Starts in Xiacheng.)

255
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,620
I'm not receiving much love
as a newcomer.

256
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,940
My brother and sister-in-law
are more popular than me.

257
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,380
The cameras won't even turn my way.

258
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,319
What?

259
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,380
Are you also seeking fame
through scandal?

260
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,900
It's normal for a new face like you
to have lower popularity now.

261
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,340
Things will get better in the future.

262
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,700
I'm just saying.

263
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,999
I don't want any scandals, either.

264
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,460
It's embarrassing to get caught.

265
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,599
Well, just because you don't want
to be photographed

266
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,999
doesn't mean you won't be.

267
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,260
It'll be better. Just take it slow.

268
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,119
I know it.

269
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,719
If I ever date someone,

270
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,919
I'll surely draw the curtains
and close the car windows tightly,

271
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,940
so our project won't face any trouble.

272
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,199
Focus on your acting for now.

273
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,740
Don't worry about anything else.

274
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,100
Let's go.

275
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,900
Dingding.

276
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,719
Tang Xin.

277
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,759
What are you doing here?
I've been looking for you everywhere.

278
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,320
I'm just getting familiar
with this in advance.

279
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,780
I'm afraid I'll get nervous later.

280
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,820
Don't worry. Relax.

281
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,479
Where's my brother?

282
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,039
He had a meeting
and went back to the office.

283
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,180
He'll be back later.

284
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,959
He's coming back?

285
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,079
I'm afraid I'll be more nervous
when he watches me act later.

286
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,239
What should I do?

287
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,599
Don't overthink it.

288
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,900
Just relax.

289
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,420
Okay, relax.

290
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,580
By the way,

291
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,399
I heard that Huo Chendong

292
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,940
escorted you here for filming.

293
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,199
So,

294
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,999
did seeing him again
bring back the overwhelming feeling

295
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,740
you used to have?

296
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,519
It's gone, actually.

297
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,780
I think

298
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,940
I've let it go.

299
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,079
We did grow up together,

300
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,580
and I've liked him for so long.

301
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,780
After letting it go,

302
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,260
there's just a tiny bit of awkwardness,

303
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,980
but it's okay, really.

304
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,839
If I have feelings for someone else

305
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,839
or

306
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,599
if I have a boyfriend,

307
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,780
it should be fine then.

308
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,239
Her makeup's done.
She's changing outfits now.

309
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,060
Good.

310
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,719
Mr. Lu is here.

311
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,820
Good luck.

312
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,060
Mr. Lu.

313
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,079
How's it going, Dingding?

314
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,700
Are you ready
for the first day of shooting?

315
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,140
I've prepared in advance.

316
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,980
You seem nervous.

317
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,679
Alright.

318
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,900
Let's run through the first scene.

319
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,740
Okay.

320
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,260
Is there any line
that makes you uncomfortable?

321
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,900
Doesn't seem like it.

322
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,279
It's fine.

323
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,100
If any line makes you uncomfortable,
just let us know.

324
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,100
Sometimes, it's okay as long
as your meaning and logic are clear.

325
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,100
However, there are some key phrases
you should mention.

326
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,860
Why he hasn't arrived yet?

327
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:11,820
Maybe soon.

328
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,239
- Call and check.
- Mr. Lu, shall we go over the lines first?

329
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,620
(Rich Lady: Mr. Lu is coaching Dingding.)

330
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,780
(Tang Yu: It's her first time on set.
You should give her more guidance)

331
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,300
(regarding social etiquette.)

332
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,900
(Rich Lady: Why don't you do it yourself?)

333
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,980
(Tang Yu: I'm her brother.
You're her sister-in-law.)

334
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,380
(It's better for you to tell her.)

335
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,740
(Rich Lady: Fine.)

336
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,540
Let's get ready.

337
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,660
Camera rolling.

338
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,460
Three, two, one. Action.

339
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,780
The world is beautiful.

340
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,199
Cut.

341
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,559
Let's do it again.

342
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,679
We were coordinating.

343
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,980
Coordinating means
following the script's sequence.

344
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,620
Don't block him.

345
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,340
Ready.

346
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,380
Camera rolling.

347
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,220
Three, two, one. Action.

348
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,020
The world is beautiful.

349
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,980
Cut.

350
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,879
Dingding.

351
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,359
You're blocking the camera.

352
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,119
Find your spot.

353
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,439
You're blocking me.

354
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,300
Sorry.

355
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,740
Continue.

356
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,999
Let's do another take.

357
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,220
(Relax.)

358
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,220
The world is beautiful.

359
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,100
Cut.

360
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,100
What should we do?

361
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,100
How about I go talk to them?

362
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,999
It's okay.

363
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,940
Let me handle it.

364
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,679
I'll go with you.

365
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,679
I'm worried about Dingding.

366
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,500
Alright.

367
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:02,860
It's done.

368
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,500
Congratulations, Mr. Tang,

369
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,839
on securing another great project.

370
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,180
That was a close call.

371
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,119
I thought they were
about to reach an agreement

372
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,599
and didn't expect Mr. Tang

373
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,180
to step in and change everything.

374
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,759
Now that the company's issue
is resolved,

375
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,660
everyone can focus on their projects.

376
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,799
Securing its copyright

377
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,980
is like having an insurance policy.

378
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,479
I'll fully focus

379
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,239
on "A Dream for You".

380
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,279
It's crucial
for the company's genre expansion.

381
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,020
You can talk to Mr. Huo
about other matters.

382
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,420
Is the car here?

383
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,620
Yes, it's arrived.

384
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,159
I'll head back to the set.

385
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,319
Take care of things here.

386
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,100
Okay, let's go.

387
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,799
Ready.

388
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,260
Three, two, one. Action.

389
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,319
Cut.

390
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,540
Let's do another take.

391
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,260
Three, two, one. Action.

392
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,539
Three, two, one.

393
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,920
(Scene 5, Shot 2, Take 36)
Action.

394
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,820
Cut. You missed your cue.

395
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,860
Cut.

396
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,340
Cut.

397
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,260
What's wrong, Dingding?

398
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,980
Three, two, one. Action.

399
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,919
Don't cry.

400
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,700
It'll ruin the makeup.

401
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,780
It's okay.

402
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,879
It's been ten minutes

403
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,740
since I arrived.

404
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,260
Tang Dingding.

405
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,340
Don't you owe me an explanation?

406
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,420
You had taken numerous acting classes
before filming started.

407
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,839
Your foundation

408
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,380
should be solid.

409
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,860
Do you remember what you said to me?

410
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,799
"Yu. You just have to attend meetings"

411
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,340
"and sign contracts."

412
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,780
But what happened?

413
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,079
Do you know what I just heard

414
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,900
in a call after landing?

415
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,759
Tang Yu.

416
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,700
Hold on.

417
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,199
I know

418
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,780
it was your first day of shooting,

419
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,420
and you needed time to adjust,

420
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,860
but how was it?

421
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,959
Can't you

422
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,079
handle the basic requirement

423
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,199
of not being nervous

424
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,300
while facing the camera?

425
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,780
A simple coordination.

426
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,580
A simple line.

427
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,199
You've repeated doing these 48 times.

428
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,020
The director's been adjusting for you,

429
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,420
and the camera's been changing angles,

430
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:58,940
yet what did you do?

431
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,340
You still couldn't do it.

432
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,119
The entire crew
involving hundreds of staffs

433
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,020
spent the whole day accommodating you.

434
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,180
Tang Dingding,
don't you have an explanation for this?

435
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,719
Did you say I'm her sister-in-law

436
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,940
and you'd hand her over to me?

437
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,380
I'll deal with this matter.

438
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,620
Hand her over to you?

439
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,380
You'll only indulge her.

440
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,319
Did you say so?

441
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,080
It was her first day of shooting.

442
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,759
Were you born with the skill
to oversee everything

443
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,420
on your first day as a producer?

444
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,500
Who doesn't work their way up gradually?

445
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,380
Moreover, she's your sister.

446
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,199
Can't you talk things through

447
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,220
without being so harsh?

448
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,180
Tang Xin, you should be very clear

449
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,140
that it's all about the issue,
not personal.

450
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,100
Since Dingding decided to pursue acting,

451
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,639
I have

452
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,580
to use the most professional standards
on her.

453
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,660
Indeed,

454
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,559
I couldn't oversee everything

455
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,900
on my first day as a producer,

456
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,719
but I held myself

457
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,940
to the highest standards.

458
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,060
That's also the Tangs' principle.

459
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,340
Now, Dingding can act in my films

460
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,639
with your protection

461
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,820
and my understanding.

462
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,999
What about the future?

463
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,799
Will she only act in our films
for the rest of her life?

464
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,839
I'm not protecting her.

465
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,100
I'm encouraging her.

466
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,239
Dingding is still a newcomer.

467
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,679
She needs more chances.

468
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,300
Wasn't 48 times enough?

469
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,500
I...

470
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,940
Do you have to argue with me?

471
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,180
My brother is upset.

472
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,940
That's not the case. Don't overthink it.

473
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,140
I'm sorry.

474
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,479
It's all my fault.

475
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,660
Is this the first time
he's been angry with you?

476
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,940
If he likes to sulk, let him be.

477
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,740
Alright.

478
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,580
Miss.

479
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,839
Mr. Lu asked us to come over

480
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,540
to rehearse with the cast.

481
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,679
Go ahead.

482
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,660
I got it.

483
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,340
I'll go rehearse now.

484
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,500
Don't go head-to-head with Yu.

485
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,719
Okay.

486
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,740
I understand.

487
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,580
You have to work hard too.

488
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,079
You should cherish the chance and help

489
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,359
that Mr. Lu is giving you.

490
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,820
Don't let Yu look down on you.

491
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,660
Be good.

492
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,180
Don't cry.

493
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,020
Calm down.

494
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,140
Quick, go rehearse.

495
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,639
Okay.

496
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,460
Go now.

497
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,900
Cheer up.

498
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,820
Alright.

499
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,540
Did you bring the script?

500
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,999
It's with my assistant.

501
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,220
Go quickly.

502
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,420
If I always

503
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,140
use those petty tricks

504
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,860
to keep you here

505
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,900
without caring about how you feel,

506
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,940
what's the difference between me

507
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,020
and the female extras?

508
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,420
Cut. That's good.

509
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,900
Dingding, you did well.

510
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,279
Let's change the scene.

511
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,020
Next scene.

512
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,500
Her state is much better than before.

513
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,300
Let's use the last take.

514
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,060
Mr. Lu.

515
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,100
Was the last take

516
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,340
good?

517
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,060
It's pretty good.

518
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,500
You're much better than yesterday.

519
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,780
Keep it up.

520
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,660
Really?

521
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,300
Let's rehearse the next scene.

522
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,100
Miss Tang.

523
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,180
What are you busy with?

524
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,900
Nothing much.

525
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,959
I was just watching your last take.

526
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,860
It was good.

527
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,180
It moved me to tears.

528
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,359
Honestly, I think

529
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,180
our performance in that scene

530
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,460
was really good too.

531
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,100
Yes.

532
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,460
Do you need anything from me?

533
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,199
I'm not confident

534
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,759
about the next scene.

535
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,359
The emotional changes are too complex.

536
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,340
Could you please rehearse with me?

537
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,820
Sure.

538
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,559
Let's go over there.

539
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:10,999
Sure.

540
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,980
Okay. Let's go.

541
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,660
If I can't fight against fate,

542
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,460
and Jiang Yi is destined
to be the female lead,

543
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,980
will she end up with Qin Jian?

544
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,780
Does that mean all my past efforts
were in vain?

545
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,140
Hold on.

546
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,919
I think your emotions

547
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,140
are running too high here.

548
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,079
Actually, his emotions here

549
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,220
are quite complicated.

550
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,239
On one hand,

551
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,820
he wants Jiang Yi to be happy.

552
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,839
On the other hand,

553
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,100
he can't let go of his feelings for her.

554
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,399
How about

555
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,340
trying a different way of acting?

556
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,140
Does that mean all my past efforts

557
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,220
were in vain?

558
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,719
This is relatively better.

559
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,159
Really?

560
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,439
Yes.

561
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,279
But I just thought of another way

562
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,399
to act it out.

563
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,559
How about I try it and show you?

564
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,039
Okay.

565
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,060
Feel it.

566
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:24,919
Did you all see it?

567
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,940
Place cameras as we rehearsed.

568
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,519
Dingding.

569
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,519
Maintain your emotion.

570
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,540
Very good.

571
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,519
Didn't you firmly say before

572
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,399
that no one on your team

573
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,119
should get together romantically

574
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,860
and be all lovey-dovey?

575
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,740
Our project is about to start.

576
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,959
There's something

577
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,660
I must emphasize to everyone.

578
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,340
In my team,

579
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,540
no dating is allowed among members.

580
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,340
Don't let me catch anyone
being lovey-dovey.

581
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,340
Or else, I won't be lenient with you.

582
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,660
Nevertheless,

583
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,580
if anything happens,

584
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,340
I can only manage my directing team.

585
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,740
The rest of you,

586
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,700
behave yourselves.

587
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,399
There are signs now.

588
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,260
Don't you stop them?

589
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,380
What signs?

590
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,660
Look at the way they are acting.

591
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,660
I told you before.

592
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,999
In situations like this,

593
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,220
even if I take charge,

594
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,239
I can only manage a few people

595
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,660
in my directing team.

596
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,420
If you really can't stand it,

597
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,780
deal with it yourself.

598
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,700
(Mr. Lu.)

599
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,119
(Mr. Lu, can we start now?)

600
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,959
Yes.

601
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,980
You may start.

602
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,660
If you didn't plan
to take control from the start,

603
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,580
don't pretend to set any rules.

604
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,079
This...

605
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,020
Excuse me.

606
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,180
Zhou, Mr. Lu wants
to discuss the scene with you.

607
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,999
It's okay. Go ahead.

608
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,220
Don't delay the filming.

609
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,759
Go ahead.

610
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,399
Sure.

611
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,860
Let's have dinner another day.

612
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,519
Okay.

613
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,119
Thanks.

614
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,759
Sure.

615
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,660
Let's go.

616
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,620
Let's go.

617
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,820
What's the talk about?

618
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,759
The script.

619
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,860
The script?

620
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,999
What are you doing?

621
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,300
Let me discuss with you too.

622
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,580
Why should I
discuss the script with you?

623
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,460
He can hold your hand three times
while discussing the script

624
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:00,820
and make dinner plans.

625
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,100
Let me join the talk too.

626
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,980
Tang Yu.

627
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,879
Can you stop making a fuss?

628
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,580
You even get jealous about Peng Zhou.

629
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,140
I'm making a fuss?

630
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,839
Yes, I don't like him.

631
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,860
I like being jealous.

632
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,980
Alright.

633
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,740
I'm sorry.

634
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,260
I shouldn't have

635
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,780
treated Dingding that way.

636
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,020
I shouldn't be mad at both of you.

637
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,799
Can you not be so strict with Dingding,

638
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,340
like an overly strict father?

639
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,599
She's new in the industry.

640
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,980
She's progressing quickly.

641
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,759
You saw her performance today.

642
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,340
She did well.

643
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,500
Indeed, her performance today was good.

644
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,479
It seems like I have a lot

645
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,580
to learn from Miss Tang.

646
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,420
Good that you know.

647
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,900
I got it.

648
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,300
Thank you.

649
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,020
What's wrong?

650
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:10,780
Did something
happen to Dingding on the set?

651
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,980
Not Dingding.

652
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,940
It's your good son.

653
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,780
Tang Yu?

654
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,740
What's up with our son again?

655
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,860
Nothing much. He's doing great.

656
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,660
This time, he did great.

657
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,980
Very good.

658
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,780
I have nothing much lately.

659
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,260
I'm going to the set to stroll around.

660
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,700
I'll go with you.

661
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,260
Why bother?

662
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,319
Stay at home.

663
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,540
I'll notify you
if anything good happens.

664
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,340
I don't want you to notify me.

665
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,500
I'll go myself.

666
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,420
Honey!

667
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,540
Honey.

668
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,999
Don't be mad.

669
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:43,959
Let's

670
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,060
go together.

671
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,100
Here, take a sip.

672
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,039
Let's go.

673
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,380
Come with me to welcome them.

674
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,180
- I...
- Be a bit softer.

675
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,180
I...

676
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,700
- Mr. Lu.
- Mr. Tang.

677
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,759
Mr. Tang, hello.

678
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,580
Lu.

679
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,039
Lu.

680
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,300
Long time no see.

681
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:00,799
Hi, Mrs. Tang.

682
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,820
Hello.

683
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,279
Mr. Lu.

684
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,359
Filming must be tough.

685
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,380
We

686
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,900
bought some food and drinks

687
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,580
to treat everyone.

688
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,100
Thank you so much.

689
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,980
Share it around.

690
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,759
Coffee from Mr. Tang.

691
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,879
You remember Lu, right?

692
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,959
He had dinner at our place.

693
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:19,719
I remember.

694
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,999
Back in college,

695
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,100
he made a short film with Tang Yu.

696
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,260
At that time,

697
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:24,919
I thought this guy

698
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,519
was exceptionally talented.

699
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,540
Look at him.

700
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,860
He's a big director now.

701
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,159
Mr. Tang, thank you so much.

702
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,159
Thanks to Time Pictures

703
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,420
for this opportunity.

704
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,500
Mr. Lu.

705
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,039
Has Dingding caused you any trouble?

706
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,439
Mrs. Tang. Not at all.

707
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,780
Dingding is an excellent,

708
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,199
hardworking and dedicated actress.

709
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,020
Everyone in the crew likes her.

710
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,399
- That's good.
- But she doesn't

711
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,199
have scenes today.

712
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,239
She is resting at the hotel.

713
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,140
Tang Yu's handling company matters
at the hotel as well.

714
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,879
Mr. and Mrs. Tang.

715
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,999
Let me introduce.

716
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:07,639
This is...

717
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,700
No need to introduce.

718
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,260
I know her.

719
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,559
Hello, Mr. Tang.

720
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,239
Hello, Mrs. Tang.

721
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,460
I'm Tang Xin.

722
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:15,919
Hello.

723
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,780
Hello.

724
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,580
No need to be so formal.

725
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,020
We're a family.

726
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,340
Right.

727
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,460
Tang Xin also has the Tang surname.

728
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,079
Yes.

729
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,679
We're all part

730
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,460
of the Tangs.

731
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,740
Exactly.

732
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,340
Mr. Tang. Mrs. Tang.

733
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,999
How about you go sit over there?

734
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,420
We're in the middle of filming.

735
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,039
No need.

736
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,199
We won't disturb your work.

737
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,079
We'll stroll around on our own later.

738
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:53,940
Yes.

739
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,599
Everyone, get back to work.

740
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,500
Right.

741
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,060
Tang Xin.

742
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,780
I have

743
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,620
prepared some desserts.

744
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,839
When you finish your work,

745
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,159
come to my place for dessert.

746
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,180
Okay?

747
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,239
Filming is tiring.

748
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:10,799
Liu Yang.

749
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,559
Mr. Lu.

750
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,479
So, you need to take care of yourself.

751
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,959
Look at how thin you are.

752
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,839
You should eat a bit more.

753
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,900
Show the Tangs around.

754
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,180
Thank you, Mrs. Tang.

755
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,300
Alright.

756
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,500
Let's go.

757
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,439
Keep up the good work.

758
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,839
Go and have a good look around.

759
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,039
- We'll be leaving now.
- Goodbye.

760
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,820
Goodbye.

761
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,260
Dingding is...

762
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,660
What's the meaning of this?

763
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,580
The parents have arrived.

764
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,900
This should be interesting.

765
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:44,860
Mom.

766
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,620
Stop staring at me.

767
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,759
You've been doing so for many years.

768
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,580
I know what you're thinking.

769
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,159
With things as such,

770
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,300
you should own up.

771
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,580
I have nothing to own up to.

772
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,839
This is my personal matter,

773
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,540
and I find it difficult
to share with you.

774
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,860
When you were young,

775
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,660
you were always
eager to share everything with me.

776
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,660
I had to listen, or you wouldn't stop.

777
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,119
I quite miss

778
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,180
the young child back then.

779
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,340
Mom, I'm already 30 years old

780
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,820
and no longer the young child

781
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,140
you keep mentioning.

782
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,180
You should
stop thinking of me as a young girl.

783
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,660
I'm not Dingding,

784
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,279
nor am I, as you put it,

785
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,740
the rotten vegetable
left in the farmer's market.

786
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,420
Mom.

787
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,100
Don't worry.

788
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,260
I have my own thoughts.

789
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,079
The magazine's editor-in-chief
called me...

790
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,020
Dingding.

791
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,780
You're busy filming
and have no time to go out,

792
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,799
so I

793
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,860
bought you some food and necessities.

794
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,639
Take a look
and see if I missed anything.

795
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,700
Later, I'll head out

796
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,559
and buy them for you.

797
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,359
I don't lack anything.

798
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,759
Aren't you guys here to question Yu?

799
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,340
Please spare me.

800
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,399
Dingding.

801
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,599
I bought you some sunscreen.

802
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,439
Remember to spray some

803
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,660
when you head outside.

804
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,460
Dingding.

805
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,799
Do you find it hard
to memorize your script?

806
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,599
Why don't I

807
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,500
head out to buy you some wild walnuts?

808
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,799
Alright, Dad.
You don't have to go anywhere.

809
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,719
I'm already in my twenties

810
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,900
and a grownup.

811
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,020
You should still improve your memory

812
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,780
lest your mom keeps calling you a dummy.

813
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,759
How am I a dummy?

814
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,639
I'm the dummy.

815
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,820
I misspoke.

816
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,220
I also bought you
your favorite marshmallows.

817
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,820
There's also this

818
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,519
and this.

819
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,500
Dad, I'm an artiste now.
I need to lose weight.

820
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,500
Tang Yu.

821
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,839
How are things

822
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,300
going on at the film set?

823
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:46,959
Dad.

824
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,220
You haven't cared
about the film set's affairs for years.

825
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,060
Mom isn't here anyway.

826
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,180
Let me ask you.

827
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,300
How are things

828
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,460
with you and Tang?

829
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,140
We're great.

830
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,999
I just feel

831
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,679
that we should wait

832
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,580
until our relationship grows even closer

833
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,020
before telling you guys.

834
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,140
Listen.

835
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,540
We've met her.

836
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,980
She's very well-mannered,

837
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,660
and we like her a lot.

838
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,180
You'd better work harder

839
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,820
and treat her well.

840
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,679
Try your best

841
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,380
to win her over as soon as possible.

842
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,540
Sure.

843
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,700
Really?

844
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,879
Yu and Tang Xin are finally together?

845
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,479
That's great.

846
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,700
Lower your voice
and don't get so excited.

847
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:29,919
Mom.

848
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,260
Is your source reliable?

849
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,860
I knew it.

850
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,820
Those two have always
seemed suspicious to me.

851
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,500
The last time Yu and Tang Xin argued,

852
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,399
Tang Xin admitted...

853
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,340
Wait.

854
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,140
Yu got into an argument with Tang Xin?

855
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,639
He finally found a girlfriend
at 30 years old

856
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,300
but then argued with her?

857
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,500
Has he gone mad?

858
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,100
Why were they arguing?

859
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,900
It was because of me.

860
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,300
Oh, you.

861
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,599
You're a grownup,

862
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,780
but why do you still act like a child?

863
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:05,799
I was nervous.

864
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,039
You should be helping them grow closer

865
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,599
and get married soon.

866
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:12,079
How could you lead them into arguing?

867
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,599
I didn't want them to argue, either.

868
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,599
You're such a dummy.

869
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,359
Why do you keep calling me that?

870
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,780
Stop talking.

871
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,100
I need to relax my brain.

872
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,140
Say,

873
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,900
this is my first meeting
with his parents,

874
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,380
so should I
leave them a good impression?

875
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,159
Talk to me

876
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,479
and stop working.

877
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,679
I'm asking you a question.

878
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,660
What is it?

879
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,620
Go on.

880
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,940
Since...

881
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,999
Since this
is my first time meeting them,

882
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,300
should I be more gentler,

883
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,279
more confident,

884
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,900
or more reserved?

885
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,559
At this stage,

886
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,260
you don't know why they came,

887
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,559
so I suggest you keep your distance

888
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,940
and observe them.

889
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,900
Got it.

890
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,279
Since this is Miss You Huan's advice,

891
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,860
I will implement it seriously.

892
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,660
Come on.

893
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,620
Good luck.

894
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,580
If they argued about Dingding's matter,

895
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,660
it meant their feelings
for each other weren't strong enough.

896
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,279
Say,

897
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,140
why don't we do something

898
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,580
to make their relationship

899
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,100
stable

900
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,900
or even stabler?

901
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,020
I'm talking to you.

902
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,839
Your son and his girlfriend had a fight,

903
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,420
but you
aren't the slightest bit worried?

904
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:05,780
Forget it.

905
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,020
You're no help at all.

906
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,660
I'll handle it myself.

907
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,199
But

908
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,620
I think you're right.

909
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,279
His parents might not be here to see me.

910
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,759
We just got together, after all,

911
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,140
and they might not know it yet.

912
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,020
Am I right?

913
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,620
Who's here so late at night?

914
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,460
Could it be Mr. Tang?

915
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,420
I should leave, then.

916
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:32,959
It's not him.

917
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,580
He has reports to finish tonight.

918
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,460
I'll open the door.

919
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,140
Who is it?

920
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:40,940
It's me.

921
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,980
Why does this voice sound familiar?

922
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,140
Mrs. Tang.

923
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,199
Tang Xin

924
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,140
Hello

925
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,980
Hello.

926
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,420
I brought you some yogurt.

927
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,079
Have one every day.

928
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,260
It's good for you.

929
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:03,959
Okay.

930
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:04,910
Thank you, Mrs. Tang.

931
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,679
You have a friend here.

932
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,660
Hello, Mrs. Tang.

933
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,860
Hello.

934
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,900
Am I interrupting something?

935
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,900
No.

936
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,460
I'm just here to chat with Tang Xin.

937
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,140
You can continue.

938
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,380
I'll wait a bit.

939
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,479
It's nothing, actually...

940
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,780
You guys go ahead.

941
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,660
Didn't you say
to keep distance and observe?

942
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,119
It's a different situation now.

943
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,879
Since she's here,

944
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,980
don't act so formal.

945
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,639
Mrs. Tang.

946
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,479
We're done,

947
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,660
so I'll be leaving now.

948
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,100
Let's have a chat together.

949
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:43,559
It's fine.

950
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,039
I can't.

951
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,140
I have other matters.

952
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,319
Join us.

953
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,300
No.

954
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,500
Good night, Mrs. Tang.

955
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,300
Good night.

956
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,559
Mrs. Tang, I'll see her off.

957
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,380
Sure.

958
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,519
Wait. It's just me now.

959
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,260
Believe in yourself. You can do it.

960
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,079
No, I can't.

961
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,380
- I can't.
- I'm leaving.

962
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,060
Mrs. Tang.

963
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,839
Did you come to find me so late at night

964
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,140
because you need something?

965
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:13,860
Sit down and talk.

966
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,620
I'm just...

967
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,060
You have no idea how Tang Yu's dad

968
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,380
snores.

969
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,420
He snores so loudly

970
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:30,940
that it gives me a headache,

971
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,900
so I thought I
would come and chat with you.

972
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,980
Chat?

973
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,959
Mrs. Tang.

974
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,999
How about this?

975
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,159
If you can't sleep at all,

976
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,060
I'll get them to get you another room.

977
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:43,999
That...

978
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,279
That wouldn't be appropriate.

979
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,199
If others found out his dad and I

980
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,500
came to visit the film set

981
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,839
but slept apart,

982
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,959
they would think
we were in a bad relationship.

983
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,319
Wouldn't that be embarrassing?

984
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,500
Don't you agree?

985
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:56,260
That's true.

986
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,020
I didn't think it through.

987
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,660
No.

988
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:00,900
That's not what I meant.

989
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,519
Then, shall we go to Dingding's room?

990
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,319
Her room is bigger.

991
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,540
Dingding's room?

992
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:08,660
I've been there already,

993
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,420
and she seems to have fallen asleep.

994
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,679
I don't want to sleep with her, either,

995
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,999
because she also snores

996
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,839
and is quite loud,

997
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,380
just like her dad.

998
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,820
Dingding snores?

999
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,900
But don't worry.

1000
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,580
Tang Yu

1001
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,780
doesn't snore.

1002
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,980
He sleeps quietly, like me.

1003
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:39,479
Mrs. Tang, you must be thirsty.

1004
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,020
I'll get you some water.

1005
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,380
I'm not thirsty,

1006
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:45,340
and I'm not tired, either.

1007
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,620
I just want to have a chat with you.

1008
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,140
You aren't tired either, right?

1009
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,660
I know you aren't,

1010
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,140
am I right?

1011
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:55,999
Yes, you are.

1012
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,639
I'm not tired.

1013
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,119
Look, I'm very energized.

1014
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,940
Then let's have a good talk.

1015
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,940
Sure.

1016
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,140
Great!

1017
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:10,999
Is he attentive toward you?

1018
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,060
Is he thoughtful?

1019
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,620
Tang Yu

1020
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,380
is quite a gentleman.

1021
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,380
That's good.

1022
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:23,180
I've always
taught him to be a gentleman.

1023
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,500
Have you seen his childhood photos?

1024
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,559
No.

1025
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:28,500
You haven't?

1026
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,500
Let me tell you.

1027
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,420
When he was a child...

1028
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,599
I'll show you.

1029
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,420
- This is how he used to look.
- Let me see.

1030
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:42,799
He looks different now.

1031
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:43,820
His gaze...

1032
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,599
- Do you have more?
- Look at this.

1033
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,279
This one.

1034
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:46,980
Look.

1035
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,780
Do you see what he's wearing?

1036
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,140
A floral dress for girls.

1037
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,340
Do you know why?

1038
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:54,639
And there's this one too.

1039
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,799
It's quite cute, actually.

1040
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:57,300
Yes. He's so cute.

1041
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,780
He wet his pants.

1042
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,879
Mrs. Tang.

1043
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,439
Send this picture to me.

1044
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,799
- Quick.
- Send it to you?

1045
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,900
Sure.

1046
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,660
I'll send it to you now.

1047
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,460
Mr. Tang.

1048
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,460
Have some coffee.

1049
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,460
Thank you.

1050
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,660
Why do you look so tired?

1051
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,980
Didn't sleep well last night?

1052
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,020
Last night,

1053
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,479
I looked at over a thousand pictures

1054
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,420
of a half-naked young boy.

1055
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,140
I slept when it was almost dawn.

1056
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,119
I didn't know you had so much energy

1057
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,420
to look at pictures of children.

1058
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,460
Do you know?

1059
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,700
That boy always

1060
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,660
wet his bed in the middle of the night

1061
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,300
and ruined dozens of bed sheets
in half a year.

1062
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,540
That's quite a large amount.

1063
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,079
What's so funny?

1064
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,300
Why are you looking at me?

1065
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,300
Mr. Tang.

1066
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,140
Mr. Tang.

1067
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,660
I didn't expect

1068
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:07,340
you would still
wet your bed at four years old.
