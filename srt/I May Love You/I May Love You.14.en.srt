22
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,200
(I'm single,
so why can't I go on a blind date?)

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,660
(Tyrant's Diary)

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,839
(Sometimes, I wonder)

25
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,150
(if it's because I haven't glanced
at any other men)

26
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,210
(that I've been liking Tang Yu
for four years?)

27
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,130
(Why don't I give it a try?)

28
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,270
She seems...

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,110
to be going on a blind date.

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,310
A blind date?

31
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,350
I just heard about it.

32
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,399
Mr. Tang.

33
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,639
Mr. Tang, I...

34
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,790
What else?

35
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,830
Should we

36
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,550
go and stop her?

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,830
Of course.

38
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,510
Do I look dead to you?

39
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,439
Go and get changed.

40
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,590
Okay.

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,719
(Missed calls: Tang Yu)

42
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,590
(Tang Yu: You're going on a blind date?
Where are you?)

43
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,470
That lapdog, Gao Heng.

44
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,310
How could he rat me out so quickly?

45
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,439
Hello, Mr. Lu.

46
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,590
(Hey, Tang Xin.)

47
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,749
Are you free to come to the studio?

48
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:00,770
To discuss the script.

49
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,999
Now?

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,750
(Yes.)

51
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,679
Okay.

52
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,110
I'll see you later.

53
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,799
Sir, I need to change the destination.

54
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,230
Head to No. 3 Xinglin Street.

55
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,799
At noon today,

56
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,879
I sent our first draft script

57
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,039
to my teacher for review.

58
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,399
He promptly came out
with another version

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,239
with his opinions

60
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,239
and sent it back to us.

61
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,670
I've posted it in the group chat.

62
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,950
Take a good look.

63
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,239
Got it.

64
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,230
What's the rush?

65
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,519
I was called over

66
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,439
before finishing my meal.

67
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,359
We need to be efficient.

68
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,470
- Let's go.
- Right.

69
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,950
I was thinking of meeting up tomorrow.

70
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,999
But our investor cum producer,

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,559
Mr. Tang, was more eager

72
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,679
than us after hearing the news

73
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,239
and asked us to discuss it tonight.

74
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,159
So, let us

75
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,430
start with the annotations.

76
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,430
That evil capitalist.

77
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,630
Mr. Tang.

78
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,239
I'm really sorry

79
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:51,559
for calling this last-minute meeting

80
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,950
and taking up your time.

81
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,710
How is the discussion going?

82
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,279
We just started

83
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,510
to review the annotations.

84
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,559
That's great.

85
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,670
I'll listen in.

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,070
Mr. Gao.

87
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,399
You're such a lapdog.

88
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,070
What can you get from snitching on me?

89
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,919
My salary

90
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,119
is from Mr. Tang,

91
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,910
so I have to prioritize his benefits.

92
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,719
Mr. Lu.

93
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,630
Thank you.

94
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,710
Thank you.

95
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,350
Mr. Tang.

96
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,399
It'd be better
if you skip this discussion.

97
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,319
In this situation,

98
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,430
it's not suitable
for the investor to give opinions.

99
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,310
What do you two think?

100
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,519
Fine.

101
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,359
Let's go back first.

102
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,150
Okay.

103
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,910
I won't disturb you creators
from doing your magic.

104
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,190
You've worked hard.

105
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,590
Have a good meeting.

106
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,279
Your drink

107
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,350
is warm.

108
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,870
Didn't we agree
to review the annotations?

109
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,910
Let's begin.

110
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,030
Sure.

111
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,879
Tang.

112
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,839
Make the modifications.

113
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,079
I'll discuss it with Mr. Lu

114
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,390
about getting it approved.

115
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:30,999
Okay.

116
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,119
Then, I'll leave first.

117
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,879
Take your time.

118
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,199
Alright.

119
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,599
Goodbye.

120
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,439
Take care on the way. Bye.

121
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,310
Goodbye.

122
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:43,070
Tang Xin.

123
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,550
You are Tang Xin, right?

124
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,350
Are you Lin Zhengxu?

125
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,390
Yes.

126
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,359
I've already bought flowers.

127
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,550
It would be a waste
if I don't give them to you.

128
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,350
Thank you.

129
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,039
I didn't text you

130
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,519
because I didn't want to disturb you.

131
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,239
I didn't expect

132
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,639
Mrs. Tang to send me

133
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,870
your studio's address.

134
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,750
This does look like a place
where artists work.

135
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,559
I'm sorry

136
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,910
for standing you up.

137
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,110
There are many forms of dates, you know.

138
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,239
Watching a movie is a date.

139
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,630
Having a meal together is a date.

140
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,679
Even sending you home

141
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,950
is also a date.

142
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,239
Let's go.

143
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,510
I'll send you home.

144
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,550
Okay, thank you.

145
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,230
What are you doing?

146
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,510
The flowers look pretty.

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,990
Who sent them?

148
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,550
Didn't you miss your blind date?

149
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,630
It'd be a waste
to not meet a handsome guy.

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,879
So,

151
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,990
I had him come to the studio
to pick me up after work.

152
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,270
Who is more handsome, me or him?

153
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,350
You dummy.

154
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,670
Tang Xin, I'm pursuing you.

155
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,270
You're pursuing me,

156
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,830
but I also have the right to choose.

157
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,919
Besides,

158
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,710
you're not the only one pursuing me.

159
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,070
Don't go on blind dates.

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,710
Didn't you mess it up for me today?

161
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,030
I rescheduled.

162
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,470
What if I don't let you go?

163
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,430
On what grounds?

164
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,110
Mr. Tang.

165
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,359
First, you asked me
to help you pursue Mingzhu.

166
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,479
Then, you rejected my confession.

167
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,510
Now...

168
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,510
I don't want to talk to you.

169
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,150
Does letting you go on a blind date

170
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,870
make things even?

171
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,950
You have to let me

172
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,430
go on 108 blind dates
before things are even.

173
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,839
Give Xin a call

174
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,670
and ask her when she's coming home.

175
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,599
Quick, go back.

176
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,559
My parents are back.

177
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:24,959
What?

178
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,150
Go home. My parents are back.

179
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,190
Tang Xin.

180
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,159
Dad, Mom.

181
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,350
Why are you home so early?

182
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,630
I was waiting for you guys.

183
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,839
These bags are too heavy.

184
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,559
I'll help you.

185
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,039
Let's go

186
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,479
and see what I bought for you.

187
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,430
Let's go.

188
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,710
Okay, Dingding. Get ready.

189
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,159
Remember, the sense of weight
you acted out last time was very good.

190
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,519
Alright.

191
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,279
Everyone, remember. You're all on a bus,

192
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,750
so sway your bodies.

193
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,910
Okay. Action.

194
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,639
We're about to arrive at Rainbow Bridge.

195
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,039
Passengers who need to get off,

196
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,399
please prepare for arrival.

197
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,279
Come on.

198
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,310
Quick.

199
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,830
Excuse me.

200
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,030
How rude.

201
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,990
Dingding, that was great.
Much better than before.

202
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,239
- Thank you.
- Great job,

203
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,519
especially with the heavy bag.

204
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,159
Awesome.

205
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,039
Dingding, why don't you take a rest?

206
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,519
- Sure.
- Alright, next student.

207
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,510
Head on up.

208
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,999
Are you sure Mr. Lu
will be coming today?

209
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,159
It seems like it.

210
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,759
I heard that he's extremely strict.

211
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,759
The female actress

212
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,430
in this behind-the-scene footage
was scolded to tears for bad acting.

213
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,039
I heard that the actress
was later replaced.

214
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,070
Really?

215
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,310
What a pity.

216
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,070
Alright, everyone, let's pause for now.

217
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,310
Mr. Lu is here
to check on you all today.

218
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,359
Mr. Lu.

219
00:09:59,360 --> 00:09:59,879
This way.

220
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,710
Okay.

221
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,159
How about this?

222
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,079
Let's show Mr. Lu the skit
about the country girl

223
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,110
coming to work in the city

224
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,519
that we've been rehearsing lately.

225
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:08,959
Alright?

226
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,279
Sure.

227
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,670
Get ready.

228
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,630
Tang Dingding.

229
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,830
You first.

230
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,350
Me?

231
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,630
Didn't you do well before?

232
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,110
Go ahead. It's okay.

233
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,959
Mr. Lu.

234
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,759
The time frame for this scene is set

235
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,759
in the 1980s to 1990s.

236
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,639
Showing a country girl

237
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,790
heading into the city for work.

238
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,639
Dingding.

239
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,070
Let's go without any props, okay?

240
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,830
Sure.

241
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,030
Ready. Begin.

242
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,119
We're about to arrive at Rainbow Bridge.

243
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,519
Passengers who need to get off,

244
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,310
please prepare for arrival.

245
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,999
Excuse me. I'm Getting off.

246
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,150
This is my stop.

247
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,350
Excuse me.

248
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,150
Sit.

249
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,550
Okay. Stop.

250
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,159
Tang Dingding, what's on your mind?

251
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,230
Why didn't you follow your cue just now?

252
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,799
And about that bag,

253
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,470
there was no sense of weight at all.

254
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,759
Your rehearsals
are usually better than this.

255
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,159
Alright. Come down the stage.

256
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,470
I'm sorry, ma'am.

257
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,399
Bing Ge.

258
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,470
You're up.

259
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,070
I need to take a call.

260
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,550
Ma'am, I would like
to go to the bathroom.

261
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,879
Okay. I understand.

262
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,750
Sure.

263
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,470
Mr. Lu.

264
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,230
Why did you leave so soon?

265
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,279
Is it

266
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,919
because my performance was too bad

267
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,710
and you couldn't stand it?

268
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,190
Are you disappointed?

269
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,550
Dingding.

270
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,030
You've misunderstood me.

271
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,550
I came out here

272
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,990
because I needed to take a call.

273
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,399
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu.

274
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,830
I was well-prepared just now,

275
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,750
but then I

276
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,719
heard a news

277
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,039
and got distracted,

278
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,759
so I...

279
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:27,670
Yes, you were distracted.

280
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,070
You were completely
out of character on stage

281
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,910
and weren't focused on acting.

282
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,710
Dingding.

283
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,359
Being an actor

284
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,990
is a very cruel profession.

285
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,590
You have to face all sorts
of unexpected situations

286
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,270
no matter in reality

287
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,550
or while acting.

288
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,079
But all these

289
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,710
are not excuses for you to slip up.

290
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,950
You have to believe in my judgment.

291
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,310
I chose you to be my female protagonist

292
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,910
because I believe you can handle it.

293
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,190
Believe in yourself

294
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,470
because I believe in you.

295
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,830
However, if you don't work harder

296
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,150
and improve your professionalism,

297
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,470
you might get replaced.

298
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,630
Is it that serious?

299
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,510
Yes, it is.

300
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,430
I'm not looking for an average actor.

301
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,230
I want the best.

302
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,630
Got it?

303
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,150
Good.

304
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,710
Dingding.

305
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,639
The acting class isn't over yet.

306
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,710
Aren't you going back?

307
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,710
Right away.

308
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,030
Mr. Lu, I'll work hard!

309
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,030
Mr. Tang.

310
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,719
The revision of the script
is almost done.

311
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,230
It's ready for company's meeting.

312
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,159
I have a few potential director candidates.
I'll send their information to you.

313
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,199
Let the producer review it, too.

314
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,230
Understood.

315
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,950
By the way,

316
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,870
how's the filing for "A Dream for You"?

317
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,599
It's been submitted.

318
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,030
It should be approved in two days.

319
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,190
Good.

320
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,759
The Screenwriting Department

321
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,199
sent new movie proposals just now.

322
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,199
Organize and send them to me.

323
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,550
I'll respond tomorrow.

324
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,630
Understood.

325
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,350
Mr. Tang, one more thing.

326
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:19,990
Say it.

327
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,670
Miss Tang has an official meeting

328
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,030
with Lin Zhengxu today.

329
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,670
Get the car ready.

330
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,510
Understood.

331
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,710
How do we find someone
in such a big place?

332
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,910
Did you find her?

333
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,150
Nope.

334
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,270
She probably doesn't like this.

335
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,830
She prefers spicy food.

336
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,190
That way. Go.

337
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,679
Hello.

338
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,039
There's no seat left.

339
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,839
If you'd like one,

340
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,079
you can join the waiting list.

341
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,870
Sure.

342
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,239
You can rest here.

343
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,799
We'll inform you once a seat opens up.

344
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,510
Okay.

345
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,439
Mr. Tang.

346
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,190
Sit.

347
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,550
Table 13.

348
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,390
They seem quite happy.

349
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,559
It's still early.

350
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,079
How about a movie?

351
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,590
There's a cinema upstairs.

352
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,350
Sure,

353
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,990
but I'll foot the bill this time.

354
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,110
As you wish.

355
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,630
Let's go.

356
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,710
Go.

357
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,759
I haven't seen a movie for a while.

358
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,639
This way.

359
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,190
Thank you for coming.

360
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,510
What genre do you like?

361
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,830
Anything's fine.

362
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,559
Let's check out what's playing later.

363
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,310
Okay.

364
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,210
(Box office)

365
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,510
Mr. Tang.

366
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,390
What Tang Xin did
is hurtful this time, right?

367
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,310
What should we do?

368
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,870
Don't move.

369
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,359
Don't move.

370
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,750
She's looking at us.

371
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,510
What should we do?

372
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,470
Go to the mall.

373
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,150
Get masks and sunglasses.

374
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,950
Maybe a wig.

375
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,950
Why do you want all these?

376
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,559
Do you want us to swagger in together

377
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,519
and work overtime here?

378
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,510
Work...

379
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,110
Remember, I'm not your superior anymore.

380
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,590
Got it.

381
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,670
Go.

382
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,230
Go.

383
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,439
Mr. Tang. I got the mask and sunglasses.

384
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,079
But the custom wig needs

385
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,039
your head measurements.

386
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,879
How many times have I told you

387
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,870
to do things flawlessly?

388
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,990
Let's go.

389
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,639
But your disguise isn't flawless.

390
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,790
It's quite obvious.

391
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,990
Where are yours?

392
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,190
Mine?

393
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,670
You're a walking accessory.

394
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,550
Whoever you're with is Mr. Tang.

395
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,470
Thank goodness.

396
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,870
I bought one, too.

397
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,910
Flawless execution.

398
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,030
You might get your bonus this month.

399
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,150
Let's go.

400
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,790
Hello, sir. This way, please.

401
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,039
Hello, sir. What can I do for you?

402
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,719
Hi.

403
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,519
I wanted to ask

404
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,990
if a guy and a lady were here.

405
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:02,999
The guy had glasses

406
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,399
and the lady had her hair in a bun.

407
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,790
Which movie did they choose?

408
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,559
Sir, that's our guests' privacy.

409
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,950
We can't disclose that.

410
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,430
Professional.

411
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:13,839
I still want

412
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,470
to know their movie choice.

413
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,710
Sir, please don't make it hard for me.

414
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,319
You see, we rarely

415
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,630
watch movies ourselves.

416
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,439
We overheard them talking

417
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,519
about a good movie

418
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,670
and decided to watch it, too.

419
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,599
I see.

420
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,559
However, they didn't buy tickets here.

421
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,390
They likely got them via the app.

422
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,110
They came earlier to buy popcorn.

423
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,630
Hold on.

424
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,599
One bucket or two?

425
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,279
They said the film was about to start,

426
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,310
so they got the last available bucket.

427
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,079
Two "Daybreak" tickets for 8:20 PM.

428
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,839
Thank you.

429
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,830
Please wait.

430
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,830
They bought one bucket of popcorn.

431
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,150
Why didn't they buy more?

432
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,470
And you still want the bonus?

433
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,230
Here are your two tickets.

434
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,950
Prepare more popcorn.

435
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,919
Hello, Mr. Ma.

436
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,310
I saw Mr. Tang.

437
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,310
They should be undercover.

438
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,599
Step up the pace,

439
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,879
but not too conspicuous.

440
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,959
Mr. Tang's sudden arrival

441
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,319
caught us off guard.

442
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,199
Don't look around.

443
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,119
Mr. Tang should be nearby.

444
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,030
Let's go.

445
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,399
Sorry.

446
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,599
Something came up.

447
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,590
I might need to make a call.

448
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,230
Can we switch to another show?

449
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,990
Which show, then?

450
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,710
Any show works. You choose.

451
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,919
Okay.

452
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,399
Okay.

453
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,670
I'lll make my call now.

454
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,630
Go.

455
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,999
Allow me.

456
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,150
Mr. Tang.

457
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,950
Sit here.

458
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,990
(Hello.)

459
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,550
What are you doing?

460
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,710
What do you mean?

461
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,550
(I know you're here right now.)

462
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,110
(What exactly do you want?)

463
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,239
I wanted to see if your date

464
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,710
is better looking than me.

465
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,190
Are you crazy?

466
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,830
Can you cure it if I am?

467
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,310
Did you get the tickets?

468
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,270
Got them.

469
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,399
Let's go.

470
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,279
Sure.

471
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,150
Okay.

472
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,430
Ticket inspection.

473
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:54,750
Here.

474
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,110
Go.

475
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,510
Mr. Tang.

476
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,239
Is it a magic act or what?

477
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,919
They suddenly disappeared.

478
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,860
What else can they do?

479
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,030
They must have chose another show.

480
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,190
Let's go.

481
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,439
Mr. Tang.

482
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,470
Mr. Tang.

483
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,870
Mr. Tang.

484
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,150
It's me.

485
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,310
Ma.

486
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:51,990
Mr. Tang.

487
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,239
Why didn't you inform me
of your arrival?

488
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,510
I could've picked you up.

489
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,790
Ma.

490
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,360
Everything's good.

491
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,199
By the way,

492
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,999
we're about to have our monthly meeting.

493
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,119
I wonder if it'd be an honor

494
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,750
for you to join us.

495
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,390
Monthly meeting.

496
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,270
Sure.

497
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,630
Let's not delay their movie.

498
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:09,959
Good.

499
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,479
Go ahead.

500
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,190
Go.

501
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,230
This way, please.

502
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,430
We'll continue searching
after the meeting.

503
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,110
Will we even make it?

504
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,519
Sorry, Mr. Gao.

505
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,119
The tickets for that show were sold out.

506
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,239
It's nearly ending.

507
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,470
How about checking the later ones?

508
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,270
Okay.

509
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,319
Mr. Tang.

510
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,270
There's no ticket left
for the earlier show.

511
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,990
It's past ten for the ones later.

512
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,950
How about...

513
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,550
Sorry.

514
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,239
We got side seats

515
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,510
due to the show switch.

516
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,310
It's no big deal.

517
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,270
Seat choice doesn't matter.

518
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,679
Besides,

519
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,719
sitting in the middle

520
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,550
won't allows you to catch extra eggs.

521
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,030
The movie today was good,

522
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,510
though a tad dull.

523
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,030
Let's watch something relaxing
next time.

524
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,550
You like popcorn movies?

525
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,270
Aren't you a screenwriter?

526
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,799
Writing scripts all day long

527
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,599
is already draining enough.

528
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,479
It must be even more tiring

529
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,390
to watch these thought-provoking films.

530
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,910
Watching some popcorn movies

531
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,430
can help you relax.

532
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,110
You make a lot of sense.

533
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,150
(Did you fall in love
after a few blind dates?)

534
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,110
(I knew it. What comes quickly
can also leave quickly.)

535
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,350
(Tyrant, must I use force)

536
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,270
(to make you change your mind?)

537
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,759
Tang Yu, what are you doing?

538
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,799
♪In the mystery of countless nights♪

539
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,359
♪Thoughts of you grow and sprawl♪

540
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,399

548
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,910
Tang Xin.

549
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,910
What's been going on these days?

550
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,870
One moment you're ignoring me,

551
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,430
but you go on blind dates the next.

552
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,599
I want you to tell me the truth.

553
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,510
Is there a thorn in your heart?

554
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,670
What is the thorn in your heart?

555
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,950
Is it because I didn't agree
to be your producer?

556
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,230
Or because I didn't read your book?

557
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,030
Or because I asked you

558
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,310
to help me pursue someone else

559
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,030
and rejected your confession?

560
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,150
You're really good
at touching sore spots.

561
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,230
So, it's because all of those.

562
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,270
Tang Yu.

563
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,070
This kiss evens things out.

564
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,470
If you do this again,

565
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,950
I'll beat you up like you're a hooligan.

566
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,190
Sure, beat me.

567
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,870
Beat me up.

568
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,670
If this makes you feel better,

569
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,110
hit me again.

570
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,350
What are you doing?

571
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,430
Can't bear to hit me?

572
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,550
Alright then.

573
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,870
Bite me instead.

574
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,390
As long as it relieves your anger.

575
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,190
You're quite ruthless.

576
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,270
Does this make you feel better now?

They're all useless dirty thoughts.

You're here.

601
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,119
Perfect timing to thank you
for writing the copy for me.

602
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,440
I've got something delicious for you.

603
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:34,999
Dig in.

604
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,039
Thanks, Miss You.

605
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,430
Your favorite Japanese food.

606
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,310
Oh, right.

607
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,350
How's it going with your blind date?

608
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,150
It's alright.

609
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,790
What about Tang Yu?

610
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,350
Do you remember
Dingding's ten-point law?

611
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,550
Of course.

612
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,910
Tang Yu kissed me the other day.

613
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,270
What do you mean?

614
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,679
Wait.

615
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,479
How did he kiss you?

616
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,159
Hang on.

617
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,550
Was it naturally happened for love,
or was it a surprise attack?

618
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,039
It's the second one.

619
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,070
Second one.

620
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,839
No way.

621
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,870
Tang Yu doesn't seem like
that type of man.

622
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,919
Going back

623
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,350
to the ten-point law,

624
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,759
how many points he gets now?

625
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,719
Seven.

626
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,230
That's pretty high.

627
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,590
Seems okay.

628
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,559
But I feel like something's missing.

629
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,710
What's missing?

630
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,110
I don't know.
That's why I came to ask you.

631
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,630
How would I know?

632
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,750
You chicken.

633
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:40,879
If you ask me,

634
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,559
you might as well go all out.

635
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,159
Then you'll know what's what.

636
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,150
I...

637
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,430
I wouldn't dare do it again.

638
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,670
I...

639
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,270
I'm just

640
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,030
unwilling

641
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,350
to treat him too well.

642
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,870
But if he's not doing well,

643
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,230
I feel sad.

644
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,319
I know what you are missing.

645
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,319
What is it?

646
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,439
You feel

647
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,910
he doesn't love you enough.

648
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,479
After we leave,

649
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,399
you must continue to interact with Lin.

650
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,719
And report to me in a timely manner.

651
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,750
Got it?

652
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,399
Did you hear me?

653
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,950
Okay, I got it.

654
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,510
I'm telling you.

655
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,630
You must call me.

656
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:31,639
Okay.

657
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,519
At least once a day.

658
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,279
Okay.

659
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,470
- We're leaving.
- Twice.

660
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,559
Okay.

661
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,790
Bye. Go back in.

662
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,750
Bye.

663
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,319
It's good.

664
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,110
Here.

665
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,870
What's wrong?

666
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,030
Mr. Tang.

667
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,670
Does this wound need treatment?

668
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,470
Do you need a rabies vaccine?

669
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,950
It's fine. It's almost healed.

670
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:02,750
I'm okay.

671
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,879
Mr. Tang, you should still bandage it.

672
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,079
We have a morning meeting later.

673
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,470
It's not good if people see it.

674
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,910
Let's go. Time for the meeting.

675
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:16,359
The renewal of the previous batch
of expired IPs

676
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,399
is completed.

677
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,719
The Screenwriting Department submitted

678
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,999
two IP proposals last week.

679
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,719
We've evaluated them on our end

680
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,719
and emailed

681
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,390
the evaluation reports to you.

682
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:25,759
I've reviewed them.

683
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,990
They are all good.

684
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,879
If you're really interested,
go talk to them.

685
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,470
Good IPs wait for no one.

686
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,439
While negotiating about the copyright,

687
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,519
Ms. Chen,

688
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,510
we need to keep up
with content development.

689
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,119
We're working on it.

690
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,959
Also,

691
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,319
that realism original film project

692
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,439
is already in progress.

693
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,790
The outline is expected
to completed this month.

694
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,270
Good.

695
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,599
Original projects
are very important to us.

696
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,679
We need to take them seriously.

697
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,519
Now, the audience

698
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,910
has a high demand for original stories.

699
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,479
To the entire company,

700
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,990
a good original story

701
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,479
is more valuable

702
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,790
than 10 IP adaptations.

703
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,239
By the way, Mr. Tang,
the attendance of "Light of Tomorrow"

704
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,359
has been high the past two weeks.

705
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,670
The play date has been extended.

706
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,039
This is a supplementary contract

707
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,350
that requires your signature.

708
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,190
Okay.

709
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,070
Any other issues from other departments?

710
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,900
(Group chat: I didn't see it wrong
during the meeting, right?)

711
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,439
(Are those teeth marks
on Mr. Tang's hand?)

712
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,999
(You saw it right. They're teeth marks.)

713
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,119
(It's even deeper
than the mark my daughter bit.)

714
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,870
(Those marks don't seem
to have come from a child.)

715
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,439
(Must be from his girlfriend.)

716
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,310
(Does Mr. Tang have a girlfriend?)

717
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,590
(I don't think he does.)

718
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,630
Mr. Gao.

719
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,550
Make a copy of this.

720
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,590
Okay.

721
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,830
This is what I think.

722
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,439
Some of the supporting characters

723
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,559
in the script

724
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,359
can be more interesting.

725
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,790
Although they don't show up much,

726
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,750
they can still shine.

727
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,470
Yes.

728
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,719
They actually already have

729
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,510
a unique personality in the show.

730
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,159
But I just feel them too one-dimensional

731
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,510
and stereotypical.

732
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,759
Why don't we create a character
like Mr. Tang?

733
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,239
Right?

734
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,710
He's got an attitude.

735
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,599
Speak of the devil.

736
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,159
Mr. Tang.

737
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,230
Morning.

738
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,230
You've worked hard.

739
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,799
Mr. Tang.

740
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,350
Should I just set up a table for you?

741
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,190
Your daily flower delivery

742
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,350
is more punctual
than those clocking in for work.

743
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,999
I have no objections.

744
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,830
Go ahead.

745
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,559
I used to think

746
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,959
the CEO of Time Pictures

747
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,310
was a domineering boss.

748
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,550
I didn't expect him to be like a peacock.

749
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,039
Do you know

750
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,719
the meme online
of a man who keeps flaunting its tail?

751
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,750
Let me show you.

752
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,190
This one.

753
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,439
Send it to me.

754
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,310
Okay.

755
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,870
Mr. Tang.

756
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,590
We're having a meeting now.

757
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,079
It's okay.

758
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,079
I won't disturb you all.

759
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,350
You guys proceed.

760
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,239
Fine.

761
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,710
Let's start the meeting.

762
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,479
Today,

763
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,670
let's focus on the stories
of the three supporting characters.

764
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,270
Mo.

765
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,190
Jiang Bai.

766
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,230
Wang Yu.

767
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,390
This is what I think.

768
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,079
Lu.

769
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,399
You know this.
We've been writing shows for so long

770
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,790
and use our friends as references.

771
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,079
It's just because of that,

772
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,879
almost all of our friends
have been referred to.

773
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,350
There's no one left.

774
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,799
So

775
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,790
it's on you

776
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,790
this time.

777
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,830
Tang Xin.

778
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,359
Come on, Tang.

779
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,870
Please give us a character.

780
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,510
It's sad to be your friend.

781
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,959
But I've referred to my friends

782
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,190
when I was writing novels.
There's no inspiration left.

783
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,070
Let's do this.

784
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,590
I'll give you a demonstration.

785
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:38,999
Jiayi.

786
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,070
Help me write this down.

787
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,350
Tang Dingding.

788
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,830
She's a new friend.

789
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,470
She's innocent,

790
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,790
lovely,

791
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,190
timid,

792
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,510
and talkative.

793
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,710
(Tang Dingding)

794
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,590
Alright.

795
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,070
Here.

796
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,790
Talkative and timid.

797
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,150
(Talkative)
Firstly,

798
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,790
innocent and lovely

799
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,450
are also the characteristics
of the female lead.

800
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,070
So we'll take these two traits

801
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,390
out.

802
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,959
Being timid and talkative

803
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,199
can fit into Mo's family background.

804
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,959
Then we'll expand from there. Understand?

805
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,390
That's the idea.

806
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,590
You have someone in mind so quickly?

807
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,670
Don't tell me
you're writing about Mr. Tang.

808
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,670
Lin.

809
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,110
Zheng.

810
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,870
Xu.

811
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,750
Lin Zhengxu's a nice name.

812
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,910
Zheng signifies excellence.

813
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,190
Xu

814
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,439
for prosperity

815
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,870
and high-spirited.

816
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,190
Not bad.

817
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,639
(Tang Yu: Find out)

818
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,950
(who went on that blind date
with Tang Xin.)

819
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:16,990
Detailed.

820
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,390
(Gao Heng: Mr. Tang.)

821
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,070
(He's called Lin Zhengxu.)

822
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,870
Gentleman.

823
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:33,919
Humorous.

824
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,870
Humorous?

825
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,070
(Humorous)

826
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,750
Knowledgeable.

827
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,790
Your friend is quite outstanding.

828
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,310
He seems to possess all the qualities
of a good man.

829
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,559
The last one is interesting.

830
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,199
What is it?

831
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,270
Likes to watch popcorn movies.

832
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,279
I think this is quite interesting.

833
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,079
It adds a contrast
to the previous traits.

834
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,679
Right.

835
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,039
I think we can add that.

836
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,830
Yes.

837
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,319
What is it?

838
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,199
Mr. Tang.

839
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,999
You want to show us a character too?

840
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,150
Yes.

841
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,070
That's great.

842
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,439
(Wenwen)

843
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,390
Wenwen.

844
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,270
This is amazing.

845
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,710
ECV.

846
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,510
The Beaux-Arts de Paris.

847
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,390
Visual communication.

848
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,870
Gallery manager.

849
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,390
Reasonable.

850
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,070
Reasonable.

851
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,810
(Reasonable)

852
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,870
Easy to talk to.

853
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,190
This is very important.

854
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,590
(Doesn't bring up past issues)

855
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,390
Indeed.

856
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,630
Doesn't bring up past issues.

857
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,510
Lastly,

858
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,630
(Doesn't like drinking)

859
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,030
She doesn't like drinking.

860
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,990
She's a gem.

861
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,390
Perfect.

862
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,070
You sound very satisfied, Mr. Feng.

863
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,199
But I wonder

864
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,679
if Miss Tang thinks

865
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:46,350
this is acceptable?

866
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,230
Yes.

867
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,199
Gallery manager

868
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,510
is a good profession.

869
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,359
Reasonable and easy to talk to

870
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,999
means she is highly logical,

871
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,870
reserved, and powerful.

872
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,390
I like her.

873
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,430
You like her?

874
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,279
At a glance,

875
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,439
these characters

876
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,870
are more vivid now.

877
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,510
But, Mr. Lu,

878
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,030
we can't make Mr. Tang work for nothing.

879
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,799
She is still a character after all.

880
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,910
We should still pay the copyright fee.

881
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,870
I don't need it.

882
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,710
It's still coming
out of my pocket anyway.

883
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:24,839
Fine then.

884
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:27,550
Consider it as me personally
acquiring this character.

885
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,990
Didn't I just say I don't need it?

886
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:30,959
That won't do.

887
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,870
I can't take advantage of you, Mr. Tang.

888
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,310
Accept it.

889
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,870
I reject.

890
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,110
Did they have a fight?

891
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,430
How would I know?

892
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,750
I'm rejecting it again.

893
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,079
Hi, the delivery is here.

894
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:01,679
Let's eat.

895
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,239
Time to eat.

896
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:02,639
Jiayi.

897
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:02,999
Let's go.

898
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,190
Time to eat.

899
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,430
Rejected.

900
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,670
Lin Zhengxu.

901
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,150
Mr. Tang.

902
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,310
Do you like it?

903
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,110
I didn't know cactus can bloom.

904
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,710
Amazing.

905
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:04,830
By the way,

906
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,790
I've always wanted to ask you something.

907
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,670
Why do you like cactus so much?

908
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,359
You even

909
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,910
brought it back from the office.

910
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,990
I used to think

911
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,950
that cactus had strong vitality.

912
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,479
They'd grow well

913
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,910
without much care.

914
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,150
But I don't think so now.

915
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,150
To make it bloom,

916
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,910
I must care for it well.

917
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,070
But you...

918
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,350
But you've been caring for it
for so long, and it only bloomed once.

919
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,710
I guess I must stay closer to you

920
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,950
for it to bloom better.

921
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,030
What I mean is,

922
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,750
if I go on a business trip,

923
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,910
you can help me care for it
since you're nearby.

924
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,950
I'm going to help Dingding.

925
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,359
Mr. Tang. Miss Tang.

926
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,830
