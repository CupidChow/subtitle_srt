(Tang Yu, you're a quick learner
when you put your mind to it.)

25
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,840
(I'm worried I won't be able
to outsmart you in this game.)

26
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,450
What's wrong, Dingding?

27
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,220
Are you pursuing Tang Xin?

28
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,140
Who told you that?

29
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,660
No one.

30
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:01,620
I noticed it.

31
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,700
My brother finally
likes someone so much.

32
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,060
Are you going to compete with him?

33
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,620
I, too, finally like someone so much.

34
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,780
What should I do?

35
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,500
You.

36
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,620
Let me tell you.

37
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,180
My brother is unbeatable in this.

38
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,390
Alright, I'm not going to crowd you.

39
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,900
My feelings for Tang Xin

40
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,740
differ

41
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,500
from your brother's.

42
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,060
Um...

43
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:39,950
I can give you a ride
if it's okay with you.

44
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,780
Sure.

45
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,050
You saved me from taking a taxi.

46
00:02:59,300 --> 00:02:59,820
Don't move.

47
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,290
If not, how am I supposed to eat?

48
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,860
How about this?

49
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,260
By the way,

50
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,750
You Huan mentioned
you had got a lawyer for her.

51
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,460
The police have officially
taken up the case now.

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,820
Having a lawyer might come in handy

53
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,380
if it comes to prosecution.

54
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,180
Don't worry.

55
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,500
Ultimately, it's up to you

56
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,580
how to handle things.

57
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,500
In my opinion, I recommend pursuing
the lawsuit to the fullest extent.

58
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,300
Am I being too harsh?

59
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:42,860
No.

60
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,860
I thought you might advise against it,
as you did

61
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,360
with the plagiarism incident last time.

62
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,940
The situation is different.

63
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,380
Vandalism,

64
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,140
physical assault,

65
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:51,860
and plagiarism

66
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,660
violate industry rules

67
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,660
and even the law.

68
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,380
Who did these must be punished.

69
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,460
Who knows what they would

70
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,500
do in the future.

71
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,620
You're right.

72
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,540
Don't be angry.

73
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,500
Come on,

74
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:04,250
have another bite.

75
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,940
Making clothes is challenging, huh?

76
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,220
It requires much effort

77
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,220
in design, material selection,
and handwork.

78
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,620
Though it may be challenging,

79
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,500
it's a piece of cake

80
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,940
compared to malicious competition
in the market.

81
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,980
That's how the market is.

82
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,220
Once your unique ideas are copied,

83
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,620
all the hard work you've put in

84
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,860
loses its value.

85
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,180
Yeah.

86
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,820
You know,

87
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,740
inspiration will inevitably run dry

88
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,550
in any industry
that relies on creativity.

89
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,180
Right now,

90
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:40,660
I can stay ahead of the competition
by constantly creating new designs.

91
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,620
However, I may be left behind

92
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,300
when I'm unable
to come up with something new.

93
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,700
Have you ever considered

94
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,780
expanding your brand?

95
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,780
Niche designer brands

96
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,420
usually face such problems.

97
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,540
The core reason

98
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,940
is that you're not Hermès

99
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:57,940
or Chanel.

100
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,980
Otherwise,

101
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,260
people might refer to them

102
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:01,380
as "inspired by Chanel"

103
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,620
or "Hermès style"

104
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:03,750
even if your designs get copied.

105
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,740
Have you ever thought of creating

106
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,260
a "You Huan trend" or something?

107
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,380
Who wouldn't want that?

108
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:13,060
I might wake up laughing from the dream
if that day ever comes.

109
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,980
Yet, don't you need capital

110
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,700
and connections

111
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,180
for a small designer
to become successful?

112
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,340
Why?

113
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,040
Are you willing to invest in me?

114
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,540
Me?

115
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,620
You're giving me too much credit.

116
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,340
I don't have that kind of ability
to create a second Hermès.

117
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,140
But I do have some

118
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,610
when it comes to connections.

119
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,100
"White Dew" has been released

120
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,820
and got positive public review.

121
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,460
However, many viewers
feel that the scene

122
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,060
where Qin Shuangcheng
sacrifices himself is unrealistic.

123
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,420
Actually,

124
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,860
it depends on each viewer's

125
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,100
personal experiences.

126
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,500
We can't generalize it.

127
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,340
That's a fair point.

128
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,820
Ultimately,

129
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,580
I relied solely

130
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,020
on my understanding and imagination
when I wrote that scene.

131
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,460
I haven't experienced
such a situation personally.

132
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,420
Therefore, I can't confidently claim

133
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,420
that it portrays genuine emotions.

134
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,750
What are you laughing at?

135
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,580
Open up.

136
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,820
As a producer, I find it reassuring

137
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,380
that my screenwriter
is still reflecting on things

138
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,500
despite her being injured.

139
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,500
What's the use of self-reflection?

140
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,660
Improvement and rectification
are what matters.

141
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,540
So, are you suggesting

142
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,380
I reinvest and re-shoot the movie?

143
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,980
That's not necessary.

144
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:03,940
Well,

145
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,500
I'm still trying to write the scene

146
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,100
where Su Yu and Jiang Yi say goodbye

147
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,940
in the "A Dream for You".

148
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,180
The reviews of "White Dew"
has reminded me.

149
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,180
I should go through the experience

150
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,740
of parting ways with someone in person.

151
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,020
Experience of parting ways?

152
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,220
Don't rush it.

153
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:31,020
We can figure things out together
once you've healed.

154
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,760
(Outpatient Building)

155
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,340
Over here.

156
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,680
(Medical Checkup)

157
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,020
Three years ago,

158
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,420
I enrolled in palliative care training.

159
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,980
During that time, I got to know
quite a few cancer patients.

160
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,750
Ms. Xu's cancer
has metastasized to her bones

161
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,140
for half a year now.

162
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,900
Her condition hasn't been great lately.

163
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,700
The attending doctor mentioned

164
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,750
that she might have
over a month left at most.

165
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,740
Thank you.

166
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,220
I once said

167
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,420
I want to take a picture with you

168
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,780
as a keepsake.

169
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,940
It all comes down to me owing you.

170
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,220
I owe you even more.

171
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,260
I owe you a wedding photo

172
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,580
to save money when we got married.

173
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,780
It's okay.

174
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,700
It's okay.

175
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,260
Can Ms. Xu be discharged
with her current condition now?

176
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,900
I want...

177
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,260
It's better to stay in the hospital.

178
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,660
I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

179
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,460
Three, two, one.

180
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:21,940
We're done.

181
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,040
You look stunning in the photo.

182
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,420
Tang.

183
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,340
Can we take another photo?

184
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,020
Of course, no problem.

185
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,220
Thank you.

186
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,500
Please hold this.

187
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,620
Thank you.

188
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,260
This...

189
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,140
Chen.

190
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,580
I knew you were a good person

191
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,220
when I first saw you.

192
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,580
Thank you for taking care

193
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,100
of me in this life.

194
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,860
Thank you.

195
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,220
Thank you.

196
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,540
Thank you.

197
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,460
It seems like I no longer need to worry

198
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,260
about the parting scene in the script.

199
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,700
I used to believe

200
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,620
people would feel sad,

201
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:50,300
distressed,

202
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,340
or even heartbroken

203
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,340
when facing an inevitable parting.

204
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,620
How about now?

205
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,460
Has your perspective changed?

206
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,060
Now,

207
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,060
I perceive

208
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,700
separation as a storm.

209
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,620
The closer we get to the center,

210
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,260
the more tranquil it becomes,

211
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,660
and the more we cherish
the time we have left,

212
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,900
even just a minute.

213
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,260
People will do everything possible

214
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,980
to create beautiful memories
for their loved ones.

215
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,780
If we learn to cherish the time
before separation,

216
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,780
we won't be afraid of parting ways.

217
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,060
Tang Yu.

218
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,540
I think

219
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,100
I've gained some new insights about you.

220
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,380
Please share it.

221
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,080
I'm considering attending training

222
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,700
and volunteering with you in the future.

223
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,620
Deal.

224
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,740
Screenwriters may need

225
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,580
to modify mentioned points

226
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,020
based on shooting

227
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:06,820
and actors' situations.

228
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,980
However,

229
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,180
in general,

230
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,700
the script is considered finalized.

231
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,460
Thank you

232
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,340
for all the hard work.

233
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,820
We want to express our gratitude

234
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,220
to our two screenwriters.

235
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,140
Thank you.

236
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,100
I need to say something disheartening.

237
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,660
Don't get too excited too soon.

238
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,460
The project has yet to succeed.

239
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,040
Much work still needs to be done.

240
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,060
Let's keep energetic

241
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:26,940
and remain committed.

242
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,250
Let's get back to work.

243
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,380
So next, should we form a team

244
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:33,610
from the art department
for outdoor scouting or something?

245
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,260
According to our current plan,

246
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,140
it should be fine.

247
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,020
I'll leave it to you.

248
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,540
Okay.

249
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,900
Tang Xin.

250
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,080
Why don't you look happy
after the script is finalized?

251
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,940
No, I'm delighted.

252
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,100
This is a cause for celebration.

253
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:51,740
And then?

254
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,380
And then...

255
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,580
Stop the "and then".

256
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,940
Mr. Tang.

257
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,500
Tang has been working so hard

258
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,580
on this project during this period.

259
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,620
I have a premature suggestion.

260
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,220
Hmm.

261
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,940
Would it be possible
to plan a dinner to celebrate

262
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,940
and unwind a little?

263
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,620
Everyone has worked hard
during this time.

264
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,860
It's a joyous occasion
for Tang Xin to finalize the script.

265
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,060
Today's dinner is on me.

266
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,150
Let's take this opportunity
to relax and enjoy.

267
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,900
It's alright.

268
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,900
This is supposed to be my treat.

269
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,140
Let's invite Dingding

270
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,460
and Mr. Huo as well.

271
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,220
It's on me. Just choose a restaurant.

272
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,620
To celebrate the completion
of "A Dream for You" script.

273
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,220
Let's hope for a smooth movie shoot

274
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,890
and not disappoint anyone
who has put in effort.

275
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,460
Cheers.

276
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,100
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

277
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,060
I'm full.

278
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:41,740
Really?

279
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,060
Mr. Tang.

280
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,540
Miss Tang seems to be in a great mood.

281
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,180
Indeed.

282
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,580
Why do you care?

283
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,460
As your assistant,

284
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,660
it is my responsibility

285
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,540
to be attentive

286
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,900
to Miss Tang's emotional state.

287
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,340
Did you manage to win her heart yet?

288
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,300
Why is that your concern?

289
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,580
It's part of my job

290
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,060
to be mindful
of my boss's personal life, right?

291
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,460
To be honest,

292
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,460
I'm still trying.

293
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,980
You're pretty straightforward, huh?

294
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,100
Take it easy.

295
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,150
There's no need to hurry.

296
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,740
I'm done eating, I'm on a diet.

297
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,540
I don't mind taking my time
to pursue her.

298
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,220
Yeah.

299
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,900
You look slim now.

300
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,180
- I shall get you something to eat.
- No, thank you.

301
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,020
I've already consumed enough for today.

302
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,540
Dingding.

303
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,610
You've been putting much effort
into your diet lately.

304
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,510
I can see that your waistline
has slimmed down.

305
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,140
- Right?
- You've lost a lot of weight.

306
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,740
I feel that, too. I've been working hard

307
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,460
on my diet lately.

308
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,220
I can tell.

309
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,700
Honestly, both of you

310
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,220
are bad at acting.

311
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,340
Try this.

312
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,540
Have a bite.

313
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,460
It's not fattening.

314
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,260
Have a little more.

315
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,020
Let me show you

316
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,660
my new target.

317
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,420
What do you think?

318
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,940
Not bad, right?

319
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:38,980
Mr. Huo.

320
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,820
Is that the same girl

321
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,260
the paparazzi photographed last night?

322
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,700
Last night?

323
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,580
Last night...

324
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,260
No,

325
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,220
she had nothing to do with me.

326
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,220
The girl was drunk,
and I helped her out for a moment.

327
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,250
Then we were photographed.

328
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,900
Do you believe what he said?

329
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,820
However,

330
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,540
I met

331
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,820
another adorable girl.

332
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,980
Let me introduce her to you.

333
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,540
She

334
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,780
is exceptionally adorable.

335
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,660
You should not follow Mr. Tang
and stay single.

336
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,620
You need to get into a relationship.

337
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,380
What's wrong with being single?

338
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,340
And that is about to change.

339
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,900
"About to change", huh?

340
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,010
Then, you're still single.

341
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,180
Gao Heng.

342
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:24,700
Thank you, Mr. Huo.

343
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:28,620
Huo.

344
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,940
Lately, you and Dingding...

345
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,580
No.

346
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,940
Come on, I wouldn't dare.
Stop bringing up this topic.

347
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,260
Let's drink.

348
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,500
It's delicious.

349
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,660
- Alright.
- Yeah.

350
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:43,540
It's delicious.

351
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,500
Come on, smile at me.

352
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,220
Review the script.

353
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,740
Sure.

354
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,220
Later, guys.

355
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,300
Bye, I'll go first.

356
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,210
- Bye.
- Alright, bye.

357
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,100
Bye.

358
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,380
Gao Heng.

359
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,860
Send Mr. Huo back.

360
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,300
Yes, Mr. Tang.

361
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,180
We'll be going then.

362
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,340
Bye.

363
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,640
I'll send both of you home.

364
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,500
Let's drop Dingding back first
before we head home.

365
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,100
Okay?

366
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,420
It won't be a hassle.

367
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,680
Dingding has been acting strange
for a little while.

368
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,340
She insists on staying with me tonight

369
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:14,060
for a BFF night chat.

370
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,540
A BFF night chat?

371
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:25,580
Aren't you going to ask why I'm upset?

372
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,380
Miss Tang.

373
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,180
Why else?

374
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,140
Mr. Huo is dating again.

375
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,340
Your heart is broken again.

376
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,620
Shut up.

377
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,540
Why must you say it out loud?

378
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,020
Honestly,

379
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,940
you're unreasonable.

380
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,460
Tang Xin.

381
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,420
Say,

382
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,540
why can't the men of this world

383
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,420
all be like Yu?

384
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,220
Every woman would be like me.

385
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,260
Faithful and devoted.

386
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,580
Say,

387
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,020
even when you're heartbroken,
you're still bragging

388
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,380
about your family's genes.

389
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,540
Why won't you date Yu?

390
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,180
I see no flaws in him.

391
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,940
Do you know

392
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,980
why I keep rejecting him?

393
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,580
Back when I quit my job,

394
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,420
it was because
he had rejected my confession.

395
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,340
He said we were not a good match.

396
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,340
Do you know what that meant?

397
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,820
It meant he didn't like me.

398
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,500
I gave up all my dignity.

399
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,020
I made the first move and kissed him.

400
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,220
He didn't react at all.

401
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,620
If he had held me close then,

402
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,660
I might not have left.

403
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,660
Wait.

404
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,420
You kissed him.

405
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,060
Why did you kiss him
after being rejected?

406
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,380
Back then, I thought

407
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,180
that if I kissed him,

408
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,460
I'd have him.

409
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,940
I'd have no regrets.

410
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,340
Really?

411
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,420
Kissing him means getting him.

412
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:19,840
And the crush will be over?

413
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,340
Don't worry, Ms. Chen.

414
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,980
You'll never lose anything
when you work with Time.

415
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:33,900
Right?

416
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,300
I'll tell you a secret.

417
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,940
Mr. Tang specifically ordered us

418
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:39,020
to put aside marketing fees

419
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,100
for Chuning.

420
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,460
It'll be just as much as the leads.

421
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,380
Also,

422
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:43,940
Mr. Lu also thinks Chuning is good,

423
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,740
right?

424
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,620
He has said

425
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,650
that he wants Chuning
to be his female lead next time.

426
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,180
I have to go, Ms. Chen.

427
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,020
Talk to you later.

428
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,620
What is it?

429
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,780
Don't speak.

430
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,860
(Do it, Tang Dingding.)

431
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,460
(You're already here.)

432
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,260
(Don't be a coward.)

433
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,900
(It's just a kiss.)

434
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,540
(You were thinking about it all night.)

435
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,260
(Even acted it out several times.)

436
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,060
You're useless, Tang Dingding.

437
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:39,740
You're not like Tang Xin.

438
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,180
At the end, they were like this?

439
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,660
This close?

440
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,820
Maybe a little closer.

441
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,260
And they didn't kiss?

442
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,180
No, Miss Dingding

443
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,380
really didn't kiss him.

444
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,020
Maybe she

445
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,380
didn't want to kiss Mr. Huo anyway.

446
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,700
They were just very close.

447
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,900
Where is Tang Dingding?

448
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,220
She left.

449
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,380
Get me Huo Chendong.

450
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,460
Okay.

451
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:24,700
Come back.

452
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,420
Are you sure they didn't kiss?

453
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:33,780
Yes.

454
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,220
I've asked the others.

455
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,260
It's absolutely true.

456
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,500
Go.

457
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,100
Should I call for Mr. Huo still?

458
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,300
Contact Dingding's agent.

459
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,620
It's the press interview tomorrow.

460
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,260
Tell her to stay calm.

461
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:51,860
Okay.

462
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,020
Mr. Lu.

463
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,100
You're gorgeous.

464
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,260
Nervous?

465
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,900
How can I not be?

466
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,460
This is my first ever press interview.

467
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,460
Done. Mr. Lu, have a look.

468
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,460
Happy?

469
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,020
Yes.

470
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:44,420
Okay.

471
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,460
I'll get back to work.

472
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,340
Okay.

473
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
What's with you two?

474
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:10,940
We're about to start.

475
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,620
Why are you spacing out? Go on.

476
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,780
Go on. Go.

477
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,260
Okay.

478
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:15,680
Let me see.

479
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,780
(A Dream For You)

480
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:21,180
(A Dream For You)
Alright.

481
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,060
(A Dream For You)
Ladies and gentlemen,

482
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,460
(A Dream For You)
our stars are here.

483
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,180
Okay. You can go now.

484
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,540
Yu.

485
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,420
You look nice.

486
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,060
Where do I sit?

487
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,860
Over here.

488
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,420
Okay.

489
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,140
Dingding.

490
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,980
Your seat.

491
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,940
I finally get it.

492
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,220
As long as Tang Xin is around,

493
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,860
no matter how pretty I am,

494
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,540
I'm just a wallpaper to you.

495
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,060
Alright.

496
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,620
Our stars are all here.

497
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,540
We will now enter the Q&A segment.

498
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,620
What questions

499
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,780
do you have for our stars?

500
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,140
Miss Tang Dingding.

501
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,420
As a newcomer,

502
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,740
you actually landed a lead role

503
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,540
in such a big show
with a famous director.

504
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,780
Is it stressful?

505
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,780
Of course, I'll feel stressed.

506
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,780
I am just a newcomer.

507
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,500
I'm not an experienced actress.

508
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,180
I'm only half-baked in a lot of things.

509
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,540
Still, I will do my best.

510
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,540
Thank you.

511
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:19,620
From what we know,

512
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,060
many actresses

513
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,540
would grind for years

514
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,980
yet never get a chance like this

515
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,020
to join in a major project.

516
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,540
Do you think the casting choice

517
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,180
had anything to do with your status

518
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,500
as Mr. Tang's sister?

519
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,660
I...

520
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,260
Mr. Tang.

521
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,140
Can it be said

522
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,540
that this movie

523
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,060
was produced for Miss Tang Dingding

524
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:40,980
as her debut work?

525
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,550
After all, Time Pictures never produced
a film like this before.

526
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:44,980
Time's transition

527
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,660
has been in the plans for a while.

528
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,300
We first decided on the show

529
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,740
before casting Dingding.

530
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,180
I think any explanation I can give now

531
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,060
will be useless.

532
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,550
Just like everyone,

533
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,740
I'm eager to see

534
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,740
just how well Dingding can perform.

535
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,780
I have one last question
for Miss Tang Dingding.

536
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,060
What do you think

537
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,260
allowed you to be cast

538
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:09,180
over Zhou Jialu?

539
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,420
I...

540
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,380
I...

541
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,780
I...

542
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,500
I personally picked Tang Dingding

543
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,740
and invited her to be the female lead.

544
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,020
I trust that she
is the most suitable pick.

545
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,860
She is also my first pick.

546
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,700
Is that clear enough?

547
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,300
After the movie airs,

548
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,080
no matter what comments you have,

549
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,420
I'll accept them.

550
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,660
But now,

551
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,980
just because of her background,

552
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,500
you show your prejudice.

553
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,060
I think

554
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,940
it's not nice for a newbie.

555
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,540
Thank you.

556
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,740
Looks like a lot of us

557
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:00,940
have their eyes on this movie.

558
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:01,740
Speaking of which,

559
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,780
this movie not only uses
newbies for its characters.

560
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,660
For example, Miss Tang Xin,
our screenwriter,

561
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,380
is writing a script for a project this big
for the first time.

562
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,500
A Dream for You

563
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,020
is my debut novel

564
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,260
and my first work as screenwriter.

565
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:17,300
I thank Mr. Lu for his trust.

566
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,940
For giving me this great opportunity.

567
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,060
I also thank Mr. Feng Cheng.

568
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,700
During the script writing,

569
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,060
he helped me a lot.

570
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,060
That's why I'm confident.

571
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,060
I have the help of so many great people.

572
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,180
Mr. Tang.

573
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,900
The script is foundation for the movie.

574
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,380
Won't you be worried
if a newbie takes this?

575
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:35,980
I won't.

576
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,540
Time Pictures

577
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,740
value hard work and suitability
for the position.

578
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,780
We won't get worried

579
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,980
just because our partner's a newbie.

580
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,900
I see Mr. Tang is confident

581
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,060
in Time Pictures' production.

582
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,500
Of course.

583
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,780
But that's not all.

584
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,550
I am confident in our screenwriter,

585
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,500
director, and actors.

586
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,740
And for this project,

587
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,060
we'll be having a mysterious guest
to help us out.

588
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,300
Mr. Tang.

589
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,660
You just spoiled

590
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,780
our surprise segment.

591
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,380
And now, let us welcome

592
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,500
our mysterious guest.

593
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,500
Let us welcome award-winning actress,
Miss Lu Chuning.

594
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,300
Hello, everyone.

595
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,860
Rumors say that the company

596
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,580
is trying to make you the female lead
for two big projects.

597
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,540
Why did you make

598
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,380
a guest appearance in A Dream for You?

599
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,950
It's hard to be the female lead
all the time.

600
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,500
I want to take a break.

601
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,460
Actually,

602
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,540
the main reason lies with Mr. Tang.

603
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,180
He came to the set I was working in

604
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,100
and talked to me.

605
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,620
He even gave me a good,

606
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,740
convincing reason.

607
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,340
So, Mr. Tang,

608
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,940
can you tell us about the reason?

609
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,340
When our screenwriter, Miss Tang Xin,

610
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,820
first made this novel,

611
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,460
Chuning is how she envisions
her female lead to be.

612
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,580
That's why I hope

613
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,450
I can use this project

614
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:59,060
to fulfill her dream.

615
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,300
And because over these past few years,

616
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,820
my style has changed a lot.

617
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,140
Now when I look at this again,

618
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,220
I'm not suited to be the female lead.

619
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,060
But I like
the guest appearance character.

620
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,620
All characters are important.

621
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,620
I hope I can surprise you guys.

622
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,500
Alright.

623
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,050
We'll be looking forward to this movie.

624
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,420
Just a bit nervous.

625
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,220
Next time you see those simpletons,
smack them back.

626
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,220
Can you slow down?

627
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,080
The day you and Lu Chuning
were pictured,

628
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,040
you were talking about
her guest appearance, weren't you?

629
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,500
A ton of people want her to show up
in their films.

630
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,460
If I had waited until she was free,

631
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,780
she'd have no slots for this.

632
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,180
I had to do it myself.

633
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,900
How'd you know

634
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,380
she's the inspiration for my work?

635
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:55,780
I read your novel many times.

636
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,020
The female lead's traits

637
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,180
fit the life experiences

638
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,180
Chuning told the public.

639
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,940
Besides that,

640
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,820
she feels like

641
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,900
the old Lu Chuning.

642
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,860
She just feels like it.

643
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,300
That's why I sought her out

644
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,500
and talked to her.

645
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,580
So you

646
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,580
were jealous because of that.

647
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:19,900
I wasn't.

648
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:22,980
You were.

649
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,750
I share a friendly relationship
with Lu Chuning.

650
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,980
We go way back.

651
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,500
And when she first debuted,

652
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,740
she signed with Time Pictures.

653
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,020
But it's purely platonic between us.

654
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,620
You don't have to explain yourself.

655
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:33,860
I don't mind.

656
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,180
You don't mind?

657
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,620
Then what are you doing now?

658
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,330
Seems like you want an explanation.

659
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,260
I am not.

660
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,020
I want to thank you.

661
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,860
Thank you

662
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,250
for spending so much time and effort

663
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,980
to talk to Lu Chuning

664
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,020
just to grant me my dream.

665
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,660
Also,

666
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,340
even if you two are that friendly,

667
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,780
it's hard to ask a favor.

668
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,380
She's a celebrity.

669
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:58,940
You're right.

670
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,980
It's hard.

671
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,550
Hey, don't push your luck.

672
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,660
You're not talking. That's rare.

673
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,660
Sir.

674
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,540
When you stood up for me,

675
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,420
I thought you were cool.

676
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,460
Don't stroke my ego.

677
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,260
Keeping my actors safe

678
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,860
is my duty as a director.

679
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,540
That just piled more pressure on me.

680
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,980
Feels like

681
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,340
I have Time Pictures' reputation
on my left shoulder.

682
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,140
On my right,

683
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,220
there's you.

684
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,260
The reputation
of a world-famous director.

685
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,460
If I botch this job,

686
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,940
everyone

687
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,180
will get embarrassed too.

688
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,420
Think about it another way.

689
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,580
I mean,

690
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,460
we're all on the same boat now.

691
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,940
We won't let you embarrass yourself.

692
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,300
Time Pictures

693
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,550
and I are backing you up.

694
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:54,580
Honestly,

695
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,980
it'll be hard to botch this.

696
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,750
Can I come to you
if I have any questions?

697
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,340
Sometimes I think

698
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,580
my questions are too simple.

699
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,260
I'm embarrassed to ask.

700
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:06,420
Sure you can.

701
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:07,850
I'll give you that privilege.

702
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,780
But let's make a deal.

703
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,750
Only one question a day.

704
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,400
You'll have to pick the question wisely.

705
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,220
You can solve

706
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,820
most problems yourself.

707
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,820
Hey.

708
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,100
Can we make it three questions?

709
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:22,900
Two is alright too.

710
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,260
It's hard to toss aside

711
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,060
some questions about acting.

712
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,380
I'll think about it.

713
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,100
Thanks, Mr. Lu.

714
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,260
(What do you want this for?)

715
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,580
Character biography aside,

716
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,620
I want the script too.

717
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,660
Oh, right.

718
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,260
If you have time,

719
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,180
send yourself over.

720
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,380
Sure thing.

721
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,460
You just piqued my curiosity.

722
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:55,620
I'll be right over.

723
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,700
(Destination changed.)

724
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,260
(Turn around right up ahead.)

725
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,580
Mr. Gao.

726
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,660
I could've gotten out

727
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,620
and get there myself.

728
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,300
It's alright.

729
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,620
Mr. Tang has anything to do
in the afternoon.

730
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,500
His flight is at night.

731
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,420
We have enough time.

732
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,220
Whatever you say, Mr. Gao.

733
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,540
Thanks.

734
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,580
I've given them my resume.

735
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,540
You did?

736
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,040
I'll see the director in two days.

737
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:45,700
But...

738
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,140
You never told me

739
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,020
you wanted to venture
into the movie costume arena.

740
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,700
I've always done my designs
in certain niches.

741
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,140
Before this,

742
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,300
I thought my design

743
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,860
was only for a select few.

744
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,540
If anyone couldn't like it,
I wouldn't force them to.

745
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,540
But Huo Chendong

746
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,020
spoke to me

747
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,500
the day after I left your place.

748
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,020
I thought he made a good point.

749
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,260
Huo Chendong?

750
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,780
The industry isn't in its best form,

751
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,020
but we cannot

752
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,020
toss all the problems

753
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,220
to everyone else.

754
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,440
Think about it.

755
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,060
If my style and design

756
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,500
make it to mainstream

757
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,380
and make me a household name,

758
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,540
then even if anyone tries to rip me off,

759
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,530
there's nothing to be scared about.

760
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,980
They'll be advertising my brand.

761
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,420
I can't believe something that smart

762
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,780
came from Mr. Huo.

763
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,420
I admire him more now.

764
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,260
So I've been thinking

765
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,540
that movie costume is the best
and fastest way

766
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,860
to show the market

767
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,300
my style and design.

768
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:38,900
Think about it.

769
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,340
Dingding is gorgeous.

770
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,660
When she wears the clothes I design,

771
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,180
she'll be a walking billboard for me.

772
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,700
If that's your plan,

773
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,660
then all three of us
can be on the production team.

774
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,820
I can't wait.

775
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,180
However,

776
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,320
it's not certain for me yet.

777
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,620
Competition's really fierce.

778
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,020
I heard

779
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,580
all the costume teams
that want to join

780
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,820
are veterans of the industry.

781
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,860
I'm a newbie.

782
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,240
It's not easy for Mr. Lu to be interested
in my designs.

783
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,140
Don't say that.

784
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,300
I believe in you.

785
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,780
From past experience,

786
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,900
the most important part

787
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,100
about costume design

788
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,580
is not to steal the actor's thunder.

789
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,860
We want the costume and the actors

790
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,700
to blend in

791
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,740
with our background.

792
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,140
To be humble yet gorgeous.

793
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,980
That's the core of our design.

794
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:30,940
I don't want a costume

795
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,900
to just be a character's outfit.

796
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,340
It should be the character's skin.

797
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,620
Or to take it further,

798
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,980
a character's mental state

799
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,980
doesn't have to be shown

800
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,660
through their lines or movements.

801
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,340
Once the character comes onscreen

802
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,500
wearing a certain costume,

803
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,660
the audiences

804
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,420
can feel her emotion.

805
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,420
I'll raise

806
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,300
an example.

807
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,980
Scene 52 of the script.

808
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,460
The female lead will be saying goodbye
to the male lead.

809
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:55,780
She does not know

810
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,180
when their next meeting

811
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,180
will be.

812
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,620
She has no idea

813
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,860
if they will ever meet again.

814
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,780
The clothes she wears when she shows up,

815
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,860
down to the littlest trinket,

816
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,540
must mean the impression
she wants to leave

817
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,220
in this final meeting.

818
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,020
Cheers.

819
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,420
Bottoms up.

820
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,580
Congratulations, Miss You.

821
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,220
Congrats for being the costume designer
for A Dream for You.

822
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,060
Congratulations.

823
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,980
Thanks.

824
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,820
And I wish you
great success and recognition

825
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,020
in acting, Dingding.

826
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,020
Nice.

827
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,580
Here.

828
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,700
You

829
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:39,540
will be our nation's

830
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,180
top actress.

831
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:42,980
And you

832
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,380
will be the nation's top

833
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,940
costume designer.

834
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,100
And you

835
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:51,260
will be the wife of Time Pictures' boss.

836
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,300
What are you talking about?

837
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,860
Why can you be independent ladies

838
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,420
while I have to rely on Time Pictures?

839
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,540
No.

840
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,060
My brother's the one relying on you.

841
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,180
That's more like it.

842
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,500
(Time Pictures VP Huo Chendong
Picking Up New GF)

843
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,100
(at Movie Set. Loving Couple.)
This is nice.

844
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,780
(at Movie Set. Loving Couple.)

845
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,580
Hey.

846
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,460
Come on, eat.

847
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,500
Don't scroll your phone.

848
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,100
Tuck it away.

849
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,460
Alright, I'm not scrolling.

850
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,620
Nothing good to see.

851
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:25,940
- Eat.
- You two

852
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,860
are hiding something from me.

853
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:29,660
I am not.

854
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,900
Let me guess.

855
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,900
No need to even guess.

856
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,180
Huo Chendong made his way
to entertainment headlines.

857
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,890
It's about his model girlfriend,
Zhang Qi.

858
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,500
How did you know?

859
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,940
For the last couple of days,

860
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,740
Zhang Qi has been
in an ad shoot with me.

861
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,260
When Huo Chendong picked her up,

862
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:45,180
I saw them.

863
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,060
That's awkward.

864
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,340
You don't feel anything for him now?

865
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,260
Don't give us the excuse

866
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,620
about how you don't care.

867
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,100
You can talk to us about anything.

868
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,300
I don't have to hide anything
from you guys.

869
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,580
Back when I forced a kiss

870
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,820
in his office, I...

871
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,380
- You forced a kiss?
- What?

872
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,740
No.

873
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,780
He didn't get the kiss.

874
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,620
Let me finish.

875
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,020
Come on, spill the tea.

876
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,700
Well, that was when I realized

877
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,260
that I just

878
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,340
didn't want to let it go.

879
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,060
When I see him dating other girls

880
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,100
and get sweet with them,

881
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,900
I get mad and jealous.

882
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,940
But I realized it was not love.

883
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,620
I just didn't want to let it go.

884
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,420
If I truly loved him,

885
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,020
I'd have kissed him.

886
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,460
Right?

887
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,900
- Why are you dragging me into this?
- That move is nice.

888
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,060
Alright, that's enough.

889
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:45,860
No matter what,

890
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,580
now that Tang Dingding is out
of her rut,

891
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,100
it calls for a celebration.

892
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,940
Of course. Let's do it.

893
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,900
Cheers.

894
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,380
Cheers.

895
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,500
Bottoms up.

896
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,350
What are you two doing?

897
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,580
We're drinking.

898
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:07,860
What's wrong?

899
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,660
Why are you sighing like an old lady?

900
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,100
I just think

901
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,420
that shooting will start next month.

902
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,500
I'm still not confident about my acting.

903
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,380
Say,

904
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,180
what if Mr. Lu gets unhappy

905
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,660
and fires me?

906
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,220
He won't, will he?

907
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,620
Dingding.

908
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,140
I'm not trying to scare you,

909
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,580
but Mr. Lu might look like
he doesn't talk much

910
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,500
and has a great temper,

911
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,220
but I heard from someone

912
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,180
that he's super strict to actors.

913
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,300
If you perform unwell,

914
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,820
he will cut the take all day long.

915
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,420
What?

916
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,780
Is that real?

917
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,660
What are you doing?

918
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,780
Say something encouraging.
Don't scare her.

919
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,300
It's alright.

920
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,980
Calm down. Relax.

921
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,580
Toss that aside and just drink.

922
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,540
- Let's celebrate.
- Yeah.

923
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,380
Forget about what I said.

924
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,420
From tomorrow onward,
we'll work hard and prepare for this.

925
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,140
I'll be there with you.

926
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,660
We're with you.

927
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,020
God, it's finally almost done.

928
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,060
Let's get some rest for today.

929
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,420
There's the last scene.

930
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,860
Shooting starts in half an hour.

931
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,140
Okay.

932
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,260
Anything else for the day?

933
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,340
Let's see.

934
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,460
After this ad shoot,

935
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,580
there's nothing else left.

936
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,860
There's an interview tomorrow morning.

937
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,420
I'll pick you up at seven.

938
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,460
We'll style you up once we get there.

939
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,780
On Friday,

940
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,580
there's a promotion for an item.

941
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,180
God.

942
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,340
Why is the interview so early?

943
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,300
Hey.

944
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,780
It's mealtime.

945
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,140
I'll grab something for you.

946
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,260
Oh, and here's your phone.

947
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,300
Thanks.

948
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,140
(I remember a rain scene we shot.)

949
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,340
(It was at night. The leads)

950
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,500
(were running in the rain, weren't they?)

951
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:54,300
(And they hugged)

952
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,520
(Do you know how many times
the take was cut?)

953
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,420
(Twenty-eight times.)

954
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,580
(After that scene, both leads)

955
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,540
(got fever and had to stay
in the hospital.)

956
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,060
(I wasn't making it hard
for the newbies.)

957
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,260
(To be precise,)

958
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,620
(it's an obsession with art.)

959
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,420
(No matter if you
are an award-winning actor)

960
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,780
(or a newbie,)

961
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,020
(if you're on my set,)

962
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,450
(you're all the same to me.)

963
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,900
(If you botch your job,)

964
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,140
(I will retake the scene.)

965
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,460
(But I heard from someone)

966
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,300
(that he's super strict to actors.)

967
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,340
(If you perform unwell,)

968
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,100
(he will cut the take all day long.)

969
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,300
I'll put your food here.

970
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,380
Come and eat.

971
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,420
It's alright. Just leave me.

972
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,140
I'm not hungry.

973
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,820
You should at least eat something.

974
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,820
You woke up early.

975
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,780
If you won't eat, you will break.

976
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,140
I don't have an appetite.

977
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,300
You do your work.

978
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,450
I'll go through the script again.

979
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,340
Honestly,

980
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,100
you are rich, beautiful,

981
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,140
and hard working.

982
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,620
If you don't get famous,

983
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,140
it'll be really unfair.

984
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,620
Let's not put the cart before the horse.

985
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,620
If I don't work hard,

986
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,980
I'll lose my job.

987
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,620
You get to work, alright?

988
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,820
I'll grab something to eat.

989
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,620
Go.

990
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,820
(Mr. Lu.)

991
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:43,580
(I'm here for my question of the day.)

992
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,900
(Should there be more surprise)
- Question of the day?

993
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:46,940
(or anticipation here?)

994
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,140
Hey, Mr. Lu.

995
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,420
(Hello, Dingding.)

996
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,140
I saw your message.

997
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:01,500
First,

998
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,140
you got the emotions right.

999
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:04,340
(The surprise)

1000
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,540
(only lasts for a moment.)

1001
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,020
(At this point,)

1002
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:08,190
(you should put more emphasis)

1003
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,380
(on the future self.)

1004
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,230
(Wonder if you'll meet
the male lead again.)

1005
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,300
Of course,

1006
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:14,300
there's also a subtler emotion here

1007
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:15,280
that you have to capture.

1008
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,380
At this moment,

1009
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:17,660
you are anticipating his answer.

1010
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,340
(But you will also be scared)

1011
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,540
(that the answer)

1012
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,820
(wouldn't be what you want.)

1013
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,980
The answer wouldn't be what I want?

1014
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,020
(This is hard.)

1015
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,340
There's only two lines,

1016
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,750
but there are so many emotions here.

1017
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,260
It's alright.

1018
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,500
I'll have time tomorrow afternoon.

1019
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,580
(I'll rehearse this scene with you.)

1020
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:42,940
Sure.

1021
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:45,020
I'll show up wearing makeup.

1022
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,140
It gives more of the vibe.

1023
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:47,820
Okay.

1024
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,780
Mr. Lu, are you down with a cold?

1025
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:53,940
No.

1026
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,100
I burned the midnight oil last night.

1027
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,580
Get some rest.

1028
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,240
(It's not good staying up late.)

1029
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:03,500
(We'll meet tomorrow)

1030
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:04,860
See you.

1031
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,140
(Not good staying up late?)

1032
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,140
(Makes me sound old.)

1033
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,340
Fifth clause, third point.

1034
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,620
If the payment comes later

1035
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,100
than seven working days,

1036
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,980
there will be late fee.

1037
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,540
If it comes over fourteen working days,

1038
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,300
work will stop.

1039
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,750
And reimbursements will happen.

1040
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,950
- No problem with everything else?
- No.

1041
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,140
(Man.)

1042
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,500
(Three clauses took them six hours.)

1043
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,140
(I should've thought of that.)

1044
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:40,300
(Maybe that move will come in handy.)

1045
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:47,500
Okay.

1046
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:02,940
Pleasure doing business.

1047
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:03,620
Pleasure.

1048
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,500
There's a new bar nearby.

1049
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,580
Want to check it out?

1050
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:07,820
No.

1051
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:08,860
It's getting late.

1052
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:10,140
We'll meet at the next conference.

1053
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:11,140
Of course, Mr. Tang.

1054
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,620
See you next time.

1055
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:13,620
Goodbye.

1056
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:23,620
Who's there with you?

1057
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:26,180
I'm asking you a question.

1058
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:27,260
Answer me.

1059
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:28,780
Why aren't you talking?

1060
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,340
(Just signed a contract.)

1061
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,460
(Now getting back to my room.)

1062
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,660
(I haven't seen anyone outside work.)

1063
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:40,900
(I didn't talk to any woman)

1064
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,700
(about anything outside work.)

1065
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,300
(I'll be back tomorrow.)

1066
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,800
I didn't tell you to report to me
about everything.

1067
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,340
Why did you do that?

1068
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,180
Sounds like you're hiding something
from me.

1069
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,180
I...

1070
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:33,780
What's wrong?

1071
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,260
Am I disturbing you?

1072
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,420
Sorry.

1073
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,300
Just one question.

1074
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:43,500
After this,

1075
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,500
you can sleep.

1076
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:46,580
Go on.

1077
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:49,860
Can you

1078
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:51,860
pick me up tomorrow?

1079
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,060
Bye.

1080
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:03,820
(Independent and unmovable)

1081
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,140
The first time,

1082
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,740
you were dragged into this world

1083
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:08,140
because of my grudge.

1084
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,340
So,

1085
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,820
your task was to change my destiny.

1086
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,180
What about this time?

1087
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,780
This time,

1088
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:19,620
I was dragged here

1089
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,620
by your longing for me.

1090
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:24,980
I thought

1091
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:27,500
you had forgotten about me.

1092
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:31,620
Okay.

1093
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:33,420
That's it for now.

1094
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:35,980
Hear me out.

1095
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:37,900
You have to understand

1096
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,300
why you speak the lines out.

1097
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:42,300
Some you speak for yourself.

1098
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,500
Some you speak to the people
in front of you.

1099
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,140
Some you speak to the audience.

1100
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:47,900
Let's practice.

1101
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,180
You try to express

1102
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,620
the love you understand.

1103
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:52,820
Sure.

1104
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:54,740
Come.

1105
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,100
Begin.

1106
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:05,860
I like you.

1107
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,460
I think

1108
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:10,940
I like you too.
