00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,479
(Once we have people we like,)

26
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,079
(they become our weakness.)

(my heart flutters.)

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,120
Even if you missed her birthday,

30
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,039
it doesn't mean you can't
do anything about it,

31
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,880
right?

32
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:06,279
Do you two have any

33
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,839
special anniversaries?

34
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,800
Think long and hard.

35
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,760
Anniversaries?

36
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,079
Right.

37
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,159
You two have been
chasing around forever.

38
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,079
Back and forth.

39
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,640
Of course, you have no anniversaries.

40
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,679
What was the day

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,639
she kissed you?

42
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,600
Do you still remember?

43
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,959
It's fine if you don't.

44
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,359
The company has surveillance cams.

45
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,359
I'll check the footage and find out.

46
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,399
And then,

47
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,639
you can make

48
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,519
something like 200 days
forced kiss anniversary.

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,800
Then the confession comes naturally.

50
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Third time's the charm.

51
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,560
What do you mean?

52
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,839
I'm stupid

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,639
for talking to you about this.

54
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,239
Hey.

55
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,759
My...

56
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,239
My suggestions are reliable.

57
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,759
Who are you going to talk to if not me?

58
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,800
My suggestions are the best.

59
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,640
Honestly,

60
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,120
I'm not too experienced in this.

61
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,520
But at least,

62
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,200
you made it once.

63
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,679
You still have to make sure

64
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,600
the time, location, and people are good.

65
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,520
The venue

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,519
should be formal.

67
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,640
Formal?

68
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,000
As for the time...

69
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,400
Birthday would be the best.

70
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,480
Birthday?

71
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,840
Why?

72
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,440
Easy to remember.

73
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,119
Birthday, confess day.

74
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,279
Wedding. Wedding anniversary.

75
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,680
Make them happen on the same date.

76
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,560
Saves money.

77
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,840
Saves your energy.

78
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,560
You two are really stupid.

79
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,799
It's been more than an hour.

80
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,280
And you two came up with nothing?

81
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,040
You make it sound like
our family's in a financial crisis.

82
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,520
Son, tell me.

83
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,639
How do you

84
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,799
usually express your love to a lady?

85
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,400
I asked him that.

86
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,759
He gives her red packets all the time.

87
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,320
He asks around for houses for her.

88
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,279
He helps her develop her projects.

89
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,079
It's one step at a time. Very safe plan.

90
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,040
Son.

91
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,799
You are more of an expert

92
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,079
in romance than me.

93
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,719
You flatter me.

94
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,680
You call this being an expert?

95
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,760
This is just throwing money
at the problem.

96
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,040
One question.

97
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,679
Do you know

98
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,000
the kind of romance girls want?

99
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,799
It must be genuine and romantic,

100
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,479
but mostly genuine.

101
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,999
But even when you're genuine,

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,519
you have to be romantic.

103
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,439
Wait, Mom.

104
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,359
So do I have to be genuine

105
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,720
or romantic?

106
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,760
Remember this.

107
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,599
Don't make the girl choose.

108
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,719
Girls are creatures

109
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,440
who want to have their cake
and eat it.

110
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,760
First you need to keep an eye
on the environment.

111
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,559
Don't do it where you two
usually hang out.

112
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,799
It will look like

113
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,080
you don't pay enough attention.

114
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,399
Go to private restaurants.
Upscale malls.

115
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,440
That is so last century.

116
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,480
It is not.

117
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,919
You should pick

118
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,959
somewhere with a nice view.

119
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,799
A place that can soothe the heart.

120
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,360
Just the two of you.

121
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,959
Don't get your friends to join in.

122
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,199
Girls hate this kind of confession.
Feels like they're emotionally blackmailed.

123
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,959
That's right.

124
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,759
Your mother's right.

125
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,280
Go away.

126
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,320
You love to work, don't you?

127
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,719
Then disguise this confession as work.

128
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,720
And don't make it too obvious.

129
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,279
If you do,

130
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,400
it'll ruin the surprise.

131
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,240
Make it a surprise. Don't be obvious.
Make it look like work.

132
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,920
I got it, I think.

You're early for the meeting.

141
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,079
The last meeting was held here too.

142

It just ended.

On your birthday...

145
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,520
I mean on your birthday,

146
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,440
you weren't down with a cold, were you?

147
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,920
No.

148
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,920
That's good.

149
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,040
You don't have to sit so far. Sit here.

150
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,440
The screen's bigger here.
I can see things better.

151
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,719
I know the screen's bigger and clearer,

152
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,919
but that's the director's seat,

153
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,839
not yours.

154

00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,960
Come.

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,800
Sit.

158
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,439
I've dry cleaned your suit.

159
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,240
Just get Mr. Gao to take it.

160
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,280
The suit's not important.

161
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,360
This is what I'm thinking.

162
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,039
Do you have anywhere you want to go?

163
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,560
I can go with you.

This set of pictures

172
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,319
are the big scenes of Icestonevale
I recreated.

173
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,759
They're made from the videos

174
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,559
I filmed when making documentaries.

175
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,479
I'll be setting a few important scenes

176
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,799
in this venue.

177
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,920

179
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,879
Can you find similar places
from Mr. Lu's files

180

in the nation?

181
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,839
Mr. Tang, that will be a difficult task.

182
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,999
That's Icestonevale.

183
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,359
Not even Mohe

184
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,600
can recreate the ice layer effect
in these pictures.

185
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,679
I won't let you
do anything impossible, Mr. Li.

186
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,799
Here's my idea.

187
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,399
We can only do this in Icestonevale.

188
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,199
Aside from the big scenes,

189
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,239
Icestonevale's mountain range
neighbors the sea.

190
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,879
There's a unique coastline there.

191
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,079
There are some lakes and bays nearby.

192
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,040
It'll enrich our movie's scenery.

193
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,120
Mr. Lu.

194
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,839
Icestonevale

195
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,720
is no go.

196
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,599
Why not?

197
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,719
A Dream for You

198
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,439
is perfect to be aired
during Valentine's,

199
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,480
or it won't make a huge splash.

200
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,159
Icestonevale is overseas.

201
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,479
We need time to prepare.

202
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,599
And if we want to go,

203
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,839
we'll need to apply for the venue,
which also takes time.

204
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,279
We don't have enough time.

205
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,599
If we're delaying this,

206
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,680
we'll be delaying it for a year.

207
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,759
And another important point.

208
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,599
Icestonevale's weather

209
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,359
is challenging for our crew.

210
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,199
If you want a sea view,

211
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,160
why not consider Xiacheng?

212
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,520
Mr. Tang.

213
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,119
Xiacheng's sea view
and Icestonevale's sea view

214
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:34,919
has different

215
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,119
visual impact.

216
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,280
I know that.

217
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,079
We can brush the videos up

218
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,879
with aftereffects.

219
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,799
You're the director.

220
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,880
You should know more

221
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,480
about various ways
of presentation than I do.

222
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,119
I know,

223
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,799
but under equal conditions,

224
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,399
taking a scene in a real place
is better than using CGI.

225
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,359
I know that.

226
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,319
Icestonevale is our best choice.

227
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,600
But we need to consider
the factors in reality.

228
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,680
Tang Xin.

229
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,879
What do you think?

230
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,800
Speak your mind.

231
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,760
Me?

232
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Just say it.

233
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,720
(Can I talk to them alone?)

234
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,400
Mr. Tang.

235
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,319
From the content point of view,

236
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,640
Icestonevale's icy land's connection
with the sea

237
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,879
fits the storyline

238
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,480
of the female lead falling
into the crack between worlds.

239
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,320
Besides,

240
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,879
if the scene looks like the real world,

241
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,720
the effects won't pop.

242
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,439
I can understand

243
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,400
you creators,

244
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,599
but as the producer of this project,

245
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,320
I must consider everything.

246
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,879
Including things beyond
the creating sector.

247
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,200
I need to consider that.

248
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,759
I'll raise a simple example.

249
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,280
Let's take our budget into account.

250
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,879
Do you know how much money

251
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,920
I would have to add if we go overseas?

252
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,079
From the point of ROI,

253
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,319
I cannot

254
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,960
convince the shareholders to do it.

255
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,639
I see.

256
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,439
Mr. Tang.

257
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,599
I understand what you mean.

258
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,319
I'll talk to Mr. Lu.

259
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,160
Wait for me.

260
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,320
Mr. Lu.

261
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,279
I've talked to Mr. Tang.

262
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,399
If we go overseas,

263
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,360
the budget's going to be in trouble.

264
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,639
I've thought about it.

265
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,800
This scene might be important,

266
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,799
but when I wrote it,

267
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,040
I didn't make any concrete settings.

268
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,599
Snow-capped lands,

269
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,399
the forest,

270
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,600
the mysterious island.

271
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,279
As long as they're different
from the real world,

272
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,640
it's fine.

273
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,519
I think we can do some survey.

274
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,160
Maybe we'll find something better
out of this.

275
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,200
The budget's a problem,

276
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,880
but so is the movie's reputation.

277
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,799
Movies like this

278
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,960
rely heavily on visual effects.

279
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,319
Sometimes, one scene,

280
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,039
one section, and even one frame,

281
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,679
might be key for more attention.

282
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,919
Bring higher attendance and more profit.

283
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,760
Mr. Tang can't get that
through his head?

284
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,759
I...

285
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,079
I'll talk to him again.

286
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,200
Give me a moment.

287
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,639
Mr. Tang.

288
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,799
Mr. Lu said that he's confident

289
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,799
to make it a good movie.

290
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,919
He'll make the money we spent
on going overseas back.

291
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,439
The budget's not the only problem.

292
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,120
What about the duration of the shoot?

293
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,840
Did he find a way around that?

294
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,119
He can't drag the whole crew with him

295
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,600
and set things up before he plans.

296
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:41,759
Fine.

297
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,120
I get what you mean.

298
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,199
But I think if we have pictures
of the real place, it'll be more convincing.

299
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,920
I'll talk to Mr. Lu again.

300
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,079
Mr. Lu.

301
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,879
Duration is also...

302
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,559
If you can't make it good,
even if it makes it to theaters on time,

303
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,160
the audience might not see it.

304
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,400
Tell him that.

305
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,679
Mr. Tang.

306
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,599
And what about the crew's safety?

307
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,440
Icestonevale is dangerous.

308
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,279
What if anything happens?

309
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,360
Who will take responsibility?

310
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,120
Can you?

311
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,079
It doesn't have to be the whole crew.

312
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,519
I'll lead a small team for it.

313
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,040
Don't sacrifice art.

314
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,799
Budget, duration, safety.

315
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,720
Uniqueness.

316
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,000
Visual impact that captures attention.

317
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,519
If you want to argue,
argue among yourselves.

318
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,240
Why must I be the messenger?

319
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,560
This is childish.

320
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,479
I don't want to talk to him.

321
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,760
- He's not calm enough.
- He's not calm enough.

322
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,040
You two,

323
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,560
can you let me catch my breath?

324
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,080
(WUway natural food)

325
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,319
I'm not going.

326
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,839
I am not.

327
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,879
I really don't want to go in.

328
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,999
I'm scared of both of them.

329
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,040
They are scary when they're mad.

330
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,839
I'll be burned to ash.

331
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,999
Please.

332
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,719
I had to go through hoops
to ask both of them out.

333
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,359
I can't deal with this alone.

334
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,719
Just sit quietly and watch me.

335
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,159
I am not going.

336
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,519
I don't want to.

337
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,440
You are going.

338
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,520
Aren't you going in?

339
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,400
He's talking to you.

340
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,760
Lead the way.

341
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,360
Hey, you two.

342
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,599
You're here anyway.

343
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,520
Why don't you sit down and talk?

344
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,840
I made the pictures.

345
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:06,999
Everyone knows

346
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,959
the effects are better if we shoot it
in Icestonevale.

347
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,039
He won't let me.

348
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,240
Then I have nothing to say.

349
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,640
We must follow the shooting schedule.

350
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,599
I can invest more money

351
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,920
on the CGI,

352
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,599
but I won't allow

353
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,840
a trip to Icestonevale.

354
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,239
Stop talking.

355
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,920
Just get this over with.

356
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,600
I'm going.

357
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,359
Mr. Lu.

358
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,919
Don't go. Stay.

359
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,799
For my sake.

360
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,599
He's my brother,
and Tang Xin's my best friend.

361
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,519
If you leave,

362
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,079
I can't face them.

363
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,720
I'll never know peace.

364
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,319
Mr. Tang.

365
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,919
Hey.

366
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,959
If you two fight,

367
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,719
the only one hurt

368
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,119
will be the project team.

369
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,999
If you're in a stalemate,

370
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,479
how can the project progress?

371
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,199
Isn't that right?

372
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,839
He's been that way since college time.

373
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,159
It was our classmate's birthday.

374
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,439
They loved Japanese food.

375
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,279
I reserved a spot

376
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,679
for a really good private
Japanese eatery.

377
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,159
But he

378
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,119
just had to take everyone to a barbecue.

379
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,199
He was wrong.

380
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,839
It was his fault.

381
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,639
We had an exam the next day.

382
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,039
That restaurant was far away.

383
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,359
We wouldn't have had time
for revision.

384
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,999
Someone's leaving himself out.

385
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,119
He wanted to help his classmate
woo a girl,

386
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,399
and they said

387
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,319
to make it simple.

388
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,000
But he had to set up a rehearsal,

389
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,479
saying it was for a better effect.

390
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,799
He wanted a better scene.

391
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,599
And then,

392
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,360
he ruined the romance.

393
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,399
Right.

394
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,239
You're right.

395
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,080
You're right.

396
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,120
How is it my fault he failed?

397
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,079
He has no idea what romance is.

398
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,359
That's ad hominem. That's bad.

399
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,159
I'm telling you,

400
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,879
you have to take risks to get romance.

401
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,039
The quicker you win a girl's heart,
the easier you lose it.

402
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,520
I was giving their romance

403
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:39,760
a gift.

404
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,079
You should join a debate competition.

405
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,919
You can twist the whole story.

406
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,640
- Alright, stop fighting.
- Alright, stop fighting.

407
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,599
Dingding, we're leaving.

408
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,400
Let's go.

409
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,920
- Hold on.
- Hold on.

410
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,840
I've found a way around this.

411
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,199
This looks nice.

412
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,080
Right?

413
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,679
I think it's alright.

414
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,720
Mr. Tang.

415
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,479
Mr. Lu, don't take this the wrong way.

416
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,599
I'm not backing Mr. Tang up.

417
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,920
But look at this island.

418
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,760
Look at its colors.

419
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,759
If we brush it up a little
during editing,

420
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,680
it'll look just as good as
the sight abroad.

421
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,479
Compared to the mysterious

422
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,279
snow-capped land,

423
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,719
this fits the domestic market more.

424
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,840
And the nation's people like
this kind of view more.

425
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Why don't we do this?

426
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,159
I'll adjust

427
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,039
these venues and fit them
with the scenes

428
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,559
in the script.

429
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,000
Then I'll show them to you.

430
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,800
Even if it's like what you said,

431
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,839
this isn't enough

432
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,279
if you want to express
the feelings of layers

433
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,680
between two worlds.

434
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,559
The venues aren't enough.

435
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,359
But time is of the essence too.

436
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,959
Many landscapes of the remote island

437
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,999
haven't been shot yet.

438
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,719
Don't worry.

439
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,880
I've sent someone to check it out.

440
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,479
Once they're done

441
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,680
with the arrangements,

442
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,160
we'll recreate the scene.

443
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,880
You decide

444
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,280
if we can shoot.

445
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,040
Can I leave now?

446
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,720
Mr. Lu.

447
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,760
Mr. Lu.

448
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,279
Mr. Lu.

449
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,600
You're leaving just like that?

450
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,719
Mr. Lu left.

451
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,520
So did he agree?

452
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,000
Ignore him.

453
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Dingding.

454
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,720
Come here and eat.

455
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,200
Check the menu.

456
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,440
I'm fine with anything. You order.

457
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,000
Eat.

458
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,393
(Lu)

459
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,800
Mr. Lu.

460
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,640
Mr. Lu.

461
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
Who's there?

462
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,040
It's me.

463
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,040
Dingding.

464
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,960
I got you some takeout.

465
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,879
You haven't eaten anything.
And it's late.

466
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,960
Eat it while it's hot.

467
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,199
You're worried I might go hungry?

468
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,399
It's late.

469
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,120
You probably can't get any delivery.

470
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,479
And having deliveries all the time
isn't healthy.

471
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,680
So I got you takeout.

472
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,120
That's just delivery with extra steps.

473
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,520
Thanks.

474
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,920
Mr. Lu.

475
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,560
You left

476
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
without having anything to eat.

477
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,599
Did you agree with the suggestion?

478
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,000
Or do you disagree?

479
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,479
After I left,

480
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,880
what did your brother say?

481
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,000
He said nothing.

482
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,879
But I think

483
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,040
you agreed.

484
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,040
Beer?

485
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,879
I can take a little.

486
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,240
Then I'll get two cans.

487
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,880
I think

488
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,920
your brother has a point.

489
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,239
We can check things out.

490
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,119
Really?

491
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,280
That's great.

492
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,800
Why are you so happy?

493
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,560
Of course, I'm happy.

494
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,959
Just when I finally decided
to be an actress,

495
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,039
if the director who admires me quits,

496
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,000
I'll be losing my job.

497
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,240
Why are you drinking so fast?

498
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,959
Sooner I finish, sooner I can leave.

499
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,719
Just the two of us sitting around

500
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,680
feels awkward.

501
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,040
Awkward?

502
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,120
That's not what I meant.

503
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,159
No. Hey, don't.

504
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,280
Stop drinking.

505
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,359
It's getting late.

506
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,480
Why don't you go home now?

507
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,799
No can do.

508
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,559
If I leave before I finish,

509
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,280
it would be discourteous.

510
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,200
No, I mean...

511
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,479
I'm just saying

512
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,040
that watching you drink like this

513
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,880
makes me feel awkward.

514
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,280
I see.

515
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
It's awkward?

516
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,560
I'll be going, then.

517
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,280
Go on.

518
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:17,120
I'm leaving.

519
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,560
Enjoy your supper, Mr. Lu.

520
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,399
I'll be going now.

521
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,280
Sure.

522
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,280
Good night.

523
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,560
Safe trip.

524
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,399
I have to provide nearly 100 costumes.

525
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,119
I have to be in the crew
for three to four months

526
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,680
and take care of the actors'
styling and costume.

527
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,599
This is already a discounted price,
and it's because of Tang Xin.

528
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,639
I can't lower it anymore.

529
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
Okay.

530
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,400
You're friends with Dingding,
aren't you?

531
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,599
What if you do it for her sake too?

532
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,200
Twenty percent discount?

533
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
Five percent.

534
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,520
Okay.

535
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,919
Do it for me too.

536
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,559
We're buddies too.

537
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,079
We've known each other for a long time.

538
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:15,960
Right?

539
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,280
Including you?

540
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,560
Sure.

541
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,360
Twenty percent.

542
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,800
Nice.

543
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,280
That's a nice offer.

544
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,920
Twenty percent?

545
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,280
Twenty percent.

546
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,160
Equals to... Let me check the price.

547
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,519
I mean, including you,

548
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,240
I'll have to increase the price
by twenty percent.

549
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,999
Think about it.

550
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,600
This is your first step
into the industry.

551
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,599
Once A Dream for You airs,

552
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,719
you'll be the costume designer

553
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,199
for the year's box-office champion.

554
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,079
Isn't that right?

555
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,239
When that happens,

556
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,439
you can take any jobs you want.

557
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,759
You can quote them any price you want.

558
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,600
Mr. Huo.

559
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,719
Don't give me false promises.

560
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,160
I might be a designer,
but I have dignity too.

561
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,879
Every product I make,

562
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,239
every matching set I create,

563
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,119
costs money and effort.

564
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,279
From components to mold and creation.

565
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,279
Yes.

566
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,240
I know.

567
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,559
You guys have invested
in such a big project.

568
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,719
Do you have to exploit me?

569
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,560
Yeah.

570
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,039
We did invest a ton of money in this.

571
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,119
But a lot of aspects need money

572
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,639
in this part of production.

573
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,919
If I don't get calculative,

574
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,159
even we double the money,

575
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,800
it still won't be enough.

576
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,480
I know

577
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,239
pushing your prices down is bad,

578
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,519
so I had to toughen up

579
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,000
and talk to you myself.

580
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,520
Tang Xin.

581
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,440
Your friend is awesome.

582
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,040
Sugar Heart.

583
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,399
You Huan is too powerful.

584
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,000
I can't convince her.

585
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,519
Just kidding.

586
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,400
I didn't send it.

587
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,200
Let's be professional.

588
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:11,440
How about this?

589
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,600
I'll give you a piece of intel.

590
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,599
You assess

591
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,599
how much it's worth.

592
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,959
And then,

593
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,519
you can give me

594
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,359
a little discount on the price
you quoted before.

595
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,320
Can we do that?

596
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,400
What kind of intel?

597
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,239
Do you know where the shooting
takes place in?

598
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,119
Where?

599
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,320
Xiacheng.

600
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
What?

601
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,679
There's a place called Lover's Bay
in Xiacheng.

602
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,560
It's where couples express their love.

603
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,760
So?

604
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,640
Fine. Ten percent discount. Carry on.

605
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:52,000
Tang Yu set the shooting to be there

606
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,320
because he wants to confess to Tang Xin.

607
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,519
Don't you want to witness it?

608
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,959
Your best friend getting
into a relationship?

609
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,119
If you want to,

610
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,719
just give me a bit more discount.

611
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,839
Mr. Huo.

612
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,439
If you keep doing this,

613
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:03,959
I should go back

614
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,680
and be a niche designer.

615
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,959
Sure, okay.

616
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,759
Ten percent discount.

617
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,640
Deal.

618
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,159
Tomorrow, I'll tell the PIC

619
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,480
to send you the contract.

620
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,119
Okay.

621
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,200
Ms. You.

622
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,160
Pleasure doing business.

623
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,560
(That's a famous couple's spot.)

624
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,279
I have a feeling

625
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,879
this trip

626
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,600
will be fascinating.

627
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,080
I'll be there for work.

628
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,559
Not a vacation.

629
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,319
Nothing fascinating will happen.

630
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,199
It's work and vacation.

631
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,519
You can't work

632
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,559
twenty-four hours.

633
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,080
(You'll break.)

634
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,119
I think Tang Yu

635
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
is up to something this time.

636
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,200
I overthought it back on my birthday.

637
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,159
This time,

638
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,959
I won't start fantasizing anymore.

639
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,719
(Just have some confidence, will you?)

640
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,999
(If he doesn't make a move,)

641
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,519
(you date a hottie
at the set right away.)

642
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,199
Listen.

643
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,439
You are not wasting

644
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,919
my cutting my price
for joining your crew.

645
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,680
I will witness you
start your relationship.

646
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,199
Okay, talk later.

647
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,880
I need to pack up fast.

648
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,320
Lover's Bay.

649
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,660
(Lover's Bay,
a must-visit place for couples)

650
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,680
(Tang Yu: What are you doing?)

651
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,320
Yeah.

652
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,440
What am I doing?

653
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,520
(Tang Yu: Are you done packing?)

654
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,759
What's it to you?

655
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,920
Who do you think you are?

656
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,920
(Tang Yu: Why aren't you replying?)

657
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,840
(The weather forecast says it'll be cold
there in a couple of days.)

658
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,119
(Bring some warm clothes with you.)

659
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,200
(You don't want to catch a cold.)

660
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,040
None of your business.

661
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,600
She's not checking her texts?

662
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,560
Who's there?

663
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,319
Tang Xin.

664
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,200
It's me.

665
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,759
I'm going to sleep.

666
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,000
You should go home.

667
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,080
Door opened.

668
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,320
Tang Yu.

669
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,800
You disappear when I need you.

670
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,000
Need me?

671
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,400
Need me for what?

672
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,599
I thought you went home.

673
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,759
Why'd you come back out?

674
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,880
Are you peeping on me?

675
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,240
You're doing the same thing, aren't you?

676
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:10,599
Tell me.

677
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,839
What do you want me to do?

678
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,759
No.

679
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,160
I'm self-sufficient.

680
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,440
Sure, thanks.

681
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,559
Tang Xin.

682
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,360
Let's go.

683
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,880
Get in the car.

684
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,520
Let's go.

685
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,839
Miss Tang.

686
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,400
I'll take the front seat.

687
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,239
It's alright, Mr. Gao.

688
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,880
You take the back with them.

689
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,559
(I don't want to sit)

690
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,120
(with these big babies, alright?)

691
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,919
(You think I want to?)

692
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,800
(They're deadly.)

693
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,240
(Please.)

694
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,000
(Please.)

695
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:33,840
(Fine.)

696
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,840
I'll get in the car.

697
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,320
Mr. Tang.

698
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,359
The luggage is in the trunk.

699
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,160
We can go now.

700
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,160
Right.

701
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,999
Where are we surveying tomorrow?

702
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,080
- The volcano.
- The volcano.

703
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,920
Get in, Mr. Lu.

704
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,559
Thanks

705
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,720
for the hand.

706
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,120
Just get in the car.

707
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,439
Mr. Lu.

708
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,879
The art guys said this volcanic terrain

709
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,880
fits our scene more.

710
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,960
Sure.

711
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,000
This is usable.

712
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,240
Liu Yang.

713
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,000
Get some pictures.

714
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,320
From this angle. Capture the sea.

715
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,120
Forget it.

716
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,920
Just get some photos from any angle.

717
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,760
Sure. You learn everything
after working in a set long enough.

718
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,560
Mr. Lu.

719
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,239
There's another spot up there.

720
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,240
It's a cliff. High one too.

721
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,799
Perfect for our cliff scene.

722
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,679
Let's check it out.

723
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,559
Sure.

724
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,119
Let's go.

725
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,079
Be careful, Liu Yang.

726
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,320
Sure, Mr. Lu.

727
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,400
Gao Heng.

728
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,880
Follow them.

729
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,879
Could you help me take some pictures?

730
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,800
Sure.

731
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,960
Here you go.

732
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:42,759
Okay.

733
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,600
Done.

734
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,760
Are you still going there?

735
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,199
Be careful, then.

736
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,759
Don't worry.

737
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,360
I have steady feet.

738
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,720
Just be careful.

739
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,399
Move to the right a little.

740
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:54,879
Your right?

741
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,680
Yep.

742
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,560
The background's nice.

743
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,559
Okay.

744
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,439
Move here?

745
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,240
Yep.

746
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:03,639
Here?

747
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,840
Alright, don't move.

748
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Another one.

749
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,640
That's nice.

750
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,760
Three, two, one. That's it.

751
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,160
Right. Move over just a bit.

752
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,199
Don't move.

753
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,640
- Is it alright here?
- Okay.

754
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,399
Let's do this.

755
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,360
Three, two, one.

756
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,840
Not bad. Is it alright?

757
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,760
What's wrong?

758
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,920
Liu Yang.

759
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,880
Liu Yang.

760
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,760
Liu Yang.

761
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,199
Liu Yang!

762
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Liu Yang!

763
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,400
Liu Yang!

764
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,720
Liu Yang.

765
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,400
Tang Yu.

766
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
Tang Yu.

767
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,600
Tang Yu.

768
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,880
Tang Yu.

769
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,520
Tang Yu.

770
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,800
Mr. Lu.

771
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,840
Mr. Gao.

772
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,120
They

773
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,880
fell to the sea.

774
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,839
What?

775
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,639
Who did?

776
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,719
Liu Yang did.

777
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,120
Tang Yu went in to save him.

778
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,519
Call the emergency number.

779
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,279
Go.

780
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:23,759
Okay.

781
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,119
Let's go.

782
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:24,800
Go.

783
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,520
Go.

784
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,560
It's right up there.

785
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,400
Mr. Tang.

786
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,200
- Mr. Tang.
- I think they're there.

787
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,079
Mr. Tang.

788
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,040
Tang Yu.

789
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:39,799
Mr. Tang.

790
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,720
Tang Yu.

791
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,519
Mr. Tang.

792
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,640
Tang Yu.

793
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,400
What should we do?

794
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,799
What are you doing?

795
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,920
Are you mad?

796
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,519
Tang Yu can swim.

797
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,000
He knows what he's doing.

798
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,240
Do you know?

799
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,839
His arm got injured two years ago.

800
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,120
He hasn't been swimming for two years.

801
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,200
Look at the huge waves.
He has to carry Liu Yang on his back.

802
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,040
How can he save Liu Yang?

803
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,680
Stop this.

804
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,239
Mr. Gao.

805
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,600
Tang Yu saved the guy.

806
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,640
Let's go.

807
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,560
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

808
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,280
Mr. Tang.

809
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,200
Mr. Tang.

810
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,880
Are you alright?

811
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,960
Liu Yang.

812
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,960
Check up on Liu Yang.

813
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,600
Tang Yu.

814
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,000
Are you alright?

815
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,680
You scared me.

816
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:56,960
It's alright.

817
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,440
I'm alright, see?

818
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,080
Tang Xin.

819
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,480
Are you really alright?

820
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,960
You scared me.

821
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,880
It's alright.

822
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,400
I'm fine.

823
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,280
I'm alright.

824
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,120
Tang Yu.

825
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,000
Tang Yu.

826
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,880
I'm here.

827
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,520
Can we be a couple?

828
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,640
You don't want to?

829
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,600
It's not that.

830
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,520
You silly.

831
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,880
I haven't confessed.

832
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,240
I was going to do it

833
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,120

from the moment you leaped into the sea,
I've been thinking.

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,760
Confession or ritual,
I don't care about them.

840
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,280
I just want you to come back safe.

841

what's going on with Tang Xin and Yu.

869
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,319
What happened to whom?

870
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,440
Here, have some fruits.

871
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,560
Nothing.

872
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,080
Just saying random stuff.

873
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,319
How's your brother's love life doing?

874
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,479
Any progress?

875
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,480
Tell me all about it.

876
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,600
I think it's the same.

877
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,760
No big strides.

878
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:26,719
Mom.

879
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,439
Honestly,

880
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,960
Yu

881
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,719
can be decisive

882
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,799
when it comes to work.

883
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,639
But he takes his sweet time
when it comes to love.

884
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,120
I get worried for him.

885
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,799
You're right.

886
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,199
Your father and I

887
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,719
are decisive lovers.

888
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,439
I have no idea
who he took that trait from.

889
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,559
He's thirty years old.

890
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,120
And he's not even worried.

891
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,319
Do you have any love stories

892
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:52,240
to tell me?

893
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:55,240
I don't have any stories, Mom.

894
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,640
I haven't run into anyone
I want to date.

895
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,319
And if I date someone so soon,

896
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,279
I won't have time for you.

897
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,159
I'm still young.

898
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,079
I'm not in a rush.

899
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,280
I'll deal with my career first.

900
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,319
Sure.

901
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,959
I'm asking you seriously,

902
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,960
so you answer seriously too.

903
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,439
Do you really want to be an actress?

904
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,240
Is acting what you want to work on?

905
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,159
Mom.

906
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,280
I've thought about it.

907
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,319
I wasn't sure at first.

908
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,640
But

909
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,759
after going through so much

910
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,640
with Mr. Lu, Tang Xin,
and everyone else,

911
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,480
I've affirmed my decision.

912
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,840
Mom.

913
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,560
For the first time

914
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,400
in my life,

915
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,279
I want to do this right so badly.

916
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,319
I hope

917
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,120
you guys can support me.

918
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,520
Of course.

919
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,040
Of course we have your back.

920
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,199
Whatever my baby

921
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,799
wants to do,

922
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,120
your father and I will always
have your back.

923
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,120
Have some water.

924
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,360
I don't want to.

925
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,520
Still unwell?

926
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,280
Lie down.

927
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,120
It's uncomfortable.

928
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,039
Where hurts?

929
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,240
Everywhere.

930
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,919
Here.

931
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,080
There.

932
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,000
I just don't want water all of a sudden.

933
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,560
What would you want to drink?
I'll get it for you.

934
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,120
I want...

935
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,080
I want...

936
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,640
I want...

937
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,560
I want booze.

938
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,999
You're unwell.

939
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,120
No booze.

940
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,799
My whole body hurts.

941
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,759
If I don't have booze,

942
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,120
how am I supposed to numb
my pain receptors?

943
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,120
It hurts?

944
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,639
Where?

945
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,920
Everywhere.

946
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,920
Let me see.

947
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:21,520
Let me see.

948
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,920
Does it hurt?

949
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,000
Yes.

950
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,239
Here?

951
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:28,999
Yes.

952
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,599
And here?

953
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,560
Yes.

954
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,799
What about here?

955
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,760
Yes to that too.

956
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,640
Why does it hurt everywhere?

957
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,800
Are you messing around?

958
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:40,799
You're so childish.

959
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,640
I'm going now.

960
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,599
Earlier, you were crying

961
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,040
about going out with me.

962
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
And now you call me childish.

963
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,440
I...

964
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,279
That was a special situation.

965
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,440
Besides, I did not cry.

966
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,039
Are you having your water?

967
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,240
If you're not, I'm leaving.

968
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,440
Feed me.

969
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,159
You can feed yourself.

970
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,400
Do it yourself.

971
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,159
I pulled a muscle earlier.

972
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,319
You know how heavy Liu Yang is.

973
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,079
To save him,

974
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:20,799
my arm

975
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,120
still hurts now.

976
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,319
I don't care.

977
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,320
You're feeding me.

978
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,400
The water's buoyant.

979
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,679
If you've picked him up on ground,

980
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,480
I'd believe that you're hurt.

981
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:33,719
You're holding me strong.

982
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,840
I don't believe you're hurt.

983
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,600
Sorry.

984
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,160
I shouldn't have lied.

985
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,840
I just

986
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,120
thought I could
be closer to you if I leaned.

987
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,080
Mr. Tang.

988
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,839
I never realized

989
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:09,640
you were such a smooth talker.

990
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,799
Because I'm talented

991
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,040
in everything.

992
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,120
Anything I want to do,

993
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,840
I can do it well.

994
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,560
You're confident, Mr. Tang.
