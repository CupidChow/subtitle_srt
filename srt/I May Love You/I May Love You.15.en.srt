00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,160
(when they're right before us?)

26
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,620
(It feels like we need
to step back for a fresh perspective.)

27
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:57,040
(Tang Yu, I may not
fully understand this feeling)

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040

30
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,540
Mr. Tang.

31
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,220
What are you doing?

32
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,380
Nothing.

33
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,780
I want to reclaim the copyright
for the piece I just wrote.

34
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,150
Didn't I already purchased
the copyright for it?

35
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,100
I just rejected it.

36
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,540
I was actually referring

37
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,220
to another piece.

38
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,060
(Lin Zhengxu)

39
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,020
You're so eager to get it.

40
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:37,580
Tang Yu.

41
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,220
- I'm throwing it away.
- I... Please, don't.

42
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,740
Does it hurt?

43
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,820
Did I touch on your wound?

44
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,000
You care about me that much?

45
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,950
Didn't you promise not to affect us?

46
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,940
You are now hindering us.

47
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,140
Am I?

48
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,260
Don't you think?

49
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,460
I guess

50
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,450
I'll have to move in for work
tomorrow officially.

51
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,300
Let's eat.

52
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,380
Tang Xin, stop standing around.

53
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,260
Join us for lunch.

54
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:16,900
Sure.

55
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,900
Mr. Tang, we only ordered
three sets of lunch.

56
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,100
We didn't know you were coming.

57
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,780
Your portion is on its way

58
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,900
and will be here shortly.

59
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,740
We'll eat first.

60
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,300
Sure, no problem.

61
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,100
I'm not hungry.

62
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,010
You guys just go ahead.

63
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,740
It's fine.

64
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,740
Alright.

65
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,340
Skipping lunch is not an option.

66
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:47,660
Come on, have a little.

67
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,540
No, thanks.

68
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,020
I'm really not hungry.
You guys go ahead.

69
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,080
You go first, no worries.

70
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,780
It's fine, really.

71
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,500
You go ahead.

72
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,180
It's fine.

73
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,140
You should eat.

74
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,180
- I'm really not hungry.
- Please go ahead.

75
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,080
Take your chopsticks.

76
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,500
Come on.

77
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,820
I'm really not hungry.

78
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,850
Eat it, or you won't
have the strength.

79
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,140
I've already picked out
the peppercorns.

80
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,250
Here are the chopsticks.

81
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:04,900
Eat up.

82
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,500
Hey.

83
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,620
Mr. Feng.

84
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,460
Grab a bite.

85
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:15,780
She's a picky eater.

86
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,540
She dislikes peppercorns, cilantro,

87
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,660
sponge gourd,

88
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,460
and carrots.

89
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,260
However, adding extra meat

90
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,980
will make her happy.

91
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,380
It seems you don't see

92
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,520
any positive qualities in me?

93
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,740
It's just a matter
of personal preference.

94
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,920
I didn't say you're not good.

95
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,420
So, you think I'm unreasonable,

96
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,000
hard to talk to, tend to bring up
past issues and enjoy drinking.

97
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,140
I wasn't talking about you.

98
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,100
Then just consider me
being presumptuous.

99
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:47,740
Let's eat.

100
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,460
What's going on?

101
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,280
Haven't you seen the gossip?

102
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,020
What gossip?

103
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,420
What gossip?

104
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,820
What gossip?

105
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:03,700
Let's eat.

106
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,100
You talk a lot, even while eating.

107
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,620
Let's eat.

108
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,820
You managed public opinion well

109
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,740
in the past.

110
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,530
What's going on this time?

111
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,900
I wouldn't have known
about the current situation

112
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,720
if Feng Cheng
hadn't mentioned it yesterday.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,850
Mr. Tang, it's not
that I'm not controlling it.

114
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,550
First, the contingency plan
didn't yield the expected results.

115
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,620
The evidence you left behind
is too compelling.

116
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,580
Evidence?

117
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,900
What's the compelling evidence?

118
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,180
It was just after finishing work,

119
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,780
I checked in at the same hotel

120
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,020
as Lu Chuning.

121
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,020
Mr. Tang.

122
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,580
I certainly believe in your inte...

123
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,660
I believe you're innocent

124
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,210
and must have some confidential matters
to discuss with Lu Chuning.

125
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,660
Yet, the gossipers are unaware of this.

126
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,750
So, it's understandable
that you're being misunderstood.

127
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,380
Additionally, Mr. Huo gave some advice

128
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,410
on handling the situation.

129
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,900
He mentioned that creating buzz

130
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,420
would positively impact the box office

131
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,540
for the upcoming films.

132
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,460
Hence, it might be worth taking advantage
of this chance

133
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,360
if you're not strongly opposed to it.

134
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,540
Gao Heng, let me ask you.

135
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,300
Are you my assistant

136
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,980
or Huo Chendong's assistant?

137
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,750
I got you, Mr. Tang.

138
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,660
I'll go to the PR department
for an urgent meeting to handle this.

139
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,460
I'm not finished.

140
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,020
I'm willing to clarify it

141
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,780
through press conferences

142
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,300
or interviews.

143
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,300
I'm willing to cooperate

144
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,640
if it can clear up the misunderstanding.

145
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,580
Now go.

146
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,780
Roger that.

147
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,940
Did she misunderstand me?

148
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,940
If you don't find anything
you like here,

149
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,460
check out these new collections

150
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,620
we designed

151
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,340
for this year.

152
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,780
You can try them on.

153
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,780
Do you have anything more vibrant?

154
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,280
Something more vibrant?

155
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,860
Apparels in this row are very vibrant.

156
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,700
Do you like this?

157
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,460
This one might suit your style.

158
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,860
This is not bad.

159
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,690
Alright, I'll take a look myself.

160
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,700
You go on with your work.

161
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,780
I'll get you if I need you.

162
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,220
Sure, no problem.

163
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,220
Just let me know
if you like.

164
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,030
You can try them on.

165
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,260
Why are you so upset?

166
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,060
I feel that Tang Yu and Lu Chuning

167
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,700
look quite compatible

168
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,580
when they're together.

169
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,290
No matter how impressive Lu Chuning is,

170
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,580
Tang Yu is pursuing you.

171
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,420
He rejected me, too.

172
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,020
Excuse me.

173
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,240
No photography is allowed here.

174
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,740
I didn't know.

175
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,050
I am buying for a friend.

176
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,910
I just wanted to let her see
if she likes.

177
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,860
I've changed my mind.

178
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:55,700
Please leave.

179
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,660
Does anyone run a business like this?

180
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,380
Are you here to buy clothes?

181
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,980
You've been here for ten minutes

182
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,780
and repeatedly checking
these clothes.

183
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,060
I'm sure you've taken pictures
of other clothes, huh?

184
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,420
What am I here for

185
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,450
if I'm not to buy clothes?

186
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,700
Besides,

187
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,260
it's an honor for you

188
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,340
to have me come in here.

189
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,900
Then pay up.

190
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,860
If you pay,

191
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,860
we'll believe you're here
to buy clothes.

192
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:21,980
How much is it?

193
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,260
Thank you. Please come again.

194
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,440
What did she come for
if she was not here to buy any clothes?

195
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,980
To steal designs.

196
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,660
Don't you know her intention?

197
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,740
You were so sharp just now.

198
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,620
I was following our understanding
built over the years

199
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,180
and going along with what you said.

200
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,980
If she was here to steal designs,

201
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:54,350
wouldn't it be worse if she bought them?

202
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,340
What should we do then?

203
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,420
Stop doing business?

204
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,700
Well,

205
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,380
it's tough for young designers

206
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,380
to succeed.

207
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,760
(Lu Studio)

208
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,940
Come over here.

209
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:15,820
Good morning.

210
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:17,860
Place it here.

211
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,780
Hurry up.

212
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,140
Be careful when you take it.

213
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:21,900
No.

214
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,580
- Mr. Gao.
- Arrange it neatly.

215
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,700
Mr. Gao.

216
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,180
Just a week past.

217
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:27,820
He has already moved his tea set,

218
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,020
office desk and filing cabinet

219
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,260
into here.

220
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,380
He even bought tons of vases.

221
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,140
Is he treating Mr. Lu's studio

222
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,740
as his own office?

223
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,540
Well, he has to work here

224
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,940
this week, right?

225
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,260
Please take this.
I have more items.

226
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,700
I...

227
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,220
Sure.

228
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:42,020
Mr. Gao.

229
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:42,780
Mr. Tang.

230
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,260
Carry on.

231
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,700
That's great.

232
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,300
Okay.

233
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,300
See you this weekend.

234
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,610
Please bring Director Bao along.

235
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,860
Morning.

236
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,020
Mr. Tang.

237
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,460
Are you planning

238
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,180
to work here for long?

239
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,460
It would be more convenient
for me to meet you.

240
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,460
You're pretty straightforward, huh?

241
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,220
Since I plan to pursue you,

242
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,460
should I not show my determination?

243
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,860
What determination?

244
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:19,940
To be wasteful?

245
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,940
I don't have time for the flowers.

246
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,060
They will soon wilt.

247
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,620
The flowers?

248
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,460
You don't have to worry about them.

249
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,500
I can take care of them.

250
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,290
My mother studied flower arrangement

251
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,740
after retiring.

252
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,260
Her passion for it rubbed off on me.

253
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,740
As a result,

254
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,120
I have some knowledge in this area.

255
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,100
Rest assured. I'll provide proper care

256
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:39,980
for all the flowers,

257
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,580
even if there are many.

258
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,460
Provide proper care...

259
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,220
If the main character in this scene

260
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,420
has professional skiing skills,

261
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,460
we'll need technical guidance
from a professional.

262
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,740
However,

263
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:05,180
I don't have any connections
in this industry.

264
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,300
I can help.

265
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,180
I'm a certified
Level 3 CASI snowboarder.

266
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,300
Please help us out, Mr. Tang.

267
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,380
No problem.

268
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,460
Lu.

269
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,750
What's the progress of location scouting
we discussed last time?

270
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:23,450
About the location scouting,
I've tasked Gao Heng to arrange it.

271
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,420
You can visit whenever you need to.

272
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,060
I have another question.

273
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,020
This movie involves a few roles

274
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,380
specialize in private equity.

275
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,980
Although their lines are limited,

276
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,820
I think it's best to have guidance
from a professional.

277
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,500
I have a project here that may involve

278
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,260
some knowledge related
to private equity.

279
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,180
I'll share your WeChat
to our screenwriter.

280
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,420
It's settled.

281
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,260
You truly deserve to make money.

282
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,660
Let me know once you have made contact.

283
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:18,140
Okay.

284
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,320
Mr. Tang, hot coffee for you.

285
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,420
You get on.

286
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,060
Why not take a break
as you've just finished a meeting?

287
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,820
Thanks, Mr. Tang.

288
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,860
I'm just seizing the good momentum.

289
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,220
Aren't you busy, Mr. Tang?

290
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,620
Tang Xin, I think

291
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,220
I might know

292
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,580
what's making you unhappy lately.

293
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,980
I'm all ears.

294
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,500
Is it because

295
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,100
of the rumors between me and Lu Chuning?

296
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,180
Who would care about that?

297
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,380
Mr. Tang, you've been
acting strange lately.

298
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,820
Why do you always overthink?

299
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,940
So, it's not because of that.

300
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,220
Of course not.

301
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,500
Are you sure?

302
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,460
Good coffee.

303
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,540
Thanks, Mr. Tang.

304
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,750
I don't have
any other schedules today, do I?

305
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,210
You have to meet Mr. Lu.

306
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,260
Mr. Tang, they're having meeting
about script today.

307
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,540
Should we join?

308
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,260
No, but we'll

309
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,300
fetch someone.

310
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,500
Anyway, the character issues
aren't that significant.

311
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,980
You can have a look yourself.

312
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,180
Is he Mr. Tang's competitor?

313
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,380
No.

314
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,340
A fellow-townsman.

315
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,340
Sure.

316
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,220
Call me for any issues

317
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,900
with the script.

318
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,580
- Sure.
- Bye.

319
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,380
Bye.

320
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,580
Why didn't you
give me a heads up before coming?

321
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,780
I was in the neighborhood for errands
and thought of you,

322
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,620
so I dropped by.

323
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,700
Shall we grab a meal?

324
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,060
Mr. Tang.

325
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,980
Why is it so hard
to get a parking spot today?

326
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:25,780
Mr. Tang.

327
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,180
Isn't that Miss Tang Xin?

328
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,220
Thanks.

329
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,300
You can take a seat now.

330
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:45,940
Sure.

331
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:46,980
I'll hold it first.

332
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,980
I thought you wouldn't see me anymore.

333
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,780
You're not going
to reject me now, are you?

334
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,300
I've come all the way here.

335
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,940
Let's have a meal at least.

336
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,700
You might feel suffer losses

337
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,700
after the meal,

338
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,300
so I think it's best

339
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,550
that I make it clear to you now.

340
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,420
Whatever.

341
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,500
I don't mind anymore.

342
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,700
I'll consider it as having a meal

343
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,940
with a fellow-townsman.

344
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,460
Can I take the bill?

345
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,660
Sure.

346
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,020
Have a seat.

347
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,220
Thanks.

348
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,500
Thank you.

349
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,340
Erm.

350
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,580
Sorry. I'll have to take a call.

351
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,020
Sure.

352
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:01,620
Hello?

353
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,700
(Where are you?)

354
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,460
I'm eating.

355
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,140
(With whom?)

356
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,740
Why are you so nosy?

357
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,820
Talk to you later.

358
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,540
Water for you.

359
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,260
Thanks.

360
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,140
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

361
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,420
Someone checking on you?

362
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,500
You can tell, can't you?

363
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,140
I like someone else.

364
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,060
So...

365
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:37,140
Is it Tang Yu from Time Pictures?

366
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,140
How did you know?

367
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,820
Actually, the three of us met that day.

368
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,580
The day we went for a movie.

369
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,620
Although he isn't a celebrity or star,

370
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,260
I know what he looks like.

371
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,420
Let me be honest with you.

372
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,620
I like him.

373
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,380
He's currently pursuing me as well.

374
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,580
I'm just

375
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,380
not sure how to get along with him.

376
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,580
You know, since young,

377
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,540
I never liked losing.

378
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,940
I don't want you

379
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,570
to lose out, so I'm giving you
a heads up.

380
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,460
I finally mustered the courage
to confess

381
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,740
but ended up getting my heart broken.

382
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,460
Heart broken?

383
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,700
That's not considered a heartbreak.

384
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,100
We never even started.

385
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,420
You're funny.

386
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,740
Have you ordered?

387
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,140
Not yet.

388
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,380
I was just about to ask
what you'd like to eat.

389
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,740
Anything is fine for me.

390
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,420
You can decide.

391
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,300
Sure.

392
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,380
I'll get going now.

393
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,580
Tang Xin.

394
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,740
Take these flowers with you.

395
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,140
They were prepared for you anyway.

396
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,700
Alright.

397
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,060
Nice to meet you.

398
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,240
Nice to meet you, Mr. Tang.

399
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,350
I've heard a lot about you.

400
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,300
You're flattering me.

401
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,900
Weren't you too harsh on me?

402
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,580
It hasn't healed even after a week.

403
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,850
We'll get going now.

404
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,580
Bye.

405
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,260
Let's go.

406
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:47,860
Mr...

407
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:53,820
Do you

408
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,900
like him?

409
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,980
Even he could tell that I like you.

410
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,540
But

411
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,780
I have no intention of dating you.

412
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,660
Tang Yu.

413
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,380
I used to really like you.

414
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,300
Even calling your name made me happy,

415
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,140
though you didn't like me then.

416
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:28,300
But when you suddenly
confessed to me,

417
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:30,500
I forgot

418
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,300
how I used to be around you.

419
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:38,900
Did you know?

420
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,260
After you rejected my confession,

421
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,180
I never expected you would pursue me.

422
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,900
I thought you might have done it
in the heat of the moment.

423
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,660
I even felt insulted.

424
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,020
Do you understand that feeling?

425
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,980
It isn't a heat-of-the-moment thing.

426
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,780
I just never realized it before.

427
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,060
Did you know, Tang Xin?

428
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,220
You're special.

429
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,940
You're different from others.

430
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,460
Before I realized,

431
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,780
how and why

432
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,060
you were different,

433
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,180
you forced me

434
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,020
into a kiss,

435
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,540
left with the copyright,

436
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,980
and even resigned.

437
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,980
I admit this series of actions

438
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,900
impacted me greatly,

439
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,260
but these are not

440
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,540
the reasons for me to pursue you.

441
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,700
Did you know, Tang Xin?

442
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,620
I wish I could beat the previous me up

443
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,780
for saying that we weren't compatible.

444
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,900
I take time to warm up to someone.

445
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,260
So maybe if you wait for a few months,

446
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,350
it'd be me to confess to you first.

447
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,940
So, now we can take our time.

448
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,060
Just be yourself.

449
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,780
You needn't change anything.

450
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,940
I'll take the initiative this time.

451
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,660
I'll accommodate you.

452
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:24,860
Is that okay?

453
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,020
Today,

454
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,640
that half-hour hasn't been used yet.

455
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:00,150
You really don't miss any opportunity
to take advantage.

456
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,620
Thank you.

457
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,020
Well, feel free.

458
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,780
I still have work.

459
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,060
Leave when the time is up.

460
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:34,940
Okay.

461
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,060
(So, now we can take our time.)

462
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,260
(Just be yourself.)

463
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,960
(You needn't change anything.)

464
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,040
(I'll take the initiative this time.)

465
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,300
(I'll accommodate you.)

466
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,700
(Is that okay?)

467
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,140
What's the silence about?

468
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,100
It's been half an hour already?

469
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,500
Well then, I'm going back.

470
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,650
I'll walk you to the door.

471
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,260
Tang Xin.

472
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,460
Shall we consider extending

473
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,060
the time a little?

474
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,540
In that case,

475
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,720
I'll give you one more minute.

476
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,700
One minute?

477
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,580
That's not enough.

478
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,340
Never mind then.

479
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,500
Forget about it.

480
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,340
One minute?

481
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:03,180
Fine.

482
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,540
One minute

483
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,020
isn't even enough for a kiss, right?

484
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,620
Just go back to your place.

485
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,540
(Did he really say that?)

486
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,700
He said if it were a few months later,

487
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,260
maybe he'd confess to me first.

488
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,020
If you put it that way,

489
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,660
I might think better

490
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,740
of Tang Yu.

491
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,180
He's straightforward.

492
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,220
(Also, people who take time to open up)

493
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,710
(usually have fewer ulterior motives.)

494
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:58,780
Indeed, there's little gossip about him,

495
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,940
except that he's always in the news

496
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:01,820
with Lu Chuning.

497
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,460
Look at you.

498
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,860
You care a lot about this,

499
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,500
but whenever this topic is brought up,

500
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,260
you act like it's none of your business.

501
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,580
(No wonder you're at a loss.)

502
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,060
Well, I can't make him think

503
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,650
that I'm jealous
about everything, right?

504
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,780
(Okay, I'm almost there.)

505
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,980
(Let's talk when we meet.)

506
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,220
- Okay.
- Who's the boss?

507
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,060
You own this place, right?

508
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,850
You're the one we're looking for.

509
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:27,980
(Huan.)

510
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,500
Huan, what's going on?

511
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,360
I'm telling you,
if you don't refund the money today,

512
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,020
believe it or not,
I'll smash up this place.

513
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,440
Huan, what's happening?

514
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,260
What's happening?

515
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:52,860
We spent so much money

516
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:53,780
for such poor quality.

517
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,100
Why can't we get a refund?

518
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,460
Is this a defect?

519
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:57,980
It seems to me

520
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,340
that you tampered with it yourself.

521
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,820
Now you're returning it
after stealing our design.

522
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,540
Refusing to even pay
for the sample, huh?

523
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,340
You guys are shameless.

524
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,500
Do you think you can bully us?

525
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,640
I'm not taking your nonsense.

526
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,480
I'm telling you,

527
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,940
you'll refund the money today
no matter what.

528
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,460
Aren't you just a new designer?

529
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,260
You've only hit it big
in the past two years.

530
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,500
Let's see how you'll fare

531
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,900
if this becomes public.

532
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,540
Hurry up. Or I'll smash up this place.

533
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,820
- Refund the money!
- Stop yelling.

534
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,160
- Refund now!
- Come, let's take a look.

535
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,300
Stop recording!

536
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,340
They've ripped us off.

537
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,960
If you keep doing this,
I'll call the police.

538
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,140
I'll see how you get out of this.

539
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,820
- What are you doing?
- Don't touch her!

540
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,740
You Huan.

541
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,620
What are you doing?

542
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,260
Let go of me!

543
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,780
You can't touch these.

544
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:33,580
Stop...

545
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,540
That's enough! Stop it.

546
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,620
Let go.

547
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,220
Stop it now.

548
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,020
Stop it!

549
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,500
Stop! What are you doing?

550
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,540
Don't throw it.

551
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,060
Stop...

552
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,380
Stop it.

553
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,420
Stop smashing.

554
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,300
Enough! Stop it!

555
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,060
What are you doing?

556
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:13,900
Tang Xin.

557
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:14,980
Are you okay?

558
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,540
Are you hurt?

559
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,060
Serves you right

560
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,340
for talking tough.

561
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,580
Are you guys insane?

562
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:21,250
Get out of here.

563
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:21,900
Go away!

564
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:22,680
Get out, all of you.

565
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,780
How dare you get mad at us!

566
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,660
Is it not enough yet?

567
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,580
Get her.

568
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,740
Stop!

569
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,260
Will you refund or not?

570
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:28,900
I'll refund.

571
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,360
I'll refund the money, okay?

572
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,100
No, we can't.

573
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,500
If we do it, it'd be our fault.

574
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,100
What are you doing?

575
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,220
What did you say?

576
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:42,580
No refund, huh?

577
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,500
Then I'll make you do it.

578
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:08,740
Tang Xin.

579
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,540
I've never been slapped
in the face before.

580
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,100
Give me a minute.

581
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,260
Call the police.

582
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,250
I'll leave this to you.

583
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:55,820
Are you okay?

584
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,940
You hit really hard.

585
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,540
You won't suffer a loss, right?

586
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,050
So, I fixed them for you.

602
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,900
What did the doctor say?

603
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:08,860
It's okay.

604
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,460
The doctor said my bones are fine.

605
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,620
It'll heal with some rest.

606
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,940
Good thing that no bones were broken.

607
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,140
Still not feeling well?

608
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,380
I still feel a bit dizzy.

609
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,180
Here, sit down for a moment.

610
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:27,580
Slowly.

611
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:33,900
Madam.

612
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,700
She said she still feels a bit dizzy.

613
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,300
Does she need to be hospitalized?

614
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,100
No need.

615
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,940
She's fine.

616
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,300
Her dizziness is from hypoglycemia
due to her agitation.

617
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,100
She may go after get some glucose.

618
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,820
Hypoglycemia?

619
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,100
Will the glucose work?

620
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,200
I know you're worried
about your girlfriend,

621
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,100
but you should listen to the doctor.

622
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,420
I'll write a prescription.

623
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,540
Come get it later

624
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,860
and take her to get an infusion.

625
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,740
Okay. Thank you for that.

626
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,540
You're welcome.

627
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,700
How embarrassing.

628
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,920
Is it embarrassing to be my girlfriend?

629
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:17,980
No.

630
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,660
I mean...

631
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,460
I've never been this embarrassed
in my life.

632
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,980
And you saw it.

633
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,060
It's okay.

634
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,380
Now I like you even more.

635
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:40,940
Come on.

636
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,820
Let me see your hand.

637
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:42,620
By the way,

638
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,260
why you got there?

639
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,140
I called you.

640
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:46,980
You Huan answered.

641
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,380
Mr. Tang.

642
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,340
Should we head to Mr. Lu's studio?

643
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,340
But

644
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,740
if we go now,

645
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,900
won't it be too late?

646
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,300
Their meeting could have ended by now.

647
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,020
That'll be none
of your concern, Mr. Gao.

648
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,860
Just drive.

649
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,180
(Hello, Tang Yu.)

650
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:23,580
Hi.

651
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,580
Is the meeting over?

652
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,500
Come here quickly.

653
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,060
Now!

654
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,540
Gao Heng, head to You Huan's studio.

655
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,420
Okay.

656
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,220
It's okay.

657
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,820
It's all in the past.

658
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,180
Don't overthink it.

659
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:53,900
Thank you.

660
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:54,540
No worries.

661
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:02,340
My hand got injured.

662
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,540
How am I supposed to write a script?

663
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,260
I can write it for you.

664
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:24,940
Tell me.

665
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,220
I'll do the typing.

666
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,180
I can't afford to hire you.

667
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,020
I won't charge you.

668
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,480
Is it still painful?

669
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:52,740
Not anymore.

670
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,420
I took the painkillers.

671
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,580
Was it painful

672
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:00,900
when I rejected you?

673
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,750
It hurt a bit more than a broken hand.

674
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:15,970
After all, it was a heartbreak.

675
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,340
Even painkillers won't help.

676
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,150
Are you still dizzy?

677
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,950
Close your eyes.

678
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:31,740
Take a nap.

679
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,220
This fairy-tale love

680
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:11,900
is truly enviable.

681
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,420
You're right.

682
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,220
It's like watching a romantic drama.

683
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,990
Even night shifts turned sweet.

684
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:54,940
You're here.

685
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:55,940
Mr. Tang.

686
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,820
You should go back and rest first.

687
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,380
I'll stay here.

688
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:00,540
It's okay.

689
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,460
Those people this afternoon...

690
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,220
None is missing.

691
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,220
All reported to the police station.

692
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,840
Miss You Huan is doing well too.

693
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,140
I've already sent her home.

694
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,260
The lawyer is handling it
at the police station.

695
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,020
They need your cooperation
and Miss Tang's

696
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,220
for follow-up procedures.

697
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,100
Okay.

698
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,620
Don't worry.

699
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:17,380
Well done.

700
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:18,980
It's getting late.

701
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:19,640
Go back earlier.

702
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:20,900
Well.

703
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,750
Call me anytime for assistance.

704
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,420
Sure.

705
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,740
I fought for you.

706
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:26,820
Is it too much

707
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:27,860
for a kiss?

708
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,260
Does it hurt?

709
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,660
I bought these for you.

710
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,820
This glove

711
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,980
is the most important one.

712
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,780
Wear it when you take a shower.

713
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,860
It's waterproof.

714
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,180
Thank you.

715
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,340
You're really thoughtful.

716
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,020
How can we not be thoughtful?

717
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,340
Look at your hand.

718
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,260
It's really terrifying.

719
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,620
I'm scared just thinking about it.

720
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,260
If your parents see this,

721
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,740
they'll definitely be worried.

722
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,340
Let me tell you.

723
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,180
I plan to tell my parents

724
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,140
I'm staying with you.

725
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,340
Don't spill the truth.

726
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,500
Otherwise,
they'll video call me constantly.

727
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,540
It's easy to get caught.

728
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:29,420
No.

729
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,340
I'll just

730
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,500
call my parents first.

731
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,620
It's broken. Now what?

732
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:42,340
Tang Xin.

733
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,380
You're all here.

734
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,340
Yu.

735
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,180
I've uploaded the data.

736
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,220
You can use it.

737
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:55,540
Dingding.

738
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,340
I can buy one myself.

739
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,250
I won't take yours.

740
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:10,980
You can buy one.

741
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,350
And I can give you one.

742
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,060
You guys chat.

743
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,140
I have a conference call.

744
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,380
I'll come after I'm done.

745
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,220
Let me tell you.

746
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,860
If you meet such a situation again,

747
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,580
don't ever step forward.

748
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,820
Even if they wreck my store,

749
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,210
it's still better than hurting you.

750
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,100
Just now, at the elevator.

751
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,220
Mr. Tang

752
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,260
glared at me fiercely several times.

753
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,620
Are you sure you didn't misinterpret?

754
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,060
Even if I did, he was not wrong.

755
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:47,860
I do need to sincerely apologize to you.

756
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,820
This incident

757
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,700
originated from me.

758
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:52,340
But you're the one suffering.

759
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,620
We're all best friends.

760
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,810
Why are you being so dramatic?

761
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,460
You said You Huan is being dramatic.

762
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,020
Aren't you being dramatic too?

763
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,020
I'm not like that.

764
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,660
Why do you

765
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,660
act like you're rejecting Yu again?

766
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,500
Why does everything you say
link back to Yu?

767
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,140
Designer You.

768
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:16,740
You used to tell me about plagiarism.

769
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,680
Things about plagiarism.

770
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,450
This was the first time I've seen
the actions of these people.

771
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,650
They were unexpectedly despicable.

772
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,620
Not only did they take your hard work,

773
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,960
but they also slandered you.

774
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,860
Which industry
lacks vicious competition?

775
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,250
A young screenwriter is hard to shine.

776
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,100
The same goes for me
as a young designer.

777
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:37,460
Plagiarism.

778
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,340
Why don't you sue them?

779
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,820
Make them compensate
and publicly apologize.

780
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,460
It's not that easy.

781
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:45,460
In fact,

782
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,860
many renowned brands nowadays

783
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,780
engage in plagiarism.

784
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,340
But once they are discovered,

785
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,700
they remove the products.

786
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:54,220
They even assert that original brands
can pursue legal action.

787
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,180
Aren't they relying on the difficulty

788
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,580
in defining plagiarism
and pursuing legal action?

789
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,100
Major brands

790
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,320
don't bother arguing with them.

791
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,180
As a young designer,

792
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,060
I lack fame

793
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,780
and background.

794
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,020
I can't compete with them.

795
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:11,820
It's Yu.

796
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,980
I'll go get the door.

797
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,260
Why are you here?

798
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,820
Isn't that to represent Time Pictures

799
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,100
and extend condolences?

800
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,980
But Yu is here.

801
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:28,740
Why are you representing Time Pictures?

802
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:30,900
I'm representing myself.

803
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,780
Is that okay?

804
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,780
How are you, Tang Xin?

805
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,840
Are you seriously injured?

806
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:35,620
I'm fine.

807
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,820
No tendon or bone harm.

808
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,860
I've checked it.

809
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,000
Those who stole the designs
are habitual offenders.

810
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,810
Mr. Tang has told me
to hire a good lawyer.

811
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,500
You can absolutely rest assured.

812
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,740
We can afford to handle this.

813
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,020
We'll teach them a good lesson.

814
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:51,860
Thank you.

815
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:53,860
No worries.

816
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:54,860
There's no rush

817
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,780
for the script.

818
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,140
If you're not well,

819
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,420
let's postpone it by two weeks.

820
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,220
No big impact.

821
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,100
No pressure.

822
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:01,300
Wow.

823
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:03,020
Mr. Lu.

824
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:04,340
You're so good.

825
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,620
Tang Xin.

826
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,380
This is a golden holiday
gifted to you by fate.

827
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:09,140
Let's

828
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:09,900
have a blast.

829
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,820
Have a blast.

830
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,220
Having a blast is allowed,

831
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,620
but I still have to write my script.

832
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,340
Do you think it's really a holiday

833
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,210
when the boss says so?

834
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,540
I didn't expect you

835
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,300
to collaborate with Tang Yu again.

836
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,100
Everyone is happy now.

837
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,520
- Yes.
- How you came here?

838
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,740
Let's carpool if you didn't drive.

839
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,580
I'll leave first.

840
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,180
I didn't drive.

841
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,340
- It's okay.
- Bye.

842
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,380
You go first.

843
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,320
Then I'll leave first.

844
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,380
Mr. Lu.

845
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:44,860
What's wrong, Dingding?

846
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,620
Are you pursuing Tang Xin?

847
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:51,900
Who told you that?

848
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,100
No one. I noticed it.

849
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,260
Yu finally likes someone so much.

850
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:57,510
Will you compete with him?

851
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,780
I, too, finally like someone so much.

852
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:01,980
