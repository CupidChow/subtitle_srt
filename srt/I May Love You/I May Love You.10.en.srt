00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,500
(Adapted from Mo Yanchuan's novel
"I May Love You")

00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,260
=Episode 10=

22
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,000
(I Have a Secret)

23
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,640
(Tyrant's Diary)

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,580
(Tang Yu seems to be overly confident)

25
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,040
(that he'll get first dibs.)

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,800
(He might have forgotten I was his ally
while he pursued Ming Zhu.)

27
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,500
(Perhaps love has a knack
for turning folks into nitpickers.)

28
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,780
Who's there?

29
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,080
Are you awake?

30
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,820
Tang Yu.

31
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,220
What are you doing in my house?

32
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:25,729
Hey.

33
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,270
Don't come in.

34
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,880
Come out for breakfast if you're up.

35
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,680
Okay,

36
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,470
I'm coming.

37
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:38,750
I...

38
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,360
Why am I still wearing
yesterday's clothes?

39
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,440
I can't go out like this to see him.

40
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,889
(Huan: Tang Yu sent you
home last night.)

41
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,160
(Text me when you wake up, okay?)

42
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:04,960
(Rich Lady: It's a long story.)

43
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:28,440
Were you here all night?

44
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:33,360
Don't you remember?

45
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,520
I remember you took me home,

46
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,939
but didn't you have to go back

47
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,219
after dropping me off?

48
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,390
Why are you still here?

49
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,640
Don't tell me you snuck back in

50
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,240
after figuring out my door password
while I drank last night.

51
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,990
I don't know your door password.

52
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,689
You changed clothes

53
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,830
but still deny it?

54
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:08,990
Look at the time,

55
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,110
you should eat now.

56
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,609
Yesterday, you mentioned

57
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:27,430
that you had a secret to share.

58
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,120
What's that secret?

59
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,560
A secret?

60
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,960
Did I?

61
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,150
I can't remember.

62
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,080
Fine, let's forget about it.

63
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,000
You really think
this is your home, don't you?

64
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,190
Why are you still hanging around here?

65
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,710
I'll leave
after you finish your breakfast.

66
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:58,430
Did you remove my makeup?

67
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,409
That's so unexpected.

68
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,520
It seems like you have much experience.

69
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,630
Dingding told me

70
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:06,289
that if a girl doesn't remove makeup,

71
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,280
it can damage the skin.

72
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,800
Ask her if you don't believe me.

73
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,240
Having a sister can be
a good excuse for anything, huh?

74
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:24,910
I pursued Ming Zhu due to family pressure,
as they urged me to find a girlfriend.

75
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:28,560
Coincidentally, Huo Chendong thought
we are a good match.

76
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,750
I admit that I pursued her

77
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,169
and even asked for your assistance.

78
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,680
I apologize for my action

79
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,150
that have hurt you.

80
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,590
After this experience, I've learned

81
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,150
that being suitable and being in love
are not the same.

82
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,099
I wasn't upset

83
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,360
about Ming Zhu's marriage,

84
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:46,280
but it bothered me greatly

85
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,590
when you left Time Pictures

86
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,000
and me for someone else.

87
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,910
Why are you explaining this
to me all of a sudden?

88
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,560
Talk to me if anything bothers you

89
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,430
in the future.

90
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,560
I promise to be honest with you.

91
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,520
I'll be heading out soon.

92
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,190
You should go now.

93
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,030
Eat more.

94
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,430
By the way,

95
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,150
are you really planning
to exclude me from your movie?

96
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,590
This is your debut movie,

97
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,030
and I

98
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,560
want to be involved as a producer

99
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,400
or in any other role.

100
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,960
I want to be part of it.

101
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,470
This was Mr. Lu's decision.

102
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:56,280
As a screenwriter,

103
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,800
my sole responsibility
is to focus on the script.

104
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,240
I got it.

105
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,400
I'll reach out to Mr. Lu again.

106
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,870
Oh yeah,

107
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,470
it's not safe

108
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,190
to use your birthday

109
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,190
as the door password.

110
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,960
I thought you said
you didn't know the door password.

111
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,680
My door password is your birthday, too.

112
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,430
I suppose we're even now.

113
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:40,870
Jiayi.

114
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,030
Where's Feng?

115
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,430
He's over there.

116
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:44,590
Okay.

117
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,150
Feng.

118
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,539
Getting hooked, aren't you?

119
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,680
Didn't even respond.

120
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,680
Lu.

121
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,240
She's really something.

122
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,329
It's incredible.

123
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,400
She's amazing.

124
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,280
It seems like you and Tang Xin
are working well together.

125
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,169
It was a smart move

126
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,840
to have Tang Xin
as the lead screenwriter this time.

127
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,539
Come on, stop reading it.

128
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,710
I need to tell you something.

129
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,710
Let's go.

130
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,030
She's amazing.

131
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:19,840
Feng.

132
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:22,120
We could have chosen

133
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,409
a more experienced screenwriter
after Wan Li pulled out of the movie.

134
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:25,409
Yet, do you know

135
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,000
why do I insist on using Tang Xin?

136
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:27,870
Why?

137
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,659
I chose her
because of her fresh perspective.

138
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,870
She's like a blank canvas.

139
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,849
Her writing

140
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,849
is free from the constraints

141
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,560
of seasoned professionals like you.

142
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:37,289
Well,

143
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,950
nor I.

144
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,120
Look,

145
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,969
Tang Xin brings a unique
perspective to our projects

146
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,640
when we give her creative freedom.

147
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,019
Besides,

148
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,760
she's someone who truly values her work.

149
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,120
When it comes to this,

150
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,169
I trust only you and her.

151
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,000
Understood.

152
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,070
What I mean is,

153
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,640
let's not restrict her,

154
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,000
and that goes for you too.

155
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,710
Your words don't sound right to me.

156
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,470
I'm just kidding.

157
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,240
To be honest,

158
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,089
I'm quite intrigued to see
what unique ideas

159
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,510
she'll bring it to the table this time.

160
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,950
You know, there are tons of students
under my guidance.

161
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:14,640
She's the most talented among them.

162
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,320
Indeed, she's a quick learner.

163
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,089
Do you know
what's truly invaluable in her?

164
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:18,880
What is it?

165
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,200
She works hard.

166
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,120
You've struck gold with her.

167
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,529
You played a crucial role in this,
didn't you?

168
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:28,440
I wouldn't have met Tang Xin
without your introduction.

169
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:29,950
Right?

170
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,139
Feng.

171
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,440
The script is in great shape now.

172
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,819
Let's take a day off!

173
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,760
Sure!

174
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,880
Let's watch a movie tonight.

175
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,150
Tang Xin.

176
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,070
Mr. Lu.

177
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,649
Sorry

178
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,440
for being late.

179
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,339
It's okay.

180
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,000
I've already placed the order.

181
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,499
(Feng Cheng: I'm not joining.
It's a rare chance.)

182
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,680
(Give it your best shot.)

183
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,320
What's wrong?

184
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,510
Feng is not coming.

185
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:03,800
He's probably

186
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,320
trying to help me escape my single life

187
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,920
because I've been single for too long.

188
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,920
He attempted to match me
with a great woman like you.

189
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,640
Don't get bothered.

190
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,830
Feng just loves playing matchmaker.

191
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,320
Do you mind
if we watch a movie together?

192
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:18,760
No problem.

193
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,139
Since we bought the movie tickets,

194
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,089
let's not waste them.

195
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:21,729
Great.

196
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,200
Let's eat.

197
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,030
By the way,

198
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,800
Tang Yu still has some concerns.

199
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,510
He suggested meeting in a few days
for further discussion.

200
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:34,969
I know.

201
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:36,200
He's on a business trip today.

202
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,320
How do you know?

203
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,089
(Tang Yu: I'm on a business trip
with Huo Chendong for a few days.)

204
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,270
He's keeping you posted on his trip.

205
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,390
Mr. Lu.

206
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,849
Did Tang Yu never have a relationship

207
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,560
during his college days?

208
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,320
No, he didn't.

209
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,510
Well,

210
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,950
is there any gossips

211
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,950
that is only known among the classmates?

212
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,070
Gossips?

213
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,880
Just with Lu Chuning.

214
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,529
There's no concrete evidence to suggest

215
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,830
that they've been in a relationship.

216
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,510
You should eat.

217
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,390
The movie is good,

218
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,320
but why aren't
the box office picking up?

219
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,139
Hold on.

220
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,200
Look at this.

221
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,320
The ratings

222
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,590
and the online reviews are just average.

223
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,270
Sometimes, the box office success

224
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,640
isn't always a reflection
of the movie's quality.

225
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:49,030
"Cherished Love"
has also gained significant popularity

226
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:51,150
and captured a large share
of the box office.

227
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,320
So,

228
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,510
Tang Yu's plan to shift
towards the female market is wise.

229
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,039
I was thinking

230
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,500
that if it were my own work,

231
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,980
and it didn't receive high views
despite being good,

232
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,220
I would also be disappointed.

233
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,820
In our line of work,

234
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,740
we must have a strong mindset.

235
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,820
Thanks for the treat today, Mr. Lu.

236
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,900
No worries.

237
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,020
Anyway,

238
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,839
remember

239
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,740
to visit the film academy tomorrow.

240
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:25,439
Sure.

241
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,660
I've already informed them.

242
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,900
Let's go.

243
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,319
(To: Rich Lady)

244
00:12:52,320 --> 00:13:00,040
(Tang Yu: I'm going back tomorrow.)

245
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,679
(Dingding: Yu.)

246
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,580
(Shen Fei saw this at the cinema.)

247
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,840
(Good luck, Yu.)

248
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,719
(Time Pictures)

249
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,500
Yu.

250
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,439
I heard that the company
will reinstate artist management again

251
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,620
and it will be led by...

252
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,439
Huo Chendong.

253
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,140
Wouldn't that satisfy his playboy nature?

254
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,300
Tang Yu.

255
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,700
That doesn't concern you.
Get in the car.

256
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,119
Are you

257
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,340
going to the film academy
to watch the audition too?

258
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,820
Yeah. Why not?

259
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,700
I'll help you decide who looks better.

260
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,439
The way you speak now

261
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,740
is becoming more irritable,

262
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,980
much like Sugar Heart.

263
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,820
Go on.

264
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,180
She's available?

265
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,559
Didn't you say

266
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,620
she had a contract with Time Pictures?

267
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,220
It has been coordinated.

268
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,679
That's why I'm giving you a call.

269
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,999
(Let's talk in a few days, then.)

270
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,020
(I can't really free up my schedule now.)

271
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,180
Sure.

272
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,599
Let's have a meal

273
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,799
when you're free, Mr. Lu.

274
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,580
Sure.

275
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,540
What's up?

276
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,860
Zhou Jialu is available now
and is interested in a collaboration.

277
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,919
Are we still

278
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,460
going to the film academy, then?

279
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,140
Of course.

280
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,679
But

281
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,679
I assume that Zhou Jialu

282
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,119
ended her contract with Time Pictures.

283
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,700
That's why she's available.

284
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,279
I don't quite appreciate artists

285
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,980
who lack the spirit of contract.

286
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,460
Let's decide if we really can't
find any suitable candidates.

287
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,039
Tang Xin.

288
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,980
What do you think of Zhou Jialu?

289
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,300
I don't think she's a good candidate.

290
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,999
See that?

291
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,980
I told you Mr. Lu has character.

292
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,260
(Dingding: Is Lu Zhixing pursuing you?)

293
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,300
(Rich Lady: Who told you that?)

294
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,119
(Dingding: Just tell me.)

295
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,660
(Is it true?)

296
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,620
(Why would she suddenly ask?)

297
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,580
(Something is fishy.)

298
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,420
(Rich Lady: Guess.)

299
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,959
(Dingding: No, I won't.)

300
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,780
(I must lobby for my brother.)

301
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,439
(He even moved across from your place.)

302
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,519
(He must really like you for that.)

303
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,559
(He's not fickle,)

304
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,079
(and he's handsome and buff too.)

305
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,380
(Besides, we're rich!)

306
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,399
(Rich Lady: Red packet sent.)

307
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,700
(Kids shouldn't be nosy
about adult matters.)

308
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,460
(Be good.)

309
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,959
Do you think

310
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,420
there were any suitable candidates?

311
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,959
Based on my understanding of Lu,

312
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,820
nope.

313
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,159
But anyway,

314
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,980
the young lady who danced last
seemed fine.

315
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,180
Well.

316
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,479
At least her vibes...

317
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,700
What are you saying?

318
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,580
No one is suitable.

319
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,220
I told you so.

320
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,159
I really think she's good.

321
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,039
Let me tell you the truth.

322
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,759
This role is hard to find.

323
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,020
It's a lady in her twenties
who is otherworldly

324
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,519
and naive.

325
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,759
Wouldn't she be a fairy?

326
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,599

(your photo with Tang Xin yesterday.)

352
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,660
Of course, I do.

353
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,279
You're the famous director,
Mr. Lu Zhixing.

354
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,079
Everyone knows you.

355
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,260
Dingding.

356
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,380
Tang Xin?

357
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,380
Why are you here?

358
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,460
I am here with my brother.

359
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,500
Lu.

360
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,060
This is interesting.

361
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,540
Mr. Lu.

362
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,500
Have you set your eyes on her?

363
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,159
She's not an actress,

364
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,660
nor a film student.

365
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,860
She's Tang Yu's sister.

366
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,300
Wait.

367
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,239
Are you Mr. Tang's sister?

368
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,180
Yeah.

369
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:37,599
I'm sorry.

370
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,780
I thought you were
from the film academy.

371
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,780
Are you here to shortlist actors?

372
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,540
For "A Dream For You"?

373
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,380
We've been looking around.

374
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,860
Dingding.

375
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,719
It really seems

376
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,300
that you're fit for our lead role.

377
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,359
Me?

378
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:07,999
Forget it.

379
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,260
You're not an actress.

380
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,740
Yu wouldn't allow you t
o join this industry too.

381
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,660
Put aside your brother.

382
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,540
Are you interested?

383
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:17,980
Me?

384
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,479
I can't act.

385
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,300
It's alright.

386
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,980
Acting skills can be taught.

387
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,380
Sincerity is key.

388
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,239
For example...

389
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,020
Who are you trying to teach, Mr. Lu?

390
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,140
What are you going to teach?

391
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,420
You've misunderstood.

392
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,180
I meant it in terms of acting.

393
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,020
What's going on?

394
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,260
We're here to cast a female lead,

395
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,260
and Mr. Lu thinks Dingding's image
fits the role.

396
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,639
Didn't you want to cast Zhou Jialu?

397
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:53,380
Yeah.

398
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,420
We did contact her,

399
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,300
but she wasn't available.

400
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,999
They just called to inform us

401
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,300
that she's available now.

402
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,300
I suppose Time Pictures
terminated her contract, huh?

403
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,719
Why would you terminate her so easily?

404
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,679
Mr. Tang.

405
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,220
Are you sending
your old classmate a gift?

406
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,759
Since we've known each other for years,

407
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,460
I find the need to help when necessary.

408
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,060
But you don't seem happy
about it, Mr. Lu.

409
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,999
I'm just flattered

410
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,620
that you look highly of me.

411
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,420
But on second thought,

412
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,740
you might not have done it for me.

413
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,540
Perhaps I merely rode on coattails.

414
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,420
Right, Mr. Tang?

415
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,900
No matter who it was for,

416
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,980
Zhou Jialu was the one you wanted.

417
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,420
If there is a better fit,

418
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,740
it doesn't have to be Zhou Jialu.

419
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,759
You?

420
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,620
Yu.

421
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,959
You didn't allow me
to be a fashion model,

422
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,420
but I can be an actress now?

423
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,780
Are you selling your sister now?

424
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,719
I didn't allow her to be a fashion model

425
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,239
because she had ulterior motives.

426
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,199
But as long as it's a job
she genuinely likes,

427
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,500
I won't interfere.

428
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,740
One more thing.

429
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,380
If Dingding is willing,

430
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,359
I'll offer Time's investment

431
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,540
for her to join your crew.

432
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,679
Lu.

433
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,060
Try harder.

434
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,220
We have the investment
and our female lead.

435
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,060
Dingding.

436
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,860
What do you think?

437
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,460
I...

438
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,199
Whether or not you want it,

439
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,900
please consider carefully, Miss Tang.

440
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,239
Your image and your innocent aura

441
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,660
perfectly matches my perception
of the protagonist, Jiang Yi.

442
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:38,700
Let's go.

443
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,460
Bye.

444
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,260
Tang Xin.

445
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,820
Be honest.

446
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,620
Is Mr. Tang pursuing you?

447
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,220
No.

448
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,460
If Tang Dingding agrees,

449
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,580
do you have any objections?

450
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,660
I have no problem.

451
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,180
I like Dingding a lot.

452
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:06,999
Besides,

453
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,340
after hearing what you said,

454
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,780
she does seem to fit the role.

455
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,199
In terms of both image and aura,

456
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,660
she's a better fit than Zhou Jialu.

457
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,580
I also agree with this point.

458
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,199
She has an otherworldly

459
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,439
yet innocent vibe

460
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,100
that resonates with our protagonist.

461
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,980
She fits better than Zhou Jialu.

462
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,500
Alright.

463
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,340
Since we are on the same page,

464
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,639
let's not worry about Tang Yu.

465
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,380
We'll try to persuade her ourselves.

466
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,559
Let's go.

467
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,860
Our efforts were not in vain.

468
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,660
Mr. Lu, it's time for your treat.

469
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,060
Yu.

470
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,660
If I don't agree,

471
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,940
does that mean
you can't win Tang Xin's heart?

472
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,820
That doesn't sound right.

473
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,220
I mean,

474
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,820
will it make things harder?

475
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,740
Right.

476
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,100
If you agree to help,

477
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,260
it will certainly help me.

478
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,340
Do you really like Tang Xin?

479
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,860
Why bother pursuing her if not?

480
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,260
Alright.

481
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,140
I'll consider it properly.

482
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,220
Dingding.

483
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,700
Don't feel pressured or burdened.

484
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,900
Just consider one thing.

485
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,260
Do you really like this profession?

486
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,020
Even if it doesn't work out,

487
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,780
I'll pursue her myself.

488
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,140
I will definitely win her heart.

489
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,460
I believe you, Yu.

490
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,679
Not bad, right?

491
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,100
This tea is good. Get more.

492
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,159
You buy them.

493
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,119
I have a family to support,

494
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,220
but you're single.

495
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,540
- Tang Xin.
- Hello.

496
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,700
Hey.

497
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,660
Have some tea.

498
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,580
Come.

499
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,100
Have a seat.

500
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,199
Dinding is still considering.

501
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,980
She might need some time.

502
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,220
Sure. Go and take a seat.

503
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,519
Thanks.

504
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,740
Try some of my new tea.

505
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,199
It's good.

506
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:19,719
Hello.

507
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,740
(Hello, Mr. Lu.)

508
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,159
(It's Liu Tian.)

509
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,220
Jialu ordered a Mahseer fish
from overseas

510
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,279
and wishes to invite you over
for a meal.

511
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,860
To be honest with you,

512
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,220
when you said she had no availability,

513
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,340
we've already found someone else.

514
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,060
Our collaboration might not work out.

515
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,319
(Didn't you say)

516
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,100
(that Jialu fits the image?)

517
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,559
She does,

518
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,140
but we found someone even better.

519
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,159
(That's all from me.)

520
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,740
(Hope we can collaborate next time.)

521
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,100
I...

522
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,660
Men can be so ruthless and indifferent.

523
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,399
If I

524
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,719
reject her directly,

525
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,580
she'll have time
to take on other projects.

526
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,559
But if I keep dragging it on

527
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,959
and give them false hope,

528
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,100
it'll be unfair to the artist.

529
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,060
Makes sense.

530
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,719
But Mr. Lu,

531
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,439
now that you've rejected her
so decisively,

532
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,119
what if Dingding can't make it?

533
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,580
Will you make me step in?

534
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,220
Your price tag is too high.
I can't afford it.

535
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,180
But

536
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,460
what exactly
are Tang Dingding's concerns?

537
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,780
Is she afraid she can't act,

538
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,500
or does she not want to act?

539
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,380
Both, I guess.

540
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,740
Tang Xin.

541
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,719
Can you invite Dingding over
to the office?

542
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,100
I'd like to speak to her.

543
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,239
Sure.

544
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,980
You're trying to start a conflict again.

545
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,620
Let me remind you.

546
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,199
You're dealing with the daughter
of Time Pictures this time.

547
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,420
She's not a puppy from the village.

548
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,860
Feng Cheng.

549
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,340
Sure you want to bring this up?

550
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,660
I'll leave if you do.

551
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,140
Go on, then.

552
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,020
Alright.

553
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,300
I'm leaving.

554
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,340
Did he just leave?

555
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,460
What's the story?

556
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,420
The village puppy was a joke.

557
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,639
Back then, we had a movie scene

558
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,020
where the dog had to cry,

559
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,919
so Mr. Lu

560
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,439
spent two hours explaining the scene
to the dog.

561
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,199
Eventually, it cried

562
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,300
for two hours.

563
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,340
Why are you still on it?

564
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,340
Tang Xin.

565
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,820
Did he tell you that I
explained a scene to a dog?

566
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,679
Listen to me.

567
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,559
He's spilling nonsense.

568
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,799
I'm not a lunatic.

569
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,839
I just did it for the sake

570
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,199
of shooting the scene well.

571
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,319
Animal scenes are the toughest.

572
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,079
Right.

573
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,620
You're right.

574
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:41,980
Really?

575
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,300
He seems interesting.

576
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,740
Do you find acting fun?

577
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,759
I never realized

578
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,679
that acting could be so interesting.

579
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,039
If you find it interesting,

580
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:53,959
join our crew

581
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,220
and strive together.

582
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,300
(I know what you're worried about.)

583
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,119
The entertainment industry

584
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,260
is no different from other industries.

585
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,100
Every industry has downsides.

586
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,559
But what you'll see most

587
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,119
are the staff who work diligently
for the project,

588
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,380
just like me.

589
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,919
So, don't let one person

590
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,900
make you feel biased
against the entire industry.

591
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,140
(If you like acting,)

592
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,940
(or if you want to try it out,)

593
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,679
(don't let other unimportant factors)

594
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,220
(affect your decision.)

595
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,900
Didn't you say

596
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,740
that you didn't fit your current job?

597
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,460
You bought 1,000 copies of my book
and gave them to netizens.

598
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,380
You even enjoy reading my book.

599
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,879
(Coincidentally, we find you fit)

600
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,519
(for the leading role.)

601
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,820
(Isn't this fate?)

602
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,860
Dingding.

603
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,940
If you start enjoying acting
because of this

604
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,799
and find something you want to do
and enjoy doing,

605
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,020
wouldn't it be a great outcome?

606
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,380
How about

607
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,300
visiting our place and having some fun?

608
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,540
Right now?

609
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,879
I'll send you the location.

610
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,780
Come over.

611
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,359
We will sign the agreement, yeah?

612
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,559
Lunch is on me next week.

613
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,439
Sure.

614
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,340
Talk later.

615
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,220
Where are you going?

616
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,599
I'm going to find Tang Xin.

617
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,020
She wants me to join them.

618
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,500
Are you really considering acting?

619
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,620
I'm still thinking about it.

620
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,260
I might actually agree.

621
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,740
Tang Xin was quite convincing just now.

622
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,639
Instead of being a bystander
at the company every day,

623
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,220
unable to assist Yu,

624
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,959
why not become an actress

625
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,580
and earn a significant income?

626
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,620
Does Yu need you to earn money for him?

627
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,260
I want to try it out and experience
spending the money I earn myself.

628
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,999
I know.

629
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,599
You want to be financially independent.

630
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,839
That's a good idea.

631
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,199
But there are many ways to make money.

632
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,580
Let me brainstorm with you.

633
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,020
This industry...

634
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,540
It might not be the right fit for you.

635
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,340
With Yu around,

636
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,500
he protects me.

637
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,660
Even you wouldn't dare to bully me.
Who else would dare?

638
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,820
Why are we talking about me now?

639
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,020
I just want you
to know that being an actress

640
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,319
can be quite challenging.

641
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,879
Alright, I understand.

642
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,260
Tang Xin is still waiting for me.

643
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,199
Let's not talk for now.

644
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:15,839
I'll leave first.

645
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,980
Okay.

646
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,039
We'll talk later.

647
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,060
You go ahead.

648
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,940
Goodbye.

649
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,580
Hello, Tang Xin.

650
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,980
I've gotten off the car.

651
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,180
Where is that place you mentioned?

652
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,399
I see two sculptures beside me.

653
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,900
Two sculptures?

654
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,839
Wait for a while.
Mr. Lu has gone downstairs to fetch you.

655
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,879
Just wait for a moment.

656
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,860
Mr. Lu

657
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,900
I didn't see Mr. Lu.

658
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,420
Are you looking for Mr. Lu?

659
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,180
You scared me.

660
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,460
Please wait for a moment.

661
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,639
Mr. Lu, let's try another shot

662
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,900
with the pose you just did.

663
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,100
Please wait for a moment.

664
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,180
Done. Thank you, Mr. Lu.

665
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,439
It can only be used as a prop.

666
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,180
Understood.

667
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,900
Hello, Miss Tang.

668
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,679
Hello.

669
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,060
You can call me by my name.

670
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,679
Sure.

671
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,780
Tang Dingding.

672
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,860
Over here.

673
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:19,679
Let's go.

674
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,540
Okay.

675
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,500
About earlier...

676
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,639
He's from our studio.

677
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,580
He asked me to take some funny photos.

678
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,420
It was a bit strange, right?

679
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,500
This is my studio.

680
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,900
It's quite spacious.

681
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,180
Dingding.

682
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,039
Tang Xin.

683
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,700
You finally made it.

684
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:41,879
Mr. Lu.

685
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,620
This place is quite easy to find.

686
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:44,919
Xin.

687
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,559
Who is this?

688
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,660
She's so beautiful.

689
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,420
She?

690
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:52,180
She might be the future female lead
in our movie.

691
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,660
Welcome.

692
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,860
With a naive and brilliant temperament,

693
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,180
she really fits the role.

694
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,839
We'll go ahead and get to work.

695
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,399
Alright.

696
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,119
Welcome.

697
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,980
Thank you.

698
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,140
Did you hear that?

699
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,959
Actually,

700
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,140
Mr. Lu asked me to invite you today.

701
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,740
He has something to discuss with you.

702
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,420
He wants to talk to me?

703
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,140
Yes.

704
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,599
Can I take up a bit of your time?

705
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,060
Of course you can.

706
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,500
But you won't pressure me
into making a decision today, will you?

707
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,479
No, we won't.

708
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,479
It's just... just a casual chat.

709
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,620
Don't be nervous.

710
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,079
Did you hear that?

711
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,039
Don't be nervous.

712
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,460
Mr. Lu won't bite.

713
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:30,999
I'll go to work first.

714
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,440
I'll treat you to dinner after work.

715
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,079
Go ahead.

716
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,180
You guys chat first.

717
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,740
I really won't bite you.

718
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,140
Come on.

719
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,140
I actually started making short films

720
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,540
when I was in my teens.

721
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,860
I was quite young at the time.

722
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,140
I love the grainy texture of film.

723
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,660
So, I've collected
quite a few film cameras.

724
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,100
Afterward,
I officially entered the industry.

725
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,460
I gradually discover that in movies,

726
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,940
we can find different answers to life.

727
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,940
In just two short hours,

728
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,100
you can engage
in distant or close interactions

729
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,660
with countless characters.

730
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,660
Over these years,
I've made quite a few films.

731
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,420
But for the art of filmmaking,

732
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:43,540
I continue to seek new experiments.

733
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,220
Filmmaking itself

734
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,260
is an interesting journey.

735
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,180
For actors and actresses,

736
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,060
when you immerse yourself in a role,

737
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,719
and all your emotions

738
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,340
blend with the character,

739
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,440
acting doesn't feel difficult.

740
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,020
Tang Xin told me

741
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,540
you really like this book,

742
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,119
and your understanding
of the characters is spot-on.

743
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,340
The moment I saw you,

744
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,239
I could imagine the scenes of you
in front of the camera.

745
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,700
There's a natural
and unique flavor about you.

746
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,380
Actually, in my heart,

747
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,180
you are the only one

748
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,900
for the female lead.

749
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,300
There's a line
in the story that I really like.

750
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,780
I want to give it to you.

751
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,020
Here it is.

752
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,380
"Welcome to the world."

753
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,180
"I might be able to give you"

754
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,180
"what you long for,"

755
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,180
"what you desire,"

756
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,060
"and what you don't have."

757
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,220
"For what you doubt,"

758
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,600
"what you're confused about,"

759
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,200
"and what you're afraid of,"

760
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,900
"will slowly dissipate with time."

761
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,580
(Mr. Tang.)

762
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,519
(Look.)

763
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,759
(Can we forget
about Jialu's contract termination?)

764
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,439
After all,
the collaboration between Jialu and Time

765
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,060
has always been pleasant.

766
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,420
Forget it?

767
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,940
Aren't you the ones
who suggested terminating the contract?

768
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,420
Mr. Tang.

769
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,900
There was a misunderstanding earlier.

770
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,260
It was our lack of understanding.

771
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,380
(Mr. Tang, please cut us some slack.)

772
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,580
You sign and terminate the contract
at your discretion.

773
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,380
Do you consider this a market stroll?

774
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,060
Yu, are you making a call?

775
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:55,879
Dingding.

776
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,980
Why did you come over?

777
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,260
Yu, can you guess where I just went?

778
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,580
It seems like you visited Lu Zhixing.

779
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,460
Boring. You guessed it right away.

780
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:09,999
Did you and Lu Zhixing

781
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,940
discuss the movie dream?

782
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,020
So, have you made up your mind?

783
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,420
I don't know.

784
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,879
I feel like

785
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,460
this is quite a significant decision.

786
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,759
But,

787
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,580
Tang Xin said she believes in Mr. Lu.

788
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,519
She mentioned that creating a film

789
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,900
with Mr. Lu

790
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,580
is an experience worth savoring
for a lifetime.

791
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,980
Her words really touched me.

792
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,900
There are many things
worth savoring for a lifetime,

793
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,580
not just cooperating with him.

794
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,900
What do you mean?

795
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,020
Dingding.

796
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:53,300
This is undoubtedly a big deal for you.

797
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,860
So, take your time
to consider it thoroughly.

798
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,940
Don't rush into agreeing too easily.

799
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,260
Certainly,

800
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,380
I'll support you

801
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,120
as long as it's something you enjoy.

802
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,740
If it's truly your passion,

803
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,159
just go for it.

804
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,980
Thank you, Yu.

805
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,260
Alright then.

806
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,540
I'll take some time to consider it.

807
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,239
I'll take my leave now.

808
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,440
I won't bother you any longer.

809
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,940
Alright, go ahead.

810
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,580
Hello.

811
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:26,460
Mr. Tang.

812
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,599
The investment contract
for "A Dream for You" is already drafted.

813
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,879
Once Miss Dingding agrees,

814
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,580
we can promptly sign with Mr. Lu.

815
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,340
Mr. Tang.

816
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,860
Don't beat around the bush.

817
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,580
Will my bonus and overtime pay be safe

818
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,020
if I speak up?

819
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,980
That depends on the substance
of what you say.

820
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,580
I think

821
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,940
the way you're pursuing Miss Tang

822
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,879
doesn't have to be so aggressive.

823
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,780
You can try a different approach,

824
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,119
perhaps something like
a self-sacrifice strategy.

825
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,380
Self-sacrifice strategy?

826
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,640
You can pretend to be drunk.

827
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,060
Don't drunk people usually need someone
to take care of them?

828
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,559
If Miss Tang finds out you're drunk,

829
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,759
she wouldn't just leave you
on the street.

830
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,300
She would take care of you attentively.

831
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,719
Isn't that how it's portrayed

832
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,060
in movies and TV shows?

833
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,260
So...

834
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,340
Mr. Tang.

835
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,340
I was just saying.

836
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,580
If you find it inappropriate,

837
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,740
just consider it nonsense.

838
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,060
So, stop talking nonsense from now on.

839
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,900
How could I ever do such a thing?

840
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,360
After three drinks,
I should be a bit tipsy now.

841
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,920
Let's play the pity card.

842
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,140
(Wrong password.)

843
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,260
(Wrong password.)

844
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,540
(Who is it in the middle of the night?)

845
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,820
(Wrong password.)

846
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,980
(Please try again in five minutes.)

847
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,180
Why isn't it opening?

848
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,980
Why won't it open?

849
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,500
Tang Yu.

850
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,639
Tang Yu.

851
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,180
The door is open.

852
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,580
What are you doing?

853
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,980
Have you been drinking?

854
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,519
Tang Xin.

855
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,119
Why are you in my house?

856
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,279
This is my house.

857
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,039
Hurry up and go back.

858
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,060
Get out.

859
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,559
What do you mean your house or my house?

860
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,919
Aren't they both houses?

861
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:22,639
What?

862
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,540
Get out.

863
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,060
Ouch.

864
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,700
It hurts.

865
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:30,860
It hurts?

866
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,060
Where does it hurt?

867
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,940
My lower back hurts.

868
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,060
Lower back pain?

869
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,060
My stomach aches too.

870
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,580
I feel uncomfortable all over.

871
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,380
Why did you drink so much?

872
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,599
Come in.

873
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,620
I'll get you a glass of water.

874
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,700
Alright, I'll help you.

875
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,540
Stand still.

876
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,900
Walk slowly.

877
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,260
Be careful.

878
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,980
Aren't you usually good with alcohol?

879
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,580
Why did you drink so much today?

880
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,460
Gao.

881
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,060
Gao didn't come today.

882
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,500
I drank it all.

883
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,700
Tang Yu.

884
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,060
Tang Yu.

885
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,500
Are you really drunk?

886
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,900
I'm feeling dizzy.

887
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,260
I'll fetch you a cup of honey water.

888
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,220
It works.

889
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,300
Have you sobered up?

890
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,460
I still feel a bit dizzy.

891
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,519
Here.

892
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,780
The honey water.

893
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,780
Drink it.

894
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,460
Hold it yourself.

895
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,060
I'm so dizzy.

896
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,020
One cup.

897
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,180
One cup.

898
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,220
One cup.

899
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,420
Alright.

900
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,500
I'll feed you.

901
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,300
Come on, get up.

902
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,220
Come on.

903
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:10,980
Come on.

904
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,140
Can you drink it?

905
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,940
It's too far.

906
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:18,660
Too far?

907
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,540
How should I feed you then?

908
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,060
I...

909
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,380
I'll drink it myself.

910
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,780
Lie down.

911
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,460
Do you feel better after drinking it?

912
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,940
Much better.

913
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,600
Let me take you back
since you're feeling much better.

914
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,500
I'm not feeling well.

915
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,159
My waist.

916
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,060
My waist hurts.

917
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,580
The hit I took just now really hurts.

918
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,940
How about you help me massage it?

919
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,460
Is it here?

920
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,180
A bit to the side.

921
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,500
Is this force okay?

922
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,620
It's good.

923
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:40,000
Are there any other areas that hurt?

924
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,460
My stomach hurts too.
I feel uncomfortable.

925
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:56,960
You should cut down on drinking
from now on.
