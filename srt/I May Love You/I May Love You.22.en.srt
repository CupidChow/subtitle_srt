Mr. Tang.

29
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,520
Dad.

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,559
Who's there?

31
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,560
Dad.

32
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
Hello, Mr. Tang.

33
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,320
Mom.

34
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,680
Tang Yu's here.

35
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,200
Hi, Mrs. Tang.

36
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,719
Oh, you should've called.

37
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,280
I didn't cook much for lunch.

38
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,399
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,800
I should've called before I came.

40
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,280
Dad.

41
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,239
Stop pulling a long face.

42
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,279
He's already here.

43
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,720
Be nice. For my sake.

44
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,199
Fine. I'm sweeping the floor.

45
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,239
Don't get in my way.

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,039
Get in.

47
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,479
Go.

48
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,159
Right now.

49
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,440
Right now.

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,519
Get inside. You too.

51
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,240
Go. Don't get in my way.

52
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,120
Come here.

53
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,639
My dad is letting you come in.

54
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,120
Now it's up to you.

55
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,720
You can count on me.

56
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,519
I know I can,
but just a friendly word of advice.

57
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,760
Don't make this into a frontal fight.

58
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,200
Don't worry.

59
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,480
I'll use my wits.

60
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,320
Mr. Tang.

61
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,520
Kid.

62
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,160
One question.

63
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,480
How are you with mahjong?

64
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
South Wind.

65
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,080
My turn.

66
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,920
I have

67
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,160
a pair.

68
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,399
I wonder

69
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,080
who has the tile I want.

70
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,560
Seven Bamboo.

71
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
Five Myriads.

72
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
Six Myriads.

73
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,999
What's the use of this?

74
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,520
Faster.

75
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,520
Another Wind?

76
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,280
Eight Coins.

77
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,600
Interesting.

78
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,879
Less talking,

79
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,360
- more playing.
- Seven Bamboos.

80
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,800
Bad tiles.

81
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,840
West Wind.

82
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,119
Not what I want.

83
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,080
Five Myriads.

84
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,440
Six Coins.

85
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,040
Pung.

86
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,079
Dad. Dad.

87
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,519
Wait.

88
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,399
What's wrong?

89
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,160
I won a hand.

90
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,519
You won a hand?

91
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,800
Let me see.

92
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,240
You won with that kind of hand?

93
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,479
Let me see.

94
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,559
Here.

95
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,239
Bad luck.

96
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,879
Come.

97
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,599
Another round.

98
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,919
Let's go.

99
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,120
Alright, let's go.

100
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,720
I have four of a kind.

101
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,080
Be careful, you guys.

102
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,240
Eight Bamboos.

103
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,520
Four Bamboos.

104
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,000
Four of a kind.

105
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,599
Dad.

106
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,240
I have good news.

107
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,919
I won another hand.

108
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,280
You won another hand?

109
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
And I did it when you have
four of a kind.

110
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,079
- Whoa.
- She won even with that?

111
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,080
How vexing.

112
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,400
I'll win this round.

113
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,639
I will win this hand.

114
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,600
Look.

115
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,320
White tile.

116
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,000
I won again.

117
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
You won even with that chaotic hand?

118
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:20,719
My girl,

119
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,039
you are so lucky.

120
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,119
- Your luck is...
- Can't do anything against luck.

121
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,719
That's it, I'm not playing.

122
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,080
You can't do that.

123
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,920
Come.

124
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,080
Let's go.

125
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,840
Give me the money too.

126
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,320
I thought I gave you.

127
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,520
You're fast.

128
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,000
I see

129
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,320
you love red packets.

130
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,439
If you want them,

131
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,120
I can give them to you.

132
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,280
Why'd you have to ruin my plan earlier?

133
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,960
I don't want red packets.

134
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,640
I want to feel the fun
of making money myself.

135
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,119
Dad.

136
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,240
Tang Yu.

137
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,919
My wife made this fruit platter.

138
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,680
Eat it while it's hot.

139
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,640
Sure.

140
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,600
Dad.

141
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,600
Nobody eats fruits hot.

142
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,119
Dad, you're getting senile.

143
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,080
Open up.

144
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,280
Eat it while it's hot.

145
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,999
Mr. Tang.

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,039
You have one too.

147
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,879
I'll pass.

148
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,599
You two finish it. You two go on ahead.

149
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,319
Give Mrs. Tang one.

150
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,159
It's alright.

151
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,360
You guys have it.

152
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,080
Thanks.

153
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,840
One more piece?

154
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,160
Sit.

155
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,120
Mr. Tang.

156
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,760
Didn't think you were good
at making friends.

157
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,919
I underestimated you.

158
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,079
I told you,

159
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,200
just trust me.

160
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,119
I deal with the problems

161
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,400
as they come.

162
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,279
Another piece?

163
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
No.

164
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,200
Tell me.

165
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,240
Am I a problem?

166
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,840
No.

167
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,560
I was playing chess.

168
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,439
Think about it.

169
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,759
If we have a common enemy,

170
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,280
then we'd become quick friends.

171
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,080
No matter the game table

172
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,800
or the business world,

173
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,040
that never changes.

174
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,159
I see.

175
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,880
I'm your enemy, then.

176
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,280
You're my woman.

177
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,760
Lover.

178
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,400
Family.

179
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,920
You'll never be my enemy.

180
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,519
Mr. and Mrs. Tang.

181
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
Dad, Mom.

182
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,520
Sit.

183
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,360
Sit.

184
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,160
I'll go ahead, then.

185
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,800
Tang Yu.

186
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,919
After seeing you a few times,

187
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,759
I think

188
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,120
you're not a bad kid.

189
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
But

190
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,760
some things

191
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,240
I have to tell you.

192
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,440
Of course, Mr. Tang.

193
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,480
You two

194
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,040
can date.

195
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,840
We won't object

196
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,520
to you two getting married either.

197
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,720
But you have to be nice

198
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,160
to Tang Xin.

199
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,120
Do not bully her.

200
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,840
Don't worry, Mr. and Mrs. Tang.

201
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,000
I'll protect her.

202
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,439
Honestly,

203
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,680
she's our beloved girl.

204
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,280
Of course we care for her.

205
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,920
I wonder

206
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,240
how much you love my daughter.

207
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,120
I want to know

208
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,320
how much you like me.

209
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,560
I swear,

210
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,440
I don't just like you.

211
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,320
I can give you

212
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,280
my life.

213
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,399
Here, Mr. Tang.

214
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,560
Thanks.

215
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,800
It's a simple breakfast,

216
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,080
so hope you won't mind.

217
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:10,999
Mr. Tang.

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,160
I'll help Mrs. Tang out.

219
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,599
No need.

220
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,599
It's fine. They'll be here in a moment.

221
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,079
Come.

222
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:16,839
Dig in.

223
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,719
Just wait for them.

224
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,560
They should be here now.

225
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,160
Dad. Tang Yu.

226
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,400
Come.

227
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,800
- Oh, fried dumplings too?
- Here comes the food.

228
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,320
Here you go.

229
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,080
Here's a sunny side up for you.

230
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,680
Some fried dough sticks.

231
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,759
It's a feast today.

232
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,440
I'll be digging in.

233
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,680
The guest goes first.

234
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,800
Here.

235
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,960
Thank you, Mrs. Tang.

236
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,879
We're a family now.

237
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,039
He's not a guest.

238
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,240
Honestly.

239
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,519
Dad.

240
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,280
You have one too.

241
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,600
You're the best, Xin.

242
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,760
Mom.

243
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,880
You have one too.

244
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,160
Mrs. Tang.

245
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,480
Have a bite.

246
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,319
Oh, right, Xin.

247
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,760
Your high school reunion
is today, isn't it?

248
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,959
High school reunion?

249
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,000
Yep.

250
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,759
Her high school friends

251
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,400
always hold a gathering this day
every year.

252
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,280
Xin.

253
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,719
What was the name
of your high school crush?

254
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,080
Something something Han?

255
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,840
Is he going today?

256
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,040
Dad.

257
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,599
I didn't have a crush on him.

258
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,160
Stop talking.

259
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,439
I remember now.

260
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,160
He's Han Yang.

261
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,359
Back in high school,

262
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,720
she wouldn't stop talking about him.

263
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,160
You think I don't know, Xin?

264
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,079
But that guy isn't bad.

265
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,480
Good personality too.

266
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,119
It's been years since you two met.

267
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,840
Dad.

268
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,759
Why'd you pinch me?

269
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,560
I'm just telling the truth.

270
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,399
I remember now.

271
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,759
What's that thing...

272
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,639
Where'd you put it?

273
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,599
Let's go.

274
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,199
What thing? I...

275
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,879
You put it somewhere.
You're helping me look for it.

276
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,519
I put it somewhere?

277
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,279
Let's go.

278
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,640
- Dad, Mom.
- What are we looking for?

279
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,720
Why'd you say all that?

280
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,400
Was your father telling the truth?

281
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,400
You and Yang

282
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,360
haven't met each other for years?

283
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,160
Yeah.

284
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,280
He went overseas after high school.

285
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,120
You have to meet him

286
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,480
now?

287
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,680
Must you meet him

288
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,120
today?

289
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,360
Not now.

290
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,680
It's just a high school reunion.
Just meeting old friends.

291
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,080
Besides,

292
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,519
it's been years.

293
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,560
Maybe he's a fat bald guy now.

294
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,080
If you're that worried,

295
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,360
you can come with me.

296
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,920
That's more like it.

297
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,480
Tang Xin.

298
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,200
Honestly,

299
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,000
he doesn't know your friends.

300
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,919
What's he going to do there?

301
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,559
No, Mr. Tang.

302
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,159
Hey.

303
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,119
Tang Yu.

304
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,600
I have an idea.

305
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,679
After breakfast,

306
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,839
you and me in the game room.
Eight rounds of mahjong.

307
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,639
We work good as a team.

308
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,239
Come with me.

309
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,160
Won't you?

310
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:18,960
Sure.

311
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,919
Nice.

312
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,759
That's the spirit.

313
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,199
Let's go.

314
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,840
Finish up your food.
And then we're leaving.

315
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,840
Here.

316
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,880
On behalf of my heartless brother

317
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,879
who didn't come back for our reunion

318
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,600
just because he wants to see his in-laws,

319
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,479
I wish you two

320
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,519
health and youth.

321
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,519
Thank you, my dear.

322
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,640
Thank you.

323
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,399
Someone finally took a liking

324
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,959
to my undesirable son.

325
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,159
He doesn't have to stick with us
for every festival now.

326
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,160
I am so happy.

327
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,800
Mom.

328
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,200
Will you think I'm annoying eventually

329
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,760
and marry me off somehow?

330
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,480
Girls are different.

331
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,960
You can't marry any random person.

332
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,760
You're still young.

333
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,000
Your career's looking up.

334
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,400
Don't think too much about marriage.

335
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,599
Here, eat.

336
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,880
That's right. Eat.

337
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,199
Mom.

338
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,440
You made this?

339
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,000
Dad.

340
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,360
Your cooking has improved.

341
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,000
Have some more, then.

342
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,999
Here you go.

343
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,279
You have some too, honey.

344
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,880
Alright, I'll do it myself.

345
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,040
(Dingding: Happy Winter Solstice, Mr. Lu.)

346
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,340
(Lu Zhixing: Happy Winter Solstice.)

347
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,480
(Dingding: Let's show off
who has the best food.)

348
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,040
(Dingding: It's the festive season.
And you're alone at home eating that?)

349
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,800
(Lu Zhixing: I'm used to it.)

350
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,839
(If you hadn't said it,)

351
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,000
(I'd have forgotten what day
it was today.)

352
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,520
Man, you're like a lonely old fogey.

353
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,840
Who are you calling
a lonely old fogey?

354
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,440
Not you two.

355
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,159
You're certainly not lonely.

356
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,960
I'm lonely.

357
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,240
Dad, Mom, I'm done.

358
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,559
I'll be going out.

359
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,640
Where are you going?

360
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,999
I mean,

361
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,439
you two are having a lovely time together,

362
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,640
and I'm a third wheel here.

363
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,120
I'll meet up with Shen Fei.

364
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,439
Hey, Dingding.

365
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,480
You haven't...

366
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,520
Are you going to see Shen Fei, really?

367
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,840
Or are you going on a date with a boy?

368
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,439
Dingding.

369
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,839
I'm telling you,

370
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,000
now that you're an adult,

371
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,600
you have to protect yourself.

372
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,839
Dad.

373
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,320
I know. I get it.

374
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,440
However,

375
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,080
Shen Fei needs my protection.

376
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,079
I mean,

377
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,840
you know what she's like.

378
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,799
She drinks, but she's a lousy drinker.

379
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,919
Without my protection,

380
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,439
she'll be in danger alone.

381
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,079
It'll be unsafe.

382
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,759
You sure she's like what you said?

383
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,079
Don't worry, Dad.

384
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,080
With me around,

385
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,199
Shen Fei will not

386
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,000
hook up with any random guys.

387
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,199
See you, Dad.

388
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,440
Bye.

389
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,720
Alright, just let her go.

390
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,439
She's a responsible girl.

391
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,000
If I were her age,

392
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,960
I'd want a good friend like her.

393
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,880
Don't you ever think before you speak?

394
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,720
You're so overbearing. Drink.

395
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,680
Don't drink so much.

396
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,400
You cooked well.

397
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,000
It's late.

398
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,200
Who'd ask her out at this hour?

399
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,639
(Dingding: Don't drink alone.)

400
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,080
(We'll drink somewhere else.)

401
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,719
Don't pull that.

402
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,240
People might recognize you.

403
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,319
With these lights?

404
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,760
No one's recognizing me.

405
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,880
It's alright.

406
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,360
Cheers.

407
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,520
The young are something.

408
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,720
What did you say? I can't hear you.

409
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,920
I said, the young are something.

410
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,119
This place is happening.

411
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,559
What? A dance?

412
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,679
You want to dance?

413
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,720
No, I can't dance.

414
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,759
It's alright. You'll get the hang of it
if you just dance.

415
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,399
- No.
- Come.

416
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,119
I can't do this.

417
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,279
- Come.
- I can't.

418
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,520
- I really can't.
- You'll learn soon enough. Come on.

419
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,839
Just dance to the music.

420
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,119
I can't dance.

421
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:49,679
It's alright.

422
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,880
Just dance around.

423
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,920
Cheers.

424
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,440
It's been a while.

425
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,400
Why didn't Ming Zhu come today?

426
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,599
Ming Zhu?

427
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,079
She's with her husband out of town.

428
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:44,759
She can't come back.

429
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,320
I heard she married a military guy.

430
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,879
She has a good husband.

431
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,199
Better than ours, really.

432
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,839
Not better than Tang Xin's, though.

433
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,159
Tang Xin, you're awesome.

434
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,960
Your boyfriend's a bigshot.

435
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,520
Thanks.

436
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,960
But I'm not bad too.

437
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,320
Tang xin.

438
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,919
Why didn't your boyfriend

439
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,600
come with you?

440
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,799
You didn't bring your boyfriends either.

441
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,840
This is our reunion.

442
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,039
Drink.

443
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,559
Don't talk about boyfriends.

444
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,399
Bottoms up.

445
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,120
Come on, bottoms up.

446
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,319
I thought Han Yang said he'd come.

447
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,359
He said he's stuck in traffic.

448
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:19,999
Let me see.

449
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,200
I'll make a call.

450
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,319
He's coming.

451
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,319
You're late.

452
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,839
Yeah, I was stuck in traffic. Sorry.

453
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,520
Drink. Have a drink first.

454
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,360
Stop talking and drink.

455
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,080
Oh, someone's first love is here.

456
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,600
I'll scoot.

457
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,760
Why are you leaving?

458
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,199
We're all friends.

459
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,519
Stop talking and drink.

460
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,679
Yeah, just drink.

461
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,880
I'll go over there.

462
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,679
Sure.

463
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,880
We'll do our stuff.

464
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,360
Come back soon.

465
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,600
Hello.

466
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,479
Can I take a seat here?

467
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,159
Sure you can.

468
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,000
Sit.

469
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,160
So how's life overseas for you?

470
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,400
Nice.

471
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,919
I saw your Moments.
I think you're having it alright lately.

472
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,800
Yeah.

473
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,279
I'm living a happy life lately.

474
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,200
Thanks.

475
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
Han Yang.

476
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,320
How long are you staying this time?

477
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,800
I'm not going back.

478
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,720
Maybe I'll go to Beijing or Shanghai.

479
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,599
I'm trying to pick
between two companies.

480
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,519
Nice.

481
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,479
You're a brilliant guy.

482
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,880
You would thrive anywhere.

483
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,039
Alright. Here's an early congratulations.

484
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:29,760
Here.

485
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:30,639
A toast.

486
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,880
Welcome back.

487
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,199
Honestly,

488
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,119
that wasn't a satisfying session.

489
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,880
Why don't we take the afterparty
somewhere else?

490
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,360
With how little you can drink? Forget it.

491
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,799
- We're going home and sleep.
- Count me out.

492
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,799
Go home.

493
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:43,840
I won't go either.

494
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,000
That person's familiar.

495
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,479
I think I saw him on TV.

496
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,239
Tang Xin.

497
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,560
Is that your boyfriend?

498
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,119
Why'd you come?

499
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,439
I finished playing mahjong
with your dad,

500
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,520
and I came to pick you up.

501
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,359
You've been waiting for long, then?

502
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,320
No.

503
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,760
Should we say hi to him?

504
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
Your friends are still around.

505
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,840
I'll greet them

506
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,799
and see who your high school crush is.

507
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,600
So you're here to supervise me.

508
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,399
- Hello.
- Tang Xin.

509
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,400
Is this...?

510
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,880
I...

511
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:13,960
Tang Xin.

512
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,440
And this is...

513
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,920
My boyfriend.

514
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,240
Hello.

515
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,040
Hello.

516
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,080
Tang Yu.

517
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,280
Han Yang.

518
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,920
Time flies.

519
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,639
Back in senior year,

520
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,800
you said you wanted to attend
the same school as me in Beijing.

521
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:44,759
Han Yang.

522
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,839
Are you drunk?

523
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,840
I am not.

524
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,160
I said I couldn't go.

525
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,360
Because my family wanted me
to go overseas.

526
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,239
If I hadn't gone overseas...

527
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,240
But

528
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,800
you're not worthy of Tang Xin.

529
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,280
Mr. Tang.

530
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,999
You might be her boyfriend now,

531
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,520
but everyone has a past.

532
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,639
I went overseas because...

533
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,240
No matter the reason,

534
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,400
you still gave up on Tang Xin.

535
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,920
But I'm different.

536
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,560
For her,

537
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,240
I can give up everything,

538
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,040
but you couldn't.

539
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,919
Mr. Tang.

540
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,159
You came back this time

541
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,880
to see Tang Xin's parents, didn't you?

542
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,079
Yes.

543
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,920
So do I smell a wedding?

544
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,319
Congratulations, you two.

545
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,159
This is so romantic.

546
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,119
Congratulations.

547
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:49,959
We'll be going now.

548
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:50,479
- Bye.
- Thanks.

549
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,440
Bye.

550
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,440
Let's go home too.

551
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,720
Mr. Tang.

552
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,160
That was the first time
I saw you fight because of jealousy.

553
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,760
Was that jealousy?

554
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,760
Even if it was,

555
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,200
I had to do it.

556
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,640
I had to shut him down.

557
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,120
And I had to keep you by my side.

558
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,479
But today,

559
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,280
I realized something.

560
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,000
You're the one

561
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,200
whose tastes never change.

562
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,280
What do you mean?

563
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
Take a guess.

564
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,720
It's obvious enough.

565
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,800
You mean Han Yang?

566
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,760
He is handsome.

567
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,800
I think you should reflect upon yourself.

568
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,600
I like you now.

569
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,280
Nothing else matters.

570
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,120
You just like me for my looks and money.

571
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,519
Why are you so childish?

572
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,840
You're so vindictive.

573
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,799
I'm childish.

574
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,120
I'm vindictive.

575
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,000
And I am bothered.

576
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,799
I love you.

577
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Tang Yu.

578
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,680
Me too.

579
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,720
Do you have anything else to tell me?

580
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,839
Like the things you mentioned.

581
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,880
The secrets.

582
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,120
Do you still have them?

583
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,400
A few more?

584
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,920
Take a guess.

585
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,680
No.

586
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,840
I want to hear them from you.

587
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,639
Refuse to tell?

588
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,040
Then we're keeping this up.

589
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,440
Alright, stop messing around.

590
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,800
I'll tell.

591
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,200
Tang Yu.

592
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,560
Do you believe in love at first sight?

593
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,680
Say the word, and I'll believe it.

594
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,360
Then that's all.

595
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,800
That's all?

596
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,360
Love at first sight?

597
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,400
That's the secret you wanted to tell me?

598
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,680
I have a little secret for you too.

599
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,640
What is it?

600
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
Look there.

601
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,320
♪A solo journey through riddles♪

602
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,160
♪Every detail about you♪

603
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,720
The fireworks are beautiful.

604
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,680
Look at that one.

605
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,640
It flies up so fast.

606
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,960
I have to go back tomorrow.

607
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,200
Can't stay for Spring Festival with you.

608
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,560
Happy Chinese New Year.

609
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,920
When did you prepare this?

610
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,159
Told you it's a secret.

611
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,640
I can't tell.

612
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,720
Is it pretty?

613
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,920
Do you like it?

614
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,040
I'll do this for you every year.

615
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,520
After this, I'll celebrate

616
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,680
every Spring Festival with you.

617
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,280
Me too.

618
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,240
Look at that one.

619
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,440
That one.

620
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,920
That one's nice too.

621
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:58,959
Mr. Lu.

622
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,560
We're coming next time too, right?

623
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,359
I mean,

624
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,879
next time we're coming
with my brother and Tang Xin.

625
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,159
And You Huan.

626
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,000
You're happy. First time here?

627
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,520
I had a friend.

628
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,319
I kept telling him to take me along.

629
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,880
But I failed every time.

630
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,280
Maybe they
didn't want to lead you astray.

631
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,640
This isn't leading anyone astray.

632
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Did I lead you astray, Mr. Lu?

633
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,880
Danced for a while earlier. It's hot.

634
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,440
My ride's here.

635
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,719
I should go back now.

636
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,240
Or my parents will worry.

637
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,560
Sure. I'll send you off.

638
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Wear your mask.

639
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,360
I'm exhausted.

640
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,120
Since you came back safely,

641
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,319
you should text your parents

642
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,560
and tell them you're fine.

643
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,480
Feels like you're more like
my parents' kid than I am.

644
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,880
Shouldn't you be happy?

645
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,479
I'm telling you,

646
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,960
your parents love me.

647
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,440
I'll let you in on a little secret.

648
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,559
They texted me every day

649
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,160
during Spring Festival.

650
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,720
You're so full of yourself.

651
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,680
I am not.

652
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,840
I passed your parents' test easily.

653
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,040
Shouldn't you be happy for me?

654
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,760
And it's time

655
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,920
to think about seeing my parents.

656
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
You don't want to?

657
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,360
It's not that.

658
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,040
I just feel nervous.

659
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:52,839
Don't be.

660
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,320
They're good people.

661
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,920
Fine, then.

662
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,640
Sure.

663
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,920
I'll make the arrangements.

664
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,200
No, wait.

665
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,599
The last time I met them,

666
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,160
I looked really unkempt.

667
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,120
No.

668
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,560
What do you mean, no?

669
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,639
My hair was so messed up.
A bird could've made a nest inside.

670
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,959
And my makeup...

671
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,559
Wait, I didn't have makeup on.

672
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,440
No.

673
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:18,479
Oh no, no, no.

674
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,119
Then for this meeting,

675
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,680
I'll have to look good.

676
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,919
Wear something formal.

677
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,559
Look at my usual clothes. Unbelievable.

678
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,319
Short pants.

679
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,199
- Skirts.
- It's fine.

680
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,279
I...

681
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,000
If you want formal apparel,

682
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,360
then just toss everything aside
and leave it to me.

683
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,519
Height 165cm,

684
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,239
weight 45kg.

685
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,720
I'll arrange
with that measurement in mind.

686
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,560
No.

687
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,840
I'm not 165cm in height.

688
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,600
And I'm not 45kg in weight.

689
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,040
I...

690
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,399
I...

691
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,960
I'm 167cm.

692
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,719
And I weigh...

693
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,600
I weigh...

694
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,319
42.5kg...

695
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,760
I weigh 42.5kg.

696
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,839
Did you get all of that?

697
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,160
Height 167cm.

698
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,480
Weight 42.5kg.

699
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,560
Alright.

700
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,399
I guess someone

701
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,920
has to train really hard for a while.

702
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,360
42.5kg?

703
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,480
Are you mad?

704
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,519
I just told him

705
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,280
that in the spur of the moment.

706
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,439
Ladies.

707
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,480
I haven't eaten anything
for three days.

708
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,680
All I ate were leaves.

709
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,960
So did you slim down?

710
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,199
I did.

711
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,320
And then I had a bowl of noodles
this morning. Couldn't help it.

712
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,600
My weight rebounded.

713
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,440
Sister-in-law.

714
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,399
You don't have to slim down

715
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,919
just to see my parents.

716
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,919
You're slim enough.

717
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,120
Besides,

718
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,960
they're laid-back.

719
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,199
They aren't picky

720
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,159
about looks or weight.

721
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,239
As long as you're kind,

722
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,719
they'll acknowledge you.

723
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:48,559
Yeah.

724
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,919
Why'd you go through all that?

725
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,159
Honestly.

726
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,119
I can't.

727
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,719
The last time I met them on the set,

728
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,560
I looked like gutter.

729
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,680
I must've left a bad impression.

730
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,479
That's why

731
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,640
this time I have to redeem myself.

732
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Oh, right.

733
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,240
Speaking of your parents,

734
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,120
what do they like?

735
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,839
This is my first visit to your place.

736
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,240
I can't bring nothing.

737
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,560
Give me some tips.

738
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,880
My parents like...

739
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,800
They like...

740
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,880
They like

741
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,120
whatever my brother likes.

742
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,640
So don't waste your breath.

743
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,720
It's useless asking that.

744
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,599
Should I still lose weight, then?

745
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,399
Lose what weight?

746
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,360
Yeah.

747
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,759
Come.

748
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,359
Have some of this.

749
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:38,839
No.

750
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,399
I've gone through too much.

751
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,320
I will not drink this.

752
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,359
More for us, then.

753
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,119
Hold on.

754
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,360
You two aren't having any, either.

755
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,159
No can do.

756
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,720
We're not meeting anyone's parents.

757
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,440
Come.

758
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,640
Come.

759
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,759
Come.

760
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,000
Cheers.

761
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,320
For today, the three of us

762
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,000
will celebrate a little.

763
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:07,400
Because A Dream for You's
rough edit is done.

764
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,919
Victory is in sight.

765
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,840
Keep up the good work.

766
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,119
Don't be so formal here.

767
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,999
I don't pay for dinner every day. Dig in.

768
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,719
- The food's getting cold.
- Right. Dig in.

769
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:17,200
Try the beef. It's excellent.

770
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,959
Why aren't you eating, Tang Xin?

771
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,000
I'm on a diet.

772
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,239
Lu.

773
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,119
This is why girls annoy me.

774
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,440
Diet is a fashion slogan for them now.

775
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,839
Tang Xin.
You have to eat something at least.

776
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,280
You're running on an empty stomach,
and just drinking booze won't cut it.

777
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,439
I won't drink much.

778
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,119
It's alright.

779
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,000
You guys eat.

780
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,959
Tang Xin.

781
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,160
You know the occasion.

782
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,599
It's the day the rough edit is done.

783
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,919
You have to eat something.

784
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,919
No, I mean...

785
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,599
Seize the chance.

786
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,159
Hey.

787
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:45,679
Have some.

788
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,959
No, don't pile my plate up.

789
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,759
Honestly.

790
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,479
Just eat.

791
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,479
You cannot starve.

792
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,559
If you starve yourself,
I can't face your family.

793
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,199
Don't you think so?

794
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,279
Yeah. Come on.

795
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,080
Listen to us.

796
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,080
If you're not eating,
then neither are we.

797
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,760
You guys...

798
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,400
Fine, I'll eat.

799
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,200
Not bad, don't you think?

800
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,639
That's the spirit.

801
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,440
Come.

802
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,480
It's great munching into meat.

803
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,760
Yep.

804
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,240
Why did I even lose weight for?

805
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,799
Food and love are the meaning of life.

806
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,040
You cannot turn your backs on them.

807
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,160
You've been holding it in.

808
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,639
Hold this for me.

809
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,599
Thanks. Come.

810
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,080
Here, you can have all of it.

811
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,559
How'd Tang Xin go home, Lu?

812
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,720
She got a driver?

813
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,720
Tang Yu took her away.

814
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,959
Sweet.

815
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,879
See?

816
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,960
That's how people with love live.

817
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,280
Are you jealous,

818
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,480
you bachelor?

819
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,480
We're here. Where are you going?

820
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,599
Lu, I don't get it.

821
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,439
You keep hanging out with us

822
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,760
married middle-aged men.

823
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,240
But why aren't you affected?

824
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,520
Is the single life that great for you?

825
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,240
You know,

826
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,719
it's because I see you guys

827
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,760
that I won't be affected by you.

828
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,439
I don't want to turn out like you guys

829
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,439
when I'm at your age.

830
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,520
Sod off.

831
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,200
Slow down.

832
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,920
Lu, I'm telling you.

833
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,520
I have someone who loves me,
but you don't.

834
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,400
You are maidenless.

835
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,720
Have a candy.

836
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,040
It'll shut you up.

837
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,480
Dingding gave you this, didn't she?

838
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,200
How'd you know?

839
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,480
Zhou told me that.

840
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,600
Peng Zhou.

841
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:12,680
Lu.

842
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,600
To be honest,

843
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,280
Dingding's a good girl.

844
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,560
She might be born to money,

845
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,920
but she doesn't have
the princess attitude.

846
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,960
You know what's better than that?

847
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,400
Her personality's great.

848
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,000
She's bubbly.

849
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,120
She is a good match for you.

850
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,040
Are you mad?

851
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,000
There's an age gap between us.

852
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,560
How feudalistic.

853
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,640
She's too young.

854
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,760
If we go out,

855
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,280
I don't think I can take care of her.

856
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,760
She deserves

857
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,280
to be loved.

858
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,640
It's only an eight-year gap.

859
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,760
Look at Xu.

860
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,160
He's in his fifties,
but he dates a girl in her twenties.

861
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,440
He takes care of her well.

862
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,599
And then you guys call him

863
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,120
a cradle snatcher every day.

864
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,960
Come here.

865
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,200
Here.

866
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,120
We're jealous.

867
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,400
But,

868
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,280
to be honest,

869
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,160
you have to snatch the cradle
if you can.

870
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,240
What are you talking about?

871
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,760
Who's there?

872
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,920
Me.

873
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,720
Morning.

874
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,200
Morning, Mr. Tang.

875
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,800
How was your sleep?

876
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:20,839
Come in.

877
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:21,760
Okay.

878
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,120
What are you holding there?

879
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,440
The clothes custom made for you.

880
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,600
Check it out.

881
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,560
I'll open it up.

882
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,440
How is it?

883
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,040
It's nice.

884
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,280
The measurements should be alright.

885
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,400
I think it's fine.

886
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,920
However,

887
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,439
if I'm that bit thinner,

888
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,080
do you think it'll look better on me?

889
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,520
Of course not.

890
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,199
I think you'll look perfect

891
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,800
in it right now.

892
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,440
I want to fatten you up.

893
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,560
No matter your size,

894
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,800
you're perfect for me.

895
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,600
Don't put so much pressure
on yourself.

896
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,440
My parents

897
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,160
don't care about this.

898
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,759
Really?

899
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,679
You're not lying?

900
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,080
Nope. Of course not.

901
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,600
That's great.

902
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,640
I don't have to lose weight anymore.

903
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,560
You can't be doing that
these days, can you?

904
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,319
Have you had breakfast?

905
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,240
Not yet.

906
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,520
I'll make something for you.

907
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,720
Stay with me for a bit.

908
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,000
Sure.

909
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,720
Here.

910
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,120
Take this.

911
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:06,999
Mrs. Tang.

912
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,799
I can't take this.

913
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,519
Take it back.

914
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,160
No, you take it.

915
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:11,679
I can't.

916
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,960
Take it, Mrs. Tang.

917
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,199
My dear.

918
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,719
This is a gift from us.

919
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:16,399
But

920
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,559
we don't know what you like,

921
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,840
so we didn't prepare much.

922
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,439
That's why

923
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,839
we're giving this to you.

924
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,599
You can use this

925
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,640
to buy what you like.

926
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,760
Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Tang.

927
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,799
I can't take this red packet.

928
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,439
You keep it.

929
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,840
We know you're a brilliant lady,

930
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,239
but this means something else.

931
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,359
This is our present

932
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,280
for our future daughter-in-law.

933
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,480
Just take it. Don't worry about it.

934
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:37,600
Take it.

935
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,239
Tang Xin.

936
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,799
Just take it.

937
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,600
Take it.

938
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,799
Yeah. We're a family now.

939
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,399
We're a family.

940
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,880
Thank you for taking my undesirable son.

941
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,800
Tang Xin.

942
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,400
