(Sugar Heart's Diary)

24
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,980
(I thought I had loved Tang Yu
to the fullest,)

25
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,520
(but little did I know,
there was room for even more love.)

26
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,940
Mr. Tang.

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,380
I never expected

28
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,020
you would still
wet your bed at four years old.

29
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,740
Who showed you the photos?

30
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,060
Erm,

31
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,700
your mom did.

32
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,900
A thousand old photos, really?

33
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,220
Let me tell you,

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,660
that image of you all embarrassed
with the blanket

35
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,540
is etched deep in my mind.

36
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,620
(Screenwriter, please get on set.)

37
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,959
Okay, Mr. Lu.

38
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,060
I'll be right there.

39
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,300
Off you go.

40
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,340
Go now.

41
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,500
Hurry.

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,860
Mom is really something.

43
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,679
Mom.

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,020
Why did you visit Tang Xin

45
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,660
at midnight?

46
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,620
I couldn't sleep.

47
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,180
Just wanted to chat with her.

48
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,500
You're in love, and you didn't tell me.

49
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,239
Dingding told me

50
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,780
you and Tang Xin had a fight
because of her.

51
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,959
I thought of going over,

52
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,060
being the peacemaker in your love drama.

53
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,100
Then just chat.

54
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,660
Why did you show her those old photos?

55
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,460
The ones from your childhood?

56
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,879
She seemed to like them.

57
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,900
Mom.

58
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,159
Tang Xin is your girlfriend.

59
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,399
What's wrong with checking out
your dark past?

60
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,820
(It's her right.)

61
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,919
(Besides,)

62
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,719
(I wanted to strengthen)

63
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,079
(our relationship as the mother-in-law
and daughter-in-law.)

64
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,980
(When you and Tang Xin tie the knot,)

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,719
(I'll be gaining another daughter.)

66
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,039
(Just a mom)

67
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,719
(having a chat)

68
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,719
(with her daughter.)

69
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,500
No big deal, right?

70
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,460
Mom, where did you
get this walkie-talkie?

71
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,060
Lu gave it to me.

72
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,940
Mrs. Tang.

73
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,420
This is for you.

74
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,340
What's this?

75
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,719
Things are too hectic on our set,

76
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,559
and we're afraid

77
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,759
we might miss anything on your end.

78
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,820
We've set up
a dedicated channel for you.

79
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,420
Press this button if you need anything.

80
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,860
Someone will assist you.

81
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,140
Isn't that a bit much?

82
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,919
You guys are working hard on the film,

83
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,180
and I don't have any requests.

84
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,580
Don't let me affect your work.

85
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,359
No worries.

86
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,580
Remember,

87
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,839
press this button

88
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,260
and turn to Channel Ten.

89
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,580
Thank you, Lu.

90
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,580
You're more thoughtful than Tang Yu.

91
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,980
You're too kind with your words.

92
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,679
Impressive job, Lu Zhixing.

93
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,740
(Well done.)

94
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,500
Xin.

95
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,420
Wishing you a lifetime of happiness.

96
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,719
Yeah.

97
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,559
Congratulations.

98
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,599
Congratulations to Tang Xin

99
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,379
for becoming my official sister-in-law.

100
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:52,639
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

101
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,060
- Greets to our sister-in-law.
- Greets to our sister-in-law.

102
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,559
Wishing you a baby soon.

103
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,940
Wishing you a baby soon.

104
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,100
- Nice.
- Nice.

105
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,380
- Nice.
- Nice.

106
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,260
When's the celebratory meal?

107
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,700
Yu.

108
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,279
Don't be angry.

109
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,799
Lu is just being kind.

110
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,860
It's my mistake.

111
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,759
I messed up the channel.

112
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,340
It's none of his business.

113
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,239
Regarding you and Tang Xin,

114
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,900
it's all out in the open now.

115
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,679
Why not make it public?

116
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,980
Mom, you may not know,

117
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,679
but it's a rule set by Mr. Lu.

118
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,100
No crew romances allowed.

119
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,140
Will this affect your relationship
with Tang Xin?

120
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,679
I'll talk to Tang Xin about it.

121
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,599
Mom, you don't need to explain it.

122
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,580
How about

123
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,060
you and Dad

124
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,580
heading home today?

125
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,660
Mr. Lu.

126
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,140
Here.

127
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,540
Have some oranges.

128
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,460
Thank you.

129
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,399
Come,

130
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,100
take a seat.

131
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,260
Sure.

132
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:00,999
What is it?

133
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,260
Spill it out.

134
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,679
About me and Tang Yu,

135
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,860
we didn't plan on sharing it
with the crew.

136
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,639
But now...

137
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,020
Everyone is in the loop now.

138
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,100
Tang Xin.

139
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,439
I owe you an apology

140
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,660
on this.

141
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,919
I gave the walkie-talkie

142
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,060
to Mrs. Tang.

143
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,340
It was a well-intentioned
gesture at first.

144
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,719
I thought

145
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,100
it might make things easier for her.

146
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,540
No.

147
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,039
Tang Yu and I...

148
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,340
No.

149
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,780
We can't control the unpredictable.

150
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,060
And

151
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,919
when I made that rule,

152
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,580
you two were already a thing.

153
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,620
Technically,

154
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,380
the rule doesn't apply to you.

155
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,159
But Tang Yu and I did break the rule.

156
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,159
He's a producer,

157
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,540
and he should set an example.

158
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,020
Who would've thought?

159
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,479
We're now

160
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,420
the cautionary tale.

161
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,919
Chill.

162
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:02,900
It's fine.

163
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,740
Thanks.

164
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,900
When I made that rule,

165
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,220
it was more for my own sanity.

166
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,180
Tang Xin.

167
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,140
If you really want to help,

168
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,879
why not

169
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,839
get back the walkie-talkie

170
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,100
from your future mother-in-law?

171
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,119
What do you mean?

172
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,359
What future mother-in-law?

173
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,980
I'm just saying.

174
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,820
If she gets her hands on it

175
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,239
and chaos ensues,

176
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,719
would Tang Yu let me off the hook?

177
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,020
Please do me a favor.

178
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,380
Well,

179
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,500
Tang Yu has settled it.

180
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,980
He escorted his parents off the set.

181
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,559
He did?

182
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,500
They left the set?

183
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:54,980
Thank you.

184
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,039
Tang Xin.

185
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,919
Swing by our place after the wrap-up.

186
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,340
I'll treat you
to some of my best dishes.

187
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:02,599
Sure.

188
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,660
Thanks, Mrs. Tang.

189
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,460
We're heading out now.

190
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,079
Dingding is on set today.

191
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,940
It's better not to bother her.

192
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,039
Please

193
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,500
pass on our regards to her.

194
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,119
Sure.

195
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:13,639
No problem.

196
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,599
I'll take care of it.

197
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,159
Great. Bye.

198
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,839
Bye.

199
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,900
We'll wait in the car, Yu.

200
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,940
We'll wait in the car.

201
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,940
Bye.

202
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,820
Why were you so quiet?

203
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,660
Are you still upset with your mom?

204
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,860
My mom's visit

205
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,140
messed things up again.

206
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,820
Don't let it get to you.

207
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,100
I won't.

208
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,540
Mrs. Tang is quite adorable.

209
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,380
You

210
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,839
need to shake off that mood.

211
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,060
No sulking allowed, okay?

212
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,479
Okay.

213
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,580
I'll do my best.

214
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,860
Your parents are watching us.

215
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,180
So what?

216
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,460
I'll rush back

217
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,580
once my work's wrapped up.

218
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,420
Give me a call

219
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,140
if anything comes up.

220
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,020
By the way,

221
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,580
Lu Chuning is now on set.

222
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,500
Please keep an eye

223
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,660
on Dingding.

224
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,399
What impact

225
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,220
will Lu Chuning have on Dingding?

226
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,919
Well,

227
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,420
Lu Chuning is a seasoned actress.

228
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,460
If Dingding gets jittery,

229
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,700
cheer her up, okay?

230
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,420
Got it.

231
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,060
I have faith in Dingding.

232
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,900
She's making great strides.

233
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,860
Let me hold you longer.

234
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,460
Xin.

235
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,700
Did Yu and my parents
go back to Nangang?

236
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,780
He had an investment meeting to attend.

237
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,039
Knowing you are filming today,

238
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,460
he doesn't want to disturb you.

239
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,340
Forget about it.

240
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,759
He must be concerned I might struggle
in scenes with Lu Chuning,

241
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,439
which would embarrass him.

242
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,100
So, he decided to make a quick exit.

243
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,860
Why are you nervous?

244
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,599
After all, she's Lu Chuning.

245
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,300
The best actress.

246
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,639
What's there to worry about?

247
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,980
You're the female lead.

248
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,100
Well, even though I'm the female lead,

249
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,740
I'm just a rookie.

250
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,079
How can I compare to the best actress?

251
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,820
I fear I'll pale in comparison
to her acting,

252
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,180
making things awkward.

253
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,660
What should I do?

254
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,300
Come on, Dingding.

255
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,980
It's okay.

256
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,620
Remember what you said?

257
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,980
She's a best actress.

258
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,559
You're a rookie.

259
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,060
Even if she outshines you,
it's not embarrassing.

260
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,620
You're talented.

261
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,279
Look,

262
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,260
these past days
have been smooth sailing.

263
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,319
You're smart.

264
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,500
And have you forgotten?

265
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,759
Mr. Lu praised you.

266
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,759
Your performance won't be overshadowed.

267
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,180
Trust in yourself.

268
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,820
You're right.

269
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,039
I have to trust myself.

270
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,959
Absolutely.

271
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,199
After all, I only
have three scenes with her.

272
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,860
I can tough it out, right?

273
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,060
Trust in yourself.

274
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,260
Dingding.

275
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,439
Costume's ready.

276
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,500
Time to get dressed.

277
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,700
Okay, got it.

278
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,839
What should I do?

279
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,359
I'm about to get dressed.

280
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,620
I'm so nervous.

281
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,479
There are only two keys in this scene.

282
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,860
Let's start with one take.

283
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,780
Sure.

284
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,199
Mr. Lu.

285
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,359
The daylight is fading fast.

286
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,599
The wind's strong, too.

287
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,860
We have only about 20 minutes
of daylight left.

288
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,999
We need to be quick.

289
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,380
Twenty minutes is enough.

290
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,780
Don't worry, Mr. Lu.

291
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,980
What about you?

292
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,980
I'll try my best.

293
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,100
Let's start filming.

294
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,700
Alright, everyone, get ready.

295
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,180
Time for last-minute adjustments.

296
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,700
Liu Yang, let's start.

297
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,820
Roll cameras.

298
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,119
Ready? Three, two, one.

299
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,260
Action.

300
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,460
Cut.

301
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,980
Sorry, Mr. Lu. I...

302
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,599
It's okay, Dingding.

303
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,260
(Take it easy. Let's do another take.)

304
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,580
Alright, one more take.

305
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,719
Okay, get ready.

306
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,359
Three, two, one.

307
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,340
Action.

308
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,180
Why are you here?

309
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,839
I want to talk to you

310
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,900
about you and Su Yu.

311
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,100
(You should've known already.)

312
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,340
(Those who come to this world)

313
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,220
have experienced life and death.

314
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,999
(Su Yu's here due to an accident.)

315
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,260
(I'm here due to illness.)

316
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,940
You're clever, Jiang Yi.

317
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,980
You should understand what I'm saying.

318
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,060
I...

319
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,020
Cut.

320
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,060
(Dingding.)

321
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,740
(You need to focus.)

322
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:44,180
Stay focused, okay?

323
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,839
(Just relax.)

324
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,660
(Come on.)

325
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,119
Let's try it again.

326
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,660
It's not raining anytime soon, I think.

327
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,820
Don't worry about it.

328
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,380
Okay.

329
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,620
Come on, get ready.

330
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,239
- Roll cameras.
- Roll cameras.

331
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,799
Ready? Three, two, one.

332
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,780
Action.

333
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,660
Why are you here?

334
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,020
(I want to talk to you)

335
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,660
(about you and Su Yu.)

336
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,460
Cut.

337
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,359
(Dingding.)

338
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,639
(You need to look into her eyes.)

339
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,879
(Don't avoid looking at her, okay?)

340
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,119
Don't keep looking at your feet.

341
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,340
Okay, let's start.

342
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,220
Why are you here?

343
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,740
Cut.

344
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,879
(Dingding.)

345
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,460
Your line delivery is off.

346
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,700
Let's do it again.

347
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,900
(Why are you here?)

348
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,140
Cut.

349
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,020
(Put some emotion into it, will you?)

350
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,580
(You're reciting like a robot now.)

351
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,540
Hurry up. It's getting windy.

352
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,359
- Time's running out.
- She's having a bit of trouble.

353
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,020
(Alright, let's start.)

354
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,900
I...

355
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,860
Cut.

356
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,940
Don't go.

357
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,319
But

358
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,199
if Mr. Lu goes alone,

359
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,540
I fear he'll say something harsh
that makes Dingding nervous.

360
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,199
Sometimes,

361
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,759
giving new actors a little stimulation

362
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,999
might unlock their greater potential.

363
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,900
Just wait.

364
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,420
What's wrong with you?

365
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,940
Didn't we rehearse these lines
yesterday?

366
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,780
Sorry, Mr. Lu. I...

367
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,959
Stop apologizing all the time.

368
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,399
Why are you afraid
to look at your partner?

369
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,399
Why keep looking at your feet?

370
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,420
There's nothing there.

371
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,639
Relax.

372
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,959
Overcome your emotions,

373
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,580
okay?

374
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,260
Hurry up. We're short on time,

375
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:21,940
alright?

376
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,500
Let's do another take.

377
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,260
Three, two, one.

378
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,220
Action.

379
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,740
Why...

380
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,380
Cut.

381
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,420
(Dingding, what are you looking at?)

382
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,340
Can't you look at her?

383
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,420
Let's take a ten-minute break.

384
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,020
Mr. Lu.

385
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,359
It's about to rain.

386
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,180
The wind's picking up too, you see.

387
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,420
Let's stop filming.

388
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,500
It's a wrap.

389
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,780
Let's pack up.

390
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,999
Thank you, Mr. Lu.

391
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,900
It's a wrap.

392
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,559
I'll go check on Dingding.

393
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,260
Okay.

394
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,140
I'll go now.

395
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,079
It's okay. Go on with your work.

396
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,119
I'll stay here for a while.

397
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,260
Thank you.

398
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,660
Take this along.

399
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,239
Hers is in here.

400
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,079
Take this along.

401
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,060
This one, too.

402
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,860
I'll put this in.

403
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,260
What's wrong with me?

404
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,519
It's okay.

405
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,900
I suck.

406
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,020
Believe in yourself.

407
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,580
You're not that bad.

408
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,580
Have faith in yourself, okay?

409
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,940
Why are you still here?

410
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,700
Despairing, huh?

411
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,180
You should go to Mr. Lu.

412
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,140
He's the one responsible for this.

413
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,900
I dare not to.

414
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,039
And besides,

415
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,380
I'm acting opposite you.

416
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,460
I don't think it'll help to go to him.

417
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,239
If I want to practice,

418
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,879
I'll need your help.

419
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,159
So, you're staying here

420
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,020
because you want
to rehearse the lines with me?

421
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,140
Fine.

422
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,460
The rain won't stop
anytime soon, anyway.

423
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,460
I'll help you.

424
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,380
Come sit beside me.

425
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,559
Thank you, Miss Lu.

426
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,460
It's nothing.

427
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,980
Hold onto your script.

428
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,020
Let's go line by line.

429
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,180
There's no rush.
Take your time to get into character.

430
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,060
Is this...

431
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,620
Is this another dream?

432
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,220
Look at me.

433
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,780
Say it again.

434
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,879
Is this another...

435
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,900
Look at me.

436
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,100
Is this another dream?

437
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,100
Are you afraid of me?

438
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,199
When we were studying,

439
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,140
we learned this method of self-patting.

440
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,759
Pat our muscles

441
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,180
to relax ourselves.

442
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,580
Try it yourself.

443
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,860
Pat yourself while speaking.

444
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,140
Relax.

445
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,540
You were first

446
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,999
brought into this world

447
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,780
by my grudge.

448
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,980
So, your task was to change my fate.

449
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,580
What about this time?

450
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,260
I have one more method.

451
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,140
Let's try sitting cross-legged.

452
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,900
Feel me in your heart.

453
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,780
Close your eyes.

454
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,140
This time,

455
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,300
it was your longing for me

456
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,380
that brought me here.

457
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,140
I thought

458
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,060
you had forgotten about me.

459
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,140
It's much better now.

460
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,620
Really?

461
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,500
How is it?

462
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,380
I feel much more relaxed.

463
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,079
It's really useful.

464
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,060
Thank you, Miss Lu.

465
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,039
Remember this feeling.

466
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,140
Use this method
for the rest of the lines.

467
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,860
Let's keep going.

468
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,380
(What about this time?)

469
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,020
(This time,)

470
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,140
(it was your longing for me)

471
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,660
(that brought me here.)

472
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,380
(I thought)

473
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,540
(you had forgotten about me.)

474
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,500
Cut.

475
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,260
Alright, that's good.

476
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,959
(Let's move on to the next shot.)

477
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,900
- Shift the camera position.
- (Bring Jiaming...)

478
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,140
Move the camera over there.

479
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,140
Dingding, you did better than yesterday.

480
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:38,999
Is Jiaming here already?

481
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,999
Yes, Mr. Lu. She's here.

482
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,860
Mr. Lu.

483
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,079
Did I pass?

484
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,319
Did Miss Lu

485
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,660
give you a lesson last night?

486
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,740
That's our little secret.

487
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,300
I guessed so.

488
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,060
Sometimes, for an actor,

489
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,620
what's needed
isn't just their acting skills

490
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,420
but also their mental composure.

491
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,179
All kinds of unexpected situations

492
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,500
can happen on set.

493
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,820
Take yesterday, for example.

494
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,780
To achieve a satisfying result
within 20 minutes of filming,

495
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,820
it needs a good actor

496
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,479
to keep their mental composure

497
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,359
at the optimal level.

498
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,359
Then it can be done.

499
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,620
As a new actor,

500
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,900
you've worked very hard,

501
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,839
but you still need

502
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,740
to learn more from Miss Lu
in this aspect.

503
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,540
Keep it up. I believe in you.

504
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,900
Let's take a break, both of you.

505
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,719
Okay.

506
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,660
Come on, let's go.

507
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,020
(Actors' Rest Area)
How can I relax?

508
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,620
What are you doing?

509
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,879
You scared me.

510
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,300
What are you fretting about?

511
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,300
I'm still thinking about the script.

512
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,359
Stop thinking about it.

513
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:41,639
Here.

514
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,300
Have a candy and cheer up.

515
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,660
Where did you get this from?

516
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,759
Jiaming gave it to me.

517
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,540
Here.

518
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,940
Jiaming gave it to you?

519
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,719
She said

520
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,519
that she gets nervous during filming,

521
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,079
so she'd give candy to Mr. Lu first.

522
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,399
That way, when Mr. Lu says "Cut",

523
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,639
he'll be gentler with her.

524
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,199
She's just five years old.

525
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,079
She already knows how to bribe people
with candy?

526
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,700
And here's a secret.

527
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,300
This works especially well on Mr. Lu.

528
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,119
Didn't you watch the filming
this morning?

529
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,039
Jiaming slipped up seven or eight times,

530
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,340
but Mr. Lu didn't say a word.

531
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,340
And he's joking with her right now.

532
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,380
Really?

533
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,620
Mr. Lu actually falls for that?

534
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,799
Back when you delivered him supper,

535
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,879
didn't you notice?

536
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,879
Mr. Lu

537
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,420
is very easy to bribe.

538
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,060
Yeah.

539
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,820
Why didn't I think of that?

540
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,660
You can't have supper everyday,

541
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,540
but you can have candy.

542
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,020
Let's go.

543
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:43,879
Where to?

544
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:44,759
To buy candy.

545
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,780
To buy candy?

546
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,999
Ji, go help out.

547
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,399
Stop sitting around.

548
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,620
Go help out.

549
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,479
It's fine.

550
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,759
You bought the candy.

551
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,820
Just give it to him.

552
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,519
No. He's angry.

553
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:58,999
It's fine.

554
00:21:59,000 --> 00:21:59,239
Hurry.

555
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,380
Go.

556
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,639
Do we have to tweak this?

557
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,500
Mr. Lu, are you still angry?

558
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,879
Don't be angry.

559
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,100
Here, for you.

560
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,860
I'll put them here.

561
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,500
These are?

562
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,599
I hear in Xiacheng,

563
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,620
nougats are great.

564
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,079
Local specialty.

565
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,340
Let me grab you one to try.

566
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,700
I'll open it for you.

567
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,319
If you don't like it,

568
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,639
I'll pick another flavor.

569
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,279
I think this is better.

570
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:54,100
I find this nicer.

571
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,719
If you like them,

572
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,500
I'll get you more.

573
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,540
Who bought the candy?

574
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:02,980
You?

575
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,420
Am I interrupting something?

576
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,740
Nope.

577
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,359
I'm done now,

578
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,399
and

579
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,420
someone's calling for me to get changed...

580
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,239
Go on.

581
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,060
Okay.

582
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,700
I'll leave them here.

583
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,620
Good luck.

584
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,660
Mr. Lu.

585
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,140
This is considered bribery.

586
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,220
Bribery?

587
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,180
Why would she bribe me?

588
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,359
She saw Jiaming giving you candy.

589
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,519
That's why she thought to buy you some.

590
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,479
So that if she

591
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,519
makes mistakes,

592
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,100
you'll be nicer.

593
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,540
Am I that fierce?

594
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,159
You know exactly

595
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,479
how you usually act.

596
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,559
Sometimes, even I

597
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,380
feel very scared.

598
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,599
Should I also

599
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,580
give you some candies as bribe?

600
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,580
You?

601
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,159
It's her first shoot.

602
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,159
You're an old hand. Stop pretending.

603
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,199
Who are you calling old?

604
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,300
Come. Let's eat candy.

605
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,420
We'll eat your candy.

606
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,479
Mr. Lu.

607
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,620
Are we really using the stunt team
for tomorrow's scene?

608
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:24,679
Yes.

609
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,860
I said it before.

610
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,519
The key parts must be filmed
on the roof,

611
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,660
or it'll look bad.

612
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,959
We haven't told Miss Dingding

613
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,119
she'll be hooked to wires.

614
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,119
She has no training.

615
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,500
Won't it be bad?

616
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,140
True.

617
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,599
Fine.

618
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,740
Discuss it with the stunt team.

619
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,340
I'll talk to Dingding.

620
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,420
Mr. Lu.

621
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,940
Really?

622
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,100
I'll be on wires tomorrow?

623
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,060
Wait. You.

624
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,439
Why are you so happy?

625
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,260
Liu Yang was worried you'd be scared.

626
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,900
Why would I be scared?

627
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,599
As a child, my favorite shows

628
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,639
were wuxia shows.

629
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,660
They'll be on wires,

630
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,860
flying around. How cool!

631
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,199
Okay. If that's what you think,

632
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,140
I'll be at ease.

633
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,559
Still, this is just talk.

634
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,679
When you're up there tomorrow,

635
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,100
I bet your legs will go weak.

636
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,719
Our shed on the roof

637
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,319
is just a simple metal scaffolding.

638
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,239
It can't hold much.

639
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,719
There won't be any staff nearby,

640
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,780
waiting with you.

641
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,980
You'll be alone.

642
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:15,980
Stay safe.

643
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,679
I'll be fine.

644
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,239
I've been through a lot,

645
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,100
like bungee jumping

646
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,039
and skiing.

647
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,460
It's only the third floor.

648
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,900
It's nothing.

649
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,580
Fine.

650
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,300
Tomorrow's scene

651
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,020
is the highlight of the film.

652
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,060
While you're mentally prepared,

653
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,599
I hope that you'll pay attention

654
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,540
to your acting,

655
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,980
especially your lines.

656
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,540
I want to record on-set.

657
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,399
So,

658
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,020
practice your lines.

659
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,620
Got it. Roger, Mr. Lu.

660
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,540
Yes, sir.

661
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,759
Okay.

662
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,500
I'll be off.

663
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,540
Bye.

664
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,940
I'm just a character under his pen.

665
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,620
I'm just his mission.

666
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,540
If death is my end,

667
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,940
what am I fighting against?

668
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,980
What was it?

669
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,740
Why, you ask?

670
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,860
Why, you ask?

671
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,620
Why?

672
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,620
You ask.

673
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,220
You ask. It...

674
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,580
You ask.

675
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,740
I should be the one asking that.

676
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,420
Even if I finish these drawings today,

677
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,740
I can accept the fact

678
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,119
that this world is an illusion.

679
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,060
It's me.

680
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,519
It's...

681
00:26:59,520 --> 00:26:59,839
No.

682
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,460
It's your creation.

683
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,519
You approached me,

684
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,020
just to complete your mission.

685
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,900
I can accept all that.

686
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,940
I'm just a character under his pen.

687
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,260
No.

688
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,140
I'm exhausted.

689
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,740
I can't sleep.

690
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,999
I need to practice more.

691
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,079
A few more lines.

692
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,239
I can do it.

693
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,940
You can do it.

694
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,700
Death is my end.

695
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,119
Practice your lines.

696
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,740
Hurry.

697
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,239
Death is my end.

698
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,039
Then, why?

699
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,759
Why?

700
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,879
Tell me why!

701
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,900
Why?

702
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,860
Why?

703
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,700
Why?

704
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,420
Why?

705
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,380
Why?

706
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,220
Why?

707
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,500
Honey.

708
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,780
Coming.

709
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,820
Mr. Lu.

710
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,799
Why are you here?

711
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,260
It's late. Why aren't you sleeping?

712
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,540
Dingding, are you hungry?

713
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,220
Yes.

714
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,900
Yes?

715
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,620
Then, sleep.

716
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,100
You're not hungry if you're asleep.

717
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,319
I'm fine.

718
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,380
I'm not tired at all.

719
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,780
I'm not that hungry.

720
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:52,959
I can keep practicing

721
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,180
until tomorrow morning.

722
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,340
Morning?

723
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,660
No.

724
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,820
You've worked hard enough.

725
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,079
There's filming tomorrow.

726
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,020
Rest early.

727
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,340
It's fine.

728
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,239
I am working

729
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,599
tomorrow afternoon.

730
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,279
I must at least practice until

731
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,300
4.00 AM.

732
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,540
4.00 AM?

733
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,860
Listen.

734
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:11,879
I think

735
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,239
from what I heard just now,

736
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,260
you know your lines quite well.

737
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,780
You have inflection,
energy, and all that.

738
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,180
Really?

739
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,100
How did you know?

740
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,660
(Death is my end.)

741
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,039
(Practice your lines.)

742
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,620
(Hurry.)

743
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,060
(Death is my end.)

744
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,999
(Why?)

745
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,220
(Tell me why!)

746
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,300
(Why?)

747
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,420
You don't need sleep,

748
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,060
but I do.

749
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,959
I'm sorry.

750
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,559
I'm sorry, Mr. Lu.

751
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,679
I really didn't know

752
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,100
the soundproofing is so bad.

753
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,300
It's fine.

754
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,519
I'm mainly worried

755
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,479
this will affect your acting tomorrow.

756
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,500
Rest early.

757
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,639
Okay.

758
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,340
Bye.

759
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,020
Okay. Ready.

760
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,060
Cameras.

761
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:18,839
What's going on?

762
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,340
My mind is blank.

763
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,940
Slowly!

764
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,740
Let's change a few camera angles.

765
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,820
Come on.

766
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,060
Slowly.

767
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,540
Wait.

768
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,500
Her feet.

769
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,460
Wait.

770
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,179
♪Time repeats its course♪

771
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,359
♪From dusk till night♪

774
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,279
Three. Two. One.

775
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,079
Action.

776
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,220
I'm just a character under his pen.

777
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,460
I'm just his mission.

778
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,420
Let's look at the replay.

779
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,900
Slowly.

780
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,420
Her feet.

781
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,540
Okay.

782
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,260
Slowly.

783
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,879
Slowly.

784
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,780
Grab on first.

785
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,180
Cut.

786
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,460
Pull Miss Dingding down.

787
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,300
Slowly.

788
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,980
Hand.

789
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,300
Slowly.

790
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,580
Her feet.

791
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,660
Okay.

792
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,620
Touch-up time.

793
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,479
Miss Dingding.

794
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,620
Good work.

795
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:26,919
Here.

796
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,439
Do you want some water?

797
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,319
No, I don't. I want to use the toilet.

798
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:30,959
Well,

799
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,199
because you're hooked to the wires,

800
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,119
it'll be some time before you can go.

801
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,519
We just need one more take.

802
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,679
We'll be done soon, okay?

803
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,679
Fine.

804
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,319
Let's do another take then,
Miss Dingding.

805
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,159
Okay.

806
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,340
Just a moment.

807
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,439
I can do it.

808
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,559
Okay. Let's go.

809
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,479
Thanks, Miss Dingding.

810
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:44,999
It's fine.

811
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,700
Let's go.

812
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,380
Let's get her up there.

813
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,500
Slowly. Slow down.

814
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,660
Wait.

815
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,980
Wait.

816
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,220
Down. Just a little.

817
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,620
Are you holding on?

818
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,700
Yes. I'm holding on.

819
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,039
Okay. Ready.

820
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:07,900
Cameras.

821
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,079
Three. Two. One.

822
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,220
Action.

823
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,580
(I'm just a character under his pen.)

824
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,180
(I'm just his mission.)

825
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:21,100
(If death is my end,)

826
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,100
what am I fighting against?

827
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,940
(Cut.)

828
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,639
(Good take.)

829
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,559
(You did well, Dingding.)

830
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,100
Your practice paid off.

831
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:30,759
(We'll now move the cameras.)

832
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,439
Okay.

833
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,159
Okay. Go.

834
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,260
Bring her down.

835
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,460
Miss Dingding.

836
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,039
Look out.

837
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,940
Hold on tight.

838
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,139
- Crash mats. Hurry.
- Hurry.

839
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:48,239
- Bring more mats. Hurry.
- Hurry.

840
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:48,959
Dingding.

841
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,119
Hold on tight.

842
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,159
Mr. Lu.

843
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,100
Hold tight.

844
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,180
I can't hold on any longer.

845
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,260
Mr. Lu, where are you?

846
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,700
I can't.

847
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,460
Hurry.

848
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,900
Help me.

849
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,060
I don't want to die.

850
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,620
I'm scared.

851
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,359
Bring all the mats we have.

852
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,180
Hurry.

853
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,140
Let's go. Hurry.

854
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,900
All of the mats, now!

855
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,279
Any more?

856
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,999
- There are more. Hurry.
- Hurry.

857
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,079
Come. Bring them all here.

858
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,980
Stack them well.

859
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,900
- Bring them over here.
- Here.

860
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,260
Coming.

861
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,100
Hurry.

862
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,660
Coming.

863
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,740
(Dingding.)

864
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,980
(Stay strong.)

865
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,060
(You are the most amazing girl)

866
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,220
(I've ever seen.)

867
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,300
(Stay strong.)

868
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,359
Mr. Lu, I can't do it. I'm scared.

869
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,799
I'm going to die.

870
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,260
I don't want to die.

871
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,420
Where are you, Mr. Lu?

872
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,140
Dingding.

873
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,260
Dingding.

874
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,479
Mr. Lu, I...

875
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,580
Hold onto me.

876
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,540
Hold onto me.

877
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,060
Stay strong.

878
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,900

What are you doing?

912
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,780
I was going to talk to you.

913
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,479
I got delivery.

914
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,540
Why don't we...

915
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,260
Sure, let's eat.

916
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,180
Come in.

917
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,380
Okay.

918
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,100
Mr. Lu.

919
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,100
How's your wound?

920
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,420
Is it alright?

921
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,140
What did the doctor say?

922
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:51,020
Does it hurt?

923
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,900
It's been treated.

924
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,140
It doesn't hurt anymore.

925
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,620
So why were you coming to see me?

926
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,399
I was thinking

927
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,900
to apologize to you

928
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,540
for today.

929
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,260
I couldn't protect you.

930
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,759
It's okay, Mr. Lu.

931
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,119
This isn't your fault.

932
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,500
But I'm the director.

933
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,460
I'm fine now.

934
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,580
Why apologize to me?

935
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,900
Actually,

936
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,100
I should be thanking you.

937
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,580
When I was up there,

938
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,140
I was really scared.

939
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,060
That's because we were lucky.

940
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,060
What if something happened to you?

941
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,140
That...

942
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,900
Don't beat yourself up, Lu.

943
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,719
I'll be worth billions in the future,

944
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,820
a celebrity with trillions
in the box office.

945
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,879
I have to go through

946
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,140
some training, after all.

947
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,159
Come.

948
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:01,940
Dinner's on me.

949
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,100
What are you doing?

950
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,799
Just eat.

951
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,220
Lu?

952
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,460
Mr. Lu.

953
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,079
I know what you're trying to say.

954
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,380
You mean I'm an obstacle on your path
to success, aren't you?

955
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,260
Even if you are,

956
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,020
you will be the obstacle

957
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,460
that makes me stronger.

958
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,100
A good obstacle, so to speak.

959
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,500
Dingding.

960
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,079
It's not too late

961
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,140
to turn back now.

962
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,959
I mean,

963
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,900
if you want to quit being an actor,

964
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,820
it's fine.

965
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,940
Mr. Lu.

966
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,079
Just because I called you Lu,

967
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:45,439
you're switching me out?

968
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,500
That's not what I meant.

969
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,460
Mr. Lu.

970
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,300
I'm serious.

971
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,420
Even though

972
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,959
I was scared

973
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,220
when I was up there,

974
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,580
but I didn't regret

975
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,580
becoming an actress

976
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,620
because of what happened today.

977
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,780
I'm not kidding.

978
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,460
♪Every detail about you♪

979
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,980
♪Is my eternal one and only♪

980
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,820
I'm serious.

981
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,420
I want

982
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,300
to be a shining,

983
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,540
hardworking,

984
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,540
and great actress.

985
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,460
I trust you.

986
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,940
From the first time I saw you,

987
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,300
I wanted you to be our female lead.

988
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,220
Of course, you didn't get my recognition

989
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,140
because of the sweets.

990
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:46,700
It's because I saw

991
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,439
the hard work

992
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,220
and hours you put in.

993
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,620
I believe

994
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,860
you will become

995
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,020
the shining,

996
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,500
brilliant,

997
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,119
actress

998
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,300
you want to be.

999
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,300

Tang.

1004
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,319
Explosion scene today.

1005
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,639
Be careful, people.

1006
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,279
All departments, keep an eye out.

1007
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,060
Sure thing.

1008
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:49,359
Kai.

1009
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,000
Let's check the explosion site.

1010
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,600
Sure thing.

1011
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,760
(Red packets from Tang Yu)

1012
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,200
(Tang Yu: Why not take it?
Rich Lady: Why should I?)

1013
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,180
Silly.

1014
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:58,820
Tang Xin.

1015
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,900
Look at scene 55.

1016
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,180
There's something
off with the plot's logic.

1017
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,420
Be careful!

1018
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,759
Mr. Tang, bad news.

1019
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,599
We have a situation.

1020
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,300
Liu Yang, tell Mr. Tang what happened.

1021
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,599
Hello?

1022
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,460
(Mr. Tang.)

1023
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,300
Something happened when we buried
the explosives. It exploded before it should.

1024
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,280
How many are injured?
What's the situation?

1025
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,399
Did you take them to the hospital?

1026
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,380
About 20 to 30 injured.

1027
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,700
(Some got hurt by the explosion,
some got hurt by the falling tents.)

1028
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,110
We took the ones badly hurt
to the hospital.

1029
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:42,079
Only those hurt shallowly are left.

1030
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:44,119
Listen to me. No matter what,

1031
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,879
take the injured to the hospital.

1032
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:46,679
(As soon as possible.)

1033
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,660
I understand.

1034
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,620
Also,

1035
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,700
where's Tang Xin?

1036
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,479
The screenwriter

1037
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,119
is in Central Hospital.

1038
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,060
I see.

1039
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,479
Central Hospital.

1040
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,460
On it, sir.

1041
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,079
Are you badly hurt?

1042
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:03,980
No.

1043
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,260
Wang.

1044
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,279
- How's the injury?
- It's nothing. Just some scrapes.

1045
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,140
It's not too bad.

1046
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:09,479
Mr. Tang.

1047
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:10,359
Look out.

1048
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,359
Alright, you go ahead.

1049
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,359
Are you badly hurt?

1050
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,180
No.

1051
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,759
- Thank you, Mr. Tang.
- Thank you, Mr. Tang.

1052
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:15,719
Dr. Liang.

1053
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,700
I'll check on the lady taken to the ICU.

1054
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,940
- I'll leave things here to you.
- Okay, go.

1055
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:35,500
Look out. We'll sit there.

1056
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,700
Here we go.

1057
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,399
I'll tell the doctor to check on you.

1058
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,340
Look out there.

1059
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,580
Thank you.

1060
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:16,860
Are you alright?

1061
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,100
I am.

1062
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,260
I really am. What's wrong?

1063
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:32,119
