"I May Love You")

(CEO's Pursuit Tactics)

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,960
(Some men are really too confident,)

25
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,120
(especially Tang Yu.)

26
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,240
(His confidence is over the top.)

27
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,800
(I won't let him have his way.)

28
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,860
The chief screenwriter
got stomach cancer?

29
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,440
So, what about the project
you're working on?

30
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,820
I don't know.

31
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,900
Chances are it'll be delayed.

32
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,820
Why the sigh?

33
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,312
What else could she sigh about?

34
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,940
It's all because of Huo Chendong.

35
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,180
He's found himself a new girlfriend.

36
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:16,940
Dingding.

37
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,460
I think this white color
looks pretty good.

38
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,220
Speak of the devil,

39
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,140
and he shall appear.

40
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,660
Do you like it?

41
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:26,060
That's Huo Chendong's girlfriend, right?

42
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,940
Yeah, that's Zhao Feiyu.

43
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,140
Dingding, you go.

44
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,620
Can I?

45
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,660
Of course, you can.

46
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:32,820
Wait a minute.

47
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,460
Hurry, hurry.

48
00:02:34,544 --> 00:02:35,900
- Dingding?
- They're coming. Hurry and go.

49
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,140
What a coincidence.

50
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,380
Why are you here?

51
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:45,540
Is this the place

52
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,504
you were referring to
as your friend's clothing studio?

53
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,820
Yeah.

54
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:52,500
Perfect timing.

55
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,340
Huan has just
added many new fashion designs.

56
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,860
Which one do you like?

57
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:57,808
Let me help you decide.

58
00:02:59,008 --> 00:02:59,940
Then I'll browse around.

59
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,660
Certainly, go ahead.

60
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,872
Feel free to look around.

61
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,020
Tang Xin.

62
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,100
What's wrong? Not welcoming me?

63
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:10,740
How could that be?

64
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,420
Tang Xin.

65
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,220
Let's welcome Mr. Huo.

66
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,140
I'll get some water.

67
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:14,980
Sure.

68
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,300
Mr. Huo.

69
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,700
Girls

70
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,020
always take forever to pick clothes.

71
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,860
Why don't you

72
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,500
take a seat first?

73
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,100
Sure.

74
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,540
So, this is it.

75
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,100
The decoration style

76
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,420
is quite unique.

77
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,940
This outfit looks nice.

78
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,460
If you like it...

79
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,580
Can I try it on?

80
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,260
Of course you can. No problem at all.

81
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,380
Hold on, let me undress it for you.

82
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,220
Dingding.

83
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,580
I'll do it.

84
00:03:47,952 --> 00:03:49,510
You go over there
and show her more options.

85
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,100
- Hurry.
- Okay.

86
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:52,660
Hi there.

87
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,540
This outfit is our unique
haute couture design.

88
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:58,500
When it was just released
a couple of days ago,

89
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,928
a social media influencer
wanted to take it away for the weekend.

90
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,220
I actually think this outfit
suits your style better.

91
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:04,980
Really?

92
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,260
I also think it suits me well.

93
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,380
Of course.

94
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,700
Trust the aesthetics of our studio.

95
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,540
Shall I assist you in trying it?

96
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,560
Give it a try.

97
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,420
If you like this style,

98
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,420
you can try this too.

99
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,940
It's a different collection's design.

100
00:04:24,496 --> 00:04:25,360
I'll give it a try too.

101
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:26,060
Sure thing.

102
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,180
I've heard friends
praising this store before.

103
00:04:29,248 --> 00:04:31,664
Now I can attend events
without matching outfits with others.

104
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,420
Of course.

105
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,060
Our designs are truly unique.

106
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:34,740
Oh, yeah?

107
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,100
The fitting rooms are over there.

108
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:37,900
Okay.

109
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,900
I think you have great taste.

110
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,256
Which one do you want to try first?

111
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:45,540
Let me tell you,

112
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,180
Dingding's sales skills
have got my style.

113
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,740
Mr. Huo.

114
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,792
What are you waiting for?

115
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,460
I'm coming.

116
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,512
We accept WeChat Pay and Alipay.

117
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:03,900
You scan me, right?

118
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,432
This is quite expensive.

119
00:05:10,512 --> 00:05:12,020
Are you sure the calculation is right?

120
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,300
It's correct.

121
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,580
Our clothes
have always been priced this way.

122
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,780
Alright, then.

123
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,720
I shouldn't buy it then.

124
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,700
How could you not buy it?

125
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,860
You've made your selection.

126
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,660
Buy it, then.

127
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,560
As long as you're happy.

128
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:26,820
Payment's done.

129
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,820
Thank you, Mr. Huo.

130
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,300
Let me help you.

131
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,500
I got it. I got it.

132
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,340
We're leaving now.

133
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,340
Take care.

134
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,100
Come back again next time!

135
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:37,780
Sure.

136
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,060
Why do I feel like

137
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,140
there's something special
between Dingding and you?

138
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,984
Your ex-girlfriend?

139
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,860
Sweetheart, what are you thinking?

140
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,740
That girl is Tang Yu's sister,

141
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,384
someone I've seen grow up
since childhood.

142
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,820
She's like a sister to me.

143
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,860
She is Mr. Tang's sister?

144
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,500
But as a woman, my intuition tells me

145
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:02,740
that she's not simple.

146
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,140
You see her as a sister,

147
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,900
but she might not see you as a brother.

148
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,620
Don't worry. Stop thinking about it.

149
00:06:10,816 --> 00:06:12,240
You're the only one in my heart.

150
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,860
Let's go home.

151
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,700
Tang Xin.

152
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,940
There's a bit of an unexpected situation
with Mr. Lu now.

153
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,340
Are you not planning
to bring the project back?

154
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:38,900
My brother actually...

155
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,620
Your intentions
aren't about the project.

156
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,820
I've already
signed a contract with Mr. Lu.

157
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,060
I can't just back out now.

158
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,260
But aren't you worried the project
will be shelved for years?

159
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,820
Like the situation in Time last time.

160
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,460
How can it be the same?

161
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,420
Your brother
simply doesn't like my novel.

162
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,500
My brother isn't...

163
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,620
Alright, Dingding.

164
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,824
Stop explaining for your brother.

165
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,380
I trust Mr. Lu.

166
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,140
And I've already

167
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,140
planned to buy a house
near Mr. Lu's studio.

168
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,420
That way, I can

169
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,060
fully immerse myself in my writing.

170
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,420
You promised me, remember?

171
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,300
Once the movie comes out,

172
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,408
you owe me a private screening.

173
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,340
Yeah.

174
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,500
Have you found any house yet?

175
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,020
Not yet.

176
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,060
It's hard to find a good house nearby.

177
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,580
Then hand it over to me.

178
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,300
My eldest uncle works in real estate.

179
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,660
I can ask my cousin about it.

180
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,660
You can trust me with this.

181
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,420
Okay.

182
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,500
I'll count on you then.

183
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,100
No problem.

184
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,208
Please come in.

185
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,616
Are you looking for me?

186
00:07:59,020 --> 00:07:59,420
Take a seat.

187
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:05,940
Here.

188
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:08,740
Thanks.

189
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,312
Are you here
to process your resignation?

190
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,180
Oh, right.

191
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,780
I heard

192
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,380
that Wan Li might be

193
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,980
leaving Lu Zhixing's screenwriting team.

194
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,620
Mr. Tang, you got quite the scoop.

195
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,340
Feng Cheng and Wan Li
are the stars of Lu Zhixing's team.

196
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,100
Losing one of them would greatly

197
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,300
impact his investments.

198
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,780
It could also
affect the development progress.

199
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:37,980
I know.

200
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,180
Perhaps you should consider

201
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,420
bringing "A Dream for You" back to Time.

202
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,780
At least,
there will be some financial security.

203
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,340
Moreover,

204
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,220
I really like this project too.

205
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,020
Are you sure

206
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,100
that you really like it?

207
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,500
Lately,
I've watched a lot of romance movies.

208
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,420
I've also
analyzed content and market trends.

209
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,300
Although these stories

210
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:07,420
don't have intense events or plots,

211
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,576
the emotions of the characters
are quite delicate and authentic.

212
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:13,136
It creates a sense of empathy
for the audience.

213
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,780
I really like "A Dream for You".

214
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,220
Besides recognizing it

215
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,420
from a professional perspective

216
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,660
as having great market potential
to help Time expand its audience base,

217
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,460
I personally enjoy this story.

218
00:09:28,832 --> 00:09:29,888
It's the first romance novel

219
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,020
I've read in one sitting

220
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,780
from start to finish.

221
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,460
Since you're here today,

222
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,780
I have a few chapters...

223
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,260
Mr. Tang.

224
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,856
The screenwriter of "The Beginning"
has arrived.

225
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,340
Mr. Tang.

226
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,792
Thank you for your kindness and support.

227
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,140
But I can't rely on others
for everything.

228
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,220
Regarding "A Dream for You",

229
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,920
Mr. Lu and I are already working on it.

230
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,100
If you really like it,

231
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,380
I'll invite you once the movie's out.

232
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,216
A private screening.

233
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,740
I'll treat the whole company to that.

234
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,540
I'll get going.

235
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:27,940
Hello, Mr. Lu.

236
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,340
Are you free to swing by the studio now?

237
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,820
Yes, I am.

238
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,420
Me?

239
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,580
As the lead screenwriter?

240
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,220
Yes.

241
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,260
Wan Li just underwent surgery.

242
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,420
He needs rest,

243
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,780
so he won't be able to
proceed with the project.

244
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,060
I know it's a sudden decision.

245
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,660
But now,

246
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,980
you're the best choice.

247
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,780
And most importantly,

248
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:52,860
Tang Xin,

249
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,380
you're the original author.

250
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,700
You understand the work better

251
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,900
and can also invest more emotions
into the creation.

252
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,140
So,

253
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,540
Tang Xin,

254
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,860
are you willing

255
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,140
to work with Feng
as the lead screenwriter?

256
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,540
Don't hesitate.

257
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,580
We both have faith in you.

258
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:14,700
Of course,

259
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,780
the decision to take on this role

260
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,100
is entirely up to you.

261
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,580
Mr. Lu.

262
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,180
I'll give my all

263
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,300
to collaborate with Mr. Feng
on the script.

264
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,100
Wishing us

265
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,768
a pleasant collaboration!

266
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,740
("A Dream for You"
Screenplay by Tang Xin)

267
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,560
(October 9, 2018)

268
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,860
("A Dream for You"
Screenplay by Feng Cheng & Tang Xin)

269
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,860
(December 14, 2021)

270
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,300
Everyone knows
Feng Cheng and Wan Li

271
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,580
are your right-hand men.

272
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,020
Given the current situation,

273
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,020
will it affect the project's outcome?

274
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,140
We're a bit worried about that.

275
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,460
I understand.

276
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,900
As for the investment,

277
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,420
let's discuss it some other time.

278
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,340
Actually, this matter

279
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,220
isn't complicated.

280
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,460
In my opinion,

281
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:39,340
the easiest solution

282
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,820
is to hire a movie star.

283
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,700
(Once there's a buzz,)

284
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,820
(the box office)

285
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,300
(won't be a concern.)

286
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,380
(Speaking of which,)

287
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,340
(I happen to know someone...)

288
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,780
Mr. Zhu, hold on a moment.

289
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,140
I just have one request.

290
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,220
To act in my film,

291
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,890
she needs to train in advance
for three months.

292
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,700
Can she do it?

293
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,340
(Stars create the buzz.)

294
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,460
As for the supportive roles,

295
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,620
a few veteran actors
will do the trick, right?

296
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,940
Mr. Zhu, acting skills can be trained,

297
00:13:05,264 --> 00:13:06,500
but my bottom line for actors is

298
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,832
that they must at least
respect their job and the project.

299
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,540
If they can't do this,

300
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:12,980
then forget about it.

301
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,180
Zhu Jiang?

302
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,240
Introducing actors again?

303
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,380
Taking advantage, huh?

304
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:20,980
What a jerk.

305
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,260
But he did remind me.

306
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,820
It's time for casting decisions.

307
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,500
Tang Xin.

308
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,460
Do you have any thoughts
on the main cast?

309
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,940
Actually, I was writing the novel

310
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,340
with Peng Zhou and Lu Chuning in mind.

311
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,940
We can talk to Peng Zhou.

312
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,380
But Lu Chuning has transitioned
to playing mature roles, right?

313
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,180
She might not fit the role anymore.

314
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:43,900
There's someone else.

315
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,260
Zhou Jialu.

316
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:46,380
What do you think?

317
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,740
I heard she's not available

318
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,980
until the year after next.

319
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,860
In that case,
let me check with her first.

320
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,300
If she's not available,

321
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,380
we'll have to scout
for new actors at film schools.

322
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,580
That's okay.

323
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,940
Our female lead is

324
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,860
the naive and unsophisticated type,
anyway.

325
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,940
Perhaps a new actress
would be better.

326
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,100
Yeah, that's what I mean.

327
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,660
I don't think we need to rush
about the actors now.

328
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,500
As soon as you make this call,

329
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,540
Dajiang's investment
will be basically gone.

330
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,380
What's your plan after this?

331
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,980
Actually, Time reached out to me,

332
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,220
saying they're interested.

333
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:22,060
Time?

334
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,100
You mean Time Pictures,
my former employer?

335
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,060
Or is it another company?

336
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,220
There is only one film company
that has "Time"

337
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:28,980
in their name.

338
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,260
Wait a second.

339
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,860
Time previously owned the rights
to Tang's work

340
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,900
but didn't produce it.

341
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,540
Now, after we bought the rights,

342
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,880
they want to collaborate with us.

343
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,740
That's absurd.

344
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,820
Anyway, Time

345
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,020
has already called twice.

346
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,220
Should we arrange to meet them?

347
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,420
Sure, it's up to you.

348
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,980
I'll call to set up a meeting then.

349
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,180
(Tang Yu, you pig head.)

350
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,820
(I've already moved on,)

351
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,380
(but you're still relentless.)

352
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,020
Waiting for me?

353
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,060
Tang Yu.

354
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,660
Just what are you up to?

355
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,500
What do you mean by that?

356
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,140
When my novel was with Time before,

357
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,260
you never bothered to adapt it.

358
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,060
Now that I'm gone,

359
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,512
you're seeking
to renew the contract with me?

360
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,220
I've made it clear to you

361
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,860
that I won't work with Time anymore.

362
00:15:52,624 --> 00:15:53,980
What's the point of you coming here

363
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,120
to talk about investment now?

364
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,020
Do you have nowhere to spend your money?

365
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,980
Are you throwing money at me?

366
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,100
You like my money, don't you?

367
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,860
Does it upset you

368
00:16:07,152 --> 00:16:08,420
that I'm throwing money at you?

369
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,520
Are you really this mad?

370
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,168
Don't want me to intervene?

371
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:26,540
Tang Xin.

372
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,140
Mr. Lu.

373
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:32,740
Mr. Tang, you're right on time.

374
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,380
Mr. Tang.

375
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,380
I'm sincere about this.

376
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,940
Let's go. I'm hungry.

377
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,660
Let's eat first.

378
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:50,740
Let's go.

379
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,180
Come on.

380
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,820
Quit standing around.

381
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,140
Tang Xin, I'll tell you what,

382
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,380
this place is really good.

383
00:16:59,140 --> 00:16:59,900
Ask Lu about it.

384
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,820
Isn't that right, Lu?

385
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:01,980
It's nice.

386
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,820
Just nice?

387
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,220
The view here is pretty nice.

388
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:06,260
Yeah.

389
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:08,220
Just don't fall into the sea.

390
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,740
Feel free to sit down
and check out our menu.

391
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,020
Here, take a look.

392
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:17,700
Thanks.

393
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,100
Here, this is yours.

394
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,140
Tang Xin.

395
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,660
You do the ordering.

396
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,980
I don't know what's good.

397
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,860
You go ahead, Mr. Tang.

398
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,900
Just order whatever you like to eat.

399
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,780
It's okay to order a bit more.

400
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:54,420
I'll do the ordering.

401
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,100
Let's go easy on Tang Xin.

402
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,260
In the many years I've known you,

403
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,460
it's the first time

404
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,180
I've seen you so eager to order food.

405
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,580
I'm a simple person.

406
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,900
I order what I like to eat

407
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,220
and buy what I want,

408
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,540
unlike you,

409
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,060
who is unpredictable.

410
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,820
One's tastes can change over time.

411
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,420
Not liking something before

412
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,460
doesn't mean that I don't like it now.

413
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,740
Mr. Tang, are you talking
about me or the book?

414
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,220
I'm talking about...

415
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:31,540
During the four years
my book remained with Time,

416
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,740
you never cared about it.

417
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,940
Now you suddenly say you like it.

418
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,220
Mr. Tang.

419
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,340
Your tastes are really fickle.

420
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:42,940
I'm hungry, Mr. Lu.

421
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:43,920
Let's order something to eat.

422
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:44,620
Go get seated.

423
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,060
Sure.

424
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:59,580
I'll invest 100% in the film.

425
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,780
Apart from that,

426
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,860
nothing else changes.

427
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,500
Your team, your crew,

428
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,020
which actors you choose,

429
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,500
I'll stay out of them.

430
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,100
Mr. Tang, you're generous indeed.

431
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,380
But our script

432
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,620
is still in its initial stages.

433
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,980
Are you sure you won't reconsider?

434
00:19:22,064 --> 00:19:22,860
Don't act on impulse

435
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,100
and regret it later.

436
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,620
My only regret now

437
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,860
is not producing "A Dream For You"

438
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,100
within the copyright period.

439
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,300
But I'll make up for my mistake.

440
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,140
Apart from the investment,

441
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,620
upon the film's release,

442
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,500
Time Pictures will give priority

443
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,820
to the screening of this film.

444
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,020
Mr. Tang.

445
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,060
You're rich indeed.

446
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,100
It's nice.

447
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,500
But we still need to think about it.

448
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,380
I believe no one else

449
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,940
can make a better offer than I have.

450
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,140
If you've thought it over,

451
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,380
you can contact me anytime.

452
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,380
Alright.

453
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:06,640
We'll definitely consider it seriously.

454
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,340
Lu.

455
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,980
Tang Yu's offer is pretty good.

456
00:20:17,264 --> 00:20:18,280
There aren't many companies

457
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,872
in the industry
making such a good offer.

458
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,380
That's true.

459
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,460
Then why didn't you accept it?

460
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,520
Playing hard to get?

461
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,060
I just feel

462
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,580
that Tang Xin doesn't actually want
to collaborate with him.

463
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,980
They might

464
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,260
have a history.

465
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,060
Lu.

466
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,620
I'd advise you

467
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,980
not to let personal feelings
affect your work.

468
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:39,620
I...

469
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,980
Do you have feelings for Tang Xin?

470
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,700
You're overthinking it.

471
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,140
First of all,

472
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,020
our film doesn't lack investors.

473
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,140
Secondly,

474
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,260
what I mean is,

475
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,380
that we don't have to force a girl

476
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,140
into unwillingly signing the agreement.

477
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,140
It's unnecessary.

478
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,060
I'll ask Tang Xin what she thinks.

479
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,220
Lu.

480
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,860
That's hardly the grace
of a learned man.

481
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,540
You're love-struck.

482
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,780
You're irredeemable.

483
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,300
Tang Xin.

484
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,340
Mr. Tang, what exactly do you want?

485
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,380
Tang Xin, can't we talk nicely?

486
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,060
Tang Xin.

487
00:21:59,020 --> 00:21:59,540
Mr. Lu.

488
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,540
Are you all right?

489
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,140
Yeah, I'm OK.

490
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,260
I'll be heading back soon.

491
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,780
Thanks for the meal, Mr. Tang.

492
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,780
It was very tasty.

493
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,620
You're welcome.

494
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,580
I'm off.

495
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:10,940
Drive safely.

496
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,520
I'll do the ordering.

497
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,380
Let's go easy on Tang Xin.

498
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,740
What's wrong with me?

499
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,500
Tang Yu.

500
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,780
Are you jealous?

501
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,140
Jealous?

502
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:06,780
Jealous of whom?

503
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,060
Tang Dingding, why are you here?

504
00:23:09,232 --> 00:23:10,816
Why aren't you going home
at this late hour?

505
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,860
Actually, I...

506
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,700
Did you drink?

507
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,140
I had a little bit of alcohol.

508
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,620
I'm afraid that if I go home,

509
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,140
Dad will find out and scold me.

510
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,060
So, I told him

511
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,460
that I'm staying here tonight.

512
00:23:36,176 --> 00:23:37,340
You're afraid of Dad scolding you

513
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,620
but not afraid of me?

514
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,740
Didn't I tell you before

515
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,620
that girls should drink less?

516
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,100
I'm not a child anymore.

517
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,620
Stop always acting like an old stubborn.

518
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,500
Now you dare to drink in front of me?

519
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:56,780
Tang Dingding.

520
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,360
Do you believe that in a while,
I'll have the driver take you back?

521
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,940
Aren't you also
drowning your sorrows in alcohol?

522
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,380
Tang Dingding.

523
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,060
Alright, I was wrong.
I won't do it again.

524
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,620
That's about right.

525
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,380
Yu.

526
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,300
Actually, today I found a job,

527
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,700
and I was happy,
so I had a few extra drinks.

528
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,380
What job did you find?

529
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,020
As a fashion model.

530
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,300
I think

531
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,260
if I do well,

532
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,580
maybe next month

533
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,008
I won't need your pocket money anymore.

534
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,100
A fashion model?

535
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:36,980
Do you like it?

536
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,460
Yes.

537
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,620
Alright.

538
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,780
Let me ask you.

539
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,220
Do you know the top

540
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,140
fashion model agencies in China?

541
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,940
Also, which major magazines

542
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,020
do they collaborate with,

543
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,820
and what is the shooting style
of these magazines?

544
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,820
I just started

545
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,140
liking it not long ago.

546
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,620
Alright.

547
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,140
Since you like it, let me ask you.

548
00:25:03,312 --> 00:25:05,740
You should at least know
what this industry is about, right?

549
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,900
Including who

550
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,620
you will meet in your future work,

551
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,340
what your role is,

552
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,220
and what your future
development direction is.

553
00:25:12,464 --> 00:25:14,032
You have to be clear about these things.

554
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,380
I'm clear.

555
00:25:18,672 --> 00:25:20,528
It seems
you don't understand it deeply enough.

556
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,420
You don't really like it.

557
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:25,300
Dingding.

558
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:27,740
You want to be a fashion model

559
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,140
just because Huo Chendong

560
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,300
is dating a fashion model girlfriend,
right?

561
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:38,100
Yu, how do you know everything?

562
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,420
Give up on those childish thoughts.

563
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,580
Starting tomorrow,

564
00:25:41,616 --> 00:25:43,104
officially come to the company to work.

565
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,700
Yu.

566
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,220
I won't go.

567
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,260
Am I not clear enough?

568
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,580
Starting tomorrow,

569
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,980
go to the company to work.

570
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,500
Yu.

571
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:03,180
Fine, I'll go, okay?

572
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,540
Don't be angry.

573
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,540
Yu, I have good news to share with you.

574
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,100
Not interested.

575
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,900
It's about Tang Xin.

576
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,940
She's buying a house.
It's such a big deal,

577
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,660
I won't tell you anymore.

578
00:26:27,408 --> 00:26:28,432
Who's buying a house?

579
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,380
I thought you weren't interested.

580
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,260
Who said I'm not interested?

581
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,820
Do you know
what "well-placed connections" means?

582
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,220
Let me tell you.

583
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,500
If I tell you,

584
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,500
you can't get angry
about the fashion model thing anymore.

585
00:27:03,184 --> 00:27:04,580
What kind of house does she want?

586
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,700
In our community, it's convenient.

587
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,980
On the left is a hospital,
and on the right is a shopping mall.

588
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,540
And parking is very convenient.

589
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,100
This place is really good.

590
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,940
Miss Tang.

591
00:27:26,016 --> 00:27:27,420
What do you think about this house?

592
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,860
After seeing it inside and out,

593
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,020
how do you feel?

594
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,220
To be honest,

595
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,060
this house is the best
I've seen recently.

596
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:37,300
Whether it's the layout, area,

597
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,220
or lighting,

598
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,340
it's all very good.

599
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,060
But

600
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,380
the price...

601
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,700
I'm afraid I can't accept it.

602
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:46,060
As for the price, rest assured.

603
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,180
I just finished a call.

604
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,100
It's completely within your budget.

605
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,740
Really?

606
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:50,700
Of course.

607
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,260
As long as you're satisfied
with the house,

608
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:53,740
we can proceed
with the paperwork right now.

609
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,380
You can move in right away.

610
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,100
Alright.

611
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,980
You see, I told you.

612
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,220
I could sort it out for you.

613
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,660
My cousin

614
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,700
may not have other skills,

615
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,208
but he has plenty
of real estate listings.

616
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,100
The men of the Tang family

617
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,180
really are all cut out for business.

618
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,820
You're right.

619
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:15,060
He became a different person
after growing up.

620
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,900
When I talked to him,

621
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,980
he never paid attention to me,

622
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,140
treating me like a child.

623
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,660
But this time is different.

624
00:28:20,912 --> 00:28:23,660
As soon as I mentioned housing,
he found a house for me the next day.

625
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,300
Thank you, Miss Tang Dingding.

626
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,140
You're welcome.

627
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:27,984
Get in the car quickly.

628
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,300
Call me when you move.

629
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:32,860
Of course.

630
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,220
Tang Xin?

631
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,540
Mr. Lu.

632
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,660
Why haven't you gone home so late?

633
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,460
I'll go home after finishing this scene.

634
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,620
I heard you're moving.

635
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:12,100
Let me know when.

636
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,340
I'll have everyone help you.

637
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,100
No need.

638
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,180
I've already packed my things

639
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,420
and arranged a moving company.

640
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,900
Too many people won't be able to help.

641
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,740
Alright.

642
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,780
You continue.

643
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,300
Okay.

644
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,100
Mr. Lu.

645
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,540
Yes?

646
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,420
Can I ask you a question?

647
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,660
Don't.

648
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:33,140
Please sit.

649
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,540
I'll sit and talk.

650
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,500
Mr. Lu.

651
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,740
Have you considered working with Time?

652
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,100
Tang Xin.

653
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,380
Actually, I have a question for you too.

654
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,340
Ask away.

655
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,780
Did you date Tang Yu?

656
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,260
Is he your ex-boyfriend?

657
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,260
No.

658
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,220
But I did confess to him before.

659
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,140
He rejected me,

660
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,900
saying we weren't a good fit.

661
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,740
So, it doesn't count as an ex.

662
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,700
This is a bit unexpected.

663
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,100
I can't hide

664
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,340
this matter anyway.

665
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,780
I guess everyone figured out

666
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,016
that something was off between us.

667
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,300
Who knows he will suddenly insist on

668
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,420
participating in this project?

669
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,500
Tang Yu

670
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,140
doesn't play by the rules.

671
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,980
Maybe he wants to win you back.

672
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,060
Don't joke with me.

673
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,380
I'm not that valuable.

674
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,220
You are.

675
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,008
Both you and your novel are valuable.

676
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,180
It's like this.

677
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,700
My movie doesn't lack investment.

678
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,300
Dajiang won't invest,

679
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,540
and we have more options than just Time.

680
00:30:59,264 --> 00:31:00,460
If you're uncomfortable with it,

681
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,380
just forget it.

682
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,100
No.

683
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,020
That's not what I meant.

684
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,896
I just wanted to say
that you don't need to consider me.

685
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,060
If you think it's suitable, just sign it.

686
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,820
The progress of the project
is most important.

687
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,860
Let's talk about it later, then.

688
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,980
There's no rush anyway.

689
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,020
Alright.

690
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:19,700
Well,

691
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,500
hurry up and write.

692
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,340
Don't stay up too late.

693
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,140
Okay.

694
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,620
Take care when going back.

695
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:26,460
Alright.

696
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,300
Bye.

697
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:28,700
Okay.

698
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,560
Hurry up and write. Ensure the quality.

699
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,100
(Win me back?)

700
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:42,820
(Impossible, right?)

701
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,820
(It's impossible.)

702
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,180
(He doesn't like me.
Win me back? No way.)

703
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:58,980
Hello?

704
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,380
Miss You.

705
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,340
Let me tell you.

706
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,940
Tang Dingding's efficiency
this time is surprisingly high.

707
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,900
In less than a week,

708
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,940
she found the house I wanted for me.

709
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,660
It's a super large single apartment.

710
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,580
Where did she find the house?

711
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,340
(It's from her cousin.)

712
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,580
(He's in real estate.)

713
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,620
(The owner wanted to sell urgently,)

714
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,620
(so the house price
is relatively cheap.)

715
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,940
Where did my stuff go?

716
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,460
Why can't I find it?

717
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:26,100
You're moving so unexpectedly.

718
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,700
Hey, just leave it for now.

719
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,488
I'll come over to help you
after I finish my work.

720
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:30,940
No need.

721
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,180
I can handle it myself.

722
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:32,940
Thanks.

723
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:35,300
I'll talk to you later.

724
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,220
Talk to you later.

725
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,740
My delivery is here. Bye.

726
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:41,940
Coming.

727
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,260
Thank you.

728
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,380
Come in.

729
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,500
Just...

730
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,380
Just put it anywhere.

731
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,140
Thank you.

732
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:02,820
These are quite heavy.

733
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,220
Why are you here?

734
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,060
I saw your delivery downstairs,

735
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,352
so I brought them over for you.

736
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,660
You didn't follow me here, did you?

737
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,620
Dingding said you're moving today.

738
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,780
I happened to be nearby,

739
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,780
so I came to take a look.

740
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,056
The house is pretty good.

741
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:23,340
Yes, it's quite nice.

742
00:33:24,064 --> 00:33:25,184
You're done looking, right?

743
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:25,900
This way.

744
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:26,660
Please leave.

745
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,140
Since I'm here,

746
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,940
there is so much stuff,

747
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:30,140
let me help you tidy up a bit.

748
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,656
Let me see
if there's anything I can help.

749
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,660
This is still not in place.

750
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,432
Wait a moment.

751
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,460
Don't touch my things.

752
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:35,980
Put it down.

753
00:33:39,552 --> 00:33:40,740
What exactly are you here for?

754
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:41,820
To show kindness.

755
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,020
To improve relations.

756
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,900
Is that answer satisfactory?

757
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,260
Not bad.

758
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,540
Since you're here to show kindness,

759
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,100
these boxes of books are too heavy.

760
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:01,980
I can't move them.

761
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,584
Sure, where should I move them to?

762
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,220
The study.

763
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:07,500
Alright.

764
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,020
Is there anything else I can do for you?

765
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,700
No.

766
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,380
Double-check.

767
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,620
See if there's anything.

768
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,712
There's something.

769
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,180
When you leave later,

770
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,820
please help me close the door.

771
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,380
Thanks.

772
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,620
I've been working for a while.

773
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,820
Shouldn't you offer a glass of water?

774
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,260
You can find water yourself.

775
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,100
It seems

776
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,140
this bottle is it.

777
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,540
You can have it.

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,100
