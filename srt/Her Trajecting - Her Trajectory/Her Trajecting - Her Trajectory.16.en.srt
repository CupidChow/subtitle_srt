00:00:58,870 --> 00:00:59,470
Shu Yan!

5
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,370
Shu Yan, this is very dangerous.

6
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,600
What are you doing?

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,470
I'm fine, Mr. Shen.

8
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,030
Don't be so close to me.
It's bad if they capture footage of us.

9
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,640
You need to learn
how to protect yourself.

10
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,170
How can you change your fate
if you don't protect yourself?

11
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,800
Changing fate

12
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,370
is not easy.

13
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:25,430
I'm fine.

14
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,130
Don't worry.

15
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,370
But I might be able
to change fate this time.

16
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:35,530
What do you mean?

17
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:37,630
Look.

18
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:38,770
That box.

19
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,030
In the previous life,

20
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,320
Han Tianyu helped Ye Wei
obtain this high-class ingredient.

21
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,800
Before we came here,
Han Tianyu borrowed money from me.

22
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,570
I'm guessing
that he wants to buy a necklace.

23
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,730
This is his way of pursuing a girl.

24
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:54,330
I received this necklace
in my previous life.

25
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm guessing that he will
give it to Ye Wei in this life.

26
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,770
In that case,

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,530
the fate should be changed.

28
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,300
Let's go.

29
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,330
They are still filming in front.

30
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,030
All right.

31
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,200
Let me carry you out of here.

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,640
All right.

33
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:29,700
Slow down.

34
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:31,770
Thank you.

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,730
Where's the ingredient
you told me about?

36
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,070
Maybe

37
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,400
someone else took it.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,600
It's all right.

39
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,330
I'll help you find it.

40
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,170
Then,

41
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,330
will your teammate be upset?

42
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,070
She won't.

43
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,730
You should rest since you hurt your leg.

44
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,680
I'll help you find it
and bring it to you.

45
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,900
Shu Yan.

46
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,130
Where did you find the box
that you're holding?

47
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,170
This?

48
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:24,370
I fished it out from the water.

49
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,000
I saw it previously too.

50
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,030
You will give it to me, right?

51
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,530
Wei,

52
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,070
can I not give it to you this time?

53
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,830
I finally teamed up with Tianyu.

54
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,100
I want to win.

55
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,300
Don't move.

56
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,570
My hair!

57
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,630
Your hair is caught in my bracelet.

58
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,330
The more you move, the more it hurts.

59
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,170
Wei.

60
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:03,930
This...

61
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,730
The bracelet is too annoying.

62
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,800
I'll go back and fix it.

63
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,840
Your hair is caught in it.
I hope it doesn't hurt.

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,130
If you didn't try to take my box,

65
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:12,930
you wouldn't get caught, right?

66
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,800
Go and fix your hair.

67
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,500
It's a mess now.

68
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,530
I'll be heading over.

69
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,370
What's wrong with me?

70
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,700
Why did I snap when I saw her?

71
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,160
(Happiness Food Diary)

72
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,370
I'm sure all of you
have found various ingredients.

73
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,430
All of you are very excellent.

74
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,270
Next, let me announce

75
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,900
the team that receives

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,830
the most points in ingredients is...

77
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,970
Which team is it, Director?

78
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,700
Take a guess.

79
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,970
I can't.

80
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,370
It's us.

81
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,500
Applause!

82
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,630
Good!

83
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,000
It's getting late.

84
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:06,470
I still have some work to do.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,770
I'm leaving first.

86
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:08,770
Eat without me.

87
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,270
Go on.

88
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,070
Stay safe.

89
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:10,730
I'm leaving then.

90
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,330
Bye.

91
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,870
Be careful.

92
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,430
Shu Yan!

93
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:36,630
What are you doing?

94
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,300
You knew

95
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:38,330
I wanted to win.

96
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,870
I want to win too.

97
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,600
I thought you didn't care about winning.

98
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,030
That's because I was
always going easy on you in the past.

99
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,130
Going easy on me?

100
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,630
Don't you think so?

101
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,560
Who are you to treat me like that?

102
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
What did I do to you?

103
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,100
You didn't go easy on me.

104
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,760
I thought our relationship
would still be the same

105
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,970
after you changed.

106
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,300
But you are

107
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,970
making me into an evil person now.

108
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,630
I will tell you honestly.

109
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,770
You are a bad person.

110
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,100
I hate you so much.
I wanted to pretend for a while longer.

111
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,300
Since you've discovered it,

112
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,370
there's no need for me
to keep pretending anymore.

113
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,230
Let me tell you.

114
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,200
You are a pretentious woman.

115
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,200
You were pretending
to be innocent and pitiful

116
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,470
and tried to make my things yours.

117
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:32,000
Calling you a pretentious woman
is an understatement.

118
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,270
You were going easy on me

119
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,330
and I'm used
to having you go easy on me.

120
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,370
Now, you call me pretentious.

121
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:41,320
Whose fault is it
that makes me into who I am?

122
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,530
It's all because of you!
Why do you treat me like this?

123
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,430
Yes.

124
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,440
So, I regret it now.

125
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,640
I want to change.
I don't want to go easy on you anymore.

126
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,070
How's that?

127
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,270
I will marry Han Tianyu soon.

128
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,300
I know

129
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,270
you like Han Tianyu

130
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,470
and you want to make him yours again.

131
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,030
But this time,

132
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,570
I will not give it to you anymore.

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,670
Han Tianyu will never marry you.

134
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,630
So, please don't

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,630
interrupt us again.

136
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,500
Shu Yan, come back!

137
00:07:36,192 --> 00:07:37,992
I think I've become a very bad person.

138
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,370
It was Ye Wei who did something wrong

139
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,670
and I said
what I should have said to her.

140
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,930
But why do I feel so sad?

141
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,930
Because you are kind

142
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,570
so you feel sad about hurting someone.

143
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,370
However, I know clearly in my heart

144
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,080
that you only did
what you were supposed to.

145
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,570
Moreover, you did well.

146
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:05,200
(Ye Wei must be thinking about
how to get revenge on me.)

147
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,600
(If she thinks)

148
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,500
(I treat her in that way
because of Han Tianyu,)

149
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,870
(she should be taking action soon.)

150
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,600
Wei.

151
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,170
What are you doing here?

152
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,730
Did something happen?

153
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,500
Why are you here?

154
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,730
You don't seem like yourself.

155
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,330
I'm fine.

156
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,500
I just feel

157
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,130
a little sad.

158
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,000
Wei.

159
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:40,000
Wei!

160
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:43,600
Wei!

161
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:45,900
Wei.

162
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,030
Wei.

163
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,200
Stop following me.

164
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,930
I'm worried about you.

165
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,800
Do you need me to comfort you?

166
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,430
How can you comfort me?

167
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,900
You're going to marry Shu Yan soon.

168
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,970
How can you comfort me?

169
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,070
Perhaps I've had too much
to drink as well.

170
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,530
I only want to cherish
the person in front of me.

171
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,670
Our filming
was very successful this time.

172
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,830
It's all thanks to
your and Shu Wei's persistence.

173
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,130
We must thank
Wang Xu's termination as well.

174
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,870
That is how we can come up
with such a good proposal.

175
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,430
Indeed.

176
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,030
Is this some kind of
animal mating noise?

177
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,440
Let's go and take a look. All right?

178
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,670
I don't think you should.

179
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,570
Why don't you let me go?

180
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:03,500
I like watching Animal Planet.

181
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,930
You've worked the whole day.

182
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,400
Moreover, you were bitten by a snake.

183
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,900
What if you see a snake again?

184
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,300
You are right.

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,670
All right then.

186
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,070
Chu Chen,

187
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,600
what's wrong with you?

188
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm fine.

189
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,100
Isn't Shu Yan with you?

190
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,170
I think Mr. Shen
has gone to look for Shu Yan.

191
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,270
In the past, I like Ye Wei a lot.

192
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,570
When I first met her at 15,

193
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,970
she was like a ray of light to me.

194
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,230
She appeared in my life

195
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:42,900
when I was at my lowest.

196
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,300
Han Tianyu too.

197
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:50,030
However, I realised he was a jerk

198
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:52,070
after we got married.

199
00:10:52,472 --> 00:10:53,992
He scolded and beat me up every day.

200
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,630
He even tried to kill me for insurance.

201
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,770
Why was I so foolish back then?

202
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,200
If I had realised sooner,

203
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,270
perhaps everything would be different.

204
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,830
Everything is over now.

205
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:31,770
I thought I'd always be alone
without help.

206
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,300
Thankfully, I have you around.

207
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,330
Thank you, Shen Weizhou.

208
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,070
Do you know?

209
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,430
I'm really lucky

210
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,470
to meet you.

211
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,930
I'm also grateful

212
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,770
to hear you tell me

213
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,430
all your feelings.

214
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,400
I am really happy.

215
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,960
It'll be the holidays two days later.
Where are you going?

216
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,040
Playing games at the dorm.

217
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,630
Baby,

218
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,730
aren't you worried about me?

219
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,270
I was drunk last night.

220
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,400
Were you really drunk?

221
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,330
Of course.

222
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,630
I would've looked for you
if I wasn't drunk.

223
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,330
No.

224
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:04,000
Yesterday, I went to
your room to look for you

225
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:08,470
but no one opened the door for me
when I knocked on your door for so long.

226
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,100
I was very drunk last night

227
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,070
and didn't hear it.

228
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,270
Sorry, baby.

229
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:19,530
That's right.

230
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:20,700
Where's Wei?

231
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,070
How would I know where she is?

232
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,330
We had a small argument.

233
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,000
Did you quarrel?

234
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,730
That's common

235
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,500
between friends.

236
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,730
It'll be fine after two days.

237
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,930
Should we go and have breakfast?

238
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:46,330
Let's go.

239
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:56,270
Ye Wei?

240
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,570
Why are you here?
Aren't you going to eat?

241
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,330
I'm eating.

242
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,240
Oh.

243
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,330
I knocked on your door last night
but no one answered.

244
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,500
Did you go out?

245
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,570
Yes. I had something to do last night.

246
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,030
Don't tell Shu Yan

247
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,570
about what happened tonight.

248
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What do you mean?

249
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,130
Yan didn't want to break up with me.

250
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,270
She will only feel sad if she finds out.

251
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,870
Both of you are good friends too.

252
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,630
Don't ruin your relationship.

253
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,000
This is for your own good.

254
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,000
If we continue this relationship,

255
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:39,200
it's bad for you.

256
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,470
What happened tonight

257
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,800
was wonderful and thrilling.

258
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,700
I hope we can leave
the best memories with each other.

259
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,730
Manager Yang,

260
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,570
can you not get something

261
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,830
the more you want it?

262
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,700
If you are persistent,

263
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,270
I think you won't regret it

264
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,280
even if you don't succeed.

265
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,370
Come on.

266
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,080
Let's go and eat.

267
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,670
Sure.

268
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:23,870
Let's go.

269
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,330
This is not bad.

270
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,630
Yes.

271
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,030
This is good, right?

272
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,130
When we want to have a leisure meal

273
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,720
and eat something good,
we can come here.
