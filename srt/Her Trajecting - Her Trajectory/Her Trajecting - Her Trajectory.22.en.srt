=Episode 22=

4
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,280
Who would've thought
your very first trending topic

5
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,070
would go public

6
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:51,770
in a way like this?

7
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,330
I'm really sorry.

8
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:56,470
Don't apologize to me.

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,400
The company's decided
to suspend your career.

10
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,120
You'll be suspended without pay.

11
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:01,700
From now on, all of your work

12
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,100
will be handed over to Chu Chen.

13
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,730
Any objections?

14
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,030
But Director Bai...

15
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,000
I thought the issue
had already been handled.

16
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,330
I can continue to work
and handle the follow-up.

17
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,130
And which company do you think

18
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,800
would want to work
with a walking PR disaster like you?

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,130
If you're not happy
with this arrangement,

20
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,000
you're free to terminate your contract.

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,870
Okay?

22
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,870
That's not what I meant...

23
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:28,470
Mr. Bai.

24
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,770
You asked

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,530
to see me?

26
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,570
Watch your tone and expression.

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,830
Because of your serious mistake,

28
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,470
the company's artist image
has taken a hit.

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,700
The company has decided

30
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:41,400
to fire you.

31
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,330
I heard Chu Chen took over
Han Tianyu's work

32
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,030
and will be going to Europe
on assignment.

33
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,070
That's great.

34
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,570
Chu Chen is talented, handsome,

35
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,770
and works hard.

36
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,520
He'll get his deserved fame one day.

37
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,330
Oh.

38
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,200
Talented and handsome, huh?

39
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:05,330
What about me?

40
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,470
You?

41
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,430
You're okay, I guess.

42
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,400
So I'm just "okay" now?

43
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,630
I'm joking.

44
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,270
To me, you're the most handsome.

45
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,800
I haven't even asked you

46
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,570
about your love life.

47
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,270
What's your story with Mengya?

48
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,700
Shu Yan.

49
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:33,430
About Mengya...

50
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,970
Don't get so serious.

51
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,470
I wasn't trying
to interrogate you or anything.

52
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,000
I've got enough drama of my own going on,
and you've never asked me about it.

53
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,470
How could I expect you to explain?

54
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:03,540
(Ye Wei)

55
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,370
Why aren't you picking up the phone?

56
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,400
Why?

57
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,970
Trash like you two deserve each other.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,130
That awful woman seduced my idol!

59
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,270
Stay away from this fake.

60
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,000
She clearly isn't a good person.

61
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,630
If someone betrays you in the end,

62
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,630
they were never your real friend.

63
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:27,200
Choose your friends wisely.

64
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,530
Why is everyone attacking me?

65
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,130
Why?

66
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,070
What do you even know?

67
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,570
You're all just
a bunch of keyboard warriors!

68
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,630
We worked on the project together.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,330
You deserved the promotion.
Don't put yourself down.

70
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,270
I've always felt uncomfortable about it.

71
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,570
Like I stole credit from you.

72
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:56,730
Don't feel that way.

73
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,130
I could only do

74
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,070
the creative work

75
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,570
I really wanted to do

76
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,370
because you were the manager.

77
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,230
You made it possible

78
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:05,730
for me to fully shine.

79
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,370
I'm genuinely happy

80
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,630
to have you as my boss.

81
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,430
Yan!

82
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,230
Yan! Something's wrong!

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,170
Come quick!
Something's happening downstairs!

84
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,230
Let's go.

85
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:18,770
Shu Yan!

86
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,470
Show yourself!

87
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,430
Come out!

88
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:22,000
I'm Shu Yan's direct supervisor.

89
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,500
You can talk to me instead.

90
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,570
Did something like that

91
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:25,480
and now she's hiding?

92
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,120
Tell her to come down here.
We want to confront her face to face.

93
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,300
This is the company lobby.

94
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,430
Please don't make a scene.

95
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,320
Stop stalling already!

96
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:31,900
Bring her out!

97
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,840
Enough of the nonsense.

98
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,030
Are you Shu Yan?

99
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,200
Yes.

100
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,200
Can I ask what this is about?

101
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:44,100
Stop it!

102
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,170
That slap was mild for what she's done.

103
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,170
Ask her what disgusting things
she's been up to!

104
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,330
Even so...

105
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:52,630
Please.

106
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,230
If you're going to slap someone,
at least explain why.

107
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,430
I'd like to know

108
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,000
how exactly did I offend the two of you?

109
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,700
Do you think
we're using this as an excuse

110
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,000
to ask for compensation?

111
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,360
Isn't the penalty supposed to be paid
by the party who breached the contract?

112
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,830
If we had gone directly
to your company back then,

113
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,200
you'd be paying a whole lot more.

114
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,840
And now, after screwing up your own job,

115
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,630
you accuse us of being scammers.

116
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,100
Do you know our entire team

117
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,770
was fired because of this?

118
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,730
You're from the magazine, right?

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,370
You were falsely accused

120
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,600
and lost your jobs over something I did?

121
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,320
Are you saying
you had nothing to do with it?

122
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,400
See for yourself.

123
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,620
(Hello, everyone. I'm Shu Yan
from Norran Entertainment...)

124
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,200
That's not my post.

125
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,930
Someone forged my handwriting

126
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,320
and uploaded it online.

127
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,470
What's that supposed to mean?

128
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,720
You're just too scared
to own up to what you did.

129
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:45,500
You trying

130
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,370
to run away?

131
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,470
Let go of me!

132
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,500
Shu Yan! What do you think you're doing?

133
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,070
You created this mess

134
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,400
just to frame me, didn't you?

135
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,500
Clean it up yourself.

136
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,930
Aren't you Han Tianyu's assistant?

137
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:02,930
She is.

138
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,200
What's the matter with you?

139
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,900
What assistant?

140
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:08,700
Shu Yan.

141
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,430
I've already suffered enough
because of you.

142
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,400
What more do you want?

143
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,800
You think you know me that well?

144
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:19,770
Take a look at this.

145
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,430
("Latest update.
Shu Yan clarifies the truth...")

146
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:22,870
This is...

147
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,430
What a cunning woman.

148
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,430
Trying to twist the story
to clear your own name?

149
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,100
Unbelievable.

150
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,800
Whatever the case,

151
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,170
this situation started because of us.

152
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,430
We'll issue

153
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,130
an official explanation

154
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:41,700
to your company

155
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,730
and restore
your reputations and careers.

156
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,100
We apologize in advance.

157
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,630
Sorry.

158
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,160
I let my temper get the better of me.
I'm really sorry.

159
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,640
It's fine. You didn't know the truth.

160
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,600
The person who owes an apology is her.

161
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,730
She stole her best friend's boyfriend

162
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,830
and created an account
under her name to set her up!

163
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,440
What kind of person does that?

164
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:04,600
Because if she'd used her own account,

165
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:06,170
no one would've believed her.

166
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,530
She's disgusting.

167
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:09,900
I'm sorry.

168
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,270
I...

169
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,970
I've just been through a lot lately.

170
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:14,870
I...

171
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,370
I just got fired from my job.

172
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,130
I only did this

173
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,070
to protect my reputation.

174
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,630
I'm sorry.

175
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:28,800
Shu Yan,

176
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,970
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry...

177
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,800
This way, please. Let's talk over here.

178
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,700
Shu Yan.

179
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,200
Shu Yan!

180
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,900
I've been falling apart.

181
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,570
My emotions are all over the place.

182
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,100
If this keeps up,

183
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,300
I'm scared

184
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,770
I might do something I'll regret.

185
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,300
Shu Yan.

186
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,230
I can't be without you right now.

187
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,830
I need you.

188
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:57,400
Because...

189
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,130
I'm pregnant.

190
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,330
She's pregnant?

191
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,570
Shu Yan's lost it.

192
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,570
Ye Wei's gone completely nuts.

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,770
Why is my life such a mess?

194
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,500
Stuck between these two women...

195
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,230
Can someone please save me?

196
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:02,600
Where am I?

197
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,500
Who are you people?

198
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,400
I'm telling you.

199
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,930
This is a country governed by law.

200
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,270
The police will get you!

201
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,830
Deadbeat who won't pay his debts.

202
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,320
Even if you go to the police,
you're not getting away.

203
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,130
No, wait...

204
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,000
That's not what I meant, sir...

205
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,840
I'm just worried you'll get caught.
I don't want you to get arrested.

206
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,700
Sir.

207
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,800
Just give me a little more time.

208
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,470
I swear I'll pay you back.

209
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,400
When?

210
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:31,630
Give us a deadline.

211
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,370
Within ten days.

212
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,230
I'll repay everything within ten days.

213
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,870
That's what you said last time.

214
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,100
Why should I believe you now?

215
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,870
When I get married,
my parents will buy me a house.

216
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,080
I'll use the house as collateral
and give it to you.

217
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:49,570
Right.

218
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,430
I swear! I'll mortgage it to you!

219
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,730
How's the situation going?

220
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,500
All taken care of.

221
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,640
Nobody recognized you, right?

222
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,770
No. Don't worry. I handled it.

223
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,230
(Good.)

224
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,500
(Time to write)

225
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,300
(the ending to this story.)

226
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,630
Who were you on the phone with?

227
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,530
Lin Yuan.

228
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,330
I had him look into something

229
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,170
for me.

230
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,700
Han Tianyu's financials.

231
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,300
Turns out

232
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,520
he's drowning in high-interest loans
he can't pay back.

233
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,270
He's

234
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,530
unemployed now.

235
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,920
He doesn't have an income.

236
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,170
His parents also took out

237
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,900
a lot of loans just to buy a house.

238
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,200
I'm guessing

239
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,570
he'll try to marry Ye Wei
now that she's pregnant.

240
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,130
I never said anything

241
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,270
because I didn't want to embarrass him,

242
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,270
but Han Tianyu is infertile.

243
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,130
Ye Wei can't be pregnant by him.

244
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,100
Doesn't matter now.

245
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,280
Guess it's just
another one of Ye Wei's schemes.

246
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,280
As long as you're not hurt,
that's all that matters.

247
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,230
Does it hurt?

248
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,300
I'll feel better if you rub it.

249
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:31,400
What's this?

250
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,470
A special dinner
I made for you with love.

251
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,070
You're not still jealous

252
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,700
about Chu Chen's
"special breakfast," are you?

253
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,670
That was ages ago.

254
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:47,270
Don't care.

255
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,900
From now on,

256
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,970
you're only allowed
to eat the breakfast,

257
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,100
lunch,

258
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,270
and dinner I make.

259
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,170
Fine.

260
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,000
Just don't feed me
so much that I get fat.

261
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,670
Bai.

262
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:03,770
Here.

263
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:12,930
You should eat too.

264
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,900
Food always tastes better
when it's shared.

265
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,770
One more bite.

266
00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:28,100
Though,

267
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,130
these noodles taste exactly

268
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,830
like the ones from Xingfu Noodles.

269
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,430
I went to the restaurant,

270
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,970
but they had already moved out.

271
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,630
They moved to another city
to grow their business.

272
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,600
I was worried you'd miss the flavor,

273
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:43,030
so I tracked them down
and learned the recipe from them.

274
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,270
Thank you.

275
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:50,830
Come on, eat up.

276
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:58,300
Wei.

277
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:07,400
I'm not good for anything

278
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,830
except being pretty.

279
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,630
So why are you even here?

280
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,100
Because I know you're pregnant.

281
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,570
And I've been feeling really guilty
ever since I said

282
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,700
those heartless things to you.
I came to check on you.

283
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,870
You feel guilty

284
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,100
because I'm pregnant?

285
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:32,800
Wei.

286
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:37,570
Wei.

287
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,570
I'm really sorry.

288
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:40,900
I...

289
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,930
I said things I shouldn't have.

290
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,600
I didn't mean it.

291
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,300
I just say stupid things

292
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,930
when I'm angry.

293
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,530
Today,

294
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,430
I got down on my knees

295
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,330
and begged Shu Yan to come back to me,

296
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,100
but she still walked away.

297
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,930
You're pregnant with my child.

298
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,200
Shu Yan must be so jealous

299
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,670
because you took away
the man she loves the most.

300
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,500
I thought Shu Yan

301
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,870
would always be on my side.

302
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,270
She saw the awful things

303
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,100
those people did to me today,

304
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,930
but she didn't stand up for me.

305
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,530
Even when I

306
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,500
messed up badly,

307
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,830
she'd always understand me
and support me.

308
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:23,830
Wei.

309
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,800
Trust me.

310
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,870
Even if she's acting cold now,

311
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,300
her eyes don't lie.

312
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,500
She still cares about us.

313
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,500
Look at you.

314
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,030
You're carrying my child.

315
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,730
We can't let our baby grow up
without a father.

316
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,670
Let's get married.

317
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,430
I... I've thought about it.

318
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
I think I really do love you.

319
00:14:49,770 --> 00:14:52,130
We'll have a family of our own.

320
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,070
A family?

321
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:00,000
Yes.

322
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,670
Will you marry me?

323
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,530
Congratulations

324
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,070
on landing the role
in the international film.

325
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,870
I couldn't have done it

326
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,370
without your support.

327
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:15,500
Take care

328
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,970
of yourself overseas, okay?

329
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:20,170
I will, don't worry. You too.
Take care of yourself while I'm gone.

330
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:21,530
But

331
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,930
if you leave,

332
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:25,430
I won't get to eat
your delicious cooking every day.

333
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,030
It's just half a month.

334
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:31,000
I'll be back before you know it.
I'll make it up to you then.

335
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,570
You promise!

336
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,930
Then once you're back,
you have to cook for me every day.

337
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:37,530
For the rest

338
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:38,970
of your life.

339
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:42,870
The rest of my life?

340
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,430
I didn't mean it like that.

341
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,370
Then what did you mean?

342
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,530
Be at the airport when I get back.
I've got something I want to tell you.

343
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:02,930
Okay.

344
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,800
Mr. Chu Chen, when you return,

345
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:07,130
I'll be there to greet you first thing.

346
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,530
Eat your food.
