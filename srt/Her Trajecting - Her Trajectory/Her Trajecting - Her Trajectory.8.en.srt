00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,460
(Every Trajectory Is You)

=Episode 8=

4
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,840
Shu Yan.

5
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,689
What's the matter?

6
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,159
You look so pretty today.

7
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,540
All of the men were staring at you.

8
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,310
I'm getting angry.

9
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,610
I should be the only one
who can admire your beauty, right?

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,040
You're mine.

11
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,210
Sorry about that. My hand slipped.

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,189
Hey,

13
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,629
you're drenched.

14
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:11,710
Get yourself sorted out in the restroom.

15
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,629
Shen Weizhou,

16
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:14,880
what are you up to?

17
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,540
I can do it myself.

18
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,059
Aren't you going to view houses today?

19
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,280
I can join you tonight.

20
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,729
I...

21
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,980
I'm busy tonight.

22
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,159
What about next time?

23
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,210
Mr. Shen.

24
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,159
Alright.

25
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,680
You can go ahead, then.

26
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,429
Okay.

27
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,410
See you next time.

28
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,410
Shu Yan.

29
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,440
Why did you leave without
hearing my explanation?

30
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,280
I don't know why they did this either.

31
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,729
You know this too.

32
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:07,610
I'm perplexed myself.

33
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,459
It occurred so many years ago.

34
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,040
I have a terrible memory as well.

35
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,910
Maybe

36
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,640
I said the wrong thing.

37
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,210
Initially, I was quite angry.

38
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,610
However,

39
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,510
after I gave it some thought,

40
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,480
I figured that you had
no reason to deceive me.

41
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,780
After all, we're best friends.

42
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,910
That's right.

43
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,729
We're best friends.

44
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,510
Why would I do that to you?

45
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,759
All those people

46
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,589
tried to bully me

47
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,680
using all kinds of bizarre reasons.

48
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,889
Now,

49
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,140
it seems like your turn.

50
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,610
If so,

51
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,229
what should we do?

52
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,610
Now, we mustn't let them bully us again.

53
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,459
I'm going to meet Chu Chen.

54
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,540
We'll clarify things in person.

55
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,680
You're going to meet Chu Chen?

56
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,640
Will Tianyu be upset, then?

57
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,640
That won't happen.

58
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,210
The stocks he bought appreciated a lot.

59
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,610
He made a huge fortune.

60
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,080
The stocks he bought appreciated?

61
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,059
He told me

62
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,740
that he was going
to buy the things I liked.

63
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,840
It's the expensive handbag
I saw before.

64
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,659
I liked it,

65
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,910
but I couldn't afford it.

66
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,589
He even said

67
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,210
that he would take me to view houses.

68
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,580
I assume

69
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,010
he wants to propose to me.

70
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,710
Really?

71
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,910
Alright now. I'll stop here.

72
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,410
I need to go on my date.

73
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,510
Shu Yan,

74
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,080
I won't let you
lead a life happier than mine.

75
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,789
- This is great. I finally obtained it.
- Be gentle.

76
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:44,780
You'll attract
people's attention, you know?

77
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,659
- What if people recognize me?
- I'm so happy.

78
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,659
I'll never forget

79
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:50,089
that you bought this limited-edition
handbag for me.

80
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:50,759
Alright now.

81
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,259
Let me send you home. Let's go.

82
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,210
Okay.

83
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,129
(So,)

84
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,410
(he's Shen Jiao's boyfriend, huh?)

85
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,940
Hello, Baby?

86
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,289
Why didn't you wait for me?

87
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,380
Where did you go?

88
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,840
I had another appointment.

89
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,210
That's why I left first.

90
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,259
Don't tell me you're going on
a date with Shen Weizhou.

91
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,289
That's not it.

92
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,010
I'm meeting my classmate.

93
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,080
That's fine.

94
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,229
You have to be wary of Shen Weizhou.
He's definitely interested in you.

95
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,440
Don't spout nonsense.
He has a girlfriend.

96
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,710
That's my hunch as a man.

97
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,410
So what if he has a girlfriend?

98
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,880
All men will cheat.

99
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,840
Even if he's married,
he'll have an affair outside.

100
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,010
He'll definitely target you.

101
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:55,140
(All men are just like you.)

102
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,780
I can tell
that Shen Weizhou is a playboy.

103
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,510
You're gullible as well.

104
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,210
He'll definitely target you.

105
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,610
You won't do this to me, right?

106
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,980
Me?

107
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,510
Of course not.

108
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,210
I'm no ordinary man, you know?

109
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,240
I'm very faithful.

110
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,629
Alright.

111
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,359
I have something else to do.

112
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,940
I'll hang up now.

113
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,610
Wait.

114
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:20,880
Hello?

115
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,410
Don't tell me she discovered
my affair with Ye Wei.

116
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,080
We didn't do anything.

117
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,810
We just kissed a few times.

118
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,910
You can't blame me for that.

119
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,680
Ye Wei is indeed charming.

120
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,880
I wonder what she's doing now.

121
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,340
Hello?

122
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:51,510
Where are you?

123
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,059
- Grandpa.
- My granddaughter is back.

124
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,859
Grandpa, look.

125
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,559
Weizhou bought me a lot of stuff.

126
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,140
I wanted them for so long.

127
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,310
You look so happy today.

128
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,889
Grandpa, you have no idea.

129
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,089
He looked so handsome
walking the runway today.

130
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,329
He had plenty of female fans

131
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,980
shouting his name down the stage.

132
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,929
Is that so?

133
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,810
Yeah.

134
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,510
How was it?

135
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,889
Did your work go smoothly?

136
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:17,710
Yeah.

137
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:19,529
I'll arrange for you

138
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,140
to be Weizhou's assistant for now.

139
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,629
You should start from the basics.

140
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,529
Try and understand

141
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:26,429
the nature of our business slowly.

142
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,410
After that,

143
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,580
I'll arrange
an official position for you.

144
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,810
Once

145
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,940
Weizhou takes over the company,

146
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,710
you can assist him.

147
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,710
Grandpa,

148
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,559
I don't want that.

149
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,580
- What do you want to do, then?
- I just want to get by.

150
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,929
I'll go and organize my things.

151
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,729
Remember to tell me

152
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,559
when dinner is ready.

153
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,529
Of course.

154
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,510
Go now.

155
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,710
Look at that lass.

156
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,189
Weizhou,

157
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:05,440
- Meng Ya will return to the country soon.
- Why is she returning to the country?

158
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,189
She's an international model.

159
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,010
Once she joins our company,

160
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,810
she'll serve as a good promotion

161
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,680
for our company across the world.

162
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,720
I hope that you can differentiate
between public and private affairs.

163
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,680
I'll make a move first.

164
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,910
- Aren't you going to join us for dinner?
- I need to maintain my figure.

165
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,180
You...

166
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,729
Chairman.

167
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,710
Were you looking for me?

168
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,010
Did you find out anything
about that woman?

169
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,089
Don't worry.

170
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:39,940
I've placed her profile
in your study room.

171
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,980
Alright.

172
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,089
Go now.

173
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:42,880
Okay.

174
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,010
Here.

175
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,159
I made this especially for you.

176
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,180
Give it a try.

177
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:00,440
It looks delicious.

178
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:06,480
What do you think?

179
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,380
It's really delicious.

180
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,789
I'm glad you like it.

181
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,010
I'll make it for you in the future.

182
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,440
You don't have to.

183
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,159
By the way,

184
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,510
did you bring the letter here?

185
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,229
(Stop annoying me! I hate you! By Shu Yan)

186
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:37,110
Look.

187
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,940
(Ye Wei can actually
forge my handwriting.)

188
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,580
It does look like my handwriting.

189
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,489
But it wasn't me.

190
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,140
You didn't write this?

191
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,310
If so...

192
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,129
Maybe

193
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,240
your crush is pulling a prank on me.

194
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,759
It's all in the past now.

195
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,759
It no longer matters.

196
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,110
Let's talk about something else.

197
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,510
Sure.

198
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,280
(So, Ye Wei tried to sabotage me
in secret in the future.)

199
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,940
(To think that I actually trusted her.)

200
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,210
In order to be at my best on stage,

201
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,089
I never took any food today.

202
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,480
Now, I'm finally having some food.

203
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,340
Thank you for
keeping me company. Ye Wei.

204
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,689
Isn't Yan keeping you company today?

205
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,689
She dolled herself up.

206
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,629
I thought

207
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,210
she went on a date with you.

208
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,980
It's fine.

209
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,280
She loves me very much.

210
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,680
She can't escape from my grasp.

211
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,610
It's hard to say for sure.

212
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,859
Everyone says

213
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,910
that women are unpredictable.

214
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,289
When Yan's mother was young,
she ran away from home

215
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,310
for the sake of a man.

216
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,059
Speaking of which,

217
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,910
Yan is truly pitiful.

218
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:06,340
So, her mother had an affair?

219
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:13,510
Don't you know about that?

220
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,329
You...

221
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,689
So,

222
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,759
has anyone

223
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,740
tried to court you lately?

224
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,510
Chu Chen,

225
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,910
I have a boyfriend.

226
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,640
Are you...

227
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,340
Are you referring to
the celebrity Shen Weizhou?

228
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,810
Of course not.

229
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,680
Why would you think
that he was my boyfriend?

230
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,310
He was the one who told me
to meet him at Jiangning Restaurant.

231
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,140
He pays a lot of attention to you.

232
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,610
I thought he was your boyfriend.

233
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:48,180
(No wonder Chu Chen
went to the restaurant.)

234
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,340
(But why did Shen Weizhou do that?)

235
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,440
I have no idea about that.

236
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:58,689
Let me send you home

237
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,940
after you're done eating.

238
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,629
Don't worry.

239
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,680
I won't pester you.

240
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,080
You don't have to.

241
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:09,210
You have plenty of customers today.

242
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,359
You can resume your work.

243
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,659
I can head home by myself.

244
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,129
I'll come and try
your dishes again next time.

245
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,080
Okay.

246
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,480
I'll make a move first.

247
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,670
(Han Tianyu)

248
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,459
Take care, then.

249
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,340
Goodbye.

250
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,910
Han Tianyu?

251
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,410
What are you doing here?

252
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,780
What's wrong?

253
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,680
Were you expecting another man?

254
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,080
So, you tailed me?

255
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,080
Who said you could skip my calls?

256
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,200
I merely wanted to give you a surprise.

257
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,110
You dolled yourself up today.

258
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,680
Which man did you seduce today?

259
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,629
An apple doesn't fall far

260
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,410
from the tree indeed.

261
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,959
What do you mean by that?

262
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,980
I'm sure you know
what I'm talking about.

263
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,629
Everyone knows
that your mother had an affair.

264
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,840
Did Ye Wei tell you
about my mother's affair?

265
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,510
Are you afraid of something?

266
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:59,640
Are you afraid that she might
tell me about your affairs as well?

267
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:01,580
Tell me.

268
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,510
Where did you go after work?

269
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,059
Let go of me!

270
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,480
You're hurting me!

271
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,680
Did you go and seduce another man?

272
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,659
Tell me!

273
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,529
Tell me!

274
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,480
No! Let go of me!

275
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,540
Listen.

276
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,910
Don't ever think of escaping from me.

277
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,729
Even if you were to die,

278
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,380
you can only die by my side.

279
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,510
Which scum did that?

280
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:33,840
Shen Weizhou!

281
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,829
Shen Weizhou! Stop hitting him!

282
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,540
Shen Weizhou, stop hitting him!

283
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,540
I knew it!
You two were having an affair!

284
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,480
Scram!

285
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,610
You're hurt.

286
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:00,640
Are you okay?

287
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,880
Wait. Why did I run away?

288
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,810
Why did I do that?

289
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,159
Darned Shen Weizhou.

290
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,289
I would've beaten him up

291
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,210
if I weren't...

292
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,910
Shu Yan,

293
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:34,680
you'll never escape from me.

294
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,640
What are you doing here?

295
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,040
I was worried about you.

296
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,359
Why were you worried about me?

297
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,429
You didn't answer my calls.

298
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:09,040
I was worried
that you might be in trouble.

299
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,659
Even so,

300
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,989
it's none of your business.

301
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,210
Who said so?

302
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,080
I was worried
that Han Tianyu might harm you.

303
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,840
Why would you think so?

304
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,829
Shu Yan, certain people and things
will never change.

305
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,540
What will happen will happen.

306
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,980
I won't allow anyone to harm you.

307
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,140
Shen Weizhou,

308
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,540
what do you mean by this?

309
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,859
I have a boyfriend.

310
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,340
You have a girlfriend as well.

311
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:52,429
Stop doing things

312
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,080
that'll cause people
to misunderstand us.

313
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,410
What is Shen Weizhou doing here?

314
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,489
I thought Han Tianyu

315
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,640
could show me something exciting.

316
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,190
(Han Tianyu)

317
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,759
I hate people
who cheat on their partners.

318
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,929
Cheat?

319
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:15,110
I didn't cheat on anyone.

320
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,829
I've already handled my affairs.

321
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,980
Handled?

322
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:26,110
Were you referring to your girlfriend?

323
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,610
Girlfriend?

324
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,880
What do you mean by that?

325
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,710
I never expected you to be this despicable.

326
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:34,759
Listen,

327
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,129
Shen Jiao

328
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,329
is an important friend of mine.

329
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,829
She's gentle and kind.

330
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,510
I won't allow you to hurt her.

331
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,959
How did Shen Jiao
encounter a playboy like you?

332
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,010
She's so unlucky.

333
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,480
Shen Jiao?

334
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:48,629
Are you saying

335
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,780
that Shen Jiao is my girlfriend?

336
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,980
You don't say?

337
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,689
Don't tell me that's not the case.

338
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,910
I saw everything.

339
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,740
Shu Yan, I do fancy you.

340
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,710
