4
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,250
Shen Jiao?

5
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,369
Are you saying

6
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,520
that Shen Jiao is my girlfriend?

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,790
You don't say?

8
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,469
Don't tell me that's not the case.

9
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,690
I saw everything.

10
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,520
Shu Yan, I do fancy you.

11
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,490
But do you actually know the truth?

12
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,069
Hello? You called me this late at night.

13
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,800
You better have
something urgent to tell me.

14
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,290
I'll give you a logical reason later.

15
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,339
But you almost ruined

16
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,750
my happiness today.

17
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,490
Are you sick in the head?

18
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:23,939
Oh yeah.

19
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,390
Both of you have the same surname.

20
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,350
So, you two are siblings, huh?

21
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,990
Isn't it obvious?

22
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:38,190
I...

23
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,550
Let me examine your wound.

24
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,320
Sorry about that.

25
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,490
You see,

26
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,350
I misunderstood you just now.

27
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,820
I shouldn't have been
that fierce to you.

28
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,250
I reprimanded you as well.
I'm so terrible.

29
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,720
Sorry about that.

Tianyu.

53
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,590
You're wounded.

54
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,050
Does it hurt?

55
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,090
Let me send you to the hospital.

56
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,520
No.

57
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,920
We mustn't do this to Shu Yan.

(I won't let you own me that easily.)

59
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,190
(This isn't the time yet.)

60
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,090
Don't worry.

61
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,690

Think about it.

66

Let me be your little boat.

67
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,390
Be my little boat, huh?

68
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,250
Should I trust him?

69
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,520
This time,

70
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,490
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

71
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,550
Bai,

72
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,350
I saw Han Tianyu

73
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,520
trying to hit Shu Yan.

74
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:35,220
I couldn't hold it in. I beat him up.

75
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,560
Did you think
Shu Yan was startled because of that?

76
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,350
Does she think that I'm a violent man?

77
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,520
I even confessed to her today.

78
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,990
Do you think she'll say yes?

79
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,350
Confess, huh?

80
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,869
Seems like Shu Yan
is no ordinary simpleton.

81
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,090
What are you doing here?

82
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,639
As your fiancee,

83
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,239
I heard that you wanted
to cancel our wedding.

84
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,020
That's why I came here to visit you.

85
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,990
But don't worry.

86
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,920
I won't touch your woman.

87
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,269
After all, I have plenty of boyfriends.

88
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,339
Regarding that,

89
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,090
we're even now.

90
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,390
However,

91
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,690
you cannot cancel the wedding.

92
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,290
Just give up.

93
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,290
I'll never marry you.

94
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,539
Do you think you can cancel it

95
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,350
without my permission?

96
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,069
Why don't you take a good look at me?

97
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,450
I'm just as good as other women,
you know?

98
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,990
You!

99
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,920
Yan,

100
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,699
you're so lucky.

101
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,369
What's the matter?

102
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,250
Look.

103
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:12,720
What are you doing here?

104
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,969
Good morning.
I was heading to the restaurant.

105
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,999
I'm delivering breakfast to you
since I was passing by.

106
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:19,020
I remember

107
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,550
that you have a weak stomach.

108
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,490
Thank you.

109
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,250
Sorry for the trouble.
You had to come all the way here for me.

110
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,820
It's no trouble at all.

111
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,039
I have to make breakfast

112
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,269
for myself anyway.

113
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,320
I just made an extra serving.

114
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,190
That's a lot.

115
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,739
It looks amazing.

116
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,220
I'm sure it's delicious.

117
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,920
Do you want some?

118
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,620
Weizhou!

119
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,550
I mean, Mr. Shen,

120
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,769
what are you up to?

121
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:01,899
I haven't had breakfast yet.

122
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,690
You're a terrible PA.

123
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,539
I...

124
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:04,939
I...

125
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,739
I was planning to buy breakfast for you.

126
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,099
This belongs to Shu Yan.

127
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,539
How could you eat her breakfast?

128
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,420
Oh.

129
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,290
This is Shu Yan's breakfast?

130
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,699
Sorry about that.

131
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,969
You can give her

132
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,650
my breakfast later.

133
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,690
No need for that.

134
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,690
Chu Chen.

135
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,299
You have to return to work, right?

136
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,669
Why don't you go first?

137
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,669
Alright. I'll deliver breakfast
to you again tomorrow.

138
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,750
Tomorrow?

139
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,150
(Tomorrow?)

140
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,099
(Don't tell me this kid)

141
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,850
(will deliver breakfast
to Shu Yan every day.)

142
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:35,299
I mean, this breakfast is delicious.

143
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,699
We should share it with everyone.

144
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:37,639
What about this?

145
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,739
I'll buy you guys breakfast
for one month

146
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,520
starting from tomorrow.

147
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,769
- Okay!
- Thank you, Mr. Shen.

148
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,020
Wait, Mr. Shen.

149
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,699
You didn't ask Chu Chen whether
he has time to make them or not.

150
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,690
He's busy with work usually.

151
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,639
It's fine.

152
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,190
It's improving the restaurant's
sales performance anyway.

153
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,769
If so, Mr. Shen,
thank you for the order.

154
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,339
Okay.

155
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,920
I appreciate your effort. Thanks.

156
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,050
I'll make a move first.

157
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,020
Delicious.

158
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,139
Stop eating.

159
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,139
Go and get changed.

160
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,590
You have several photoshoots later.

161
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,139
(Why do I feel like)

162
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,320
(Shen Weizhou has become childish?)

163
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,739
(Don't tell me)

164
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,750
(he's jealous of Chu Chen.)

165
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,869
Look at you.

166
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,490
You got your shirt messy.

167
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:27,950
And here.

168
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,950
You look good now.

169
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,469
Mr. Shen,

170
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,620
take a look.

171
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,569
Later,

172
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,899
you'll hold this product.

173
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,720
We'll start with a wide shot.

174
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,840
After that, walk toward the camera
with the product.

175
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,569
And then,

176
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,899
we'll take a close shot.

177
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,169
During that shot,

178
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,390
you'll put on the raincoat.

179
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:49,839
The raincoat

180
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,020
is dirt and water repellent.

181
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,239
Therefore, we'll use different scenes

182
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,220
to capture its characteristics.

183
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,739
Director, we need to show that the raincoat
is water and dirt repellent, right?

184
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,550
That's right.

185
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,050
I do have an idea

186
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,069
that can demonstrate

187
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,620
its capabilities even better.

188
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,720
Please tell me about it.

189
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,269
We need two people.

190
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,480
One of them will wear this raincoat

191
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,299
and the other person
will wear a normal raincoat.

192
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,220
After that, we'll use different kinds
of stains to make a comparison.

193
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,720
This way, our audience
can see the difference directly.

194
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,220
That's a great idea.

195
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,090
However,

196
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,469
if we proceed with that plan,

197
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,290
it'll be different from the script
we gave to the investors.

198
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,339
I'm worried that they might be upset.

199
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,220
Director,

200
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,899
by doing so, we'll demonstrate

201
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,490
the functionality
of their raincoat better.

202
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,139
If they're unhappy with it,

203
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,690
I'll bear all of the responsibilities.

204
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,620
Let's use that plan.

205
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,690
As for the other raincoat,

206
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,890
Han Tianyu should wear it.

207
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,620
Alright. I'll tell them
to make some preparations.

208
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,220
Tianyu.

209
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,920
Director.

210
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,669
Were you looking for me?

211
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:53,890
It's like this.

212
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,299
We've made some slight adjustments

213
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,890
to the script.

214
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,699
You can follow this script,

215
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,469
okay?

216
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,499
Okay, Director.

217
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,439
I'll do my best.

218
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,290
Okay.

219
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,090
Pour it on his head!

220
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,090
More!

221
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,820
Director,

222
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,020
I don't think

223
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,240
that's enough.

224
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,220
We should show the functionality
from more angles.

225
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,560
One angle alone isn't enough, huh?

226
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,039
Yeah. Let's get another angle.

227
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,790
Do it from the bottom.

228
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,190
That's right.

229
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,450
We'll change
to another type of stain later.

230
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,339
Weizhou, how did he offend you?
Why are you doing this to him?

231
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,690
This is an adult's affair.

232
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,350
Kids like you should stay out of it.

233
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,620
Oh.

234
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,790
More.

235
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,269
(I'm sure Shen Weizhou)

236
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,920
(is doing this to Han Tianyu
for the sake of Shu Yan.)

237
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:06,040
(It's a shame that Shen Weizhou
has no feelings for me.)

238
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,080
(If not, why would I resort
to seducing Han Tianyu?)

239
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,969
(Anyway,
as long as it belongs to Shu Yan,)

240
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,350
(I can steal it from her eventually.)

241
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,190
Darned Shen Weizhou.

242
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,899
Not only did he steal my woman,

243
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,790
but he also pranked me on purpose.

244
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:32,650
You could tell, huh?

245
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,120
Seems like you're not an idiot.

246
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,390
Listen.

247
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,290
Shu Yan is mine.

248
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,820
You won't get your hands on her.

249
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,190
You better stay away from her.

250
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,939
This is a warning.

251
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,520
Do not hurt Shu Yan again.

252
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,169
I quit!

253
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,420
I quit!

254
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,520
You don't deserve her.

255
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:07,650
Here's some advice.

256
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,899
Leave her as soon as possible.

257
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,750
But we love each other.

258
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,450
Is that so?

259
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,890
Do you dare to promise
that you'll be faithful to her?

260
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,090
No matter what decision Shu Yan makes,

261
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,950
I'll always support her.

262
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,750
Shen Weizhou.

263
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,350
Just you wait!

264
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,750
Everyone,

265
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,320
I have good news.

266
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,439
Our last exhibition was a great success.

267
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,320
The brand dealers have
acknowledged our success.

268
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:05,239
The bonus from
our superiors have arrived.

269
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,190
You guys will receive it
by the end of this month.

270
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,290
Besides that,

271
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,169
have you guys done

272
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,499
the branding program

273
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,920
for the gourmet kits we mentioned?

274
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,069
I made a draft.

275
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,069
Reality TV shows
are quite popular lately.

276
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,339
Therefore, I plan to do

277
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,350
a reality TV show related to food.

278
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,950
Reality TV shows?

279
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,350
It's easy to say.

280
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,539
But do you know

281
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,690
how much manpower
and resources we have to invest?

282
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,939
And, we have to negotiate with
the TV stations for resources.

283
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,939
The industry is very competitive.

284
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,680
There's no way we can get any resources.

285
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,339
And,

286
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,869
the procedures are complicated as well.

287
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,690
Therefore, I don't think
your proposal will work.

288
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,690
Does anyone else have any other ideas?

289
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,620
I think Shu Yan's proposal is viable.

290
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:48,720
Although we don't have the resources
that a TV station has,

291
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:49,739
we can start a live stream

292
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,750
with the company's official page.

293
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,560
There are already several celebrities
under our company.

294
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,320
If we feature them on a TV show,

295
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,039
not only can we make them more popular

296
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,339
and increase their business value,

297
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,099
but we can also

298
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,190
insert some advertisements
throughout the show.

299
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,769
Once the TV show starts,

300
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,150
it'll definitely bring
considerably revenues to the company.

301
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,169
I do think

302
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,450
we can discuss this proposal.

303
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,490
What about this?

304
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,369
You guys can write a detailed proposal.

305
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,899
After that, we'll discuss it,

306
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,750
okay?

307
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,239
If there's nothing else,

308
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,690
that'll be all for our meeting today.

309
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,920
Meeting dismissed.

310
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,990
Mr. Wang.

311
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,920
I heard

312
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,939
that we're looking for a general manager

313
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,990
for our foreign branch.

314
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,850
If we do a good job with this project,

315
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,539
it'll help you

316
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,290
to get promoted as well, right?

317
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,939
I also heard

318
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,669
that the celebrity, Wang Xingxing,

319
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,150
is a relative of yours.

320
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,290
That's right.

321
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,699
If we can persuade him

322
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,139
to join our project,

323
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,969
our project

324
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:02,920
will definitely succeed, right?

325
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,850
Of course.

326
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:05,769
My nephew

327
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,069
is a superstar.

328
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:09,050
Yeah.

329
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,839
However,

330
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,850
we can talk about it later.

331
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,450
I need to think about it.

332
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,390
(You fell for it.)

333
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,390
(You'll definitely steal this proposal.)

334
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,120
(And, that superstar nephew of yours)

335
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,120
(will become a commoner soon.)

336
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,090
(On the other hand, I have to help them
progress their relationship.)

337
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:34,990

without seeking revenge against me.)
