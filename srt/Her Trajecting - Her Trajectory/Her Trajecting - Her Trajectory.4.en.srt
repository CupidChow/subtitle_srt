1
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:48,759
Xiao Bai

2
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:51,919
Do you think I should tell the whole truth

3
00:00:51,919 --> 00:00:52,959
to Shu Yan

4
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,560
Tell her

5
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,119
I was reborn from five years in the future

6
00:01:01,599 --> 00:01:03,919
Tell her Han Tianyu and Ye Wei will have an affair

7
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,839
and hurt her

8
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,959
But will she believe me

9
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,879
Believe that I have been reborn from five years in the future

10
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:16,400
But even I haven't figured it out

11
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,480
No matter what

12
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,319
This time

13
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:25,400
I will definitely protect her

14
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,360
Very good

15
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,599
We will turn things around with this money

16
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,720
Xiaoyan

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,559
Remember to wear it on Sunday.

18
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,199
We are still like we used to be.

19
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,199
Wearing matching outfits for our date.

20
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:07,400
In my previous life,

21
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,759
I was wearing this outfit.

22
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,000
How have you been lately?

23
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,080
Pretty good.

24
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,199
Those recent projects...

25
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,279
Really are...

26
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,039
Shuyan

27
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,880
I mean that Shu Yan

28
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:30,160
got a fake item to show off

29
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,440
and got caught

30
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,919
It's really funny

31
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,320
A fake is always a fake

32
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,720
I really can't stand it

33
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:37,759
If you ask me

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,479
Ye Wei is just too kind and naive

35
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,960
to be friends with someone like that

36
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,839
Has Shu Yan not come back yet?

37
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,759
You love eavesdropping on others so much

38
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,520
Right, Shuyan?

39
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,839
Then just stay inside quietly

40
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:12,919
Give her some more

41
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,600
Are you okay?

42
00:03:26,399 --> 00:03:27,160
Shuyan

43
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,279
Are you okay?

44
00:03:30,679 --> 00:03:31,320
It's nothing

45
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,000
You've been really cold to me lately

46
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:36,199
I'm very sad

47
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,240
We

48
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,039
Can we still be like we used to be?

49
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:51,679
We can't go back to the way things were.

50
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:54,320
I won't let you bully me anymore.

51
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,520
I've been a bit distant lately.

52
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,839
It won't happen again.

53
00:04:00,839 --> 00:04:01,600
Hmm.

54
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,479
We will always be best friends.

55
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,720
I'll go pour a cup of coffee.

56
00:04:22,119 --> 00:04:23,359
Tianqi stocks

57
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:26,079
Why did she suddenly buy this?

58
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,480
You have it

59
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,480
I need to have it too

60
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,799
Hello

61
00:04:39,799 --> 00:04:40,440
Hello

62
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,440
Are you looking for a house?

63
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,440
Yes, I am looking for a house.

64
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,279
Thank you.

65
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,000
Looking for a house, huh?

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,920
Yes, I want to change my environment.

67
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,399
Perfect

68
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,399
My friend has a vacant house for rent.

69
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,320
The environment is quite good.

70
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,239
The price is also reasonable.

71
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:57,239
I'll take you to see it.

72
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,399
That would be great.

73
00:04:58,839 --> 00:04:59,920
Thank you, Teacher Shen.

74
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:01,559
I owe you another meal.

75
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,359
No problem, you can make it up later.

76
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:12,480
Let go of me

77
00:05:17,559 --> 00:05:18,839
Han Tianyu, what are you doing?

78
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,839
This is the company.

79
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,519
Come on, tell me.

80
00:05:23,119 --> 00:05:24,320
Is it really because of Shen Weizhou?

81
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,440
We just broke up, right?

82
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,679
Why are you bringing this up again?

83
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,839
Then why is he always around you?

84
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:34,440
We can't drag Shen Weizhou into this.

85
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,600
I have to endure until he marries Ye Wei.

86
00:05:40,119 --> 00:05:40,760
You want to

87
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,440
You're overthinking it.

88
00:05:42,799 --> 00:05:44,000
Shen Weizhou is so popular.

89
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:46,079
He's surrounded by beautiful women.

90
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,799
How could he possibly be interested in someone like me, a mere employee?

91
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,799
He just uses me as a servant.

92
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,320
Really.

93
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,640
He just uses me as a servant.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,799
Besides,

95
00:05:56,119 --> 00:05:57,320
I've already told you,

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,160
I broke up with you

97
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:01,239
only because I felt

98
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:02,600
you didn't care about me.

99
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,880
Are you blaming me for not caring about you?

100
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:14,880
Do you think I'm being cold to you?

101
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes.

102
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,119
That's right.

103
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,359
But you have so many people around you.

104
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:21,720
Throwing themselves at you.

105
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:24,040
How do I know

106
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,679
if you have someone else?

107
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,320
No, I don't.

108
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,239
I only have you.

109
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:30,959
Baby,

110
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,040
I'll be more careful in the future.

111
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,119
Well,

112
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:39,880
I'll go to work now.

113
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:45,920
How about we do something exciting?

114
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:46,959
No.

115
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:48,079
Tianyu,

116
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:48,959
Tianyu,

117
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,440
It's okay, no one will come.

118
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:51,880
Shuyan,

119
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,239
What are you doing here?

120
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:05,160
Xiaoyan

121
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,399
Where did you go?

122
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,640
Tianyu just looked for me.

123
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:13,000
Let's go out for lunch.

124
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,000
I want to eat at that barbecue place.

125
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,160
Let's go.

126
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,320
Together.

127
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:25,279
It's time to create an opportunity for them to get along.

128
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,119
I just ate that.

129
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,200
I'm not very hungry yet.

130
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,959
And I still have a lot of work to finish.

131
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,160
I need to continue following up.

132
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,040
You, you guys go ahead and eat.

133
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:38,760
If you don't go, I won't go either.

134
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,920
I'll just treat it as dieting.

135
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:44,640
I know.

136
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,640
As long as anything doesn't go your way,

137
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:47,959
you'll start scheming.

138
00:07:57,239 --> 00:07:57,959
Qi Xiaoyan

139
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:58,760
What should we do?

140
00:07:59,079 --> 00:07:59,839
Are you okay?

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,079
The reason I endure

142
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:01,760
It's all wet, Qi Xiaoyan

143
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,679
is because you are my only friend

144
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,720
This time I won't back down

145
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:19,559
It's burning me!

146
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,799
What are you doing?

147
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,320
Are you okay, Tianyu?

148
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:23,519
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

149
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:25,359
Tianyu, your clothes are all dirty.

150
00:08:25,679 --> 00:08:26,279
Hurry up.

151
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,839
Ye Wei, go with him to clean up.

152
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,359
Tianyu

153
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:37,840
Hello

154
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,280
Can you help me, please?

155
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:41,760
Do you have that?

156
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:45,520
Are you asking for a sanitary pad?

157
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,000
Yes

158
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,960
Thank you so much

159
00:08:50,359 --> 00:08:51,719
I am the new artist assistant

160
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:52,520
My name is Shen Jiao

161
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,960
How should I address you?

162
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,520
I am Shu Yan from the artist project department

163
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:00,559
Wait a moment

164
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:12,760
Alright

165
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,840
You are really too good

166
00:09:17,559 --> 00:09:19,320
You are practically my god

167
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,599
You are the light of my life

168
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:23,159
It's not that exaggerated

169
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,239
Anyone else would do the same

170
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,039
Sunday

171
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,000
Would you like to go on a date with me alone?

172
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,039
Sunday

173
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,880
I have plans

174
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:35,000
Although I don't really want to go

175
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,960
Then don't go

176
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,080
What kind of date is it?

177
00:09:41,479 --> 00:09:42,359
A class reunion

178
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,840
But

179
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,119
I wasn't very popular in school

180
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,039
So I don't really want to

181
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,960
Think back to that time

182
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,039
The unbearable past

183
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,719
I think you're wrong

184
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,200
On the contrary

185
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,520
You must go

186
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:00,359
If you don't go

187
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,000
It will forever become a

188
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,119
Unbearable memory

189
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:05,799
But if you make a big change

190
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:07,599
It will become a glorious history

191
00:10:22,359 --> 00:10:23,239
Tianyu

192
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,760
Can you help me?

193
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:26,760
I can't zip up my zipper.
