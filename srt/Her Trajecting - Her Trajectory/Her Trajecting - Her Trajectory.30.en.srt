00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,119
The negotiation went well.

5
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,930
She should be taking action soon.

6
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,370
Our company offers

7
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,600
family insurance to employees.

8
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,900
It covers the employee, their spouse,
and immediate family members.

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,519
Employees who are suspended
or have left within three months

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,970
can choose to continue

11
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,470
the coverage.

12
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,330
I'll sell this bag to get

13
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,900
some emergency cash.

14
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,419
Han Tianyu didn't even know
about this insurance policy.

15
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,749
But he should be

16
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,449
getting the notice soon.

17
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:11,919
The stage is all set.

18
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,300
Now we just wait
for the lead actors to step on.

Should I just die?

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,219
If Han Tianyu didn't have
any ill intentions,

24
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,219
that insurance policy

25
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,670
would never come into effect.

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,600
If I die,

27
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,249
my parents would be able

28
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,300
to collect my death benefits.

29
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:43,549
Knowing Han Tianyu,

30
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:45,700
he won't pass up a chance like this.

And Ye Wei will only grow
more envious of me.

34
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,570
Why does everyone only see Shu Yan?

35
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,719
They're all the same kind of people,

36
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,879
so they're bound to walk

37
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,670
right into the trap we've laid.

38
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,730
Right now,
the most important thing is to make

39
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,670
Ye Wei go through

40
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:14,330
everything you've been through.

41
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,479
Grandpa,

42
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,970
I lost again.

43
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,200
Because you want everything,

44
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,370
I could read

45
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,670
all your moves.

46
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,919
A good leader knows

47
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,300
when to let go of things

48
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,570
that don't belong to them.

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,170
I understand, Grandpa.

50
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,870
Weizhou's here.

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,849
I was just playing Go

52
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,349
with Grandpa.

53
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,630
I lost again.

54
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,870
But I think I could beat you.

55
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,270
Care to play a round?

56
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,630
Grandpa,

57
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,300
I want to formally introduce

58
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,370
the woman I love to you.

59
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,530
Before that, I don't think Mengya
should be coming to the residence anymore.

60
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,919
You told me
your feelings were one-sided.

61
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,719
That you didn't plan to be with her.

62
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,730
Well?

63
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,679
Had a change of heart?

64
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,470
Yes.

65
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,200
I want
to take things seriously with her.

66
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,530
So it's not appropriate

67
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:19,749
for my ex-fiancée to keep coming over.

68
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,370
People like us don't just marry

69
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,700
based on personal feelings.

70
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,000
You should get Grandpa's opinion first.

71
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,100
I will, Grandpa.

72
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,070
Let me formally introduce her to you.

73
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,519
Hello, sir.

74
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,730
I'm Shu Yan.

75
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,149
I should've handled her myself
from the start.

76
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,770
Shouldn't have let that pesky bug
fly into my glass.

77
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,149
Go make arrangements.

78
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,530
Get rid of Shu Yan.

79
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,749
I'm not one to care about social status.

80
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,849
But now,

81
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:28,470
my grandson is all I have left.

82
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,819
I don't want

83
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,870
any more dangerous incidents
like last time.

84
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,319
As the head of the family,

85
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,900
all I want is for my grandson

86
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,000
to be healthy

87
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,970
and happy.

88
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,879
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

89
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,270
It won't happen again.

90
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,479
I'll protect him,

91
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,530
just like he protects me.

92
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,170
Good.

93
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,420
(Ye Wei)

94
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,870
Shu Yan!

95
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,949
Why did you seduce Han Tianyu?

96
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,130
You're the reason we got divorced!

97
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,430
Don't blame everything on me.

98
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:12,479
Han Tianyu dumped a girlfriend
he'd been with for seven years.

99
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,679
You should've

100
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,019
seen this coming.

101
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,819
Besides,

102
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,549
only someone looking for trouble

103
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,279
would choose a guy

104
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,549
like Han Tianyu.
I used to be that someone.

105
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,330
But who else
would even want him but you?

106
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,500
Shu Yan!

107
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,719
Get back here!

108
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,819
You come back!

109
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,670
I...

110
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,930
Move!

111
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,370
Shu Yan!

112
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,800
Let go of me!

113
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,479
(Shu Yan)
(Darling,)

114
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,240
(Ye Wei showed up at the office earlier
and made a huge scene. I was scared.)

115
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,370
(Everyone's saying
she's totally lost it.)

116
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,970
(Oops, wrong message.)

117
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,000
Shu Yan.

118
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:56,230
I'm not letting you off that easy.

119
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,830
If I'm right,

120
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:59,970
Ye Wei should be calling me very soon.

121
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,020
(Ye Wei)

122
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,270
Shen Weizhou?

123
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,570
I'll agree to your proposal,

124
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,100
but on one condition.

125
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,630
Before Shu Yan comes back to you,

126
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,300
I want her to hit rock bottom

127
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,800
and grovel at my feet.

128
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,670
As you wish.

129
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,630
Ye Wei took the bait.

130
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,070
Han Tianyu should be receiving
the insurance policy soon too.

131
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,030
What did the company send me now?

132
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,430
Is this some kind of joke?

133
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:49,800
I've been suspended
for months with no pay.

134
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,600
Where would I get money for insurance?

135
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,630
This is ridiculous.

136
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,389
(Insurance Policy)

137
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:08,420
(Pays 500 million upon spouse's death)

138
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,200
I know you don't have any reason
to help me anymore.

139
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,870
So

140
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,630
I'm proposing a deal.

141
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,770
I'll make sure Ye Wei

142
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,300
never bothers you again.

143
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:37,570
What are you planning
to do to your wife?

144
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,670
I'm at the end of my rope.

145
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,300
But now, I see a way out.

146
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,430
And maybe that way out

147
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,900
can help you too.

148
00:07:58,754 --> 00:08:00,820
(Insurance Policy)

149
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,730
This policy only pays out
upon her death.

150
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,830
If Ye Wei disappears from the world,

151
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,400
no one will ever bother you again.

152
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,819
You want me to clean up your mess again?

153
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,100
Not just clean it up.

154
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,430
I need you to help me set the stage.

155
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,070
In this world,

156
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,130
money and power are everything.

157
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,670
And I have neither.

158
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,570
At least

159
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,430
you've got guts.

160
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:41,670
That's all I've got left.

161
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,530
This time,

162
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm betting my life.

163
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,930
This is your last shot.

164
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:50,279
Han Tianyu is inside

165
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,100
Wu Mengya's hotel room.

166
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,830
So it's happening today.

167
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,319
(Ye Wei)

168
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,019
(Han Tianyu and Shu Yan.)

169
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,230
(Room 1106, Xingchen Hotel)

170
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,630
Mm.

171
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,800
Honey?

172
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,500
I'm almost there.

173
00:09:59,220 --> 00:09:59,679
Han Tianyu!

174
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,419
Ye Wei!

175
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,800
I thought you were with Shu Yan,

176
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,930
but turns out you're
with some other woman.

177
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,530
You're like a stray dog in heat.

178
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,570
Didn't we agree to get a divorce?

179
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,679
Who I'm with now
is none of your business.

180
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,630
Fine.

181
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,800
Since you've got time to waste on this,
why don't you spend it behind bars?

182
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,470
Wu Mengya.

183
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,300
I'm turning the recording over
to the police.

184
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,670
Get ready to rot in prison.

185
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:24,700
Also,

186
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,130
where's my dad?

187
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,300
Did you kill him?

188
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,870
Killed him?

189
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,000
Stop her!

190
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,170
You're awake.

191
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,870
Han Tianyu!

192
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,330
What are you doing?

193
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,700
I bought an insurance policy for you.

194
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,770
As long as you die,

195
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,500
I'll get 500 million.

196
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,800
Han Tianyu...

197
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,100
You can't do this to me.

198
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,279
Tell me

199
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,419
how much you want.

200
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,879
I'll give you everything I have!

201
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,830
You can't do this to me!

202
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,400
Who do you think

203
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,300
I'd choose

204
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,200
between you

205
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,400
and Wu Mengya?

206
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,479
You really are such an idiot.

207
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,130
You think if you kill me,

208
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,170
Wu Mengya will let you off?

209
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,930
I have evidence that could threaten her.

210
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,300
You better think this through.

211
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,400
You mean

212
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,549
that recording, right?

213
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,530
I deleted everything

214
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,100
while you were

215
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,770
unconscious.

216
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,770
People like us can't go up

217
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,270
against those with power and influence.

218
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:49,530
I've been backed into a corner.

219
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm not going to hesitate
over a few million anymore.

220
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,770
Didn't you say you loved me?

221
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,270
Then help me.

222
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,970
Just die.

223
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,270
Once you're dead,

224
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,900
I start over again.

225
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,249
Be good.

226
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,800
It won't hurt too much.

227
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,070
Don't worry.

228
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,900
Screw you!

229
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,530
Where are you?

230
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,630
You can't run!

231
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,119
I found you!

232
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,800
Stop hiding!

233
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,430
Go ahead.

234
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,130
Run!

235
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,500
I'll take my time with you.

236
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,830
Shu Yan told me

237
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,770
you're a good-for-nothing.

238
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,749
I was never even pregnant,

239
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,519
because you couldn't get me pregnant!

240
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,170
You have azoospermia!

241
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,070
And you think you're any better?

242
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,400
I'm going to end your life right here!

243
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,800
Yes?

244
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,119
Yang Huiting's divorce case

245
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,670
should go through without issues.

246
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,749
The video evidence
of the husband's infidelity

247
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,030
has been restored.

248
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,219
That's sudden.

249
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,079
Yes.

250
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,349
There was no video before,

251
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,770
and now it's suddenly back.

252
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,049
Shows that some things
are just meant to happen.

253
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,630
They were destined to divorce.

254
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,500
Oh,

255
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,300
and Han Tianyu is dead.

256
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,200
Cause of death
was blunt force trauma to the head.

257
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,849
Police have named Ye Wei
as the prime suspect

258
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,100
and are now hunting her down.

259
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:32,600
Got it.

260
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,553
(Obituary.
Mr. Han Tianyu has passed away.)

261
00:15:35,554 --> 00:15:38,220
(May the deceased rest in peace.
Norran Entertainment.)

262
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:05,879
(Condolences)

263
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,270
Shu Yan?

264
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,770
You actually showed up?

265
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,300
Are you here to mock me?

266
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,500
If you hadn't betrayed my son,

267
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,679
he never would've married Ye Wei.

268
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,730
She killed my son!

269
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,649
She ruined his entire life!

270
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:24,200
All because of you!

271
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:30,170
My poor boy...

272
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,200
Tianyu...

273
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,479
How can I go on?

274
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,070
(I used to wish)

275
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,370
(you were dead.)

276
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,100
(When you betrayed me
and tried to kill me,)

277
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,270
(when you left me in despair,)

278
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,430
(I still couldn't understand
why you did what you did.)

279
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,100
(But to have it end like this...)

280
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:54,430
Huiting.

281
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,549
Mommy.

282
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,700
Mu.

283
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,319
You'll feel better soon.

284
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,400
Don't worry.

285
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,600
Oh.

286
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,470
This is your divorce decree.

287
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,300
Keep it safe.

288
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,870
And Mu's custody?

289
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,619
Both legal and physical custody
are yours now.

290
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,279
Plus,

291
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,300
his visitation rights have been revoked.

292
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,000
But that means

293
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,319
Mu will grow up without a father.

294
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,119
Mommy,

295
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,449
I don't need a father.

296
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:25,049
As long as I have you, that's enough.

297
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,430
You're a good girl, Mu.

298
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,319
Shu Yan,

299
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,070
thank you for everything
you've done for me.

300
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,279
I've been through illness,

301
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,930
pain, and betrayal.

302
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,100
When I was on the operating table,

303
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,400
it felt like I'd already died once.

304
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,100
But now I've got a new plan.

305
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,479
That scoundrel

306
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,630
might try to blackmail Mu one day.

307
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:49,400
I can't let my daughter go through
that kind of pain,

308
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:50,630
so

309
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,700
I won't hold back anymore.

310
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,249
Congratulations

311
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,700
on your new beginning.

312
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,419
Definitely a day worth celebrating.

313
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,449
We should have a feast to celebrate!

314
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,200
Is food all you ever think about?

315
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,270
Oh, no!

316
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,770
I almost forgot.

317
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,230
Chu Chen is flying back
from Europe today after filming.

318
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,600
I have to go pick him up. Got to go!

319
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,330
When did Shen Jiao start caring
so much about Chu Chen?

320
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,170
A daughter has to marry someday.

321
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,770
- Those two got something going on?
- Mm.
