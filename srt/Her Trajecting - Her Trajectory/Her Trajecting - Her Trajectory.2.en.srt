1
00:00:51,959 --> 00:00:53,080
My name is Shuyan

2
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,639
Today

3
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:57,720
is my wedding day

4
00:00:58,319 --> 00:01:00,319
I married the man I've loved for ten years

5
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,479
I thought from now on

6
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,400
I would spend the rest of my life in happiness

7
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,519
But I didn't expect

8
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,559
this day would become

9
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,480
the beginning of my life's greatest misfortune

10
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,360
Eggplant

11
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,599
Han Tianyu

12
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,680
Let's break up

13
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,000
Why

14
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,400
Why

15
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,639
You useless thing

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,959
You can't even have children

17
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:27,720
I found a remedy for you

18
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,400
But you won't take it

19
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,480
What do you really want

20
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,199
You're going to end our family line

21
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,000
Let's stop drinking.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,279
Clean all of this up.

23
00:01:40,279 --> 00:01:40,839
Get some rest early.

24
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:41,519
Is that okay?

25
00:01:43,919 --> 00:01:45,000
Stop nagging!

26
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,239
I'm telling you,

27
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,120
Don't talk to me in that tone again.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,680
You're still speaking for him.

29
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:55,879
Help! Help!

30
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:56,440
Speak.

31
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,480
Do you like Shen Weizhou or not?

32
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:02,480
Speak.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,400
You should have died long ago.

34
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,479
This is what you should be doing.

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,279
Speak.

36
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,520
What are you doing?

37
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:13,880
Lin Yuan.

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,080
No.

39
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:16,839
We just...

40
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:18,199
We're just messing around.

41
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,440
Why are you here?

42
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:21,559
Why do you care why I'm here?

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,119
I saw you touch her.

44
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:24,080
Come with me to the police station.

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,800
Shu Yan.

46
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,600
I apologize to you.

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:31,919
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:40,320
It's okay

49
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,839
I'm leaving

50
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,800
Boss

51
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:03,679
How is she doing?

52
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,520
Nothing serious.

53
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,039
She was a bit frightened.

54
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:08,839
Alright.

55
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:10,320
Then stay here.

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,880
If anything happens,

57
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,000
report to me immediately.

58
00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:14,119
Okay.

59
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:34,639
Han Tianyu is like a ticking time bomb

60
00:03:35,279 --> 00:03:37,119
It seems we can't break up peacefully

61
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,600
Now there's a chance to start over

62
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,279
I must not repeat the same mistakes

63
00:03:42,559 --> 00:03:43,600
Leave this place

64
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,119
But he took all my money

65
00:03:46,679 --> 00:03:48,639
Now I don't have much savings left

66
00:03:49,399 --> 00:03:51,000
I must find a way out

67
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,559
Shen Weizhou

68
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:12,800
You don't have any major issues.

69
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,240
Just a bit of gastritis.

70
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,679
Watch your diet.

71
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,640
If you feel unwell, get a timely recheck.

72
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,160
It's okay.

73
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,559
Everything is still on time.

74
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:26,839
Stay healthy.

75
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,920
Teacher Shen

76
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,160
Why are you here?

77
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's too noisy downstairs.

78
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,359
I wanted to come up for some peace and quiet.

79
00:05:17,679 --> 00:05:18,760
I didn't expect you to be here too.

80
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,239
I

81
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,640
still feel a bit sorry about yesterday.

82
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:26,920
Sorry about that.

83
00:05:27,799 --> 00:05:28,920
If you feel sorry,

84
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,839
treat me to a meal.

85
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,160
Okay.

86
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,160
The taste today is good.

87
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,000
It's good.

88
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:52,440
You, you go first

89
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,600
I'll take this

90
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,239
Compared to me, Han Tianyu

91
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,399
is inferior in every aspect.

92
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,279
Why don't you be with me from now on?

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,640
Thank you

94
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,359
What I mean is

95
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,559
You come work at my studio

96
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:35,880
I see your ability to manage artists is quite strong

97
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,200
Leading a group of unknown artists

98
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,640
is indeed a bit of a waste of resources

99
00:06:42,279 --> 00:06:42,839
How about it

100
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,519
If I join Shen Weizhou's team

101
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,679
Can I get rid of Han Tianyu

102
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,000
This scar

103
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:03,079
is exactly like the one I had on my forehead before.

104
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,119
Are you trying to end our family line?

105
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,040
This time

106
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,399
I won't let you get hurt again

107
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,359
Sorry about that.

108
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,679
It's okay

109
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:45,519
You don't need to answer me right away.

110
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
Think it over first.

111
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,320
Okay.

112
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:58,200
The scar that was originally on my forehead

113
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,279
has appeared on Shen Weizhou's hand

114
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,079
Is this a coincidence

115
00:08:02,679 --> 00:08:03,679
or

116
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,640
.

117
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,040
Han Tianyu

118
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,399
Everyone is waiting for you in the rehearsal hall

119
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,880
What are you doing here

120
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,920
I just went to the restroom

121
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:24,839
I'll go back now

122
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,959
This Shen Weizhou

123
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,679
Why are you everywhere

124
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:33,039
Buzzkill

125
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,559
We can't keep hiding like this.

126
00:08:44,719 --> 00:08:46,479
How can we avoid Han Tianyu?

127
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,039
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,520
I shouldn't have treated you like that last night.

129
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,039
I really know I was wrong.

130
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,119
To pay you back,

131
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,479
I sold all the Tianqi stocks.

132
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,840
The money has been transferred to your account.

133
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,520
I bought U-Tech stocks.

134
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,359
When it rises,

135
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,119
I can pay you back all the money I owe you.

136
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,440
Please don't break up with me.

137
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,000
By the way,

138
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,479
In his previous life, Han Tianyu

139
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:11,280
sold his Tianqi stocks early.

140
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,719
Later, the stock surged.

141
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,039
And the U-Tech stocks he bought

142
00:09:16,239 --> 00:09:17,559
will plummet soon after.

143
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:21,679
I'll give it a try.

144
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:41,080
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

145
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,039
Two, two, three, four

146
00:09:44,479 --> 00:09:45,119
Tighten the core

147
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:46,080
Xiaoyan, you are here

148
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,359
Tighten

149
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:48,400
Wait, I'll be ready soon

150
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:50,960
I don't know when I, as an artist assistant

151
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:53,960
will be promoted

152
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,359
Hmm, okay

153
00:09:57,239 --> 00:09:58,359
Continue, don't stop

154
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,880
Were you okay yesterday?

155
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,359
You really worried me.

156
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:05,119
I'm fine.

157
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:06,080
Come, fingertips.

158
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,320
I just thought I was pregnant.

159
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:09,640
A bit sensitive.

160
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:10,840
It's good that you're okay.

161
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,719
Straighten your leg.

162
00:10:19,599 --> 00:10:21,719
I recently came across some social news

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,200
and it made me afraid of marriage.

164
00:10:24,599 --> 00:10:25,440
What news?

165
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,960
It was about

166
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,159
a woman who got cancer.

167
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,719
Her husband bought a huge insurance policy for her.

168
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,359
Seeing her condition was bad,

169
00:10:34,359 --> 00:10:36,520
he immediately bought the insurance.

170
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,520
He was just waiting for her to die

171
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:40,799
to collect the insurance money.

172
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,719
Her husband is such a scumbag.

173
00:10:44,599 --> 00:10:45,640
Not only that,

174
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:48,200
her husband also got involved with her best friend.

175
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,200
They got together.

176
00:10:49,359 --> 00:10:50,679
This is so disgusting.

177
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,559
What kind of people do such things?

178
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:54,000
Her best friend thought

179
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,679
her friend was going to die anyway.

180
00:10:56,479 --> 00:10:57,760
Anyway, since they were young,

181
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,919
they shared everything.

182
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,320
I don't want to pretend anymore.

183
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,799
That's right, Shuyan.

184
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,479
We are friends,

185
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,200
but don't we share everything?

186
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,119
You should have died a long time ago.

187
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,440
This is your final value.

188
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,080
Shuyan

189
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,159
If I die in the future

190
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,239
You can take all my things

191
00:11:31,719 --> 00:11:33,760
But if you die

192
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,520
I will die with you

193
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,640
If I hadn't seen the ending

194
00:11:39,119 --> 00:11:41,119
I would really be moved by your words

195
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,679
Shuyan

196
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:48,520
Look

197
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,880
Tianyu is so handsome

198
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,080
I think he will

199
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,880
definitely become a big star

200
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
A big star

201
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,760
Do you like him?

202
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,080
Of course I like him

203
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,919
Tianyu

204
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,679
Thank you

205
00:12:11,479 --> 00:12:13,400
So what is meant to come will still come

206
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,960
Then take away my fate
