4
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,149
In any case,

5
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,049
I still think

6
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,549
Mengya is a good girl.

7
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,600
Grandpa,

8
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,349
Mengya and I called off the engagement.

9
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,200
I paid the compensation too.

10
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,549
Do you really think

11
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,049
she came to see you out of kindness?

12
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,930
That is exactly why I like her.

13
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,179
She has

14
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,049
what it takes

15
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,349
to be the mistress
of Norran Entertainment Group.

16
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,230
I admire her determination.

17
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,300
Remember,

18
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,379
a man

19
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,860
should be with a woman like that.

20
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,109
Remember,

21
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,879
to protect a family,

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,449
you need to have grit.

23
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,509
Grandpa!

24
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:19,449
Sit down.

25
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:20,660
Let's sit and talk.

26
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:31,960
Grandpa,

27
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,330
when Mom was still alive,

28
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,630
what did you think
about Dad going after Ms. Lin?

29
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,060
Compared to Ms. Lin,

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,209
wasn't Mom more ambitious,

31
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,500
more ruthless?

32
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,500
When I was a kid,

33
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,500
I relied more on Ms. Lin
than my own mother.

34
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,660
But Mom went through
so much on her own.

35
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,100
She must have been
so desperate and heartbroken.

36
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,730
And under your arrangements,

37
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,679
I got engaged to Mengya.

38
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,009
Even though I didn't love her,

39
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:02,830
I accepted that fate.

40
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,130
But, I don't want to
end up like my father.

41
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,230
When I saw how it all ended,

42
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,860
I knew I never wanted to
go down that path.

43
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,700
What I really want

44
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,360
is to be with Shu Yan forever.

45
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,660
Grandpa,

46
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,860
tell me.

47
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:23,900
What should I do?

48
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,430
They don't know who Shen Weizhou is.

49
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,600
Right.

50
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,600
What a couple of fools.

51
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,779
But I'm curious.

52
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,309
What if they find out?

53
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,700
What will they do then?

54
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,330
Wei,

55
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,360
go wash these clothes.

56
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,179
Those in the closet
have been sitting for months.

57
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,330
Take them out, wash and dry them.

58
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,800
Mom,

59
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,549
you want me to wash
all of these by myself?

60
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,109
Yes.

61
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,279
Where are you going?

62
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,230
I'm going to a party, of course.

63
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:10,979
You

64
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,749
should stay home
and listen to prenatal music.

65
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,679
Do the laundry while listening to it.

66
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,930
That sounds wonderful, right?

67
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,379
Baby, Grandma's heading out now.

68
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:22,660
Stay home and listen
to your prenatal music with Mommy.

69
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,100
I don't deserve this.

70
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,610
(Shen Weizhou's personal profile)

71
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,300
Shen Weizhou is the heir
to Norran Entertainment.

72
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,730
No wonder Shu Yan
dumped Han Tianyu on me.

73
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,860
She found someone richer!

74
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,100
Why?

75
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,530
Why?

76
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,200
Ye Wei.

77
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,360
What did you do?

78
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,430
Shen...

79
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,760
Shen Weizhou...

80
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:25,100
Shen Weizhou just happened
to be born into the right family.

81
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,330
He got lucky.

82
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,930
Why couldn't I be born
into a rich family too?

83
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,200
Are you jealous of Shen Weizhou?

84
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,649
Shu Yan ditched you for him!

85
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,630
What can you even do now?

86
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,600
Cursed Shu Yan.

87
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,330
So that's how it is.

88
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,579
She ditched me

89
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,260
and go live the good life?

90
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,300
Did you pay back the money?

91
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,079
Keep your voice down.

92
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,560
My mom might hear it.

93
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,860
How much is left?

94
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,760
Would 100 million be enough?

95
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,130
What?

96
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,800
We should be able to get compensation.

97
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,060
Why does Shu Yan always
get all the benefits?

98
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,600
Don't be stupid.

99
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,760
You think she would give it to you?

100
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,530
She has no choice.

101
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,900
I know everything about her.

102
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,530
Even...

103
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,900
Even things she doesn't know.

104
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,500
What are you doing?

105
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,930
What?

106
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,230
Who are you calling?

107
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,430
Shut up.

108
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,679
Why leave the hospital now of all times?

109
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,660
I'm worried about the baby. I wanted
to check on the baby. Sorry to trouble you.

110
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,279
It is fine.

111
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,909
You bought her insurance too?

112
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,730
Isn't she having surgery soon?

113
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,930
Why not let her die before the surgery?

114
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:03,079
Should I ask Shu Yan out

115
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,830
to meet at the river someday?

116
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,400
Then, if something
"accidentally" happens...

117
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,760
Have you lost your mind?

118
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,530
What do you want?

119
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:18,700
What do you want?

120
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:21,560
What do you want?

121
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,630
You should have died a long time ago.

122
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,679
That is your last bit of value.

123
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,960
Get lost, nutcase!

124
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,460
No!

125
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,109
(Shu Yan,)

126
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:56,909
(I can't reach you by phone.)

127
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,500
(Are you doing well?)

128
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,100
(I hear things about you now and then.)

129
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,730
(This is Mom.)

130
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,230
Yan,

131
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,330
you've grown up.

132
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,000
You're so beautiful.

133
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:17,000
You're still beautiful too.

134
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,709
I'm already old.

135
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,600
Time has been cruel to me.

136
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,209
Back then,

137
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,160
I was young and naive.

138
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,960
I married your father in a blur.

139
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:33,560
But the truth is, I never liked him.

140
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,930
But back in those days,

141
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:38,200
everyone got married like that.

142
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,600
Then, you were born.

143
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:45,760
I'm sorry, Yan.

144
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,400
Back then,

145
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,000
I left you behind.

146
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,660
I'm really sorry.

147
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,960
All these years,

148
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,260
I've missed you so much.

149
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:01,130
Then, why haven't you come to me?

150
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,809
I...

151
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,209
I wanted to see you.

152
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,360
But, your father
wouldn't let me see you.

153
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:11,230
I heard your father
passed away a few years ago.

154
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,049
And last year,

155
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,860
your grandpa passed too.

156
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,430
So I thought,

157
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,130
my poor daughter...

158
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,360
must be all alone now.

159
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,200
My heart couldn't take it.

160
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,300
So, I came here to see you.

161
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,760
Grandpa treated me well.

162
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,860
To be honest,

163
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,660
if it weren't for him all these years,

164
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,700
I wouldn't have made it through.

165
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,300
Sometimes I wonder,

166
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,060
I really do hate you.

167
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:48,100
If you hadn't left me...

168
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:51,400
If you had stayed in my life...

169
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,309
Would I have

170
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,100
avoided all the wrong people?

171
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,460
Yan,

172
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,709
it's my fault.

173
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,530
All these years, it's on me.

174
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,279
I'm sorry.

175
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,930
You suffered for my mistake.

176
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,530
Tell me how I can make it up to you.

177
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,579
Tell me.

178
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,749
Tell me what to do

179
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,400
to make it right.

180
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,000
Then, just stay by my side.

181
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,800
Okay.

182
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,160
From now on,

183
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,660
I will always stay with you.

184
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:29,309
Hello.

185
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,660
Feel free to take a look.

186
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,600
So pretty.

187
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,600
You can't find clothes this fancy
back in the countryside.

188
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,449
This...

189
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,060
Would this suit me?

190
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,779
Excuse me.

191
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,509
How much is this?

192
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:46,430
One thousand.

193
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:47,300
Okay.

194
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,700
That expensive?

195
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,330
Forget it. Never mind.

196
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,079
Pack it up.

197
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:52,900
Sure.

198
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,430
Let's keep looking.

199
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,309
Welcome.

200
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,909
Feel free to take a look around.

201
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:02,349
Mom,

202
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,760
see if there's anything you like.

203
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,360
This looks really nice.

204
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,109
Okay.

205
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:07,849
That one.

206
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,709
This?

207
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,560
Sure.

208
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,130
Try it on.

209
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,500
It looks beautiful.

210
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,500
Does it look good?

211
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,560
It does.

212
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:30,200
Really good.

213
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:32,449
How much is this?

214
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,509
- This one is forty-eight thousand.
- We'll take it.

215
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,660
Pack it up, please.

216
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,460
Sure.

217
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,900
I'll pack it for you.

218
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,279
Let's check out the other items.

219
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,230
Sure.

220
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,900
You look thrilled.

221
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,930
Of course I am.

222
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:48,509
With a daughter like you,

223
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,330
how could I not be happy?

224
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,730
Now that you're seeing a rich guy,

225
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,000
you really do spend generously.

226
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,030
No.

227
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,009
Yan, I didn't mean that.

228
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,230
I knew it.

229
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,930
Back when I got into a good university,

230
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,000
when I joined a top company,

231
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,130
you never reached out to me.

232
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,149
No, Yan. That wasn't
what I meant just now.

233
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,279
If the rich guy
you're talking about is Shen Weizhou,

234
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,630
then you'd better give up on that idea.

235
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,960
We're already over.

236
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,660
Why?

237
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,930
You finally landed a rich guy.

238
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,460
Why would you break up with him?

239
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,530
Seriously, why would you do that?

240
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,600
Just think about it.

241
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,930
That face of yours

242
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,479
inherited my beauty genes.

243
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,060
You could've won over any man.

244
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,560
No way.

245
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,500
You'd better get him back.

246
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,300
You want to know why?

247
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:57,160
Then, tell me why you left me back then.

248
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,360
Why did you run away from home?

249
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,660
So, you knew all along.

250
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,930
Why did you still buy me all this stuff?

251
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,930
I saw my mom today.

252
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,530
I wanted to try

253
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,960
to be a good daughter.

254
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,700
To show some filial piety.

255
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,909
With a mother around,

256
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,100
maybe I could be happy too.

257
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,430
But now that I've tried,

258
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,330
I don't want to see you again.

259
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,430
Do you have money?

260
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,909
You're dating a rich guy.

261
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,560
A hundred million
should be no big deal.

262
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,009
If I wasn't

263
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,230
at the end of my rope,

264
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,560
why would I come looking for you?

265
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,570
(Ye Wei)

266
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,500
Who is this?

267
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,179
It has been a long time, hasn't it?

268
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,400
How have you been?

269
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,630
I heard you're short on cash.

270
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:11,130
You have to understand.

271
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,779
You want to be a good daughter, right?

272
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,530
You should see it through.

273
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,000
Your name isn't even
on my household registry.

274
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,330
I have no money.

275
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,800
And I have no mother.

276
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,000
I never had one.

277
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,560
And I never will.

278
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,779
You ingrate!

279
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,509
I carried you

280
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,500
for ten months and gave birth to you!

281
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,630
This is...

282
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,779
Not this.

283
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,030
It's too expensive.

284
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,549
Forget it.

285
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,200
Heartless little brat.

286
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,509
Are you stupid or what?

287
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,000
It was a simple task!

288
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:48,349
I told you to pretend to be a good mom

289
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:50,209
and trick her little by little!

290
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:52,300
That's exactly what I was doing!

291
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,130
But she cut me off.

292
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,009
What else could I do?

293
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,179
Just keep playing dumb!

294
00:14:59,180 --> 00:14:59,879
Forget it.

295
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm done talking to you.

296
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:05,930
Useless fool.

297
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:09,960
No way.

298
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,630
I have to come up with something else.

299
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:18,730
Yan.

300
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,909
Mr. Lin? What are you doing here?

301
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,100
Boss sent me.

302
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,760
He wants you to keep training in judo.

303
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,909
But he was worried
you'd feel awkward with him there,

304
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:30,060
so from now on,
I'll be your training partner.

305
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,060
Why are you wearing a mask?

306
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,760
I caught a little cold.

307
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,979
He told me to bring you your belongings

308
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,360
from his place.

309
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,060
Thank you.

310
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:44,709
I'll head up now.

311
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:45,430
Okay.

312
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,430
Bye.

313
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,760
See you in a bit.

314
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:52,000
(Why does that guy look so familiar?)

315
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,509
So they're working

316
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,930
with the loan sharks.

317
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,900
How dare you mess with me?

318
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,600
Shu Yan,

319
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,560
