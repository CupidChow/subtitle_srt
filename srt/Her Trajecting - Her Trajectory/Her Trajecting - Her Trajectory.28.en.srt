=Episode 28=

4
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:45,660
Come here.

5
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:47,509
I already told you

6
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:48,879
not to do this in the restaurant.

7
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,709
You're so annoying.

8
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:50,309
What's wrong?

9
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,679
You're so bad.

10
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,709
My plan for tonight is

11
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,609
we watch a movie.

12
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,030
Sure.

13
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,209
You always tease me.

14
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,200
Does your wife know about this?

15
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:18,460
Huiting!

16
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:21,760
Bai Kun.

17
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,160
You knew he was cheating on you.

18
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,700
You should've
slapped him then and there.

19
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,879
Why did you choose to run away?

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,260
How do you know?

21
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,260
Doesn't matter how I know.

22
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,160
Why did you just silently endure it?

23
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:36,749
Don't you realize

24
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,600
that the more you tolerate,
the more he'll take you for granted?

25
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,030
I'm good to him.

26
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,279
I waited for him.

27
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,649
I kept waiting.

28
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,030
He should've come to his senses.

29
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,400
So why?

30
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,000
Why does he keep hurting me
again and again?

31
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,460
Jiao.

32
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,830
Jiao.

33
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,330
Yan.

34
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,709
Go back and rest.

35
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,160
I'll stay and keep watch.

36
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,109
Okay.

37
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll head home.

38
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,630
I've become

39
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,060
much,

40
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,100
much stronger now.

41
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,730
You should know that.

42
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,030
Because this whole time,

43
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,300
you were watching me

44
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,200
get through everything.

45
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,630
Aren't you going
to keep watching over me?

46
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,000
I...

47
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,949
I've walked

48
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,560
this road alone

49
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,800
the entire time.

50
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,930
I don't want to be alone anymore.

51
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,709
Can you...

52
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:34,060
Can you please wake up and stay with me?

53
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,500
Shu Yan...

54
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,700
Shu Yan...

55
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,900
(What did Shu Yan mean
by what she said?)

56
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,330
(What will she do to me?)

57
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,400
(So it was Wu Mengya
who was targeting Shu Yan.)

58
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:51,949
Slow down.

59
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:53,200
Careful, the floor's slippery.

60
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,460
It's okay.

61
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:55,700
Sit.

62
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,030
I told you not to move so much.

63
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:01,509
I'm fine.

64
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,600
I feel much better.

65
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,530
What are you doing?

66
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,209
It's uncomfortable.

67
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,500
I want to take it off.

68
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,679
No.

69
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,130
There's a reason
the doctor told you to wear it.

70
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,360
You can't take it off.

71
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,630
Be a good boy.

72
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,679
Okay, fine.

73
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,760
Whatever you say.

74
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,679
Are you hungry?

75
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,160
I'll make you something to eat.

76
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,030
What's up?

77
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,160
Just want to hold you for a while.

78
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,660
Wu Mengya's not easy to deal with.

79
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,700
Once she sets her mind on something,

80
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,930
she won't stop until the end.

81
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,800
Keep yourself safe.

82
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,649
Everything still seems

83
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,930
to be heading toward the fate
I tried to change.

84
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,549
Wu Mengya is working
with Han Tianyu and Ye Wei

85
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,030
to kill me

86
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,230
and steal all my money.

87
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,300
And Huiting's been diagnosed

88
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,309
with stomach cancer.

89
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,730
Her husband cheated on her too.

90
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,060
My fate has been transferred onto her.

91
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,809
There must be some other turning point

92
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,260
I haven't discovered yet.

93
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,960
She shouldn't have to bear my fate.

94
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,260
I'll be here with you.

95
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,360
Don't worry.

96
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,060
It'll be okay.

97
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,160
Mm.

98
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,109
Darling,

99
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,109
today marks our 100th day together.

100
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,679
Where are you taking me?

101
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,100
I already have it all planned out.

102
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,260
Let's go.

103
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,230
Come on.

104
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,549
The police believe the accident was

105
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,060
(Heavy Vehicle Rental Contract)
caused by a drunk driver and are investigating.

106
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,279
I've already sent people
to track Wu Mengya,

107
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,949
Ye Wei,

108
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,300
and Han Tianyu.

109
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,509
As you can see,

110
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,800
no leverage.

111
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,660
If you knew something beforehand,

112
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,160
I think it's better
to discuss it with me.

113
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,709
I wasn't completely sure

114
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,960
you were one of us.

115
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,860
Sorry.

116
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,900
I'm not that upset.

117
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,530
The most urgent task now
is locating Ye Qiang and Pei Juan.

118
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,049
Wu Mengya is looking for them too.

119
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,579
We have to get to them

120
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,579
before she does.

121
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,430
Mm.

122
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,860
What's going on?

123
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,749
Your dad's in hiding.

124
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,330
I haven't been able to reach him.

125
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,230
He must not get caught.

126
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,300
Oh, right.

127
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,260
I've got a shoot for the next few days

128
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,830
and have to stay with the crew.

129
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,600
Stay home and lie low.

130
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,300
If there's any news,
let me know right away.

131
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,600
What are we supposed to do now?

132
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,649
We can't just keep running

133
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,130
and hiding like this.

134
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,800
How long can this go on?

135
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,949
What else can we do?

136
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,360
Take it one day at a time.

137
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,200
Who's calling?

138
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:42,949
Hello?

139
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:43,830
Who is this?

140
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,560
Why are you hiding?

141
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,930
I've been searching everywhere for you.

142
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:48,830
No.

143
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,509
I wasn't hiding from you.

144
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,200
I was hiding from my daughter.

145
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,560
We're terrified.

146
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,830
Don't worry.

147
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,160
I've arranged everything.

148
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,160
You'll lay low abroad for a while.

149
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,549
Huiting,

150
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,760
you know everything?

151
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,560
Mm.

152
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,400
Every time I say I'm going
to the hospital, he brings her home.

153
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,930
So today, I told him I'd be admitted.

154
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:14,300
I also checked
the store's surveillance footage.

155
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:16,579
The lawyer said
there isn't enough proof of infidelity

156
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,130
to file for divorce.

157
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,500
So today, I'm going to wait

158
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,530
and catch them together in the act.

159
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,309
Huiting,

160
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:25,800
can I come with you?

161
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:26,830
Mm.

162
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,709
Cut it out.

163
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:43,960
You even bought her life insurance?

164
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,260
But isn't she about to have surgery?

165
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,779
Just have to make sure

166
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,400
she dies before the surgery.

167
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,600
Stop filming!

168
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,260
Stop it!

169
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,560
Huiting.

170
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,130
Didn't you go to the hospital?

171
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,300
Why...

172
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,349
Why did you come back?

173
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:07,549
If I hadn't come back,

174
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,549
I wouldn't have
caught you both in the act.

175
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,600
Why are you doing this to me?

176
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,000
Ting.

177
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,260
Calm down.

178
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,330
You need to leave.

179
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,260
Go!

180
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,549
Are you crazy? Why'd you attack her?

181
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,709
How dare you bring her to our home!

182
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,209
What if Mu saw?

183
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,030
You make me sick!

184
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,149
You even bought
life insurance for me, huh?

185
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,949
How much do you get

186
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,460
if I die?

187
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:40,930
What are you going on about?

188
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,500
That never happened.

189
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,800
Are you insane?

190
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,030
I'm warning you.

191
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,900
Don't push it.

192
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,030
Psycho!

193
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,560
Huiting, are you okay?

194
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,279
You cheat and still have the nerve to hit her?

195
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,979
You cheat and you get violent?

196
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,230
How dare you!

197
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,500
You're trash!

198
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,400
You two are both out of your minds!

199
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,500
Stop it!

200
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,509
You should stay at a hotel for now.

201
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,379
Don't worry about anything else.

202
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,730
I'll handle it.

203
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,230
Thanks.

204
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,449
But judging by the way he reacted,

205
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,560
he's not going to agree
to a divorce that easily.

206
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,749
No matter what,

207
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,760
don't meet him alone.

208
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,749
If he tries to contact you, tell me.

209
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,730
I'll go with you.

210
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,909
This is a personal issue.
I can't keep troubling you like this.

211
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,479
This isn't just your issue.
I don't want to see you get hurt.

212
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,760
Hurt?

213
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,849
There are things

214
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,800
I can't explain yet,

215
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:55,279
but please,

216
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,709
just trust me.

217
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,660
Okay.

218
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,100
Shu Yan.

219
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,660
Don't worry.

220
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,030
I'm here for her.

221
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,360
Mm.

222
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,100
Get some rest.

223
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,200
Mm.

224
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,279
You can trust Bai Kun.

225
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,549
He's never gone back

226
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,949
on his word.

227
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,709
This whole thing about transferring fate

228
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,400
doesn't just happen by chance.

229
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,000
If her cancer came from the stress
of her husband's neglect,

230
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,060
then what would drive him
to actually kill her?

231
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,600
Because he was cheating
with someone close to her?

232
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:43,860
Or maybe

233
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,730
he's after the insurance money?

234
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,079
To make that cheating Han Tianyu

235
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,179
want to kill his wife,

236
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,960
that's when the "fate"
would complete itself.

237
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,860
Only then will Huiting survive.

238
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,100
I need to seduce Han Tianyu.

239
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,749
Don't worry about a thing.

240
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,000
Do what you need to.

241
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,000
I've got your back.

242
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,730
I found out where he is.

243
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,579
Han Tianyu is filming

244
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,630
with a crew

245
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,300
at the Xingchen Hotel.

246
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,300
Then it's time we put on a show too.

247
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,630
Mr. Fang.

248
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,360
Cut!

249
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,449
Water!

250
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:34,549
Get him ready.

251
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:35,779
Get him for the next scene.

252
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,560
Okay.

253
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:37,930
Sir.

254
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,600
Your water, sir.

255
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,309
Are they filming
another cheesy CEO drama or what?

256
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:43,660
So tacky.

257
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,209
Looks like Han Tianyu's career

258
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:47,000
is in the dumps.

259
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:47,979
This way.

260
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,200
This way, sir.

261
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,130
I'm still here!

262
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,630
What, small actors don't matter now?

263
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,160
What does he have that I don't?

264
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:58,660
Let's do this.

265
00:13:59,110 --> 00:13:59,930
Okay.

266
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,830
Why are you here again?

267
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,130
Didn't you already take the money
and agree to break up?

268
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes, we broke up.

269
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,330
But you can't just fire me!

270
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,749
You should at least
keep things professional.

271
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,979
The company has to cut those

272
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,920
with poor performance.

273
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,999
You've been here five years,

274
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:23,160
and all you've done is host
a few food segments. What else?

275
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,000
Shen Weizhou...

276
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:24,909
That's enough.

277
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,700
Don't come looking for me anymore.

278
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,160
Stay out of my sight.

279
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,709
So Shu Yan took the money,

280
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,230
then dumped him.

281
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,000
Should I tell Mengya about this?

282
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,300
Never mind.

283
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,060
Shu Yan.

284
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,400
What are you doing here?

285
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,660
I'm shooting a drama.

286
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,730
What was that?

287
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,430
Did Shen Weizhou dump you?

288
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,009
You must be thrilled

289
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,460
to see me like this.

290
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,530
Of course, I am.

291
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,360
You tried to land yourself
a rich husband by seducing Shen Weizhou,

292
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,560
and now you've got nothing.

293
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,060
It's not that bad.

294
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,349
Things are still

295
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,000
leaning in my favor.

296
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,730
What do you mean?

297
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,500
Want to grab a drink

298
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,730
and talk?

299
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,160
Sure.

300
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,360
Why isn't he picking up?

301
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:42,930
Shu Yan married into money.

302
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,749
She must be planning her next move

303
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,160
against me.

304
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,030
Director Zhang?

305
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:04,060
Did Han Tianyu show up on set today?

306
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,779
He finished filming

307
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,779
and left.

308
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,030
Left?

309
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,000
Did he say where he was going?

310
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,979
He went off with a woman.

311
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,200
I heard she's his ex.

312
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:16,379
I'm busy.

313
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,260
I have to go.

314
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,830
His ex?

315
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,760
Shu Yan?

316
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,730
800 million?

317
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,479
Chairman Shen said

318
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,900
it was a fair deal for breaking up

319
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,560
with Shen Weizhou.

320
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,579
Not all cash,

321
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,209
of course.

322
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,560
There's property involved too.

323
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,849
Shen Weizhou was furious
when he found out

324
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,149
I accepted Chairman Shen's money.

325
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,779
Now I'm caught in the middle

326
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,160
between the two of them.

327
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,260
I don't know what to do anymore.

328
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,649
(Shu Yan's luck is unreal.)

329
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,149
(Even if she doesn't marry rich,)

330
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,000
(she's still worth
hundreds of millions.)

331
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,549
(And here I am,)

332
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,430
(stuck playing background characters.)

333
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,170
(Wei)

334
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,860
Tianyu.

335
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,379
I miss those days

336
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,460
when we were still together.

337
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,479
Remember

338
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,349
when we first graduated?

339
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,449
We missed the last train

340
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,060
after job hunting.

341
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,060
We didn't have money for a cab,

342
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,949
so we just huddled

343
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:28,000
under a bridge all night to stay warm.

344
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,160
Why would you even remember

345
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,479
something like that?

346
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,009
Because it was special to me.

347
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,700
That's why.

348
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,349
You know

349
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,230
I used to like you a lot.

350
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,500
Right.

351
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,330
You were so kind.

352
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,030
I had a temper.

353
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,630
Only you ever put up with it.

354
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:48,000
So

355
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,500
are you and Shen Weizhou really over?

356
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,430
Mm.

357
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,009
But to be fair,

358
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:55,260
he was very good to me.

359
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,449
I nearly got hit

360
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,779
in a serious car accident a while ago.

361
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,430
A car accident?

362
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:03,460
A truck was speeding toward me.

363
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,149
For a second,
I thought I was going to die.

364
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,400
But then Shen Weizhou jumped in
and took the hit for me.

365
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,779
Do you know

366
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,590
who was driving that truck?

367
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,249

♪You make the stars
burn brighter in the sky♪

00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:18,490

at our reunion♪
