00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,460
(Every Trajectory Is You)

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,540
=Episode 15=

4
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,600
Are they crossing the line
with their behaviors?

5
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,630
Han Tianyu is your boyfriend.

6
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:56,600
It's all right. They are just too close.

7
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:58,830
Do you want water?

8
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,200
This fruit as well.

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,680
I purposely brought it for you.
It's not provided by the crew.

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,430
Thank you.

11
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,200
How is it?

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,400
Are you used to it?

13
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,870
I was nervous with cameras around

14
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,640
but when I was cooking
or completing missions,

15
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,400
I would forget
about the cameras' existence.

16
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:18,000
If I do badly,

17
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:19,370
tell me any time.

18
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,800
I don't want to cause you trouble
because of my problem.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,470
No. Let me tell you.

20
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,400
All the crew members like you a lot.

21
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,930
They were all telling me

22
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,230
that they wanted your autograph.

23
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,900
If you're unhappy or need my help,
just come to me any time.

24
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,800
Although I might not be able to help,

25
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,830
you'll feel better

26
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,770
if you tell others your problem.

27
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,600
Chu Chen,

28
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,800
thank you.

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,830
Then,

30
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,300
I'll be leaving.

31
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,700
There are many people here.

32
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,200
It might start a gossip.

33
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,130
All right.

34
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,270
Go back to work.

35
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,130
Right now,

36
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,030
every team only has a budget of 30 yuan.

37
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,270
All of you must use this 30 yuan well

38
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,130
to prepare a feast

39
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,170
for the filming team.

40
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,430
No way, Director.

41
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,630
Only 30 yuan?

42
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,070
How is that enough to make dinner?

43
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,430
It's not enough for everyone.

44
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,300
I'm not done yet.

45
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:12,930
From now on,

46
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,630
you can split into groups

47
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:18,030
and obtain useful clues
through competitions.

48
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,930
You can use them
to find ingredients hidden elsewhere.

49
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,800
Of course. During the process,

50
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,230
you can steal

51
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,730
other groups' ingredients.

52
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,030
The time is also three hours.

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:30,900
Director,

54
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,230
if there are no further questions,
let's begin.

55
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:33,870
All right.

56
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
Get ready.

57
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,070
Come on.

58
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,400
Three!

59
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:39,800
Two!

60
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,070
One!

61
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,700
Wait.

62
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,930
It's that international model, Meng Ya.

63
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,530
Look.

64
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,730
Isn't that the international model,
Meng Ya?

65
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,100
Why is she here?

66
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,300
I heard she took over the position of

67
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,970
Norran Entertainment's vice president.

68
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,000
A capable woman.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,730
However, I heard
that she has a bad temper.

70
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,430
I'm participating
in this program as a guest.

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,870
It seems like
you don't welcome me, Mr. Shen.

72
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,230
Ms. Meng Ya.

73
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,570
We didn't receive any notice
about you coming here.

74
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,070
Your sudden participation

75
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,600
will affect our filming.

76
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,430
What do you think, Mr. Shen?

77
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,770
I think it's not right.

78
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,070
Are you sure?

79
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,930
Not only am I an international model,

80
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,930
I am also
the newly appointed vice president

81
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,370
of Norran Entertainment.

82
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,570
With my fame,

83
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,970
it'll only benefit this program
if I participate.

84
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,430
There's no harm.

85
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,500
No matter who you are,

86
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,670
there are procedures to follow
when it comes to work.

87
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,920
You can't treat this as a joke

88
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,300
because of personal preference.

89
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,830
Procedures?

90
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,270
Fine.

91
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,030
Director. Do you have any objections?

92
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:46,670
I...

93
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,600
I have no objections
if the producer has no objections.

94
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,880
Does the producer have any objections?

95
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:54,770
No.

96
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,670
Who else?

97
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,270
The planner?

98
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,570
I need to ask my superior.

99
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:02,870
I am

100
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,870
Norran Entertainment's vice president.

101
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,730
Which superior are you going to ask?

102
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,370
Old Master Shen?

103
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,000
The person in charge of this program
is Mr. Bai Kun.

104
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,670
You can't spoil other people's plans

105
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,000
regardless of

106
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,470
your position.

107
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,670
Bai Kun, right?

108
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,430
Hello, Vice President Wu.

109
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,970
Mr. Bai.

110
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,170
Tell everyone my decision.

111
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,200
Everyone,

112
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,100
I am Bai Kun.

113
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,570
Wu Mengya

114
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:36,800
will officially join the team

115
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,130
as a special guest.

116
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,100
Please adjust the filming plan

117
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,800
according to the on-site situation.

118
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,430
Do you hear that?

119
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,100
Can I

120
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,200
join the filming now?

121
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,730
Ms. Meng Ya,

122
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,000
please wait.

123
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,700
We will amend the filming immediately.

124
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:05,770
This is the amended filming.

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,700
What do you think?

126
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,870
We are running out of time.

127
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,430
This is the best solution now.

128
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,380
(Food)

129
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,530
Gather around.

130
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,170
Everyone, get ready.

131
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:15,800
Come on.

132
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,430
Rolling!

133
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,730
Right now,

134
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,800
let's invite our special guest,

135
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,300
international model,

136
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,000
Meng Ya

137
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,600
to join us!

138
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:29,770
Hello, everyone.

139
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,830
I am Meng Ya.

140
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,840
I'm fortunate enough to be invited
back to the country for this filming.

141
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,500
Please take good care of me.

142
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,270
All right!

143
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,970
Up next,

144
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,530
we will begin the group competition.

145
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,730
Meng Ya will team up with Shen Weizhou.

146
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:47,322
The remaining teams

147
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,030
will be formed with our crew members.

148
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,570
They are our project manager,

149
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,400
Shu Yan

150
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,670
and assistant project manager,

151
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,400
Ye Wei.

152
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,630
Of course,

153
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,700
both of you can choose

154
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,070
the team you want to join.

155
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,630
I choose

156
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,600
to join Mr. Han Tianyu's team.

157
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,430
Ye Wei

158
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:16,330
will team up with Chu Chen then.

159
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,230
Ye Wei.

160
00:06:24,627 --> 00:06:25,100
All right.

161
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,600
Our three teams

162
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,370
have been formed now.

163
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,270
Our colours are red, yellow, and green.

164
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:36,407
Our ingredients have been packaged.

165
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,000
They are hiding

166
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:40,070
in different spots in the wild.

167
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,900
They are marked with different colours.

168
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,700
A red package
contains high-class ingredients.

169
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:46,930
A yellow package
contains middle-class ingredients.

170
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,700
A green package
contains low-class ingredients.

171
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,030
The higher the level of ingredients
you obtain,

172
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,030
the better your rewards.

173
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,200
Since our project managers have joined,

174
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:03,070
they don't know the exact location

175
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,870
for the sake of fairness.

176
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,330
From now on,

177
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,930
you have three hours.

178
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,500
The activity

179
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,730
begins!

180
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,100
Hurry.

181
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,830
Follow them.

182
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,100
You must capture
the most exciting footage.

183
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:16,730
Understand?

184
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:17,930
Hurry up.

185
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,430
Let's go.

186
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:19,570
Move.

187
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,600
Hurry.

188
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,300
What are you trying to do?

189
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:28,570
I've wanted to tell you
that I realized you've changed

190
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:29,900
since I came back.

191
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,630
You look like a man now, at least.

192
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,370
Don't worry.

193
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,700
Regardless of my relationship with you,

194
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,230
my relationship with your grandfather

195
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,500
will never change.

196
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,760
How weird.

197
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,730
Your relationship with grandpa
has improved for some reason

198
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:44,400
and you've visited him more frequently.

199
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,870
You visit him more frequently now

200
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,770
compared to when we were engaged.

201
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,330
What?

202
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,030
Mr. Shen has

203
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,530
become sharp all of a sudden.

204
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,130
Is it because of that woman?

205
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,830
Didn't you agree to cancel the marriage?

206
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,730
Yes.

207
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,870
However, that was before I heard
that you had another woman.

208
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,170
I hate it the most
when other people touch my things.

209
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:12,570
Keep up.

210
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:13,600
Be careful.

211
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,600
Shu Yan.

212
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,500
Are you all right?

213
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,700
I'm fine.

214
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,700
(Shu Yan,)

215
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,030
(just you wait.)

216
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,930
Ye Wei, be careful.

217
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,830
You're so annoying.
No wonder Shu Yan hates you.

218
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,500
(I hate you! Shu Yan)

219
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,930
It was you.

220
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,200
Gosh, there are so many insects here.

221
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,670
Mr. Shen,

222
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,770
can you help me?

223
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,200
Why don't you

224
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,400
go and take a break?

225
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,360
I can find it on my own.

226
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,000
Are you going to abandon me?

227
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,070
What? Are you not used to
filming a variety program?

228
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,970
I feel a little tired.

229
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,700
Mr. Shen,

230
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,570
can you carry me on my back?

231
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,700
The marriage.

232
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,500
Sure. Let's go.

233
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,370
Why are you afraid?

234
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,230
Soon,

235
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,470
I will announce our marriage
to the audience.

236
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,360
If we were caught on camera,

237
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,520
just think of it as giving fans
something to talk about.

238
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:30,730
Sure.

239
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:34,230
Wu Mengya, if you want to announce
the marriage in public,

240
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,500
I'll also announce
the cancellation in public.

241
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,830
I don't need to become a star.

242
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,560
I can go back
and inherit my family business.

243
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,100
As for you,

244
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,000
your news will be
blown out of proportion by the media

245
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,200
and become a laughing stock.

246
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,200
Shen Weizhou.

247
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,430
I told you I would give you
the necessary compensation

248
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,630
but if you dare touch Shu Yan,

249
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,970
I will never forgive you.

250
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:03,770
You...

251
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,800
Good morning, Chairman.

252
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,270
Shen Weizhou withdrew all his savings

253
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,600
and invested in
a new company called Douli.

254
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,570
The legal person in charge
is a man called He Ju.

255
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,770
Oh.

256
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,900
That's unlike Weizhou.

257
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:38,930
Yes.

258
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,430
According to my investigation,
Shu Yan is involved in this.

259
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,270
Chairman,

260
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,830
do I need to investigate in detail?

261
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,500
Kun.

262
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,770
Some pawns might seem to be captured

263
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:52,770
but it actually

264
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,230
turns the whole game alive instead.

265
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:00,570
Just let him do what he wants.
Stay and observe the changes.

266
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:01,800
Yes,

267
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,670
Chairman.

268
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,370
He Ju.

269
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,900
Douli.

270
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,200
Let me tell you some good news.

271
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,530
With Mr. Shen and Ms. Shu's investments,

272
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,830
(Douli Studio)
our July Beta test will begin soon.

273
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,570
All of you have worked hard
during this period.

274
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,630
Work hard

275
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,930
and let's close this up.

276
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,520
After this,

277
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,870
I'll bring all of you
on an overseas team-building activity.

278
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,230
All right!

279
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,970
(It was Ye Wei)

280
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,070
(who imitated Shu Yan's handwriting
in that letter.)

281
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,700
(She has been using dirty tricks.)

282
00:11:49,492 --> 00:11:50,362
(It's all her fault)

283
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,670
(for making me miss out
on Shu Yan for so many years.)

284
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,370
Chu Chen.

285
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,680
There's an ingredient package.
Why aren't you picking it up?

286
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,730
Thank you.

287
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,300
Tianyu.

288
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,330
I'm fine.

289
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,770
I just need to rest here.

290
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,700
You can leave me alone.

291
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:14,670
No way.

292
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,230
How can I abandon you here?

293
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,570
The mission is important.
It's all right.

294
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,130
Go and find the ingredients.

295
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,000
(Leave as soon as possible.)

296
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,130
(Acting is very tiring.)

297
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,130
Fine.

298
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,200
I'll go and look for the ingredients.
I'll come back when I'm done.

299
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:32,900
All right.

300
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm fine.

301
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,440
I just need to sit here for a while.

302
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,530
Go and film the artist.

303
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,700
Yes.

304
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,970
(This is the development
in the previous life.)

305
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,430
(Both of you will end up together soon.)

306
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,700
Tianyu.

307
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,800
Can you help me get the ingredients?

308
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,700
It's over there.

309
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,470
I twisted my ankle

310
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,500
and couldn't go there.

311
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,400
Sure.

312
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,130
Shen Jiao?

313
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,730
How are you? Are you all right?

314
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:17,430
I got bitten by a snake.

315
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,070
I don't know if it's venomous or not.

316
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,230
Will I die?

317
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,440
Let me take a look for you.

318
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,900
It's probably not venomous.

319
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,670
Why are you here?

320
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,130
I was bored

321
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,400
so I came out to take a stroll
before going back.

322
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,630
What should I do?

323
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,600
Let me carry you.

324
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,080
But you still need to
carry out the mission.

325
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,080
It's all right.
It won't take too much of my time.

326
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,330
Get up.

327
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,970
So sweet.

328
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,400
This is not a food variety show.

329
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,700
This is a romantic variety show.

330
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,170
Yes.

331
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,930
Mr. Shen and Meng Ya are sweet too.

332
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,130
Manager Su too.

333
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:18,560
This is so annoying.

334
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,970
Who decided on this location?

335
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,200
The paths are muddy
and difficult to walk on.

336
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,870
My shoes are limited edition.

337
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,530
I'm tired

338
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,430
and I can't carry you.

339
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,870
You can leave on your own.

340
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,370
Why don't you

341
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,900
go back on your own

342
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,830
or wait for me here?

343
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:43,300
However, I don't know what might happen
in a forest like this.

344
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,200
There might be snakes here.

345
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:46,700
Snakes?

346
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,330
I'm most afraid of snakes.

347
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,700
I'm going back first.

348
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:55,830
Stop filming.

349
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,000
How annoying.

350
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,600
Cameraman,

351
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,570
I'm going to the toilet.
Stop filming for now.

352
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,700
All right.

353
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:19,770
