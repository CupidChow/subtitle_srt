﻿=Her Trajecting=

2
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,460
(Every Trajectory Is You)

3
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,540
=Episode 24=

4
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,930
(My fate)

5
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:48,770
(was already doomed back then.)

6
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,670
She's really pretty, just like her mom.

7
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:52,870
Maybe she'll grow up
to be just like her mom,

8
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,500
running off and abandoning her family.

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,600
Stop it.
The poor kid's been through enough.

10
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,000
Seriously?

11
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:01,100
Then, I'm having some meat.

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,900
It's Mom.

13
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,830
Mom! Wait for me!

14
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:11,270
Why are you taking so much?

15
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,730
It's not that much.

16
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,270
We'll use all of it anyway.

17
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,070
You are sweating all over.

18
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:25,770
Here, for you.

19
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,770
(Back then, everything was fine.)

20
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,630
(Because I longed
for a feeling so close,)

21
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:33,630
(like I could reach out and touch it.)

22
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,900
(I thought)

23
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,600
(I had finally found a real family)

24
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,230
(and friends.)

25
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,870
(But, I never imagined)

26
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:06,830
(I'd fall into the abyss.)

27
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,830
(When I was given a second chance,)

28
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,030
(I told myself)

29
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,970
(that I would fight)

30
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,000
(and learn from my experience.)

31
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,000
(That I would be happier
than anyone else.)

32
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,930
(But, fate never seemed
to be on my side.)

33
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,730
(My love)

34
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,170
(would still leave me in the end.)

35
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,400
(The misfortune)

36
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,130
(was passed on to someone
who never deserved it.)

37
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:05,200
Shu Yan.

38
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,470
You're awake.

39
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:10,600
Yeah.

40
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,330
How are you feeling?

41
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,530
How is Huiting doing?

42
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,230
She has finished the exams

43
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,370
and gone back to rest.

44
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,800
I also contacted
top cancer specialists overseas.

45
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:24,230
Don't worry.

46
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,300
Thank you.

47
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,430
I was afraid what happened with Ms. Yang

48
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,230
would stress you out.

49
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,630
I'm okay.

50
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,070
If there's nothing else,

51
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,330
you should head back.

52
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,330
It won't look good if someone sees us.

53
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,200
I don't care what others think.

54
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,270
I only care about you.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,570
Shu Yan.

56
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,900
If this is about Mengya,

57
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,430
I can explain everything.

58
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,130
I ended the engagement long ago.

59
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,230
I even compensated her.

60
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,930
There's nothing between us now.

61
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,270
Shu Yan.

62
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,800
You should leave.

63
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,360
Don't come looking for me again.

64
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,700
Rest well.

65
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,900
You two

66
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:08,430
really are hard to separate.

67
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,370
But that's fine.

68
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,730
What's mine

69
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,200
will be mine again soon enough.

70
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,770
Thank you for visiting.

71
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,130
It's nothing.

72
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,630
As for Mu,

73
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,230
I hired a nanny to take care of her.

74
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,230
So, don't worry.

75
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,070
I don't like this.

76
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,270
With you around,

77
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:38,800
I'll get soft.

78
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,700
If I were on my own,

79
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,270
I could still endure it.

80
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,900
Then, don't hold it in.

81
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,870
If you want to cry, just cry.

82
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,600
Shu Yan.

83
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,970
Why are you so good to me?

84
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,330
Because you're my best friend.

85
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,900
I'll always be here for you.

86
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,770
(I'm sorry.)

87
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,600
(It's my fault you got sick.)

88
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,770
(Huiting ended up getting cancer.)

89
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,230
(What will happen next?)

90
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:20,100
Hello?

91
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,300
Who's this?

92
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,400
Miss.

93
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,270
She's here.

94
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,830
Ms. Shu Yan.

95
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,000
Have a seat.

96
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,700
Why did you want to see me?

97
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,800
Even if your best friend

98
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,630
got with your boyfriend,

99
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,870
you didn't have to steal mine.

100
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,130
How are you any different from her now?

101
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:58,200
I didn't know he had a fiancée.

102
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,600
Really?

103
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,300
Then, why are you still pestering him?

104
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,700
Didn't he go see you again yesterday?

105
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,630
We just ran into each other
at the hospital.

106
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:11,830
Fine.

107
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,170
I'm willing

108
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,470
to overlook the past.

109
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,900
But, you must leave
Norran Entertainment.

110
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,670
I want you to promise me

111
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,100
you'll never see him again.

112
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,200
Why should I leave Norran?

113
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:24,770
Work is work.

114
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,430
Personal matters are personal.

115
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,970
You still can't bring yourself
to let him go.

116
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,100
It makes sense.

117
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,400
After all, Shen Weizhou

118
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,370
is the heir to Norran Entertainment.

119
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,500
He's worth billions.

120
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,900
A nobody like you

121
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,230
got rid of those two leeches.

122
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,830
Of course you wouldn't
let this chance slip away.

123
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,070
That's not true.

124
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,530
So, you do know who he is.

125
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,870
At the end of the day,
all you want is money.

126
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:57,500
I'll pay 800,000 yuan

127
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,320
for you to leave Shen Weizhou.

128
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,500
Not everything

129
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,000
can be solved with money.

130
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,470
Anyway,

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,200
I'm not leaving Norran.

132
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,600
As for Shen Weizhou,

133
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,200
if he really belongs to you,

134
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,070
then I won't fight you for him.

135
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,070
That's all I have to say.

136
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,000
I have nothing more.

137
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,430
I really hate people like you.

138
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,430
You're just a nobody.

139
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,930
Yet, you're so arrogant.

140
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,970
You know exactly what you're doing,

141
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,170
but you still act innocent.

142
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,700
You know what?

143
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:31,330
Even if you pester Shen Weizhou,

144
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,170
it won't change

145
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,970
your miserable life.

146
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,070
What a coincidence. I hate you too.

147
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,630
People like you

148
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,000
simply assume the entire world

149
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,030
behaves like you.

150
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,600
Is Shen Weizhou's status that important?

151
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,130
Listen up.

152
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,000
Even without Shen Weizhou,

153
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,570
my fate has already changed.

154
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,100
You'll pay for this.

155
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:13,770
Yan.

156
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:16,430
Jiao.

157
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,730
Eat up.

158
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:22,200
I already am.

159
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,000
By the way, Jiao.

160
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,470
Yes?

161
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,800
Weren't you supposed to be abroad

162
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,070
with the artists on tour?

163
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,230
Why did you come back?

164
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,200
Because I missed you.

165
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:47,300
Come on, cheers.

166
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,830
Yan.

167
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,800
Actually,

168
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,870
all of this

169
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,930
was bought by my brother.

170
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,570
Could you

171
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,170
just forgive him?

172
00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:11,300
My brother and Mengya
were never in love.

173
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,170
They were only together
out of family duty.

174
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,300
Besides,

175
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,570
Mengya is nothing short of vile.

176
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,530
She's completely nuts.

177
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,330
Back then,

178
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,830
any woman who even spoke to my brother

179
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,300
would end up...

180
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:26,830
Stop it.

181
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,130
Yan.

182
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,370
He really didn't

183
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,070
mean to keep that from you.

184
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,130
Just give him another chance.

185
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,700
I know he didn't mean to lie.

186
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,070
But, that's not the point.

187
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,130
So, let's drop the subject.

188
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:54,630
Yan.

189
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,330
Actually,

190
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,530
I'm not really his biological sister.

191
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:01,000
My mom already had me when she married

192
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,900
into the Shen family.

193
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:06,270
That situation

194
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:09,130
left a deep scar on him.

195
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,900
So,

196
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,600
he would never cheat.

197
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,200
Because he has been through that pain.

198
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,330
He won't make the same mistake again.

199
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,430
I know he won't.

200
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:23,830
So,

201
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,500
please

202
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,200
give him one more chance, okay?

203
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,270
Please forgive him.

204
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,970
(Shen Weizhou)
(Is she alright?)

205
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,470
(What's taking you)

206
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,320
(so long to come out?)

207
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,830
(Why aren't you replying?)

208
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,500
(I'm still waiting outside.)

209
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,600
Well...

210
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,730
I came to pick up Shen Jiao.

211
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,830
Jiao is staying at my place tonight.

212
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,400
Oh.

213
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,470
Then, you two rest well.

214
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:37,900
I'll head back now.

215
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,830
Okay.

216
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,830
It's chilly tonight.

217
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,300
Keep warm.

218
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,530
Okay.

219
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,800
Here's your coffee.

220
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,970
Thank you.

221
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,430
What are you looking at?

222
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,830
Stop staring.

223
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,000
Help me out.

224
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,370
I'm here, okay?

225
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,400
Later today,

226
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,370
will you be free?

227
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,030
How did you know?

228
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,800
I brewed this myself.

229
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,570
Pretty good, right?

230
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,200
(So,)

231
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,430
(fate is not about marriage itself,)

232
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,200
(it's about the man I marry.)

233
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,230
(I think once you see this,)

234
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,270
(Bai Kun,)
(you'll know how to help her.)

235
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:15,730
(Got it.)

236
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,100
(Don't tell Huiting for now.)

237
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,100
(Let's take our time and plan this.)

238
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,630
(Yang Huiting)

239
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,570
(The doctor said)

240
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,270
(the treatment schedule is set.)

241
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,700
(The surgery time)

242
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,030
(will be arranged soon.)

243
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,570
(That's good.)

244
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,900
(Don't worry too much.)

245
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,570
(You'll feel much better
after the surgery.)

246
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,330
I'll come see you again next time.

247
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,100
Grandpa.

248
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,330
Yeah.

249
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,030
Go on now.

250
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,930
It's windy outside.

251
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,130
It's okay.

252
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,070
You came.

253
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:03,970
Perfect timing.

254
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,930
Can you walk Mengya out for me?

255
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,200
Sure.

256
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,240
I'll be going now, Grandpa.

257
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:09,770
Alright.

258
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:10,670
Take care.

259
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:18,970
Why are you here?

260
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,930
No matter what happens between us,

261
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:24,330
my relationship with grandpa
will never change.

262
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,600
Enough with your little schemes.

263
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,770
It won't end well for you.

264
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,200
Fine.

265
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,400
I hope you and Shu Yan

266
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,270
live a peaceful and happy life.

267
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
I'm warning you.

268
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,260
Stay away from Shu Yan.
