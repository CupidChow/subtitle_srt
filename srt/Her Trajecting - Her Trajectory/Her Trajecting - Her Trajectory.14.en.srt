2
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,460
(Every Trajectory Is You)

00:00:41,707 --> 00:00:44,547
=Episode 14=

4
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,370
So, you got Han Tianyu to marry Ye Wei.

5
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:47,900
Yes.

6
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,430
Otherwise,

7
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,000
I will marry Han Tianyu

8
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,230
and get cancer.

9
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,920
In the end, I will die at the hands
of my closest friend and my husband.

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,600
What was supposed to happen

11
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,530
will still happen.

12
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,170
It cannot be changed.

13
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:03,770
Unless

14
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,130
someone can take that fate away.

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,730
So, I asked Chu Chen
to go to the gathering

16
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,870
at Jiangning Restaurant

17
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,200
and changed what you experienced
causing Ye Wei to experience it instead.

18
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,730
I see.

19
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,870
That was why you asked Chu Chen
to go to the restaurant.

20
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:23,730
Why did you lie to me then?

21
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,770
I figured telling you

22
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,870
the truth back then

23
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,530
would make you think I'm a lunatic.

24
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,570
I thought so too.

25
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,200
However,

26
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,730
how did you know about the gathering?

27
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,230
Because

28
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,630
I attended the funeral.

29
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,530
My funeral?

30
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:51,630
Yes.

31
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,930
How was my funeral?

32
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,330
It was sad.

33
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,630
Many people

34
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,230
felt regret.

35
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,700
You are lying.

36
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,970
I can imagine it
without attending the funeral.

37
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,700
No one will feel sad

38
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,800
and no one will regret it.

39
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,930
Perhaps

40
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,370
no one even attended my funeral.

41
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,700
We should have
many things to talk about.

42
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,930
Should we talk somewhere else?

43
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,070
I like cats a lot.

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,930
Is there another way?

45
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,470
For example, breaking up with Han Tianyu

46
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,930
or cutting ties with Ye Wei.

47
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,600
I tried it.

48
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,230
Han Tianyu is a crazy person.

49
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,970
If I mention breaking up with him,
he will start getting mad.

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,030
I'm afraid
I might die five years earlier.

51
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,130
Is there any other way?

52
00:03:31,414 --> 00:03:33,184
Escape to a place
where he can't find you.

53
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,500
When I first came back,
I was very scared as well.

54
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,230
My first reaction was to escape

55
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,930
to a place where no one knew me.

56
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,470
However, there's a realistic problem.

57
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,370
I have no money.

58
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,300
If it's about money,

59
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
I can help you out.

60
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,800
In the beginning,

61
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,230
I might choose to escape.

62
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,830
However, I don't want to do it anymore.
Escaping won't solve any problems.

63
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,600
What is destined to happen
will still happen.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,870
My forehead had a scar in the past

65
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,600
and you got hurt in my place.

66
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:03,700
The shape of the scar

67
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,270
is the same as the one on my forehead.

68
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,530
If I don't get hurt,

69
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:09,100
will you still get hurt?

70
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,600
Yes.

71
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:13,530
Escaping won't change anything.

72
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,970
What has happened

73
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,970
will happen again in another way.

74
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,730
I already know what is going to happen.

75
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,730
Things are still within my control.

76
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,430
If it goes too far off the trajectory,
it might really be out of my control.

77
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:31,970
So,

78
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,330
the way to solve it

79
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,400
is to let other people

80
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,700
steal my fate.

81
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,270
A scar is a scar.

82
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,570
A marriage is a marriage.

83
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,670
Death...

84
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,930
Will be death.

85
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,030
How did you come back?

86
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,830
I thought I was dead

87
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,570
and I opened my eyes in 2020.

88
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,300
I...

89
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,300
I only slept

90
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,630
and when I woke up,

91
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,670
I am in the year 2020.

92
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,730
Why are you looking for He Ju?

93
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:33,562
In my previous life,

94
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,000
I lived in a world without sunshine.

95
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,370
Rebirth has given me another chance.

96
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,530
It makes me understand

97
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:43,830
that there are many things to do in life

98
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,570
besides love.

99
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,030
I want to avoid what has happened.

100
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,770
At the same time,

101
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,900
I also want to do more things.

102
00:05:52,622 --> 00:05:55,000
I also want to look for you
to talk about this.

103
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:58,370
If you work with He Ju
and obtain this talent for the group,

104
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,500
grandpa will surely see you
in a new light.

105
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,070
Then, you'll also be promoted.

106
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,470
Thank you.

107
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,000
So,

108
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,300
do you know who rejected He Ju?

109
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,880
In the previous life,
the person who rejected He Ju

110
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,000
was Wang Xu's support,
Vice President Lin.

111
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,700
However, all of them were punished
after Wang Xingxing's incident.

112
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,200
Vice President Lin has been suspended.

113
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,600
The new vice president

114
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,800
hasn't been decided yet.

115
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,170
I still don't know

116
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,200
when He Ju will come and visit.

117
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,170
I checked the visiting records.
He hasn't visited yet.

118
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,230
Is there a possibility

119
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,730
that it is a private meeting?

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,470
Yes.

121
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,900
So, I must find him as soon as possible.

122
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,170
If we find him before he gets rejected,

123
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,500
will the change in his destiny

124
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,300
develop as it did

125
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
in the previous life?

126
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,930
Are you saying

127
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,600
that I need to wait
until he is rejected?

128
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,270
Manager Yang,

129
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:00,970
let's begin.

130
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,430
Mr. Bai,

131
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,630
this is the new proposal
created by our team's Shu Yan.

132
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,100
Shu Yan, tell us about it.

133
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,500
Sure.

134
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,880
(Happiness Food Diary)
Mr. Bai.

135
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,730
Before I introduce this proposal to you,

136
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,170
I want to report this to you.

137
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,800
Our company has signed

138
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,300
a new artist called Chu Chen.

139
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,900
Not only is he exceptional
in various aspects,

140
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,370
but he has also obtained

141
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,030
a professional certificate in cooking.

142
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,870
So, the program's theme

143
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:22,930
suits him a lot.

144
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,970
We might let him
be involved in this project

145
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,900
and appear as the main chef.

146
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,030
For the other artists we invited,

147
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,770
those who don't know how to cook,

148
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,300
will become assistants.

149
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,200
So, I must first report it to you.

150
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,960
Next, our program

151
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,200
will also add in elements
of searching for ingredients

152
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,830
apart from

153
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,300
the variety genre.

154
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,830
Our set

155
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,930
will also be different

156
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,830
from home kitchens.

157
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,630
We have chosen

158
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,770
a mountain area
suitable for outdoor camping

159
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,680
to have a competition.

160
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,560
(Team Building)
Artists

161
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,330
(Gathering Ingredients, Food Tasting)
will split into teams and compete

162
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,000
according to the received themes.

163
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,070
That's the whole program.

164
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,270
After learning a lesson
and gaining experience last time,

165
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,630
we've invited

166
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,770
Shen Weizhou as the main character.

167
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,030
The rookie, Chu Chen,
will also join the filming

168
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,300
because he is good at cooking.

169
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,870
Besides that,

170
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,870
Ye Wei participated

171
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,530
in the production of our program

172
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,430
and is experienced.

173
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,630
I hope

174
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,770
she can join in this program.

175
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,130
Moreover,

176
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,870
I also hope our company's Han Tianyu

177
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,970
can participate in this program.

178
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,600
After all, I think it's a good thing
for our company's artist

179
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,370
to participate in the program

180
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,930
and increase his reputation.

181
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:30,870
Good.

182
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,770
I hope everything goes well for us.

183
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,170
Did something happen?

184
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Why are you in a rush?

185
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,870
The company's new vice president
has been appointed.

186
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,600
I've found He Ju
according to the address you gave me

187
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,170
and asked him to visit the company.

188
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,370
I prepare

189
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,430
to bring the fate
of his rejection forward.

190
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
I've arranged

191
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,870
for him to meet
the company's vice president.

192
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,200
Vice President,

193
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,170
take a look at my proposal.

194
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,300
You can consider rejecting me
after you look at it.

195
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,400
Wemedia is an important
development direction in the future.

196
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,680
Moreover, it can also become

197
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,770
Norran Entertainment's
important development direction.

198
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,160
Are you doing your job properly?

199
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:18,262
You just let anyone inside.

200
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:20,270
Have you checked his background?

201
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,770
It was Bai Kun who informed you
to meet this important client.

202
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,430
Take a look.

203
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,670
I'm not interested in your proposal.

204
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,360
Moreover,

205
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,730
the most fundamental requirement

206
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,030
in a business discussion

207
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,800
is one's professional appearance.

208
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Look at how shabby you are.

209
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:41,670
No.

210
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,400
Are you going to discuss business
with Norran Entertainment like this?

211
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,700
I might not know

212
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,800
how you got Bai Kun to help you,

213
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,230
but I advise you not to bite off
more than you can chew.

214
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,630
Mr. Shen, you're actually
walking around with a woman.

215
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,840
Aren't you afraid
that paparazzi might catch you

216
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:05,870
and affect your career?

217
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,000
I am innocent.

218
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,730
Moreover,
we only have a working relationship.

219
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,730
You on the other hand,
how did you persuade Chairman Shen

220
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,400
to give you the position
of vice president?

221
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,070
Do you want to know?

222
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,700
Tell me something that makes me happy

223
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:22,800
and let me feel joy.

224
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,770
(I think she is...)

225
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:30,162
She's nothing special.

226
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,670
Should I lend you for a few days?

227
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:34,170
(I'd rather destroy what I have)

228
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,830
(than lending it to other people.)

229
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,330
He Ju.

230
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,570
Are you really
from Norran Entertainment?

231
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,900
(Work Pass)

232
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,700
I think your group is quite funny.

233
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,730
You asked me to come here

234
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,800
and rejected me.

235
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,500
Right now,
you got someone else to meet me.

236
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,770
Are you here to laugh at
a worker at his lowest?

237
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:19,130
No, Mr. He.

238
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,270
You've misunderstood.

239
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,430
We might be employees of the group

240
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,730
but we are not representing the group.

241
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,270
We want to work with you
on a personal basis.

242
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,330
Yes, Mr. He.

243
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Please believe in us.

244
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,330
We are absolutely sincere.

245
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,320
Mr. He,

246
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,830
I've never thought

247
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,570
that humans come to this world
to suffer.

248
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,700
However,

249
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,330
we can't avoid

250
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,870
maintaining our dreams

251
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,230
during the process of suffering.

252
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,430
I believe you are not doing this

253
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,230
for your life

254
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,430
but to show
what you've learned all your life

255
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,300
in front of the world.

256
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,170
If we face obstacles in our dreams
and have an unknown future,

257
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,700
let's change it.

258
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:55,730
All right.

259
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,300
Take another look.

260
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:58,930
All right.

261
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,000
An excellent dreamer who is crushed
to the brink of breaking down

262
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,170
by the harsh reality.

263
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,080
I suddenly felt that I was too weak
in my previous life.

264
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,570
I was so weak to the point
of not having my own opinions.

265
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,300
I only understand after dying once.

266
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,670
All of this is not your fault.

267
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,800
It's because you are too kind.

268
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,200
Shu Yan.

269
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,700
Well...

270
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,500
The female model you met today was...

271
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,070
Hold on.

272
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,630
Hello, Chu Chen.

273
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,500
What is it?

274
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,700
Hello, Shu Yan.

275
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:01,900
It's like this.

276
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,170
The program

277
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,630
will begin filming in two days.

278
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,700
However, I don't understand

279
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,970
some of the planning details.

280
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,330
To prepare myself completely,

281
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,722
I need to ask you about it.

282
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:12,930
Sure.

283
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,470
Wait for me.

284
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,270
Chu Chen is looking for me.

285
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,370
Bye.

286
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:26,600
Cheers.

287
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,560
Congratulations to Wei

288
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,800
for participating in the food program
for the second time.

289
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,360
I also want to congratulate you, Tianyu.

290
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:38,830
I hope you can use this program

291
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,270
to increase your reputation.

292
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,900
When the time comes,

293
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,770
I'll become a loyal fan of yours.

294
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:44,930
No problem.

295
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:07,630
Bai Kun. Why did grandpa
appoint Meng Ya as vice president?

296
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,970
It's because of the favour.

297
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,930
After all,
you cancelled the marriage first.

298
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:13,470
I understand.

299
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,700
How's the thing
that I asked you to do going?

300
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,070
I'm looking at the contract.

301
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,800
Have you thought it through?
It's still not too late to regret this.

302
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,000
I have.

303
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,670
Please help me speed up the progress.

304
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,570
Thank you.

305
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,000
Bai,

306
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,900
do you think

307
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,430
Shu Yan will feel sad for me

308
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,770
if she finds out about my misfortune?

309
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:00,900
(Happiness Food Diary)

310
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,230
Your budget will be distributed
by the production team.

311
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,770
You can purchase your own ingredients

312
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,700
within the given budget.

313
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:08,570
Of course,

314
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:09,770
you can also

315
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:10,930
think of other ways

316
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,800
to trade for ingredients.

317
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:13,500
Anyway,

318
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:14,700
every meal

319
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,370
must contain five dishes.

320
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,070
You'll get bonus points
if you have more than five dishes.

321
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:24,230
Points will be deducted
if you have fewer than five dishes.

322
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,430
In the end,

323
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,130
the dishes you pick

324
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,570
will be scored

325
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,830
by culinary experts.

326
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Do all of you understand?

327
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,500
All right.

328
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,130
In that case, let's begin.

329
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,530
I didn't expect Mr. Shen
to cook so well.

330
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,770
The cold and handsome man
actually has this side to him.

331
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,130
I heard Chu Chen is a rookie.

332
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,330
He is handsome as well.

333
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,960
Moreover, he has a cheerful personality.

334
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,200
I like him a lot.

335
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,630
I'm sure
Chu Chen's cooking is delicious.

336
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,560
In that case, you can date him.

337
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,600
Then, you can

338
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,900
eat his cooking every day.

339
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,970
That's not my intention.

340
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,570
I just

341
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:17,900
admire his cooking skills.

342
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,830
Jiaojiao

343
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,970
should participate in

344
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,470
the culinary experts' tasting session.

345
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,470
That's right.

346
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:24,900
Then,

347
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,330
I can eat good food every day.

348
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,770
You are always thinking about eating.

349
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,400
(Ye Wei.)

350
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,430
(Do everything you can
to steal Han Tianyu away from me.)

351
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,870
