2
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,460
(Every Trajectory Is You)

3
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,540
=Episode 12=

4
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,520
I didn't expect you

5
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,069
to be such a gentleman.

6
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,690
I'm only a gentleman when I'm with you.

7
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,050
Have you seen me
treat Shu Yan like this?

8
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:59,739
Don't say that.

9
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,090
If you say that,

10
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,550
Shu Yan will be upset.

11
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,890
Shu Yan won't hear about this.

12
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:09,220
(No.)

13
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,299
(I must enjoy this thrill)

14
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,390
(before I marry Shu Yan.)

15
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,890
(It's time to show my true charm.)

16
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,120
Waiter.

17
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,369
Thank you.

18
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:29,139
Sir,

19
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,790
how can I serve you?

20
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,299
What did you tell him?

21
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,290
It's nothing.

22
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,950
Since we ordered the Couple's Set,

23
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,969
So,

24
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,990
I asked him
to cook for my girlfriend first.

25
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,720
It's not right for you to say this.

26
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,520
A restaurant like this

27
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,750
is suitable for couples.

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,090
We can be a couple for just a meal.

29
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,450
Isn't that interesting?

30
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:08,150
(Shu Yan, it's such a pity
that you can't see this.)

31
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:09,839
(All men are the same.)

32
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,839
(They say they love you but they are still
having fun with other women.)

33
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,720
Your food is here.

34
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,190
Let me do it.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,150
Try it first.

36
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,050
Their steak is not bad.

37
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,299
Tianyu.

38
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,120
Yes?

39
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,420
Thank you so much.

40
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,150
(Very good.)

41
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,320
(Are you very touched now?)

42
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,020
(You've fallen for me, right?)

43
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,550
Tianyu,

44
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,120
I can feel your sincerity.

45
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,850
(Men.)

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,369
(They can't take it anymore)

47
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:52,390
(if I just use a bit of my charm.)

48
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,820
It's delicious.

49
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,490
You should eat too.

50
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,090
However,

51
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,220
what you said last time

52
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,769
made me feel very sad.

53
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:16,390
- Wei, What's wrong?
- It's fine.

54
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,090
Wei,

55
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,690
it's all my fault.

56
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,090
I was too stupid.

57
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,720
I felt bad
for saying that to you as well.

58
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,090
Tianyu.

59
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:34,390
I know I've let Shu Yan down
by doing this

60
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:43,150
but I can't control myself.

61
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:49,720
Wei,

62
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:51,590
it's my fault.

63
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,450
Don't cry, all right?

64
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,439
At the moment,

65
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,439
the leader is very supportive

66
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,790
of the food reality program.

67
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,869
All of you are the main people in charge

68
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,039
so you must
handle all details carefully.

69
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,339
I've sent you the list

70
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,720
of artists that we want to invite.

71
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,669
The people in charge

72
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,469
are Yang Huiting

73
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,290
and Ye Wei.

74
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,699
Don't worry, Mr. Wang.

75
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,139
I will follow your orders carefully

76
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,590
and get things done.

77
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,682
All of you must learn from Ye Wei.

78
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:25,739
I will send the contact

79
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,920
of the male artist, Wang Xingxing,
directly to Team Leader Yang and Ye Wei.

80
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,350
Both of you must take good care of him.

81
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,099
Mr. Wang.

82
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,350
Yes, Mr. Wang.

83
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,420
I'll surely take good care
of Mr. Wang Xingxing.

84
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,569
Yan,

85
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,299
what's going on with Wang Xu?

86
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,069
You were the one who proposed it.

87
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,720
Why did he kick you out of the project?

88
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,890
Stop worrying about me.

89
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,890
I'm the one who should feel bad.

90
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,669
I asked you
to discuss the proposal with me

91
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,390
but it ends up like this.

92
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,750
I'm feeling bad for you.

93
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,250
Why don't I

94
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,120
talk to my brother?

95
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,350
No need.

96
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,750
Thanks, Jiaojiao.

97
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,090
Shu Yan.

98
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,899
Mr. Wang's cup is empty.

99
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,669
Since we are busy

100
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,799
and you are free,

101
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,590
why don't you
get a cup of water for him?

102
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,420
Wei, you are so considerate.

103
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,690
I'm relieved
to put you in charge of this project.

104
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,890
Ye Wei

105
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,520
is flaunting someone else's power.

106
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,590
Hello, Chu Chen.

107
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,790
Hello, Shu Yan.

108
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,439
I'm downstairs

109
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,699
and I brought you food.

110
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,550
Oh.

111
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,550
I'm coming down.

112
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:41,450
Please wait.

113
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,499
All right.

114
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,350
I'll wait for you.

115
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,420
Jiaojiao, I'm going downstairs.

116
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,320
All right.

117
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,099
(Norran Entertainment)

118
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,539
So handsome.

119
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,299
Are they the newly hired male models

120
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,490
who will be joining
the food variety program?

121
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,439
They are handsome, have a good body,
and can cook well.

122
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,720
I wish I have such benefits.

123
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,690
Shu Yan.

124
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,090
Why are you here?

125
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,869
I'm worried that you might be too busy
and forget to eat.

126
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,139
I made this for you.

127
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,469
It's green nutritious food.

128
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,650
Take it and eat without worries.
It's not fattening.

129
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,090
Thank you.

130
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,550
You are still as considerate
as you were in the past.

131
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,590
I must be considerate

132
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:26,190
since it's related to you.

133
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,739
That's right.

134
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:30,939
I heard you are hiring

135
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,469
some male models who can cook.

136
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,750
Do you think I can do it?

137
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,169
Of course.

138
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,690
You have good conditions.

139
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,590
However, why do you suddenly
feel like becoming a male model?

140
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,850
(Then, I can see you all the time.)

141
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:44,950
In life,

142
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,390
we always have to try out something new.

143
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,650
You are right.

144
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,699
Is this kid

145
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,520
trying to join the company?

146
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,039
I'm sure he has an ulterior motive.

147
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,990
Sure.

148
00:06:57,076 --> 00:06:59,099
Go upstairs with me to register.

149
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,920
All right.

150
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,020
Let's go.

151
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,050
Yan.

152
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,550
You have good food again?

153
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,439
Yes.

154
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,650
Chu Chen brought it for me.

155
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:15,499
You are so nice.

156
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,320
- You always bring us good food.
- I'll bring a portion for you next time.

157
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,899
Sure.

158
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,250
Thank you so much.

159
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,220
Boss.

160
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,469
What are you doing? You scared me.

161
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,900
Why are you hiding here?
I've been looking for you for so long.

162
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:27,720
It's nothing.

163
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:28,620
Let's go.

164
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,099
Jiaojiao.

165
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,569
Bring Chu Chen upstairs.

166
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,369
He wants to interview as a male model.

167
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,299
Sure. No problem.

168
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,350
Leave it to me.

169
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:39,790
Let's go.

170
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:43,720
Shu Yan.

171
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,350
Shu Yan!

172
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,290
Mr. Shen.

173
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,120
Are you feeling happy right now?

174
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:50,899
Am...

175
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,120
Am I?

176
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,350
I haven't eaten lunch this afternoon.

177
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,869
Mr. Shen,

178
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,250
you've worked hard.

179
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,990
You've worked hard.

180
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,390
Shu Yan,

181
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,750
why are you here?

182
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,720
You can't even pour a cup of water?

183
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,369
Mr. Wang, you're so audacious.

184
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,790
How dare you ask our company's elite
to pour you a cup of water.

185
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,520
Mr. Shen,

186
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,899
you might not know...

187
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,750
Enlighten me then.

188
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,020
Mr. Shen.

189
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,820
Mr. Wang didn't mean that.

190
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,969
It might be my fault

191
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,950
for not communicating properly.

192
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,990
If it's your problem,

193
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:35,390
you should apologise.

194
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,290
What?

195
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:43,720
You won't do it?

196
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,120
Sorry, Shu Yan.

197
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,669
I shouldn't let you idle
because you're not involved

198
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,950
in the project.

199
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,290
I even got you
to pour water for Mr. Wang.

200
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,150
(Is this even an apology?)

201
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,820
(She's obviously laughing at me.)

202
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,020
It's fine.

203
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,139
I've never done something

204
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,539
like serving water after all.

205
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,090
In the future, I need
to learn more from you regarding this.

206
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,350
All right.

207
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,269
Let's take a break for one hour.

208
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,220
We'll meet at the set in one hour.

209
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,720
Let's go.

210
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:16,820
Let's go.

211
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,699
Boss,

212
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,090
we need to go to the set as well.

213
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,639
Then,

214
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:23,769
Mr. Shen,

215
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,150
I'll be going upstairs then.

216
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,269
I...

217
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,099
I know. Stop rushing me.

218
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,120
Where's the set?

219
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,120
Over there.

220
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,390
I didn't rush you.

221
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,840
I wanted to tell you
that I'm going to the toilet.

222
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,990
So fierce.

223
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:41,669
Ms. Yang,

224
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,220
let's take a seat in front.

225
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:44,099
Sure.

226
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,020
I still need to learn from you
when it comes to work.

227
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,439
Hello.

228
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,350
Hello.

229
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,369
Two coffees, please.

230
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,390
Sure.

231
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,439
Your coffee. Enjoy.

232
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,450
Thank you.

233
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,899
The coffee here is good.

234
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,739
Try it.

235
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,550
Sure.

236
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,650
Ms. Yang,

237
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,450
do you feel a little bad

238
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,050
for Shu Yan as well?

239
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,299
But this is
the decision of the higher-ups.

240
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,850
Sometimes, being too capable
is a problem as well.

241
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,999
Actually,

242
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,150
it's not because I'm too capable.

243
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,869
Don't take it to heart.

244
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,890
Shu Yan speaks bluntly.

245
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,450
Sometimes,

246
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,339
the higher-ups feel upset
because of this.

247
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,999
However,

248
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,490
I will put in a good word for Shu Yan
with the higher-ups.

249
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,920
Perhaps she can join the project
in the future.

250
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,639
Shu Yan is really lucky
to have a good friend

251
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,620
like you.

252
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,069
Actually,

253
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,169
I think we can be good friends as well.

254
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:56,050
Although I'm not as smart as Shu Yan,

255
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,420
I hope you can take good care of me
if there's any problem at work

256
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,390
in the future.

257
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,750
All right?

258
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,199
You are smart and capable.

259
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,639
I'm relieved to work with you.

260
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,920
Let's work hard together.

261
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,750
I'll obey Ms. Yang.

262
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,939
The sample footage looks good.

263
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,199
The editing is good.

264
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,250
Not bad.

265
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,869
Not bad.

266
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,050
Looks decent.

267
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,150
Yes.

268
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,750
All right.

269
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,739
This is the first demo footage we shot.

270
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,790
If you have any opinions or suggestions,
feel free to tell us so we can make amendments.

271
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,769
I think it looks good.

272
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,920
After watching the first episode...

273
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,160
I feel like watching the second episode.
I'm looking forward to it.

274
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,550
Yes.

275
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,220
This is the result
of everyone's hard work.

276
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,350
Keep it up.

277
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,399
This is my husband.

278
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,856
- Wang Xingxing is so handsome.
- The rumors were fake after all.

279
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,519
- He's such a gentleman.
- A family man.

280
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,634
Love him.

281
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,650
What do you think, Nephew?

282
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,139
It's all thanks to you, Uncle.

283
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,569
There have been some rumors recently

284
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,520
and I was thinking about
dealing with some PR issues.

285
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,339
We are a family.

286
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,269
We should help each other.

287
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,120
That's right.

288
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,820
I kept a portion of the endorsement fees
with Norran Entertainment for you.

289
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,920
However,

290
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,590
don't tell my agent about this.

291
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,069
My nephew is a huge star indeed.

292
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,790
You are really considerate.

293
00:12:50,008 --> 00:12:52,640
(Wang Xingxing's Schedule)

294
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,520
(Finally.)

295
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,290
(Tomorrow is the thrilling moment.)

296
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:04,869
Mr. Wang.

297
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,350
You have a good eye for talent.

298
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,120
This project
has gone viral on the internet.

299
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,890
In the next month,

300
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,369
we will film all 11 episodes.

301
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,150
Good.

302
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,790
You've worked hard recently, Wei.

303
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,869
Thankfully, you suggested

304
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,220
the idea of a sneak shot

305
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,099
to create a behind-the-scenes footage

306
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,499
and make it into something viral.

307
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,220
This is a very good idea.

308
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,490
You deserve to be praised.

309
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,999
Mr. Wang,
you should take all the credit.

310
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,890
Isn't it?

311
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,450
That's right.

312
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,669
Chu Chen's interview result is not bad.

313
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,250
He can report to work next Monday.

314
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,269
However,

315
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,150
if he can make it in time,

316
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,669
he can participate

317
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,469
in the filming
of our food reality program.

318
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:54,899
Just nice

319
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,069
since he cooks well.

320
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,639
There's no rush.

321
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,120
He still needs time to train.

322
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,450
That's right.

323
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,999
You said you had an idea

324
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,699
you didn't add to the proposal.

325
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,690
What is it?

326
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,820
It's a new trick.

327
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,839
We can ask reporters

328
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,499
to get some behind-the-scene shots

329
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,220
when the artist isn't aware.

330
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,350
When the artist isn't aware?

331
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,669
What if

332
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,739
they capture something bad?

333
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,150
You're such a fool.

334
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,539
We are the ones responsible

335
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,169
for the editing in post-production.

336
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,969
If you think it's bad, just delete it.

337
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,990
If you think it's good, just promote it.

338
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:31,969
I'm sure you can

339
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,850
create many viral topics.

340
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:34,739
Viewers nowadays

341
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,850
like to see something real like this.

342
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,820
You are right.

343
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,520
It's a good idea.

344
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,199
However, you mustn't
tell Wang Xu this idea.

345
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,139
If he finds out,

346
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,820
he will steal your credit.

347
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,420
That's right.

348
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,539
All of us are close

349
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,269
but you must still be cautious.

350
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,650
Don't let anything go wrong.

351
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:54,750
Yes.

352
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,220
Don't worry, Mr. Wang.

353
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,439
Call me Xu.

354
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,650
I like to hear it.

355
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,850
All right.

356
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,120
Then,

357
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,550
Xu...

358
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,620
After our filming today,

359
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:14,420
let me treat you to dinner today.

360
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,569
How can I let you treat me all the time?

361
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:18,650
Allow me to treat you today.

362
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,169
Drink less coffee

363
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,550
if you have a weak stomach.

364
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,720
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

365
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,390
What is it?

366
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,850
What are you thinking about?

367
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:42,069
I heard Chu Chen
would be joining on Monday.

368
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:42,939
He studies culinary.

369
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,450
Why would he become an artist suddenly?

370
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,520
It's because of you, right?

371
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,899
I don't think so.

372
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,469
He told me he wanted
to experience a new life.

373
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,269
However,

374
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:54,439
I do feel happy to meet him again.

375
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,790
He is my first love.

376
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,520
I know.

377
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,299
You should forget about your first love
whenever you can.

378
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,339
After all, they are bad memories.

379
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,390
I only see him as a good friend now.

380
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,190
You seem very happy.

381
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:14,520
Am I?

382
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,299
That's right. Chu Chen told me

383
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,350
it was you who asked him
to go to Jiangning Restaurant.

384
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,320
Yes.

385
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,850
I heard Chu Chen was good at cooking

386
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,520
and the restaurant wanted to hire him.

387
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,469
So, there might be an opportunity
to work together.

388
00:16:29,469 --> 00:16:30,999
I didn't expect you to meet him there.

389
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,990
I see.

390
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,139
Stay here.

391
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:36,290
I'll be going to the filming.

392
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,090
All right.

393
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,190
Drink it while it's hot.

394
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,690
(Wang Xu is really stupid.)

395
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,699
(He should know how ambitious)

396
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,969
(that Qiwen reporter is.)

397
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,920
(However, he still used him.)

398
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,050
(Ye Wei is going)

399
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,490
(to reap what she sow this time.)
