4
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,630
Mr. Wang.

5
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,330
Mr. Wang.

6
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,700
Please plate this.
We need another close-up.

7
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,800
Didn't you film

8
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,930
the close-up a few times?

9
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:00,930
I'm tired.

10
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,830
I need to rest.

11
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:03,630
Please hold on.

12
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:04,200
Mr. Wang,

13
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,070
please hold on.

14
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,230
I said I'm tired.

15
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,300
Don't you understand me?

16
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,170
Director,
why don't we take a break for a while?

17
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,430
Everyone has worked hard today.

18
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,730
Let's take a break.

19
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,130
I'll buy milk tea for everyone.

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,170
Let's take a break.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Huiting.

22
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,900
You've worked hard.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,730
I missed you so much, Baby.

24
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,400
Come here.

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,630
Come on.

26
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,300
Don't let others see us.

27
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:52,000
Famous male superstar,

28
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,700
Wang Xingxing, is having an affair

29
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,030
with a female staff member on set.

30
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,900
Wang Xingxing is putting on airs on set.

31
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,780
(Censored)

32
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,880
(I am Wang Xingxing's
current girlfriend, Cheng Xiao.)

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,000
(I want to expose a secret.)

34
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,840
(Wang Xingxing has dated me
for three years.)

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,370
(He has been cheating on me frequently)

36
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,680
(and his private life is a mess.)

37
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,130
(I just found out today)

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,070
(that he was even
having an affair with a minor.)

39
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,670
(Things are developing as I expected.)

40
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,230
(Next comes Wang Xu's downfall!)

41
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,270
Ye Wei.

42
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,330
You

43
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,170
and you.

44
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,070
Both of you. The few of you.
Come inside for a meeting.

45
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,170
Yan.

46
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,570
This is serious.
Come inside for a meeting.

47
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,320
They kicked you out
when things were going well.

48
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,360
Now that things have gone badly,
they are asking you to take the fall.

49
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,430
Yan, don't go.

50
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,730
It's fine.

51
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,070
Let's go.

52
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll go with you then.

53
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,000
What are all of you doing?

54
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:57,000
You knew reporters were bad.

55
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,630
Couldn't you
keep an eye on the reporters at all?

56
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,200
Great. Just great.
The project has been suspended.

57
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,040
Every product's endorsement

58
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,080
is asking for compensation
due to breach of contract.

59
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,330
Ye Wei,

60
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,570
you are the project's person in charge.

61
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,930
Give me a solution!

62
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,600
Sorry, Mr. Wang.

63
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,800
I warned Team Leader Yang before.

64
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,900
I don't know
why it would turn out like this.

65
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,900
However, Team Leader Yang
had many things to do on set.

66
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,570
Mr. Wang, sorry.

67
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,880
Regardless of the reason,

68
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,480
I am the person
in charge of this project.

69
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,070
I'm willing to take responsibility.

70
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,100
Hold on.

71
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,800
Team Leader Yang shouldn't
take responsibility for this.

72
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,600
Ye Wei is also
one of the people in charge.

73
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:43,070
Moreover, Ye Wei gave the idea
and you signed the artist, Mr. Wang.

74
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,370
I'm sure everyone knows
where the source of the problem lies.

75
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,530
We are a team.

76
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:50,800
Since this is a team,

77
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,400
we need to help each other.

78
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,640
Team Leader Yang,

79
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,800
you are the person
in charge of this project.

80
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,730
You need to take on your responsibility.

81
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,930
Are you calling this a team now?

82
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,200
This wasn't

83
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,570
what you said back then.

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,930
Shen Jiao.

85
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,800
I don't think it's right

86
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,400
for you to speak at this moment.

87
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,960
Why can't Shen Jiao speak?

88
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,500
If she can't speak,
do you think you can?

89
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,670
Actually, Shu Yan was the one
who gave me the idea.

90
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,730
I trusted her
so I didn't give a lot of consideration.

91
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,000
I am at fault

92
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:25,570
regarding this.

93
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,200
Why didn't I remember
telling you about this?

94
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,530
Perhaps you forgot.

95
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,230
Anyway,

96
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,730
I suggested this project
because you told me about it.

97
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,000
Shu Yan.

98
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,470
You came up with this idea?

99
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,789
Since you are so capable

100
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,130
and suggested a sneak shot?

101
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,100
Fine.

102
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,600
I want you to give me a solution

103
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,000
by the end of today!

104
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,360
Otherwise, not only must you
pay the compensation,

105
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,600
but you will also be terminated!

106
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,130
Mr. Wang, you are quite arrogant.

107
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,384
Not only did you
steal someone else's proposal,

108
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,430
but you are

109
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,730
making someone else the fall guy
when there's a problem.

110
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,000
Mr. Shen,

111
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,130
why are you here?

112
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,830
If we hadn't come here sooner,
would the company belong to you then?

113
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,730
Everyone, let me introduce myself.

114
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,600
I am Bai Kun.

115
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,130
I am the project manager
appointed by the chairman.

116
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,370
I am here
to take over the project in person.

117
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,330
Wang Xu.

118
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,280
From now on,

119
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,200
you'll be suspended
and get a salary cut for three months.

120
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,200
If you have any questions or objections,
you can report them to the chairman.

121
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,240
Do you have any questions?

122
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,270
Not at all.

123
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:36,800
That's great.

124
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,630
I will tell you the solution
in tomorrow's meeting.

125
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:40,870
Dismissed.

126
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,800
What is it?

127
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,640
Why do you always smile at Shen Weizhou?

128
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,480
Have you not been looking for me
because you're spending time with him?

129
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
(I must endure.)

130
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,570
(It's not time
to have a falling out yet.)

131
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:11,570
No.

132
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,770
That's impossible.

133
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,930
You are so handsome

134
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,930
and talented.

135
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,600
You are just lacking in reputation

136
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,770
compared to Shen Weizhou.

137
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,100
You will be brilliant in the future.

138
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,570
You are right.

139
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,520
Speaking of which, Shu Yan.

140
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:26,770
You are incapable

141
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,830
but you have good taste

142
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,130
in men.

143
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,920
(He's really a jerk)

144
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,970
(who can be easily fooled
by simply praising him.)

145
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,630
Wait for me after work.

146
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,720
We haven't gone on a date
for a long time.

147
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,400
Director Bai just took over.

148
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,270
I still have work to liaise with him.

149
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,200
Why don't we do it next time?

150
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,370
Shu Yan,

151
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,130
you've been acting weirdly

152
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,430
since you went mad last time.

153
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,400
I...

154
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,430
Are you playing hard to get with me?

155
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,370
Actually,

156
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,630
I think

157
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,970
I might not be suitable for you.

158
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,470
I don't want to keep you away
from the happiness you deserve.

159
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,500
Why don't

160
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,630
we...

161
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,470
You won't.

162
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:19,100
Don't be so self-abased.

163
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,530
I will never leave you.

164
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,200
I'm leaving first.

165
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,030
You...

166
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,370
(Han Tianyu,)

167
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:47,830
(I won't let you hurt her again.)

168
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,530
Sorry.

169
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,100
Bai Kun?

170
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,900
Why do you still look the same?

171
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,430
You are clumsy
when something's on your mind.

172
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,800
Hey,

173
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,530
why are you so clumsy?

174
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:14,830
I'm sorry.

175
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,000
I was spacing out
because I was thinking about something.

176
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,500
Never mind.

177
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,830
It's my fault as well.

178
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,640
I've embarrassed myself
before you again.

179
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,770
Not at all.

180
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,130
Cheer up.

181
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,570
Okay?

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,630
The company is going to change

183
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:46,470
and save the food reality program staff.

184
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,570
Can anyone tell me
Wang Xingxing's recent situation?

185
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,630
It's like this.

186
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
Wang Xingxing has been reported

187
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,130
because the girlfriend
he has been dating for three years

188
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,430
is only 19 years old.

189
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,700
So, this is not just
a scandal in entertainment.

190
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,730
It is already a legal issue.

191
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,370
Wang Xu has been terminated.

192
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,730
I need to promote someone

193
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,830
as the temporary manager

194
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:08,870
to become the main person in charge

195
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,400
and provide a solution to this incident.

196
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,700
Of course, this is a difficult mission.

197
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,600
If it ends well,

198
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,030
it'll greatly help your future.

199
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,030
From now on,

200
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,610
the food reality program
will be resumed.

201
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,870
Yang Huiting.

202
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,470
You will become the project manager.

203
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,070
Okay?

204
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,700
Give her some motivation.

205
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,600
(Do you think you'll get the position?)

206
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,870
(Don't think you are capable)

207
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,530
(just because
you came up with a proposal.)

208
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,400
Isn't he a confidant of the chairman?

209
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,470
If he is here,

210
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:55,800
it'll be really scary.

211
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:59,100
I feel scared just thinking about it.
Everyone calls him the living Hades.

212
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,570
Mr. Shen,

213
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,770
why are you looking for me?

214
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:14,830
Why did you come out of retirement?

215
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:16,440
I am a paid employee.

216
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,770
I have to come here
since your grandfather asked me to.

217
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,270
This is not a personnel change
in work matters.

218
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,270
This is a family matter.

219
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,880
In Norran Entertainment,

220
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,400
the chairman's words are absolute.

221
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,630
Whether it's work or family matters,

222
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,670
do you think he will
stand by and do nothing?

223
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:33,880
I didn't expect him to send you here.

224
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,270
I didn't expect her to be your type.

225
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:40,370
She's more ordinary than I imagined.

226
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,230
Listen well.

227
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:44,677
She isn't ordinary at all.

228
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,470
Yes.

229
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,930
A public relationship for five years

230
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,970
and having an ambiguous relationship

231
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,700
with a star in the company.

232
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,500
Bai Kun,

233
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,530
you don't understand her at all.

234
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:56,830
Yes.

235
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,280
Didn't you want to hand over
the position of temporary manager

236
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,200
to Shu Yan?

237
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,800
Before you can
look at the problem objectively

238
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,530
without being manipulated by rumors

239
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,370
and misled by a woman,

240
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,830
putting Yang Huiting
in charge of the project

241
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,470
is the best choice.

242
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,070
Of course, Shu Yan
can also be involved in the project.

243
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Shu Yan,

244
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,730
are you still angry at me?

245
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,870
I wasn't trying
to pin the blame on you on purpose.

246
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,030
You know me.

247
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,430
I have a bad memory.

248
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,100
Maybe I heard your conversation
with Shen Jiao

249
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,100
and thought you told me the idea.

250
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,670
Actually, I wanted
to help you claim the credit.

251
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:45,430
Unfortunately,

252
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,100
Mr. Wang was bad
at understanding what I told him.

253
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,030
Thankfully,

254
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:50,630
his punishment was fair.

255
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,270
Mr. Wang has been terminated.

256
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,100
This issue is over.

257
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,630
Yan,

258
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:00,430
we are best friends.

259
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:02,870
Don't be angry at me.

260
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,030
I was a little angry just now

261
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:09,830
but

262
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,870
it's fine now
after I hear your explanation.

263
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:16,930
It hurts.

264
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,330
Yan.

265
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,970
Let's go shopping

266
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,970
after work, all right?

267
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,100
It has been a long time
since we last went shopping.

268
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,530
Didn't Mr. Bai

269
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,770
order me

270
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,170
to come out with a new proposal?

271
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,520
I have to work overtime today.
Let's do it some other day.

272
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,930
Team Leader Yang...

273
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,930
Manager Yang will deal with it.

274
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,000
Moreover, she has been promoted.

275
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,330
To be honest,

276
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,030
I think this is unfair.

277
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,400
You were the one
who came up with the proposal.

278
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:51,700
Why did she end up
becoming the manager instead?

279
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,930
A single-cell animal who only knows
how to play tricks at work.

280
00:12:55,719 --> 00:12:58,400
A fence-sitter who has no backbone.

281
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,170
The only strength in work

282
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,930
is to stir the pot.

283
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,300
Shut up.

284
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,970
This is none of your business.

285
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,130
What did you say?

286
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,370
I didn't hear you.

287
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:11,300
Did you just admit it yourself?

288
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:25,900
Why are you here?

289
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,270
This is a public area,

290
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,070
Manager Yang.

291
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,230
Why can't I be here?

292
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,870
You are still the same.

293
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,700
Speaking in a heartless tone.

294
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,530
Aren't you the same as well?

295
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,500
You don't know
how to fight for yourself.

296
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,240
Mr. Bai, thank you for your trust

297
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,480
by giving me the position
of temporary manager

298
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,130
and putting me in charge
of this project.

299
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:45,430
Of course,

300
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,700
you don't trust me.

301
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,870
You only think that it is safest
to put me in charge

302
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,200
in this situation.

303
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,300
However,

304
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,470
I still need to thank you.

305
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,330
Yes.

306
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,370
You are capable enough
for this position.

307
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,530
Also,

308
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,500
speak in a simple way.

309
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:00,970
You just need to say thank you.

310
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,430
All right.

311
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,830
That's all?

312
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:05,470
Thank you.

313
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,330
Shu Yan.

314
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,030
Manager Yang.

315
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:15,900
What's wrong?

316
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:18,130
The food variety program proposal

317
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,370
belongs to you.

318
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,800
Although I'm in charge of this project,

319
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,900
you can handle this with no problem
with your ability.

320
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,700
So, I'm leaving it to you.

321
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,330
If you need my help,

322
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,430
just let me know.

323
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,730
Manager Yang,
what are you talking about?

324
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,370
You can call me anytime

325
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,730
whenever you need help.

326
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:38,200
I'm not giving it to you
because it is a difficult job

327
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:39,230
which is stressful.

328
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,200
I think that you are the only one
who can get it done.

329
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,120
Thank you for your recognition,
Manager Yang.

330
00:14:45,561 --> 00:14:46,891
I won't let you down.

331
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Let's work hard together.

332
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:50,930
Sure.

333
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:52,870
Good.

334
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,370
It's well-handled.

335
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:58,830
Are you here?

336
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,400
There are leftovers for you.

337
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,070
Go and eat.

338
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,330
I ate outside.

339
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,130
That's right.

340
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,130
Regarding your marriage with Meng Ya,

341
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,130
as long as

342
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,000
it doesn't ruin the family's reputation

343
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,570
and the company's benefit,

344
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,100
you can deal with it

345
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,800
as you wish.

346
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,770
Didn't you want me to marry Meng Ya?

347
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,630
What if I want it?

348
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,630
Will you do it?

349
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,320
(Wang Xingxing's
reality program reputation)

350
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,130
(My time was over back then.)

351
00:15:45,607 --> 00:15:46,637
(But I still have time)

352
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,330
(to protect her this time at least.)

353
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,700
(Even if I'm not
a part of her happiness.)

354
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,970
Hello, Chu Chen.

355
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:01,700
What is it?

356
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,200
You asked me

357
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,400
to find He Ju from Nanling University
and I've found him.

358
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:06,720
Let me send you his address.

359
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,500
That's wonderful.

360
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,530
Thank you.

361
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:09,370
How do you know how to do this?

362
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,200
My grandfather taught me this.

363
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,530
Right now, I am

364
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,770
giving you my best blessing.

365
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,770
You must be

366
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,130
happy forever.

367
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,130
The person I met

368
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,470
when I was drunk was you?

369
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,700
Have you remembered?

370
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,270
Why didn't you tell me?

371
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:38,800
I feel so embarrassed now.

372
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,500
Not at all.

373
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,400
I think you are very cute.

374
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,430
Let's go.

375
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,570
Let me send you home
since it's so late.

376
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,730
I'm going back as well.

377
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,370
Are you wearing this outfit?

378
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,630
Wait for me. Let me go and get changed.

379
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,330
I've sent the address to your phone.

380
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,270
This is quite a remote place.
Why are you going there?

381
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,370
I'm looking for a person
to discuss something.

382
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:17,330
Oh.

383
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,470
Is it Chu Chen?

384
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:21,600
No.

385
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,530
He is...

386
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,770
An amazing person.

387
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:28,430
An amazing person?

388
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,070
Yes.

389
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,600
You've piqued my curiosity.

390
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,430
Can you tell me who it is?

391
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,080
He is not very famous now

392
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,270
but he will become
an amazing person in the future.

393
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:40,030
He Ju

394
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:40,970

395
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,230
He Ju?

396
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,100
Yes.

397
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,630
He is an amazing person indeed.

00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,070
The founder of Douli.

get Douli Music Streaming Platform
listed in three years.

401
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,770
He's really amazing.

402
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:52,630
Yes.

403
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:55,000
I wanted to find you tonight
to talk about this.

404
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,440
I didn't expect you...

405
