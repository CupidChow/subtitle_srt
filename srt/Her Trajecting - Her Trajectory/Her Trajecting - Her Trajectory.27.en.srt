Shen Weizhou!

Shen Weizhou!

(Operating Room)

8
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,149
Ma'am, you can't go in there.

9
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,700
Please wait here.

10
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,500
(Now I think I finally understand)

11
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,630
(why I was brought back to this moment.)

12
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,030
(Yan.)

13
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,900
(There's something I have to tell you.)

14
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,100
(I didn't expect to tell you like this.)

15
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,400
(I died in a car accident)

16
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,360
(in 2025.)

17
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,860
(When I opened my eyes again,)

18
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,860
(it was 2020.)

19
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,230
(And I saw you, still alive.)

20
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,879
(That was the first time)

21
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,060
(I thought
maybe I could actually be happy.)

22
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,360
(But I knew I couldn't stay
by your side forever,)

23
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,530
(because I didn't know
when I would die again.)

24
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,979
(Still, I couldn't resist)

25
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,330
(the temptation of being with you,
even for a little while.)

26
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,300
(I love you.)

27
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,330
(I love you so much.)

28
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,860
(And for that,)

29
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,460
(I'm sorry.)

30
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,760
(I came back to protect you.)

31
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,779
(But if I had known)

32
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,960
(this moment would come so soon,)

33
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,039
(I wouldn't have held your hand.)

♪Then we were never truly apart♪

35
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,960
(Don't blame yourself.)

36
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,530
(What was meant to happen)

37
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,330
(happened.)

38
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:55,934
♪There is no need
to face the loneliness alone♪

39
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:05,979
How did it go?

40
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,200
Did you succeed?

41
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,000
I hit the wrong target.

42
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,500
What?

43
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,400
You must be stressed lately.

44
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,860
Your thigh is all tight.

45
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:20,430
All right.

46
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:25,930
Then help me relax a little.

47
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:30,900
Miss!

48
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,160
Miss. It failed.

49
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,440
Shen Weizhou came out of nowhere
and took the hit instead of her.

50
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,400
He's in the hospital. The driver fled the scene.
We're still searching for him.

51
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,500
What did you say?

52
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,279
Why was Shen Weizhou even there?

53
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,630
That was my mistake.

54
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,160
Useless!

55
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,979
Now I have to clean up

56
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,930
your mess too?

57
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,230
That driver will probably

58
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,330
go back to the hotel to find his woman.

59
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,030
Take some people and bring him in.

60
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,930
Right away.

61
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,860
Han Tianyu,

62
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,760
take your wife and go home.

63
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,930
Act like nothing happened.

64
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,030
Don't do anything reckless

65
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,660
until I contact you again.

66
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,100
Okay.

67
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,130
Okay.

68
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:24,960
Are you crazy?

69
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,630
Have you lost your mind, Ye Wei?

70
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,109
You're insane!

71
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,460
Calm down!

72
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:32,400
It's not over yet.

73
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,479
That woman is on our side.

74
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,530
Tianyu.

75
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,130
Did you know?

76
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,949
My dad ran off again with that woman.

77
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,179
He left me again!

78
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,030
What did I ever do wrong?

79
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,530
It's all Shu Yan's fault.

80
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,330
I'm going to kill her.

81
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,230
I'm going to kill Shu Yan!

82
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,730
Calm down!

83
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,630
Listen to me.

84
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,130
It's not over.

85
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,260
That woman is working with us.

86
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,600
She'll help clean this up.

87
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,100
Grandpa, slow down.

88
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,960
Take it easy.

89
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:12,979
Doctor,

90
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,349
how is my grandson?

91
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,809
Our best medical team
is doing everything they can.

92
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,709
Please try not to worry.

93
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,930
Just wait here a little longer.

94
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,109
Don't worry, Grandpa.

95
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,330
He's in surgery.

96
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,530
Go ahead.

97
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,809
Did you find out anything?

98
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,479
The driver's name is Ye Qiang.

99
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,230
He's Ye Wei's biological father.

100
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,779
Have you found him yet?

101
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,800
Not yet.

102
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,109
Go to the police.

103
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,960
Start by going through Ye Wei.

104
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:55,879
Go.

105
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,600
Yes, sir.

106
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,460
Director Bai,
did you just mention Ye Wei?

107
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,000
Shu Yan.

108
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,500
So this wasn't just an accident?

109
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:24,879
But what could she possibly gain
by doing this?

110
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,960
Ye Wei...

111
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,300
Ye Wei doesn't have the guts
to kill someone.

112
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,260
Someone else must be behind it.

113
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:37,730
Because Shen Weizhou transferred
all his assets to you before this happened.

114
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,230
If you died,

115
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,979
your only remaining family,

116
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,660
your mother, would inherit everything.

117
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,530
Why...

118
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,360
Why would he do that?

119
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:58,209
It's like he knew he was going to die.

120
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,360
He had everything planned in advance.

121
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,800
I think he just wanted
to make sure you'd be set for life.

122
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:37,709
(Operating Room)

123
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,549
Doctor!

124
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,430
Doctor.

125
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,860
How's my grandson now?

126
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,379
We've done everything we can,

127
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,149
but we don't know

128
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,130
when he'll regain consciousness.

129
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,930
Doctor,

130
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,579
please save

131
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,549
my grandson.

132
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,179
He's all I have left.

133
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,700
I'm begging you.

134
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,830
Everything's normal.

135
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's go.

136
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,660
Shen Weizhou,

137
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,460
don't give up.

138
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,700
Hang in there.

139
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:38,700
Hang in there...

140
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,530
Yes?

141
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,430
I've always wanted to ask you.

142
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,360
Why did you want to kill me?

143
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,260
Was it for money?

144
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,300
What on earth are you talking about?

145
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,360
Do you even realize what you did to me?

146
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,300
Because of you, I had a miscarriage!

147
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,849
Han Tianyu is infertile.

148
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,860
You couldn't have been pregnant.

149
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,860
What are you talking about?

150
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,300
I did an ultrasound.

151
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,860
I felt the baby move.

152
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,700
Enough!

153
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,100
Stop lying!

154
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,900
You lie about everything!
Can't you tell me just one thing that's true?

155
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:12,900
Why are you doing this to me?

156
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,509
What did I do
to make you hate me so much?

157
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,760
You've always tried
to take everything from me

158
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,949
since we were kids. Why?

159
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,030
Fine!

160
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,700
I'll tell you why.

161
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:28,030
Because I don't want you to be happy.

162
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,530
You didn't know, did you?

163
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,060
Back when we were kids,

164
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,660
the man your mom had an affair with
and ran away with

165
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,460
was my dad.

166
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,879
You didn't know anything.

167
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,909
Living your carefree,

168
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,000
happy little life.

169
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,100
Everything I was put through
because of that...

170
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:02,599
(Dad, why haven't you come home yet?
Mom said you left us because you had an affair.)

171
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:04,610
(Please call me back.
I'll be good. Please take me with you.)

172
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:05,709
You brat!

173
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:07,130
What are you doing now?

174
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,400
Just looking at your face reminds me
of that scoundrel of a father of yours!

175
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,449
Mom!

176
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,130
Don't hit me!

177
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,760
Why didn't you just leave with him?

178
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,500
All you Yes should just die!

179
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:21,800
Who was that on the phone?

180
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,760
A woman?

181
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,709
No.

182
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,760
My daughter.

183
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:27,660
She's as stubborn as her mother.

184
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,920
You're not planning to bring
your daughter here to live with us, are you?

185
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,579
I haven't even brought my daughter over.

186
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,379
If you do that,

187
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,679
I'll just find

188
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,260
another man

189
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,909
and live my best life.

190
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:40,330
What are you talking about?
Why would I bring that burden here?

191
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,149
I like you.

192
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,400
You can't leave me.

193
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,879
What would I do without you?

194
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,630
(Dad's new lover had a daughter too.)

195
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,530
Here.

196
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,909
You do one.

197
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,149
I'll do one.

198
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,300
Yan.

199
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:04,849
You're back.

200
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,000
Grandpa.

201
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,430
Hello, sir.

202
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,530
Good.

203
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,849
Yan rarely

204
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:12,060
brings friends over to play.

205
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,560
You're a beautiful girl.

206
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,849
Well, little fairies,

207
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:19,949
come have some cake.

208
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,460
Sweet cake

209
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,760
tastes even better with milk.

210
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,500
(You and I are different.)

211
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,330
(Even if you lost your mom,)

212
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,900
(you still had a family full of love.)

213
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:39,600
From that moment on,

214
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,100
I envied you.

215
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,130
I wanted to take everything from you.

216
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,679
Why did you get

217
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,260
to have all the best things in life,

218
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,730
while I had to suffer?

219
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,960
Shu Yan.

220
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,130
Do you understand now?

221
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:03,260
From the very beginning,

222
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,909
I only got close to you
so I could ruin your happiness.

223
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:11,530
I never saw you as a friend!

224
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,560
Every time I saw you,

225
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,060
I felt disgusted!

226
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:26,560
You never had to face
how cruel the world can be, have you?

227
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,160
Well, I have.

228
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:36,760
And because my life
has been so miserable,

229
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,400
how can you live happily?

230
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,460
You know what, Wei?

231
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,100
I've known all of this

232
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,000
for a long time.

233
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,300
I was actually relieved.

234
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:18,100
Relieved that you didn't know.

235
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,679
If my dad were still alive,

236
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,449
he would've come back for me too.

237
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,879
You said your dad passed away
two years ago.

238
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,209
You must miss him a lot.

239
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:28,909
Yes.

240
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,509
He was the best dad in the world.

241
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,179
Come to my place for dinner tonight.

242
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,379
Okay.

243
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,200
Let's go.

244
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,560
I wanted to be kind to you.

245
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,100
I wanted us both to be happy.

246
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,260
Hold up.

247
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,779
You conniving little tramp.

248
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,079
You're a two-sided faker.

249
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,279
Still pretending to be innocent?

250
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,930
Want to act all pure and good?

251
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,900
Then stick to drinking milk.

252
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,760
Even when I was dying,

253
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,100
I still hoped you'd be happy.

254
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,000
Shut up!

255
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,960
Just because Shen Weizhou is rich
and from a powerful family,

256
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:24,430
you dumped Han Tianyu on me.

257
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,100
Why didn't you give
Shen Weizhou to me, huh?

258
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,960
I can't stand people like you.

259
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:33,300
So fake. So disgusting!

260
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,400
Shu Yan,

261
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:42,160
I hate you.

262
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,600
You hate me?

263
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,030
You still don't understand

264
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,749
what you did wrong,

265
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:50,730
do you?

266
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,300
Fine.

267
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,730
I'll tell you.

268
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:03,949
You can treat me however you want,
but the one thing you should never have done

269
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,860
<i>was drag Shen Weizhou into this!</i>

270
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,730
Let me tell you something.

271
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,900
Ever heard this saying?

272
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,330
You reap what you sow.

273
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,730
Just wait.

274
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:18,930
It's coming.

275
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,800
Prepare to face the consequences
you brought on yourself.

276
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:26,630
(I'll transfer my fate, my pain,)

277
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,830
