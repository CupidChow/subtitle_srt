Yan,

6
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:33,230
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,760
I'm late.

8
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,490
If I had

9
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,130
had the courage to interfere,

10
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,690
would your story
have turned out differently?

11
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,990
Shen Weizhou! Shen Weizhou!

I'm going on stage soon.

18

Let's take some pictures
with the fans first.

19
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,290
Have you seen the doctor?

20
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,490
What did they say?

21
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,979
You should've died a long time ago.

22
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,060
That's the only value you have left.

23
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,430
The man I loved so deeply, my husband,
actually killed me!

24
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,760
What's wrong?

25
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,930
Go to hell!

26
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,079
What's wrong with you, Shu Yan?

27
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,879
Why did you hit me?
Are you out of your mind?

28
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:40,930
You jerk!

29
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,990
Hey, people are watching!

30
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,830

Ouch! Ouch!

Are you

37
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,390
okay?

38
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,530
I'm fine.

39
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,830
Shu Yan?

40
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,690
Let go.

41
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,590
Shu Yan,

42
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,660
are you okay?

43
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,479
As long as Shu Yan dies,

44
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,690
we'll get 80 million yuan.

51

Look! Look!

52
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,790

Wait!

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,579
Shen Weizhou!

56
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,360
Weizhou, wait for me!

57
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,890
Your hand is hurt.

58
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,479
I'm so sorry.

59
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,730
It's all because of me.

60
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,030
It won't leave a scar, will it?

61
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,360
It's just a scratch.

62
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,560
No big deal.

63
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,330
I'm just glad you're okay.

64
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,660
There shouldn't be a scar
on your forehead.

65
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,430
(What does that mean?)

66
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,909
(Could he have seen)

67
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,660

you're in a delicate
situation right now.

102
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:58,260
It's normal for you to
be emotionally unstable.

103
00:08:58,610 --> 00:08:59,979
But why did you have

104
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,630
to make such a scene in public?

105
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,460

You're really good at your job.

108
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,539
I just don't want your future

109
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,990
to be affected for family reason.

110
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,509
Besides, my career is just taking off.

111
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,530
If news gets out that I had
a child out of wedlock,

112
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,460
it would be a huge blow
to my image in the showbiz.

113
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,890
So...

114
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:24,060
You should get an abortion.

115
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,990
I can cover half the cost.

116
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,060
I'm not pregnant.

117
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,330
It's gastritis.

118
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,430
Oh, it's just gastritis?

119
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:40,790
Thank goodness.

120
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,579

Why?

128
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,060

After all these years,

130
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,939
have you been well to me?

131
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,590
All you ever did was take money from me,

132
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,960
or make me clean up your messes.

133
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,790
Have you ever once cared about me?
What have you ever done for me?

134
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,660

139

I only let it slide

141
