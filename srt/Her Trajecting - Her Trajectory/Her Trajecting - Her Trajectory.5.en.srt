1
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:48,159
Tianyu

2
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:49,680
Can you help me?

3
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,680
I can't zip it up.

4
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,120
Tianyu

5
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,040
We can't do this

6
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,400
Sorry

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,879
Hey, Xiaoyan

8
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,919
You should be on your way now, right?

9
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,559
Today is our date day

10
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:04,279
Remember to dress up nicely

11
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:04,919
Okay

12
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:05,680
Hmm

13
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,440
See you in a bit

14
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,559
See you in a bit

15
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,440
Shuyan, you're too easy to fool

16
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,679
You'll see something interesting soon

17
00:02:14,679 --> 00:02:16,559
Happy birthday, Li Qian

18
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,919
Thank you, everyone

19
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:19,559
It's been a while since we all met

20
00:02:19,559 --> 00:02:20,759
Let's have a good chat

21
00:02:22,039 --> 00:02:22,720
Ye Wei

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,039
You dressed up so nicely

23
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,960
Wow, what a wow

24
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,600
Ye Wei

25
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,199
You look so beautiful

26
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,000
Let me see

27
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:38,160
You haven't changed since school

28
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,639
You haven't aged a bit

29
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:43,559
Did you secretly get injections?

30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,960
Why are you still so cheeky?

31
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,160
Sorry, sorry

32
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:50,160
But I think you all haven't changed either

33
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,600
Still so beautiful

34
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,720
Ye Wei is here

35
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,679
Let's have a drink together

36
00:02:53,679 --> 00:02:54,960
Come, have a drink

37
00:02:55,559 --> 00:02:57,119
Come, come, come

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,320
Happy birthday

39
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,160
Ever since Ye Wei joined the big company,

40
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:05,919
she has become like a strong woman.

41
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,440
Both beautiful and charismatic.

42
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,839
Not really.

43
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:11,360
Just a bit of good luck.

44
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,240
However,

45
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,440
I am indeed preparing for a promotion recently.

46
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,759
To become an artist manager.

47
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,800
So impressive

48
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,639
Impressive

49
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:23,839
It's all thanks to my good friend Shuyan

50
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:24,800
By the way

51
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,880
Shuyan and I are now at the same company

52
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,039
Did you know that?

53
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:29,800
No, I didn't

54
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:30,600
Really?

55
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,720
You're still hanging out with her?

56
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:34,000
Don't say that

57
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,919
We've been good friends for so many years

58
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,199
You're not still being taken advantage of, are you?

59
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:40,360
How has she been lately?

60
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:42,080
She's not still struggling, is she?

61
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,160
Still clinging to you?

62
00:03:43,559 --> 00:03:45,479
Actually, Shuyan isn't struggling

63
00:03:45,679 --> 00:03:47,839
She just lives a simple life

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,559
And also

65
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:50,039
She's become really beautiful now

66
00:03:50,559 --> 00:03:51,600
Wait, she's coming

67
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,199
Be nice to her

68
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,399
Because she's been feeling down lately

69
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,600
She

70
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,000
Why is she feeling down?

71
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:00,559
Exactly

72
00:04:00,559 --> 00:04:01,479
That's funny

73
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,240
Didn't I introduce her

74
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,639
to Noran Group as an artist assistant?

75
00:04:06,399 --> 00:04:07,320
But

76
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,559
After she started working

77
00:04:08,559 --> 00:04:10,520
she seems to be interested in our company's trainee

78
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,960
Han Tianyu

79
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,279
Han Tianyu

80
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:14,080
Wait a minute

81
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,040
Han Tianyu

82
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:18,920
I remember you said

83
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,839
Han Tianyu is pursuing you, right?

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,600
What's wrong?

85
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,440
Wait, don't mention it when Xiaoyan comes.

86
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:26,959
Why can't we talk about it?

87
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,760
Exactly.

88
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:30,040
She won't start again, will she?

89
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,200
Competing with you for a man.

90
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:41,160
Ye Wei

91
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,720
Shu Yan

92
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,839
Xiao Yan

93
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,640
Why are all the classmates here?

94
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:52,119
Ye Wei told me it would just be the two of us having dinner.

95
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,160
Long time no see, classmates.

96
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,440
Ugly duckling Shu Yan

97
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,880
Has now become so beautiful?

98
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,079
Watch your words.

99
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,160
What do you mean by "now"?

100
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,320
Sorry, sorry.

101
00:05:01,799 --> 00:05:03,000
What are you pretending?

102
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,600
Dressing like this to pretend to be rich?

103
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,920
I see her shoes are still imitating Ye Wei's.

104
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,320
It's different.

105
00:05:17,799 --> 00:05:20,200
Shuyan's shoes clearly have a more premium feel.

106
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,839
Ye Wei's seem to be fake.

107
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,480
No way, Ye Wei.

108
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,720
Why are you copying her?

109
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:28,679
You should buy the real thing.

110
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,480
I

111
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,160
There are a lot of high-quality fakes lately.

112
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:33,640
You can wear them even if you don't have money.

113
00:05:34,239 --> 00:05:35,880
Most people can't tell the difference anyway.

114
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,920
But you wouldn't have guessed.

115
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:40,040
I'm a luxury goods expert.

116
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:44,160
Give people some face.

117
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,519
A luxury goods expert, really?

118
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,480
Hurry up and eat.

119
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,559
Sorry, everyone.

120
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,679
I just rushed in.

121
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:52,399
I wanted to say hi to everyone first.

122
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,799
I need to go to the restroom first.

123
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,519
I'll be right back.

124
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:56,320
You guys eat first.

125
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,679
Shuyan, how can you steal my spotlight?

126
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:07,079
You mentioned that Shu Yan

127
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:09,000
isn't here to show off, right?

128
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,040
I noticed she's wearing all new clothes from head to toe.

129
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,720
She's just like she was in college.

130
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,839
Always copying Ye Wei's style.

131
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,679
I don't think much of it.

132
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,040
If you ask me,

133
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,000
Ye Wei is too kind and naive.

134
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,559
That's why she befriends people like her.

135
00:06:23,119 --> 00:06:24,559
Don't you think Shu Yan

136
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:27,079
is like a leech, always sticking to her?

137
00:06:27,559 --> 00:06:29,359
She takes her things as if it's her right.

138
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
She takes everything.

139
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,040
Shameless.

140
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
Shu Yan hasn't come back yet.

141
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,399
Let's go check inside.

142
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:38,640
Let's go, let's go.

143
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,000
She didn't come out

144
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,200
It's this one

145
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,559
It's this

146
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,480
Shu Yan

147
00:07:01,679 --> 00:07:02,559
What's going on

148
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,640
Exactly

149
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,839
Hiding here to eavesdrop

150
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,480
Who's eavesdropping

151
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:08,920
You're making a loud noise in a public place

152
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,519
It's hard not to hear

153
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,079
Didn't I come out to greet you

154
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:15,040
Speak up

155
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,119
I also want to keep listening

156
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,119
What did I take from Ye Wei

157
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:27,000
Shu Yan

158
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,559
You're asking knowingly, aren't you?

159
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,359
You want to learn everything that Ye Wei does.

160
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:33,440
Look at the shoes you're wearing today.

161
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,920
Aren't they also imitating Ye Wei?

162
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,279
Exactly.

163
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:37,920
Oh.

164
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,920
Shoes.

165
00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:40,279
Right.

166
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,239
Ye Wei did give me a pair of shoes.

167
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,440
Because they were fake.

168
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,880
So I bought a genuine pair with my own money.

169
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,200
Is there a problem?

170
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:51,040
Ye Wei also got you into Nuoran Entertainment Group.

171
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,679
A job at such a big company.

172
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,920
You even stole her crush, Han Tianyu.

173
00:07:56,239 --> 00:07:57,239
Listen up, everyone.

174
00:07:57,519 --> 00:07:58,880
I'll only say this once.

175
00:08:00,359 --> 00:08:03,119
I've been working at Nuoran Entertainment Group for five years.

176
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,720
My current position is Artist Project Planner.

177
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,760
And Ye Wei is just an artist assistant.

178
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,040
And she got the job last year through my introduction.

179
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,480
That's how she got the job.

180
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
As for Han Tianyu,

181
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,720
he is my boyfriend.

182
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,600
He has nothing to do with Ye Wei.

183
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:23,600
Hey, darling

184
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,559
Darling

185
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:27,799
I'm having dinner with my college friends

186
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,119
They all want to say hi to you

187
00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:32,599
Say a few words to everyone

188
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,840
You're Han Tianyu

189
00:08:35,239 --> 00:08:36,919
Are you really with Shu Yan?

190
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:38,960
How long have you been together?

191
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,559
Hi, I'm Han Tianyu

192
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,200
We've been together for over five years

193
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,400
Please take good care of her today

194
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,960
Let's have dinner together another day

195
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:52,000
Is that okay?

196
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,440
What's going on?

197
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,679
How dare you hang up on me?

198
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,719
I think

199
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,640
your girlfriend already has another guy, right?

200
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:07,640
She's just keeping you around for marriage.

201
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,640
You don't know anything.

202
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:10,880
Take your time eating, everyone.

203
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:12,440
I'll be leaving now.

204
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:13,760
Shu Yan

205
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,520
Where are you going?

206
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:17,640
Shu Yan

207
00:09:18,119 --> 00:09:19,919
Forget about the other things.

208
00:09:20,239 --> 00:09:22,320
You can't just break up Ye Wei and Chu Chen because you like him.

209
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,119
Just let Ye Wei and them break up.

210
00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:25,520
Oh.

211
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,719
If you hadn't reminded me,

212
00:09:26,719 --> 00:09:27,840
I would have almost forgotten.

213
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:29,960
It's true that I liked Chu Chen.

214
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,239
But Ye Wei never dated Chu Chen.

215
00:09:35,239 --> 00:09:36,559
Did you date Chu Chen?

216
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,400
Ye Wei, say it.

217
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,159
Say it.

218
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,960
Tell her.

219
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:47,799
Shuyan

220
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,919
Back then, you liked Chu Chen

221
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,719
I really didn't have the courage to tell you

222
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:52,640
That's right

223
00:09:53,479 --> 00:09:56,359
I did indeed date Chu Chen

224
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:57,239
Oh

225
00:09:58,479 --> 00:10:00,640
Didn't you just say

226
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,320
I made you break up?

227
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,719
Now you're saying I didn't know

228
00:10:04,599 --> 00:10:05,080
That's because I

229
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,679
Shuyan

230
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,280
You, someone who did wrong

231
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,760
How can you be so confident

232
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,799
when talking to Ye Wei

233
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,719
Ye Wei always defends you

234
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,960
You need to apologize to Ye Wei

235
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,799
The ones who should apologize are the three of you

236
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,599
Because of an unverified statement from Ye Wei

237
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,359
I was bullied for three whole years

238
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:21,760
And you are still making excuses

239
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,799
Ye Wei said she dated Chu Chen for three years

240
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,119
But you have always denied it

241
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,679
How come I don't know that I dated Ye Wei

242
00:10:28,599 --> 00:10:30,320
Chu Chen

243
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:33,400
Shu Yan

244
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,000
Long time no see

245
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:36,559
Chu Chen

246
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,679
What brings you here

247
00:10:38,119 --> 00:10:40,919
You just said you didn't date Ye Wei

248
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,440
So you liked me, right?

249
00:10:47,719 --> 00:10:49,559
Then why did you treat me like that back then

250
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,799
Shuyan

251
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,799
Why did Chu Chen come to the class reunion?

252
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:02,840
It's all over now.

253
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,880
What?

254
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,479
You want to break off the engagement with Mengya?

255
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,359
Yes.

256
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,280
This marriage contract

257
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,679
was agreed upon by me and Mengya's late father

258
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:27,960
a long time ago

259
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,479
Without a valid reason

260
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:31,039
it cannot be annulled

261
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,039
No reason

262
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,119
is simply not liking

263
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,640
Weizhou

264
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,280
You are now

265
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,000
the heir to the company

266
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,119
Do you mean

267
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,719
you will run this company according to your own preferences

268
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:43,119
in the future?

269
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:43,799
Grandpa

270
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,799
Once I inherit the company

271
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,559
I won't need to explain myself to anyone

272
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:48,400
You

273
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:52,280
Weizhou

274
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:56,440
I know

275
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,880
nowadays

276
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,520
there is a group of young people in society

277
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:02,640
who hold the belief

278
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,799
that not getting married leads to a better life

279
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,679
Do you

280
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,359
also think this way?

281
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,039
Grandpa

282
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,119
I have someone I like.

283
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,239
What?

284
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:14,320
You have someone you like?

285
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:16,440
Which family is she from?

286
00:12:16,719 --> 00:12:17,840
What's her surname and given name?

287
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
It's unrequited love.

288
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:20,320
It's inconvenient to disclose.

289
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,760
You...

290
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,320
How did you end up with unrequited love?

291
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:24,640
Don't forget,

292
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:26,200
you are my grandson.

293
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:29,799
And the heir to our Nuoran Entertainment Group.

294
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:30,640
What you should do,

295
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,799
and what you shouldn't do,

296
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,679
you should be very clear about it.

297
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:34,239
Grandpa,

298
00:12:34,479 --> 00:12:35,039
what I should do,

299
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:35,679
and what I shouldn't do,

300
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:36,679
I am very clear about it.

301
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,760
But from childhood to now,

302
00:12:39,119 --> 00:12:40,799
I have always followed your instructions.

303
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:41,760
This time,

304
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,000
can you give me the freedom to choose?

305
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:44,599
You...

306
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,840
You mean Grandpa is too domineering

307
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,159
I've been suppressing you since childhood

308
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,159
No, Grandpa

309
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,520
I know you mean well for me

310
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:55,840
I also respect you

311
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,239
So when I found someone I like

312
00:12:57,239 --> 00:12:58,479
I told you immediately

313
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,080
I really like her

314
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:01,440
I want to fight for it

315
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,159
I don't want to have regrets

316
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,559
Weizhou

317
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,520
Weizhou

318
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:17,320
This half of my kingdom

319
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,760
was built with the help of Mengya's late father

320
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,159
who helped me establish it

321
00:13:21,479 --> 00:13:22,520
If this time

322
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,640
Weizhou cannot marry Mengya

323
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,479
then we will have to make other plans

324
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:29,799
By the way

325
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,320
investigate thoroughly

326
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:34,479
and see if there are any unwanted developments

327
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:35,400
If there are

328
00:13:36,239 --> 00:13:37,520
eliminate them immediately

329
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:38,640
Don't worry, Chairman

330
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:39,799
You have me

331
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:40,599
Good

332
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,760
Keqin's side should have been resolved by now.

333
00:13:58,359 --> 00:13:59,520
Why would Chu Chen come here?

334
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,200
What has already happened

335
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:02,919
Why is there such a change?

336
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:03,960
Shuyan

337
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,799
Shuyan, wait a moment

338
00:14:07,719 --> 00:14:08,440
Sorry

339
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,359
I just wanted to ask

340
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,159
I... I never liked you

341
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:12,760
I

342
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,039
That just now

343
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:14,799
It

344
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,960
was a slip of the tongue

345
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,599
But

346
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,320
I did like you
