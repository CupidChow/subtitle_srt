00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,460
(Every Trajectory Is You)

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,540
=Episode 10=

4
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,280
I surrender!

5
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:54,310
Boss, what are you up to?

6
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,410
Seems like

7
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,529
Judo is a better fit for Shu Yan.

8
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,560
Are you going to teach Yan
the art of self-defense?

9
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,689
You should at least raise my salary.

10
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,510
What a ruthless man.

11
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,810
I'm done for.

12
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,740
I'm totally done for.

13
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,910
I borrowed this sum from loan sharks.

14
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,110
I'm done for.

15
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,680
Oh yeah.

16
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,110
Shu Yan is rich.

17
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,110
That's right.

18
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,710
Shu Yan is rich.

19
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,210
She can help me repay my debt.

20
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,880
Shu Yan is rich.

21
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:46,959
That's right.

22
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,180
Shu Yan is rich.

23
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,680
Tianyu?

24
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,329
When did you come?

25
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,810
You scared me.

26
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,240
I just arrived.

27
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,610
(Just arrived?)

28
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:04,110
(If so, I suppose she didn't hear me.)

29
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,240
Here you go.

30
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,710
Actually,

31
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,889
there's nothing between Mr. Shen and I.

32
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,689
But you really startled me

33
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,310
with the way you acted last night.

34
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:20,280
I know you might already be tired of me.

35
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,440
Although

36
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,480
I'm reluctant to part with you,

37
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,740
if you're tired of me,

38
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,280
we should break up.

39
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,029
I'll pray that you can find
a better girl than me.

40
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,210
(Yeah.)

41
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,310
(She's just a delicate woman.)

42
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,110
(How could I be violent to her?)

43
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,489
(Shen Weizhou likes her a lot.)

44
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,440
(Even so, she still prefers me.)

45
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,140
(At least I'm better than him
in that regard.)

46
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,880
Yan,

47
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,640
did it hurt?

48
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,410
It's all my fault.

49
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,780
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,580
I shouldn't have hit you.

51
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,059
But Baby,

52
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,510
you were at fault as well.

53
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,359
You didn't tell me anything.

54
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,980
That's why I misunderstood you.

55
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,340
I swear.

56
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,240
I won't ever hit you again.

57
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,910
It's all in the past now.

58
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,080
Let's reconcile.

59
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,480
(Reconcile?)

60
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,840
(You still don't want
to break up with me after that?)

61
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:23,910
Let's go.

62
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,610
Let's go and have lunch.

63
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,610
Alright.

64
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,310
I'll invite Ye Wei, then.

65
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,710
Sure.

66
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,640
If so,

67
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,680
I'll text her, then.

68
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,610
(Something's off.)

69
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,180
(The two of them
were already being sneaky.)

70
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,559
(News alert.)

71
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,229
(Stock market crisis.)

72
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:54,459
(Multiple stocks plummeted.)

73
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,410
(I see now.)

74
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,140
(The stock he purchased
today had plummeted.)

75
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,610
(No wonder he wasn't willing
to break up with me.)

76
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,710
(He still intends
to take money from me.)

77
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,680
Did you go home directly last night?

78
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,959
Yeah.

79
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,540
Where else can I go?

80
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,440
Wei said she saw you.

81
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,480
Oh.

82
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,910
I remember now.

83
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,529
I encountered her on my way home.

84
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,810
I sent her back on my way home.

85
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,080
Is that so?

86
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,940
(Excellent.)

87
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,559
(They have begun their affair.)

88
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,929
(I have to speed up the process)

89
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,780
(and let them get married.)

90
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,380
(I suppose Ye Wei
didn't tell her what happened.)

91
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,159
(I can't afford to delay
the loan payment.)

92
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,280
(I have to obtain Shu Yan's fortune
as soon as possible.)

93
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,559
(Once I marry her,)

94
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,740
(all of her fortunes will be mine.)

95
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,240
Cheers.

96
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,729
This is great.

97
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,210
As of today,
we're done with our past grudges.

98
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,089
We'll always be the sweet trio.

99
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:13,729
That's right.

100
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,680
Indeed.

101
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,180
Tianyu,

102
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,880
you should eat up.

103
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,980
I feel like you've lost weight.

104
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,810
Thank you, Baby.

105
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,480
Wei,

106
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,729
you should eat up as well.

107
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,340
It's been tough on you lately.

108
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,480
You had to look after
all of the company's celebrities.

109
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
You had to look after Tianyu too.

110
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,529
Yeah, Yan.

111
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,280
It's truly been tough on me.

112
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,129
I've worked for the company
for a long time.

113
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,210
When can I join the program department?

114
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,359
My meager wage

115
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,810
is barely covering my expenses.

116
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,259
The company will be filming
a reality food show soon.

117
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,640
Mr. Wang is in charge of it.

118
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,559
You have great ties with him, right?

119
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,759
You should ask him about it.
Maybe he'll help you out.

120
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,429
Really?

121
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,280
Yeah.

122
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:01,880
I'm glad to hear that.

123
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,410
Yan, you should eat up too.

124
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,640
Reality show?

125
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,380
They're very popular now.

126
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,910
Baby,

127
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:10,929
can you recommend me
to the show as well?

128
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,960
I've been doing
product advertisements for so long.

129
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,659
It's hard for me to achieve anything.

130
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,729
Of course.

131
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,529
You're my darling, you know?

132
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:19,089
Who else can I support?

133
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,140
Really?

134
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,940
Thank you, Baby.

135
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,289
You guys can continue.

136
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,780
I need to use the restroom.

137
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,880
Just bear with it.

138
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,000
Just hang in there for a little longer.

139
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,830
(Shen Weizhou)

140
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,680
Hello, Mr. Shen?

141
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,059
Hello, Shu Yan.

142
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,359
I need to speak with you.

143
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,340
Are you free now?

144
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,840
Yes.

145
00:06:58,930 --> 00:06:59,880
I'm free.

146
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,680
Let's end our relationship.

147
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,840
Don't tell Shu Yan about us.

148
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,410
I plan to propose to her.

149
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,640
Is that so?

150
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,889
That's great.

151
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,280
I give you guys my blessing.

152
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,689
(Shu Yan)
(Dear,)

153
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,910
(I had to go due to work affairs.)

154
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,120
(You guys can finish the meal.
Send Ye Wei home later.)

155
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,089
What the heck?

156
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:35,780
She's not even finishing her meal.

157
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,040
Of course she's leaving

158
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,280
to do something more meaningful
than spending time with you.

159
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,980
To her, the only thing
that's more meaningful than me

160
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,180
is to work hard and make money.

161
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:53,489
(This won't do. I have to participate
in this project no matter what.)

162
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,080
(Seems like I need
to do something about Wang Xu.)

163
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,529
I'm done. I have something else to do.

164
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:02,480
I'll make a move first.

165
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,440
Let me send you home.

166
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,129
What's going on

167
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,580
with these two women?

168
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,280
They couldn't even finish their meal.

169
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,740
You wanted to learn
the art of self-defense, right?

170
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,680
Judo is one of the most basic forms.

171
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:28,089
Judo

172
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,160
has its roots in Physics.

173
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,010
You can think of it
as manipulating leverage.

174
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,510
It's easier to understand that way.

175
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,640
Come.

176
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:34,610
Give it a try.

177
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,329
Give what a try?

178
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:38,610
Try to make me fall.

179
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,210
I can't!

180
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,889
When the difference in size and strength
between you and your opponent is too great,

181
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,740
you mustn't force a confrontation.

182
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:09,010
You have to find
the right place to start and shout it out.

183
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,080
Give it another try.

184
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,540
Bring it on.

185
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,780
Yan, you succeeded!

186
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,429
I succeeded!

187
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,010
You succeeded!

188
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,659
Excellent.

189
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,110
You've mastered the basics.

190
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,080
Now,

191
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,680
let's start the real training.

192
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,510
Come.

193
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,910
Your opponent won't let you
grapple them that easily.

194
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:20,980
Sometimes,

195
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,710
they might strike.

196
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,410
Your opponents

197
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:27,629
know

198
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,410
that you cannot defeat them
with your strength.

199
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,129
If you hesitate
to engage them in a fight,

200
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,489
do not enter the stage.

201
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,889
Once you do it,

202
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,280
you can only think of one thing,

203
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,580
that is to defeat your opponent.

204
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,759
Get up.

205
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,840
Continue your fight.

206
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,540
I'll make you fall for real.

207
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,510
Bring it on.

208
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,540
Judo is all about pushing and pulling.

209
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,610
When the gap in strength is too large,

210
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,240
you need to learn
how to leverage your opponent's strength.

211
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,010
When you're weak in battle,

212
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,180
you can consider

213
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,840
borrowing my strength.

214
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,410
I!

215
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,440
I succeeded!

216
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,580
I made you fall!

217
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,510
Great job.

218
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,259
Boss, you're going too easy on her.

219
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,240
You were never this gentle
when you sparred with me.

220
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,010
You have no eyes for your PA at all.

221
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,489
Mr. Shen,

222
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,140
sorry for the trouble today.

223
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,880
Aren't you going
to buy me a drink upstairs?

224
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:04,110
I...

225
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,259
Don't be nervous.

226
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,510
I'm just joking with you.

227
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,240
And,

228
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,710
don't be stressed out
by my confession last time.

229
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,380
I...

230
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,010
I wasn't stressed out by it.

231
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,680
And,

232
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,040
I felt pretty happy.

233
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,329
However,

234
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,340
in my current state,

235
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,940
I don't think it's appropriate
for me to start a new relationship.

236
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,740
And, we don't know
each other well enough.

237
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:35,240
I don't think I can
or will start a new relationship

238
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,780
before I'm done handling
my relationship with Han Tianyu.

239
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,710
Therefore,

240
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,780
thank you for liking me.

241
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,210
I understand.

242
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,040
But you can look for me

243
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,410
if you need anything.

244
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,510
Alright.

245
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,740
Stay safe on your way home.

246
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:55,840
Goodbye.

247
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,410
Shu Yan.

248
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:58,740
Hmm?

249
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,640
Although I might be nosy here,

250
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,759
please consider your relationship

251
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,929
with Han Tianyu carefully.

252
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,380
He's not the kind of good husband
you think he is.

253
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,910
I will.

254
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:16,920
Are you experiencing stomach discomfort?

255
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:18,280
Let me send you to the hospital.

256
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:20,240
It's fine.

257
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,289
I already did my checkup.

258
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,360
It's just gastritis.

259
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,259
You should've visited
several hospitals, you know.

260
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,680
There's potential for misdiagnosis.

261
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:29,980
I...

262
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:30,889
I...

263
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,380
I'm not jinxing you here.

264
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,490
I'm just saying that it's possible
for a hospital to misdiagnose you. Therefore...

265
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,080
Mr. Shen, it's fine.

266
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,280
Don't worry about me.

267
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,780
I know my own condition the best.

268
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,310
I'll be fine.

269
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,380
Don't worry.

270
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,159
I'll head back and rest now.

271
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,559
Goodbye.

272
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,540
Okay.

273
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:01,910
Meng Ya.

274
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,710
Why didn't you tell me beforehand

275
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,280
that you were coming back?

276
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,329
Grandpa, I just missed you.

277
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,359
In order for me

278
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,310
to spend time with my family every day,

279
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,459
I've decided

280
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,089
to remain in the country
after my return.

281
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,110
Hmm.

282
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,959
I suppose

283
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,010
it's because Weizhou tried
to cancel your wedding, huh?

284
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,010
Grandpa,

285
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,329
I know clearly that Weizhou
has no feelings for me.

286
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,829
However, our engagement

287
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,210
wasn't established on
the basis of mutual love.

288
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:33,140
Therefore, after giving it some thought,

289
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:35,710
I think our wedding mustn't be canceled.

290
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,910
Hmm.

291
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,310
No matter what kinds of decisions

292
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,680
you two make,

293
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,080
I'll always support

294
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,659
you two.

295
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,910
Thank you, Grandpa.

296
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,529
But Grandpa,

297
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,610
I've been engaged
to Weizhou for three years.

298
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,510
It was fine before.

299
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,680
What's with the sudden cancellation?
