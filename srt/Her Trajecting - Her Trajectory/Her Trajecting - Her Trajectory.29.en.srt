2
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,460
(Every Trajectory Is You)

3
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,540
=Episode 29=

4
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,529
I nearly got hit

5
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:47,889
in a serious car accident a while ago.

6
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,540
A car accident?

7
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:52,580
A truck was speeding toward me.

8
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,259
For a second,
I thought I was going to die.

9
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,510
But then Shen Weizhou jumped in
and took the hit for me.

10
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,489
Do you know

11
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,310
who was driving that truck?

12
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:04,780
How would I know?

13
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,880
It was Ye Wei's dad.

14
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,710
(She does know everything.)

15
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,629
Anyway,

16
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,310
that's what happened.

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,729
I never imagined

18
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,689
Ye Wei would actually try to kill me.

19
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,380
That accident opened my eyes

20
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,759
to who she really is

21
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,980
and to Shen Weizhou, too.

22
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,410
He had someone following me.

23
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,489
If he wasn't tracking me,

24
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:28,689
how else would he have shown up right

25
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,640
at that moment after we broke up?

26
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,310
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,059
It's like

28
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:36,089
I'm constantly being watched.

29
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:37,780
He scares me.

30
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,640
So what will you do now?

31
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:42,380
There's no way I'm getting back together
with Shen Weizhou.

32
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,859
Luckily,

33
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,829
I've got
that 800 million breakup settlement.

34
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:46,829
Life

35
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,480
could be worse.

36
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,529
(She broke up and still walked away
with 800 million.)

37
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,480
(If I marry her now,)

38
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,810
(wouldn't that 800 million become mine?)

39
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,780
Tianyu.

40
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,729
Can you break up with Ye Wei?

41
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,780
What?

42
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,689
You know what kind of person she is.

43
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,640
Why are you still with her?

44
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,840
Come back to me. Please?

45
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,910
I'm scared

46
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,940
to be alone.

47
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,340
But

48
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,440
if you really don't want to,

49
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:19,210
I won't force you.

50
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:21,180
I have to go.

51
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,610
Wait.

52
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,410
Give me some time.

53
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,080
I'll sort things out.

54
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,810
You saw it all, huh?

55
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,380
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,480
I won't let

57
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,659
any other man

58
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,589
get close to you ever again.

59
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,280
From now on,
I only want you smelling like me.

60
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,780
Aren't you a childish one?

61
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,740
Tianyu.

62
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,710
You coming over tonight?

63
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,280
I was just about to contact you.

64
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,510
Things might have gotten a lot simpler.

65
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,559
I just met with Shu Yan.

66
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,810
She and Shen Weizhou broke up.

67
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,510
She got a huge payout from him,

68
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,540
so

69
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,480
I'm going to marry her.

70
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:34,640
All you have to do is take care
of Ye Qiang and Pei Juan.

71
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,280
Got it.

72
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,210
Shu Yan and Shen Weizhou split up.

73
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,240
Looks like

74
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,510
they're making new moves.

75
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,540
Look into it.

76
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,780
Oh,

77
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,680
and get rid of those two.

78
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,729
Only the dead

79
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,580
can keep secrets.

80
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,510
I don't think we need to go that far.

81
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,710
We've already arranged
for them to leave the country.

82
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,680
Don't question my orders.

83
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:09,780
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,689
I've been thinking.

85
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,140
We should get a divorce.

86
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,110
We don't have kids anyway.

87
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,089
And

88
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,680
I want to continue as a celebrity.

89
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,280
Getting exposed as someone
who married young isn't a good look.

90
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,080
You met with Shu Yan, didn't you?

91
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,710
No.

92
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,740
Why would I meet with her?

93
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,980
Tianyu.

94
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,129
What?

95
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,429
Please don't divorce me.

96
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,059
If you leave me,

97
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,880
I...

98
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,159
I'll be miserable.

99
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,440
You can't just abandon me, Tianyu.

100
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,710
Think about it.

101
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:07,410
I'll stay with a friend for a few days.

102
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,310
Watching someone die for the first time.

103
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,810
It's not as dramatic as I expected.

104
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,410
It's been a whole day.
Still no word from him.

105
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,489
Tianyu.

106
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,640
Shu Yan.

107
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:50,680
Do you have time to meet today?

108
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:53,710
I've decided. I'm divorcing Ye Wei.

109
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,759
Let's make today

110
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,189
the day we found our way
back to each other,

111
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,129
okay?

112
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,010
Mm.

113
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,880
Well,

114
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,940
see you soon.

115
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,140
Okay.

116
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,240
Weizhou.

117
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,529
I've confirmed it.

118
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,880
The woman Han Tianyu is cheating with
is Mengya.

119
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,529
I've already sent the red high heels

120
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,110
to her place.

121
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,810
You have two options.

122
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,040
Help me

123
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,540
or go down with her.

124
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,710
You're smart.

125
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,080
I'm sure you know what to do.

126
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,880
What exactly do you want me to do?

127
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,540
Miss.

128
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,540
What's that?

129
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,140
It's from the brand
you used to endorse. High heels.

130
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,340
Not bad.

131
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,559
(Han Tianyu,)

132
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,659
(I've thought it over.)

133
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,440
(Let's not meet again.)

134
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,059
Nice place you picked.

135
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,880
Right? I took my time choosing it.

136
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,640
It's great for pictures.

137
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,140
Let me get one of you.

138
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:06,359
(Why?)

139
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,559
(Can't see me tonight?)

140
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,429
(That's okay.)

141
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,029
(Tomorrow or the weekend works.)

142
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,540
(I'll wait until you're free.)

143
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,729
(I guess you didn't get the message.)

144
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,729
(You're manipulative,
unfaithful, greedy,)

145
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,329
(and you tried to go after
your family's insurance money.)

146
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,029
(You don't deserve me.)

147
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,459
(Stop being delusional.)

148
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,540
(Goodbye. Forever.)

149
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,440
Shu Yan.

150
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,140
You crazy woman!

151
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,910
You were just messing with me?

152
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,740
No idea.

153
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,410
What's the matter with him?
He's got a bad temper.

154
00:07:51,964 --> 00:07:53,810
(Wei)
(Okay. Let's get divorced.)

155
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,240
Hello?

156
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,080
Is this Wu Mengya?

157
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,010
This is Ye Wei speaking.

158
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,059
You don't have to come so often.

159
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,240
You're busy enough as it is.

160
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,489
Director Bai's been handling

161
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:30,440
the divorce stuff for you.

162
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,640
You don't need to worry.

163
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,029
From what he says,

164
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,029
my husband still refuses
a mutual divorce.

165
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,640
Guess I'll have to take it to court.

166
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,259
Yes.

167
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,540
It's a bit of a mess.

168
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,380
Director Bai's been running around
helping you.

169
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,359
It's obvious he really cares about you.

170
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,629
Actually,

171
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,210
he was my first love.

172
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,910
No way, really?

173
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,489
We couldn't be together back then

174
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,880
because of our families.

175
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:54,189
Then...

176
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,259
Then maybe this time,

177
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,329
you should hold on tight
to your shot at happiness.

178
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,959
But with how my health is now,

179
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,640
I don't want to drag anyone down.

180
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,680
He deserves better.

181
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,910
Don't say that.

182
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,889
Your bad luck is almost over.

183
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:10,010
Just trust me.

184
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,140
Mm.

185
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,489
Shu Yan.

186
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,510
You're here.

187
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,210
Well,

188
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,889
I'll leave Huiting with you,

189
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,910
Director Bai.

190
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:24,759
I'm heading out.

191
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,289
Okay.

192
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,729
I'll come visit again soon.

193
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,489
Be safe on the road.

194
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,129
Mm.

195
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,080
Bye.

196
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,310
Thanks for everything.

197
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,929
I'm at the parking lot.

198
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,729
Where are you?

199
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:38,659
Traffic's a little heavy.

200
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,489
I'm almost there.

201
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,880
Give me five more minutes.

202
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,659
Okay.

203
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,689
Don't hurry.

204
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,429
Just drive safe.

205
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,289
Got it. Wait for me.

206
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,110
Mm.

207
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,889
Shu Yan!

208
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:55,580
How dare you play me like that!

209
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,210
Let go of me!

210
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,689
Let me go!

211
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,710
What?

212
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,080
Scared now?

213
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,440
Then why'd you mess with my feelings?

214
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,080
Do you have any idea?

215
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,140
I wanted to get back with you.

216
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:12,610
I wanted to treat you right.

217
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,759
You were trying to kill me!

218
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,459
You lied to me!

219
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,510
You treated me like I was garbage!

220
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,959
You knew

221
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,380
I was drowning in debt.

222
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,189
And you?

223
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,159
What did you do?

224
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:27,889
You dumped me

225
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,480
onto Ye Wei

226
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,359
and went chasing after some rich guy!

227
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,780
That was your choice.

228
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,380
I just let it happen.

229
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,929
The two of you
should've been gone a long time ago.

230
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,380
Gone?

231
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:42,729
You're the one who's finished!

232
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:44,440
Die!

233
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,710
(Is this it?)

234
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:53,910
(Does my story have to end
with me being killed by Han Tianyu?)

235
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,059
Shu Yan!

236
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,040
Shu Yan!

237
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:02,559
Shu Yan!

238
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,359
Yan!

239
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,210
Yan!

240
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,410
Yan!

241
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,080
Weizhou.

242
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,710
The police will be here soon.

243
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,959
Her pulse and breathing
are back to normal.

244
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,440
Slight fever.

245
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,059
We'll be back to check on her

246
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,329
when she wakes up.

247
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,110
I'll write up the diagnosis.

248
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,529
Thank you, doctor.

249
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,340
Mm.

250
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,910
Drink some water.

251
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:38,259
The police confirmed

252
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,459
Han Tianyu attacked first.

253
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,210
They're recognizing you
for your heroic deed.

254
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,429
You're a public figure.

255
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,340
I recommend you lay low
at home for a few days.

256
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,489
Han Tianyu will probably
be out in a week.

257
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:49,480
Got it.

258
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,659
Where's Shu Yan?

259
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,529
Already discharged.

260
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,680
She was in a rush to go home.
Huiting sent her back.

261
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,110
All right.

262
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,480
Let's split up.

263
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,880
I'll go check on Shu Yan.

264
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,689
You dig into whether Han Tianyu's
paid off his loan sharks.

265
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:00,929
Mm.

266
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,129
If he hasn't,

267
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,210
lean on them a little.

268
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,780
He sure was thirsty.

269
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,080
Got it.

270
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,340
How's Shu Yan?

271
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,659
Not great.

272
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,859
There's nothing in the house.

273
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,340
I was going to buy some groceries
and cook for her.

274
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,489
You should get some rest.

275
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,659
- I'll stay and look after her.
- I'll leave her to you.

276
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,510
Mm.

277
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,140
You okay?

278
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,480
I'm sorry.

279
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,340
I was late.

280
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,359
(Don't worry.)

281
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,459
(I've arranged everything.)

282
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,480
(You'll lay low abroad for a while.)

283
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,380
(We're grateful for everything.)

284
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,610
(Just be prepared.
The boat ride might be tough.)

285
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,810
(That's fine.)

286
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,489
(We didn't even
finish the job properly.)

287
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,480
(If I had one more chance,)

288
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,959
(I swear I'd floor it)

289
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,340
(and run her over.)

290
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,510
When you're desperate,

291
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,680
the only insurance you have

292
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,480
is leverage.

293
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,080
Cut to the chase.

294
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,510
What do you want?

295
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,040
The question is,

296
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:31,310
what do you have to offer?

297
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:44,489
Those bums

298
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,740
should just know their place.

299
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,659
Has the body been found?

300
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,810
Not yet.

301
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,580
Can't keep Ye Wei
and Han Tianyu alive either.

302
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,140
Take care of them both.

303
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:58,180
Understood.

304
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,030
(Han Tianyu)

305
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:07,889
Yes?

306
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,529
Hello?

307
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,629
I'm at the police station.

308
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:09,929
What?

309
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:10,859
Can you do me a favor?

310
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,240
The police station?

311
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,959
Idiot!

312
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,210
Can't you use your brain for once?

313
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,489
If the plan had actually worked, fine.

314
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,110
But look at the mess you've made.

315
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,410
I just lost it. I couldn't help myself.

316
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,310
By the way,

317
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,910
your wife came by yesterday
and threatened me.

318
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,759
She can be intimidating.

319
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,780
What?

320
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,359
What did she say?

321
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,440
She said

322
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,110
if you divorce her,

323
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:35,210
she won't go down alone.

324
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,640
She'll take you with her.

325
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,310
She's lost her mind!

326
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:45,559
I've got to go.

327
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,489
My mom's calling.

328
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,940
I'll call you back later.

329
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,980
Han Tianyu!

330
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,510
Why didn't you answer your phone?

331
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,510
Why are you running?

332
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:04,480
Do you know how long
you've been overdue?

333
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:12,180
Get him!

334
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:12,959
Not the face!

335
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,240
I'll teach you a lesson!

336
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,480
Where's our money?

337
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,880
Those brutes.

338
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,740
I told them to spare my face.

339
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,440
I live off this face.

340
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,110
Where did Ye Wei stash the money?

341
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,780
Where else could it be?

342
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,210
Nothing here either.

343
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:14,259
10, 100, 1000, 10000...

344
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,740
200,000?

345
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,059
(Shen Weizhou)

346
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,440
Shen Weizhou?

347
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,040
Why'd he suddenly contact me?

348
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,629
We haven't met in a while.

349
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,540
Why did you want to meet?

350
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,129
I heard you've had

351
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:52,680
a rough time lately.

352
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,880
Things haven't been easy, huh?

353
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:58,940
Yes.

354
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,840
Things are pretty messy.

355
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,540
I'm divorcing Han Tianyu.

356
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,110
And

357
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:09,180
I betrayed my best friend.

358
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,340
Maybe it's karma.

359
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:15,459
Did you consider

360
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,010
killing Shu Yan?

361
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,610
Relax.

362
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,810
I've thought about
offing Han Tianyu myself.

363
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:25,040
Especially after I found out
they got back together.

364
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,140
They're getting back together?

365
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,210
Let's ruin them.

366
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,429
I can give you

367
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,189
the time and place of their next date.

368
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:36,680
If you want,

369
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,840
I can even hook you up
with the best lawyer.

370
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:39,729
You'll get

371
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,540
the compensation you deserve.

372
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,510
Why help me?

373
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,140
It sucks, doesn't it?

374
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,680
Having your whole life
fall apart like that?

375
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,510
If you settle peacefully,

376
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,040
you'll get nothing.

377
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,140
That's true.

378
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,410
But

379
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,010
what do you want?

380
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,880
Shu Yan.

381
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,340
She'll only come back to me

382
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,240
once she's completely broken.

383
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,410
Why does it

384
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,180
have to be her?

385
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,380
Do you really hate me that much?

386
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,229
Yes.

387
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,329
I despise

388
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,959
those who leech off others.

389
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,229
You don't even know me.

390
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,710
How can you judge me?

391
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,440
Anyway,

392
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:39,380
I've said what I needed to say.

393
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,689
Think it over and call me

394
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,740
