00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,460
(Every Trajectory Is You)

3
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,540
=Episode 31=

4
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:01,790
(Where are you?)

5
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,040
(Weren't you supposed
to pick me up at the airport?)

6
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,620
Shen Jiao?

7
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,090
What were you doing back there?

8
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,820
Oh, I get it now.

9
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,490
You wanted to prank me, didn't you?

10
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,950
Of course not!

11
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,199
I just

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,639
fell asleep

13
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,020
while waiting for you.

14
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,550
What kind of assistant
sleeps on the job?

15
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,299
Well, since you brought it up,

16
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,790
I guess I should report
your schedule for this week.

17
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,269
The crew will resume
filming domestically

18
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,999
in a week.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,939
Before that,

20
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,099
you've got a Men's Style magazine shoot,

21
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,499
a Beichen Watches launch event,

22
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,069
and...

23
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,069
Wait.

24
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,569
That sounds like nothing

25
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,190
but endless work.

26
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,420
Maybe I should just
go back to being a chef.

27
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,839
The second season of the gourmet reality show
is also getting finalized this week.

28
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,739
So you might be

29
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,769
a chef again

30
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,269
sooner than you think.

31
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:04,290
That's not what I meant.

32
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:05,869
Forget it.

33
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,950
Let's not talk about work.

34
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,990
How's Shu Yan doing with your brother?

35
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,490
They're doing great.

36
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,190
Ever since he got out of the hospital,

37
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,820
he's been glued to Yan
every second of the day.

38
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,120
Oh.

39
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,669
And

40
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,720
what about you?

41
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,550
What about me?

42
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,469
Well,

43
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,920
Yan and Weizhou found their happiness.

44
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,099
Don't you think it's time

45
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,950
you thought about yours too?

46
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,790
Maybe

47
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,339
you could

48
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,320
like me?

49
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,390
I mean,

50
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,990
I like you.

51
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,650
Could you maybe like me back?

52
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,450
Aw, man.

53
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,550
I finally mustered
the courage to confess.

54
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,150
Am I getting rejected already?

55
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,369
When did they start having a thing?

56
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,069
A while ago.

57
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,520
- I had a feeling something was going on.
- You didn't notice?

58
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,420
So you two

59
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,899
are officially together now?

60
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:29,769
Yes.

61
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:32,439
I've had feelings
for Shen Jiao for a while now.

62
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,650
Didn't expect her

63
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,950
to be the one to confess first.

64
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,539
Man.

65
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,390
I really thought
I was going to get rejected.

66
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,539
Turns out

67
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,239
I caught happiness just in time.

68
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,269
In that case,

69
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,250
pick a day next week to visit Grandpa

70
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:45,920
and set a wedding date.

71
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:46,899
Yan,

72
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,969
when are you and my brother
getting married?

73
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,739
Grown-up stuff, kid. Stay out of it.

74
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,790
Now, sit down and let's eat.

75
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,790
Let's eat.

76
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,269
Let's do a toast

77
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,239
together.

78
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,450
Celebrate a little.

79
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,390
Here.

80
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,920
To

81
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,369
new beginnings.

82
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:04,139
To

83
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,269
a successful divorce.

84
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,699
To love finally happening.

85
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,490
Here, here.

86
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,920
Cheers!

87
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,139
Don't drink too much.

88
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,950
You just had surgery.

89
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,969
It's fine.

90
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:14,990
Just a sip.

91
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,190
Mr. Bai,

92
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,520
why are you always
hovering around Huiting?

93
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,499
Do you like her

94
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,369
or something?

95
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:22,620
Of course not.

96
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,739
Let me be clarify.

97
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,769
I'm not here because of Huiting.

98
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,020
I'm here working for Mr. Shen.

99
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,790
I don't remember that.

100
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,699
My job is to make sure
the boss's family

101
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,090
keeps their mouths shut.

102
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,690
Right?

103
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,890
Let's eat.

104
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,490
Let's eat.

105
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,269
There was thunder just now.

106
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,669
It might rain soon.

107
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:53,039
Be careful on the way back.

108
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,090
Don't worry.

109
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:54,899
Bye.

110
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,499
Bye-bye.

111
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,299
Bye.

112
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,139
Take care.

113
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:57,639
See you.

114
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,720
Stay safe.

115
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,750
It's just the two of us now.

116
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,090
Mm.

117
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,790
What do you think you're doing?

118
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,439
Well, it looks like

119
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,769
it's about to rain.

120
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,590
So...

121
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,139
You're not going home?

122
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,420
You drove here.

123
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,920
I just ordered you a driver service.
Time to go.

124
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,150
Can't I stay for the night?

125
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,420
See you tomorrow!

126
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:29,220
I'll see you tomorrow. Bye!

127
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,339
Shu Yan,

128
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,199
when we get married,

129
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,750
I'm going to be with you
every single day.

130
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,450
Shu Yan.

131
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,950
You're not leaving me behind

132
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,690
to be happy on your own.

133
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,020
Ye Wei.

134
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,250
Shu Yan.

135
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,690
You look way too happy

136
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,720
while I'm living like trash.

137
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,120
What makes you deserve happiness?

138
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,150
Are you going to burn me alive?

139
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,920
Bingo.

140
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,550
As your friend,

141
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,090
I came to send you off one last time.

142
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,720
Han Tianyu is waiting for you
on the other side.

143
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,469
I'm giving

144
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,350
your man back to you.

145
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,350
So you two can be a lovely couple

146
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,420
down there.

147
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,950
Shu Yan.

148
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,520
Aren't I good to you?

149
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,190
You killed Han Tianyu.

150
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,750
Yes.

151
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,320
I killed him.

152
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,390
But I didn't mean to.

153
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:15,390
You know what?

154
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,439
If I hadn't killed him,

155
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,050
he was going to kill me.

156
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:21,990
He even took out
an insurance policy on me.

157
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,690
If he managed to kill me,

158
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,420
he'd get 500 million.

159
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,690
A scumbag like him

160
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,890
deserved to die!

161
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,490
Wei.

162
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,250
Turn yourself in.

163
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,190
Don't keep going down this road.

164
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,390
Shu Yan.

165
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,120
I am turning myself in.

166
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,120
But...

167
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,750
Not before I kill you first.

168
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,550
Then I'll go to the police and say,

169
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,339
"Sorry, officer.

170
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,550
It was an accident."

171
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:14,939
"I didn't mean

172
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,339
to kill

173
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,950
Han Tianyu."

174
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:27,150
The police will believe me.

175
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,790
And by the way,

176
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,490
I also took out
an insurance policy on him.

177
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,920
So once

178
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,420
I'm out of prison in a few years,

179
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,290
I'll be rich

180
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,350
and set for life.

181
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,420
Perfect plan, right?

182
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:50,750
Han Tianyu was trash.

183
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,920
But what does that make you?

184
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,090
You two will do anything for money.

185
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,550
Do lives mean nothing to you?

186
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,520
Shut up!

187
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:10,550
Always pretending
to be some innocent little angel.

188
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,720
Like you're the only one
who's kind and pure?

189
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,469
I'm the bad one, huh?

190
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,550
Well, I hate people like you!

191
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,990
Even facing death,

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,850
you're still putting on
that "I'm so kind" act.

193
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,620
But it's okay.

194
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,290
It's almost over.

195
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,050
Want to hear some good news?

196
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,699
Tomorrow morning,
you'll be on the front page.

197
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,420
"Tragedy. Woman dies in accidental fire

198
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,620
after gathering with friends."

199
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,850
"Unattended candle burns carpet,

200
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:46,750
home caught fire."

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,220
It's over.

202
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:57,950
Everything's over.

203
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,190
Why are you laughing?

204
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,690
Why am I laughing?

205
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,790
You really thought
I didn't come prepared?

206
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,139
I just recorded everything.

207
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,320
Your confession

208
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,069
about killing Han Tianyu

209
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,090
and trying

210
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,550
to set me on fire.

211
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,120
Enjoy the rest of your life in prison.

212
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,969
Wench!

213
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,950
I'll kill you!

214
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,569
You're not getting another chance.

215
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,520
I won't let you hurt me ever again.

216
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,690
Ye Wei's been taken away by the police.

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,050
Are you okay?

218
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,550
Is it

219
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,290
really over this time?

220
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,820
It's over.

221
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,150
You changed your fate.

222
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,020
There won't be any more trouble.

223
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,950
Weizhou.

224
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,650
Out of respect

225
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,999
for Mengya's late grandfather

226
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,650
and father,

227
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,650
let's give her one last chance.

228
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,790
I'll revoke her proxy shares

229
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,790
in Norran Entertainment.

230
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,690
Soon,

231
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,339
our company's foundation

232
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,520
will send

233
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,190
a volunteer team

234
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,869
to Africa.

235
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,199
Sounds like

236
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,469
they plan to have her lead the team,

237
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:52,850
do volunteer work,

238
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,699
and give back a little.

239
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,750
What do you think?

240
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,669
Grandpa,

241
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,090
she's not going to appreciate it.

242
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:08,020
That old geezer not only took my shares,

243
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,339
now he wants to ship me off
to Africa to be a volunteer?

244
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,420
In his dreams!

245
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,550
Book me a ticket

246
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,620
back to the US now.

247
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,750
Ye Wei's been arrested.

248
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,869
She could rat me out at any moment.

249
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,690
No way.

250
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,699
I have to lay low in the US.

251
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,590
Miss,

252
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,390
you should turn yourself in.

253
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,120
What did you say?

254
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,350
I said book me a plane ticket!
Didn't you hear me?

255
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,400
Shen Weizhou already brought Ye Qiang
and Pei Juan to the police station.

256
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,800
The cops are on their way here now.

257
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:35,050
What?

258
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,690
They're alive?

259
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,520
It was you.

260
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,220
You didn't kill them, did you?

261
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,120
No, I didn't.

262
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,720
Why would you betray me?

263
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,199
If I hadn't picked you off the streets,

264
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,969
you'd still be a homeless nobody.

265
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,020
You ungrateful mutt!

266
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,620
I'm sorry, Miss.

267
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,639
You already have the kind of life
most people can only dream of.

268
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,240
Why ruin it all
by doing such awful things?

269
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,160
I didn't want to watch you
spiral like this.

270
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:02,739
I was wrong?

271
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,350
They're the ones who were wrong!

272
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,190
It's Shu Yan!

273
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,639
Why does she get everything?

274
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,720
She took Shen Weizhou from me.

275
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,950
She took the shares
that should've been mine.

276
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,899
If my grandfather and father

277
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,769
hadn't died in that car crash years ago,

278
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,499
that old Shen

279
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,650
would've never become chairman.

280
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,320
He's the one who should've died

281
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,699
in that crash!

282
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,720
The Shen family owes me!

283
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,750
I can't get caught.

284
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,590
I won't get caught.

285
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,990
No...

286
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,720
It wasn't supposed to end like this...

287
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,650
Shu Yan!

288
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,069
Shu Yan!

289
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:18,620
You don't get to be happy!

290
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,420
You can't be happy!

291
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,190
Why is it so dark in here?

292
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,350
I need to find Shu Yan.

293
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,169
Please let me out!

294
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,520
I need to find Shu Yan!

295
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,560
(Tomb of Beloved Grandfather Shu Moshan)

296
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,190
Grandfather.

297
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,669
This is Shen Weizhou.

298
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,090
He's the man I love.

299
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,539
I brought him

300
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:42,090
to see you.

301
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,390
Grandfather.

302
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,790
Please rest assured.

303
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,120
I'll protect Shu Yan
with everything I have.

304
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,320
I won't let anything
ever hurt her again.

305
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,950
In my last life, I lost you.

306
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,490
In this life,

307
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,220
I'm not letting you go.

308
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,990
Finding you again

309
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,739
felt like coming home

310
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,320
after a long, hard journey.

311
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,550

312

and full of obstacles.

313
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,990
