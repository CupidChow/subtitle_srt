4
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,290
Sorry.

5
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,939
I wanted to ask...

6
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,839
I've never liked you.

7
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,620
I...

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,639
Just now...

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,369
That...

10
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,790
It was a mistake.

11
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,420
But

12
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:58,150
I liked you before.

13
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,769
So, I...

14
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,750
Sorry.

15
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,150
I'm really sorry

16
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,590
for what happened just now.

17
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,050
Let me answer this.

18
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,190
Hello, Mr. Shen.

19
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,090
Sorry

20
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,939
for calling you so late at night.

21
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,139
However, there's a problem
at the exhibition venue.

22
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,790
I might need you to resolve the issue.

23
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,099
No problem.

24
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,490
I should be there in 30 minutes.

25
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:35,590
All right.

26
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,620
I'll wait for you.

27
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,099
Sorry.

28
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,139
I have something to do.

29
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,490
I'll be leaving then.

30
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,290
How has my fiance

31
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,850
been doing lately?

32
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,569
The people we sent to investigate him
were discovered.

33
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,789
He has discussed the cancellation
of the marriage with Chairman Shen.

34
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:12,869
Cancellation?

35
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,750
Yes.

36
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,739
Seems like it's time

37
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,320
to go back and meet my fiance.

38
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:25,239
A group of two-faced women.

39
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,650
They are crazy!

40
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,320
Why did they treat me like that?

41
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,239
Ye Wei,

42
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,290
you've always been framing Shu Yan.

43
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,020
All of you were fooled by your lies.

44
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,039
What are you doing?

45
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,069
Try experiencing

46
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,920
how Shu Yan was bullied by us.

47
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:42,620
It's all Shu Yan's fault.

48
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,590
Pick up.

49
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,899
Pick up.

50
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,990
Pick up!

51
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,920
Why would Chu Chen
appear at a time like this?

52
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,420
Why?

53
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:05,680
(2020 Yitian
Beauty and Fashion Product Launch)

54
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,390
Mr. Shen.

55
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,639
Sorry, Mr. Shen.

56
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,820
I am late.

57
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,850
Is there a problem with the venue?

58
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,820
There was a problem

59
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,200
when the workers set up your venue
according to your designs.

60
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,840
You might need to make some adjustments.

61
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,990
You know

62
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,720
I'm a perfectionist.

63
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,899
I don't want any flaws in the events

64
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,120
I'm involved in.

65
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,090
I'll make the amendments immediately.

66
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:39,620
Shu Yan.

67
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,320
Thanks for your hard work.

68
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,390
Not at all.

69
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,820
You just need
to change a little over here.

70
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,320
Move this board over there.

71
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,520
Boss, what do you think
of my arrangements?

72
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,099
Not bad.

73
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,950
You may go back.

74
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,920
Sure.

75
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,620
I will leave you two alone.

76
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,020

He might not be as good as you think.

I'm telling you.

Don't speak to me
in this tone again in the future!

113
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,420
Help.

114
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,339
Say it!

115
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,220
Do you like Shen Weizhou?

116
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,239

(Han Tianyu)

119
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,820
(is a demon.)

120
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:14,620
(It seems like Han Tianyu
is really important to her.)

121
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,990
(I must think of a way
to show him Han Tianyu's true colours.)

122
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,390
Do you believe in time travel?

123
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:30,990
Do you believe it?

124
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,290
Perhaps.

125
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,050
I'm just thinking

126
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,150
that if something like that happens,

127
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,890
what will you do?

128
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,090
(Should I tell him?)

129
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,620
(Forget it.)

130
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,090
(I'm sure he won't believe me)

131
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,020
(even if I tell him.)

132
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,090
(He'll only think
that something's wrong with me.)

133
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,120
I want

134
00:07:57,883 --> 00:07:59,520
to live confidently and happily.

135
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,720
You can already choose

136
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,620
a confident and happy life now.

137
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:11,990
We are here.

138
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:16,220
(Looking at her.)

139
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,990
(It seems like she has experienced
what I did in my previous life.)

140
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,939
Mr. Shen,

141
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,790
I don't feel like going home now.

142
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,590
I'm a little hungry.

143
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,220
Didn't we just eat?

144
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,420
I have a big appetite

145
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,990
and get hungry easily.

146
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,720
I'll bring you to eat something nice.

147
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,690
All right.

148
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,790
Ye Wei?

149
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,469
Tianyu.

150
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,690
What's wrong with you?

151
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,350
Why are you here?

152
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,369
(I'm sure)

153
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,950
(they are together now.)

154
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,820
Which one do you want?

155
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,220
Today is a memorable day.

156
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,350
I'll have some alcohol.

157
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,590
This one.

158
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,350
Thank you for always helping me.

159
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,669
It's fine

160
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,069
as long as you think

161
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,850
the decision you make is good for you.

162
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,650
That's so despicable.

163
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,450
How could they treat you like this?

164
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,420
Shu Yan as well.

165
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:45,220
How could she abandon you?

166
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,890
Let me call her.

167
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,420
Don't call her.

168
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:54,120
She wouldn't answer when I called her.

169
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,320
This is not her fault.

170
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,420
I think

171
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,350
she misunderstood as well.

172
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,220
It's fine.

173
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,969
I'll just wait for her

174
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,720
downstairs at her home.

175
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,390
But you'll catch a cold.

176
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,320
I came here to look for Shu Yan too.

177
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,620
Wear my jacket for now.

178
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,850
It's fine.

179
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:36,320
Then...

180
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,669
Let's find a hotel nearby.

181
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,120
You can take a hot shower

182
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,890
and get changed.

183
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:44,390
You can't just sit here and wait.

184
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,490
All right?

185
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,650
You can put this on.

186
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,220
I'm fine.

187
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,720
In the past, I used to think

188
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,420
that I was someone
who floated on the ocean.

189
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,090
I had nothing else besides a buoy.

190
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,120
I could only swim as hard as I could

191
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,550
with the buoy

192
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,099
but I could never

193
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,190
find a lifeboat to save myself.

194
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,099
However, it's different now.

195
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,190
Now,

196
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,820
I can swim to shore

197
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,020
with my hard work.

198
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,869
What do you want to do

199
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,050
after you are on the shore?

200
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,299
I want to get a raise and promotion.

201
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,790
I want to make a lot of money.

202
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,590
Buy a house with full payment.

203
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,150
Keep a cat as a pet.

204
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,539
When I'm free,

205
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,539
I can play with the cat,

206
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,299
nurture plants,

207
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,390
and read books.

208
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,769
I also hope I can have more time

209
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,820
to travel around the world often.

210
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,990
I also want to learn how to bake.

211
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:52,890
That's right.

212
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,490
I also want to learn self-defense arts.

213
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,820
You like being a busybody, right?

214
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,620
You don't look too awesome now.

215
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,699
You're such a busybody.

216
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,890
Someone!

217
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,120
They are beating someone!

218
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,550
Police, come here!

219
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,490
In the name of the Moon,
I'll punish you!
