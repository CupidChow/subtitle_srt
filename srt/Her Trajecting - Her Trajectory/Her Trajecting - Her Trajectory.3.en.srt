1
00:00:50,599 --> 00:00:51,159
Wei

2
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,159
Why are you here?

3
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,159
Previously

4
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,200
Ye Wei took my project proposal

5
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:58,159
and went to Wang Xu to take my spot

6
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,560
then successfully got promoted to artist project planner

7
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,240
Mr. Wang

8
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,480
I came to show you a project proposal

9
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,400
You know,

10
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,239
I don't want to always be just an artist assistant

11
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:13,680
Mr. Wang

12
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:17,720
Can you give me a chance?

13
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,839
Let me also participate in the planning

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Isn't this Shu Yan's project proposal?

15
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:25,199
Yes

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,400
Actually, I think

17
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,519
her project proposal is quite good

18
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,040
just a few points need to be changed

19
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:35,720
This weekend

20
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:37,599
Can you give me a chance?

21
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,879
Let me say something.

22
00:01:48,839 --> 00:01:50,160
The purpose of this meeting

23
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,000
is mainly to discuss

24
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:54,040
the artists from Nuoran Entertainment Group

25
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:55,599
and the Yitian brand

26
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,919
business cooperation project plan.

27
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,080
This plan

28
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,680
was mainly created by Ye Wei.

29
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,319
I have reviewed it.

30
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,599
It's very good.

31
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:05,360
So I have decided

32
00:02:06,199 --> 00:02:07,120
that this event

33
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,320
will be managed by Ye Wei.

34
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,880
Of course.

35
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:12,639
What about Ye Wei?

36
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:14,919
She has always been an artist assistant.

37
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,720
But our company has always upheld

38
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:20,320
the principle of not wasting talent.

39
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,839
We need to give more opportunities to newcomers.

40
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,320
All the seniors present,

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,440
please assist Ye Wei more.

42
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,800
Thank you, President Wang, for the opportunity.

43
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,479
Yes.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,080
I also hope everyone

45
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,320
will take good care of her.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,520
Yes.

47
00:02:41,679 --> 00:02:42,440
Teacher Shen,

48
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,520
why are you here?

49
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,720
I heard you got me a new business endorsement.

50
00:02:46,119 --> 00:02:46,839
Let me see the plan.

51
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:48,160
Here it is.

52
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,080
Please take a look.

53
00:02:56,399 --> 00:02:57,039
Not bad

54
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,639
Who's in charge

55
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:03,000
Teacher Shen

56
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,119
It's me

57
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,279
Aren't you an assistant

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,520
Wang Xu

59
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,080
Such an important event

60
00:03:08,279 --> 00:03:09,240
You handed it to a newcomer

61
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:11,960
Mr. Shen

62
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,039
This plan

63
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,000
was made by Ye Wei

64
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,080
So I think

65
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,240
Ye Wei should be in charge of this event

66
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,479
It's very appropriate

67
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,240
Talking on paper and actual practice are two different things

68
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,880
I don't want the business event I endorse

69
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,039
to have any mistakes

70
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,679
affecting my public image

71
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,000
Yes, yes, yes

72
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:32,679
Alright

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,399
Shu Yan

74
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,199
Yang Huiting

75
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,160
You two have been in the project department for five years

76
00:03:37,279 --> 00:03:38,960
You've planned many events, big and small

77
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,360
This event

78
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,039
will be handled by you

79
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,440
So I

80
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:49,240
You

81
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,080
should just

82
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,399
learn on-site

83
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:53,960
As a person

84
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,320
you can't step on your seniors' heads

85
00:03:56,399 --> 00:03:57,520
to reach the top in one step, right?

86
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,000
Everyone

87
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,440
Any other opinions?

88
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:06,600
No

89
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,000
No, no

90
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,839
Meeting adjourned.

91
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,480
Group Leader Yang

92
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,320
I look forward to your guidance in the future.

93
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,640
Let's work hard together.

94
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:38,559
Yes.

95
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,279
Wang Xu has a crush on Ye Wei

96
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,399
So he will always be used by Ye Wei

97
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,239
If I can get Yang Huiting to help me against Wang Xu

98
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,119
Ye Wei will have one less helper

99
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,799
But why does Shen Weizhou

100
00:05:12,799 --> 00:05:14,359
frequently appear around me

101
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,440
You're back

102
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,279
Why are you here

103
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,359
Xiaoyan

104
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:25,399
Don't be mad at me, okay

105
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,399
I know

106
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,399
I've been neglecting you lately

107
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,640
Tonight

108
00:05:30,359 --> 00:05:31,600
I will make it up to you

109
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,000
Tianyu

110
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:39,640
I

111
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,440
I am

112
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,519
a bit tired today

113
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,880
How about we reschedule?

114
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,040
I

115
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,119
I have a lot of work at the company tomorrow

116
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,079
We

117
00:05:49,359 --> 00:05:50,799
Let's reschedule

118
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:53,399
No

119
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,480
Tianyu

120
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,000
Since you want to do something exciting

121
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:59,079
Tianyu

122
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,880
Listen to me

123
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,839
Tomorrow I

124
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,839
I really have a lot of things to do

125
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:05,160
Let's reschedule

126
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,640
Really, let's reschedule

127
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:08,959
Reschedule, reschedule

128
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,399
Who is it in the middle of the night?

129
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,279
Buzzkill

130
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:22,880
Who are you?

131
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:24,600
Hello

132
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:25,519
I'm from property management

133
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,559
I heard your house is leaking

134
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,480
Our house isn't leaking

135
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:28,559
Go check somewhere else

136
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:29,920
Wearing a hat in the middle of the night

137
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,079
Wearing a mask

138
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,079
You don't look like a good person

139
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:32,799
Get out

140
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,720
Check next door

141
00:06:37,359 --> 00:06:38,000
Shu Yan

142
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,279
Why are you running?

143
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,399
We can't stay here any longer.

144
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,480
We need to get them together as soon as possible.

145
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,440
Ye Wei

146
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,320
Tian Yu

147
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,000
The door is closing, hurry up.

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,559
Don't push.

149
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,440
Did I push you?

150
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:40,920
No.

151
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,040
We're here.

152
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:49,359
Hurry up.

153
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,799
Then I'll go find Shuyan first.

154
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,440
Why does she get a good boyfriend?

155
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,679
A good job

156
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,600
It's all Shuyan's.

157
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,320
Would you like some coffee?

158
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,000
Thank you.

159
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:24,640
I should be the one thanking you.

160
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:25,799
Shu Yan.

161
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:26,399
Yang Huiting.

162
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,480
You two have been in the project department for five years now.

163
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,279
You've planned many events, big and small.

164
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,679
This event,

165
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,359
will be handled by you.

166
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,719
No need to thank me.

167
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,479
I'm just giving you what you deserve.

168
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:41,679
How about it?

169
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:43,840
Have you decided to join my team?

170
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,919
Thank you for your appreciation.

171
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:49,640
But,

172
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,599
I still want to rely on myself.

173
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,479
Only what you strive for yourself,

174
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,440
will last long.

175
00:08:56,599 --> 00:08:57,440
This time,

176
00:08:58,119 --> 00:08:58,919
I want to change.

177
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,080
I want to live again.

178
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,760
That's a good decision.

179
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:07,359
You will definitely be happy.

180
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,520
Are you free this weekend?

181
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,200
Free

182
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:13,440
this weekend

183
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,599
let's have a meal together

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,520
Sure

185
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,880
Xiao Yan has already made plans with me this week

186
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:22,799
Did you forget?

187
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,200
I've already booked Jiangning Hotel

188
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,239
Jiangning Hotel

189
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,280
Since you have already made plans,

190
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,320
we'll arrange another time.

191
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,559
Okay.

192
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:49,880
Shu Yan

193
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:52,159
When did you get so close with Shen Weizhou?

194
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:53,559
He helped me.

195
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,559
It's only right that I treat him to a meal.

196
00:09:56,719 --> 00:09:58,640
Can you talk to him about it?

197
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,080
Let me join this brand event too.

198
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,960
I really want to join.

199
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,479
I haven't asked you yet.

200
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,239
Why did you say the plan I made

201
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,599
was made by you?

202
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,760
Didn't you just make Wang Esq. angry?

203
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,679
If we say this plan was made by you now,

204
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:16,960
he definitely won't approve it.

205
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,320
Besides,

206
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,320
what's mine is yours,

207
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,479
and what's yours is mine.

208
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,919
Seriously,

209
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,080
I think from now on,

210
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:27,640
we should draw clear boundaries.

211
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,960
Help me investigate someone

212
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,760
I will send you the information
