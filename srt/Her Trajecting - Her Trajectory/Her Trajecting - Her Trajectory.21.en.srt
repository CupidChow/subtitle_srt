=Episode 21=

4
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,630
In any case,

5
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,400
if you can take good care
of your husband,

6
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:48,770
raise your children well,

7
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:50,500
and balance both work and life,

8
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,300
then you'll be worthy of marrying

9
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,530
into the Han family.

10
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,100
Are you finished, ma'am?

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,300
I'm done.

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,530
Thirsty?

13
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:02,200
Have some water.

14
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,600
Dear...

15
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,230
You brat!

16
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,330
You clumsy ox!

17
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:13,870
Mom.

18
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:15,000
Everything all right, Mom?

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,630
I've had enough of you, ma'am.

20
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,730
"Ma'am"?

21
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:19,100
Shu Yan!

22
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,170
What are you saying?

23
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,720
Where are your manners!

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,530
Didn't you just get a lecture
on how to behave?

25
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,630
I've had enough of all of you!

26
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,520
I don't even understand
where all this audacity comes from.

27
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,800
You expect someone's daughter,
the apple of someone's eye,

28
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,960
to wait on you like a servant?

29
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,000
Let me tell you something.

30
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,130
Your son isn't good enough

31
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:37,070
for any woman.

32
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,430
Did you get that?

33
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:41,700
Shu Yan! Apologize to my mom right now!

34
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,770
Tianyu! What kind of daughter-in-law
did you find for me?

35
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,030
No manners at all!

36
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,670
Mom, give me some time.

37
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:48,830
Shu Yan!

38
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,930
Shu Yan! Stop right there!

39
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,240
What is this supposed to mean?

40
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,500
You really don't know what I mean?

41
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,070
I want to break up with you!

42
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,070
Break up?

43
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,030
You think you have the right
to break up with me?

44
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,830
Tianyu!

45
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,970
Tianyu!

46
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,930
You uncultured woman!

47
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:19,470
Shu Yan!

48
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,530
You just wait!

49
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:24,730
Get up.

50
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,170
Mom.

51
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,230
It hurts...

52
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,130
Shu Yan!

53
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,000
You wait and see!

54
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,500
I'll make you pay for this!

55
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,500
Mom.

56
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,830
A grown man still running

57
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,930
to his mommy every day?

58
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,630
Can't even manage your own girlfriend.

59
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,970
You're pathetic.

60
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,470
Why are you so spineless?

61
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,170
Mom, you don't understand!

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,530
This was unexpected!

63
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,800
Unexpected?

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,430
You think I've gone senile?

65
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,600
How dare you bring home
such an ill-mannered woman!

66
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,200
It's like you've been kicked
in the head by a donkey!

67
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,800
Mom!

68
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,130
Shu Yan wasn't always like this.

69
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,800
She used to be so sweet and quiet.

70
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,970
Lately she's been acting
totally out of character.

71
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,370
Sweet and quiet, huh?

72
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,600
She always had that sour face.

73
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,760
Who was she trying to impress?

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,970
And you're still defending her?

75
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,730
You little brat!

76
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,320
I'll beat you!

77
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,100
Don't hit me...

78
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:11,480
Mom!

79
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,560
Still sticking up for her!

80
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:12,930
Mom!

81
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,100
Mom.

82
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,100
You have to trust your son's judgment.

83
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,100
Trust you?

84
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,500
You think I trust someone

85
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,530
with taste that bad?

86
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,000
I've got enough to deal with already.

87
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,760
Can you just let me handle this myself?

88
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,600
How? How are you going to handle it?

89
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,200
Mom!

90
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,870
I'll take care of it.

91
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,300
Get back here right now!

92
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,240
You... You little brat!

93
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,000
Come back here!

94
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:36,630
Shu Yan!

95
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,570
Shu Yan! Open the door!

96
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,040
Don't think staying quiet in there means
I'll let you off easy!

97
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,170
Shu Yan!

98
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,230
Come out here!

99
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,600
Who do you think

100
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,630
you are,

101
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,200
screaming outside someone's door?

102
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,530
Trying to stir up trouble, huh?

103
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,700
Who are you?

104
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,930
Isn't this Shu Yan's place?

105
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,970
Shu Yan?

106
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,300
You looking for someone?

107
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,100
She moved out.

108
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,200
She moved?

109
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,070
Congrats on your new place, Ms. Shu.

110
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,720
I brought a little housewarming gift.

111
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,930
Well, before we celebrate,

112
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,300
I'm going to need Mr. Shen to help
with some heavy lifting.

113
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,000
It would be my honor.

114
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,520
Weren't you just on your way to meet me?

115
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,270
Did you forget?

116
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,630
Have you been waiting long?

117
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,430
Not at all.

118
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,170
It's late.

119
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,930
Maybe you should head back.

120
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,800
All right.

121
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,730
You inviting me out for dinner

122
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,300
must mean you're in a good mood.

123
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,840
Finally got something off my chest.

124
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,270
Feels like a weight's been lifted.

125
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,000
Well then, we have to toast to that.

126
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,330
(Shu Yan and Han Tianyu broke up.)

127
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,730
(Maybe it's better
if Shu Yan never finds out)

128
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,100
(Han Tianyu cheated on her)

129
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,230
(with Ye Wei.)

130
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,000
Hey.

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,300
You're on a date with me
and you're spacing out?

132
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,900
Sorry about that.

133
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,870
You know,

134
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,000
you're great in every way,

135
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,570
except your skin's too thin.

136
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,600
Maybe you could teach me

137
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,770
how to toughen up?

138
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:27,430
Are you calling me

139
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,330
thick-skinned?

140
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,530
I didn't say that.

141
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,670
Don't take it personally.
Come on, let's eat.

142
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,480
So we're going to have to
revise this proposal further.

143
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:36,840
Shu Yan!

144
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,900
Han Tianyu, what are you doing?

145
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,270
Shu Yan, show yourself!

146
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,900
What's all this shouting about?

147
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,030
Why is he so angry?

148
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:57,870
What happened?

149
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,930
What's your deal?

150
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,170
Explain yourself!

151
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,630
Are you done yet?

152
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:13,570
I...

153
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:16,600
Han Tianyu,

154
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,670
it's over.

155
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,630
Why is life so unfair?

156
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:21,800
Unfair?

157
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:24,770
And cheating is fair, huh?

158
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:25,830
Stop it!

159
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,680
Everyone, take a breath outside.

160
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,230
Wait.

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,270
I'm not done talking.

162
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,530
Han Tianyu,

163
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,770
not only did you cheat,

164
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:42,170
but the other woman
was my best friend, Ye Wei.

165
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,370
Now that's scandalous!

166
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,200
Ye Wei.

167
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,830
You think I'd ever

168
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,670
marry trash like you?

169
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,270
Shu Yan!

170
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,670
The woman found out the other woman

171
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:11,770
was her best friend.

172
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,900
These two are the lowest.

173
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:14,730
Seriously.

174
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,270
The whole thing's blowing up online.

175
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:19,430
Han Tianyu finally went viral, though.

176
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,630
No wonder Shu Yan had
that attitude toward my mom.

177
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,700
Turns out she found out about us.

178
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,200
Darn.

179
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,270
She's terrifying when she gets angry.

180
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:41,730
What are you so afraid of?

181
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,000
This is all your fault!

182
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,100
If you hadn't come to find me,
she never would've found out!

183
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,730
You're the one
who dragged me into the car.

184
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,230
And now you're blaming me
because you can't control yourself?

185
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,000
I only did it to give you
some final comfort before your marriage

186
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,130
so you wouldn't have any regrets.

187
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,130
Comfort me?

188
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,530
Wasn't you the one enjoying it the most?

189
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,100
You're really something.

190
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,370
Oh, I'm something?

191
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,830
So I was the only one who had fun, huh?

192
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,070
You women are all trouble!

193
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,300
(I'm screwed.)

194
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,840
(The wedding's off.)

195
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,880
(What am I going to do
about all those loan sharks?)

196
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,100
Wait.

197
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,730
If Shu Yan acted that way
toward my mom yesterday

198
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,970
because she found out about us,

199
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,900
it doesn't make sense.

200
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,670
She never even got in my car yesterday.

201
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,930
So how could she have known?

202
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:39,970
No.

203
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,330
I need to ask her myself.

204
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:45,130
What good will that do now?

205
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,230
Even if you confront her,

206
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,700
it won't change the fact
she knows about us.

207
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:51,930
Got it?

208
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,530
So she already knew?

209
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,600
She must've been giving me time,

210
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,160
waiting for me to break it off with you.

211
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,330
And I blew it.

212
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,600
That's why she finally snapped.

213
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,430
We fell in love.

214
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,730
If anyone's to blame, it's Shu Yan
for not being charming enough.

215
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,170
This isn't my fault.

216
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,070
It's not yours either.

217
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:16,800
Ye Wei.

218
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:19,830
Some friend you are to Shu Yan.

219
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,300
You're really standing there

220
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,730
justifying your affair

221
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,870
like it's no big deal.

222
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:31,730
Tianyu.

223
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,030
Listen to me.

224
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,400
These days,

225
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,070
many couples end up divorcing

226
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,600
because they didn't meet
the right person at the right time.

227
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,830
That's why people cheat.

228
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,830
But we're different.

229
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,230
I don't want you

230
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,670
to stress yourself out.

231
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,170
Don't worry about what others think.

232
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,070
What we have is true love.

233
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,570
If Shu Yan won't marry you,

234
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,930
I will.

235
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:05,930
Hold on.

236
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,200
True love?

237
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,070
Marriage?

238
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,870
You and me?

239
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,800
All along,
the only person I ever wanted to marry

240
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:17,900
was Shu Yan.

241
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,130
She's highly educated,

242
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,570
incredibly capable,

243
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,520
and she's getting better
at dressing and presenting herself.

244
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,330
Most importantly,

245
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,120
she knows how to make money
and manage a home.

246
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:26,970
But you?

247
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,400
Aside from your looks,
what do you bring to the table?

248
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:32,730
Come on,

249
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,600
let's be adults about this.

250
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,430
All right?

251
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,430
Marriage isn't a game.

252
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,280
And it's definitely not something
a naive little girl like you can handle.

253
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,070
Yes,

254
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,930
I admit, sleeping with you felt great.

255
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,570
But we're too old

256
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,200
to be chasing cheap thrills.

257
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,330
Let's get real, okay?

258
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,300
What are you saying?

259
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:01,130
I'm helping you face reality.

260
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,970
Stop being so delusional.

261
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,730
Han Tianyu!

262
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:12,670
You scoundrel!

263
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,560
Ms. Yang. You were looking for me?

264
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,100
What happened?

265
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,530
Why didn't you report the issue

266
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,470
with the on-site shoot?

267
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,930
What are you talking about?

268
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,300
Still pretending, huh?

269
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,070
Two hours missing from the shoot.

270
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,030
What's that about?

271
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,270
You left the entire crew waiting.

272
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,440
Why didn't you inform anyone?

273
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:34,570
How did you find out?

274
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:35,530
Sure,

275
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,200
you covered the financial losses,

276
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:39,320
but after that
you went off on the staff,

277
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,670
said it was their fault
for not checking every single room

278
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,700
to find you.

279
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,030
It was their fault!

280
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,080
I wasn't there,
so they should've looked for me.

281
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,470
All they did was call.

282
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,870
All the phones were on silent.
Shouldn't they have known that?

283
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,030
Besides,

284
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,070
it's normal

285
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,100
if we missed the calls.

286
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:53,970
We?

287
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,770
So the two of you left together?

288
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,730
No...

289
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,960
A pair of animals you are.

290
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:01,080
Can't even keep your hands off
each other at work.

291
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,530
It's not what you think.

292
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,300
You know exactly what it is.

293
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,070
The feedback's in.

294
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,480
They said the next issue of the magazine
will make up for it.

295
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,870
Han Tianyu did screw up,

296
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,300
but he managed
to patch things up decently.

297
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:15,130
Right.

298
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,400
But you didn't report
something this serious

299
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,500
to the company.

300
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,430
Go explain yourself to Director Bai.

301
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,560
Who would've thought
your very first trending topic

302
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,370
would go public

303
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,100
in a way like this?

304
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,670
I'm really sorry.

305
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,770
Don't apologize to me.

306
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,700
