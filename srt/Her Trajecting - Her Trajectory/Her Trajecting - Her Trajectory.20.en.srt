=Episode 20=

4
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,670
Dear. What do you think about this?

5
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:50,900
The price for this is a little...

6
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,270
Hello, Miss.

7
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,400
You are so pretty.

8
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,130
This bag you are looking at

9
00:00:57,170 --> 00:00:58,600
is a limited-edition bag in our shop.

10
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,370
It matches your style.

11
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:02,870
Tianyu.

12
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,300
Yes.

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,670
I figure

14
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,970
I must dress formally

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,800
since it's my first time
meeting your mother.

16
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,470
Moreover, I heard

17
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,200
that your mother has a high standard.

18
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,870
Not bad.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,600
As expected.

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,500
A handsome man matches a pretty woman.

21
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,700
If she carries this handbag
to meet your parents,

22
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,800
she will leave a very good impression

23
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,030
on your parents.

24
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,470
Tianyu,

25
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,470
I'm not trying to get this
just to meet your mother.

26
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,570
You are an artist
of Norran Entertainment after all.

27
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,970
The future and upcoming star

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,040
will be famous soon.

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,600
Everyone in the company is watching.

30
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,270
You are right.

31
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,770
I am a legend of the company.

32
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,300
Yes.

33
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,630
Let's buy this then.

34
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:40,900
I think this is the only handbag
that matches you.

35
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,230
Of course.

36
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,230
I want this.

37
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:43,900
All right.

38
00:01:44,698 --> 00:01:46,100
Show us something else.

39
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,830
Do you have any similar ones?

40
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,100
Take a look over here.

41
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,770
Follow me.

42
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,030
(I asked her to buy them)

43
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,970
(and she actually bought them all.)

44
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,430
(Darn it.)

45
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,070
(I was such a fool in my previous life.
Why did I help him save money?)

46
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,570
(In the end,)

47
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,770
(he took it for granted)

48
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,470
(and I failed to protect my happiness.)

49
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:17,830
Dear,

50
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,800
I like this handbag so much.

51
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,070
I'm glad that you like it.

52
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:25,230
A woman will only obtain happiness

53
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,430
when she finds the right man.

54
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,330
That's right.

55
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:28,630
I can only be so happy

56
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,270
because I've met you.

57
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,930
That's right.

58
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,100
You'll soon meet my parents.

59
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,000
Where are we eating?

60
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,930
(I knew you'd try to
save money using this.)

61
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,970
We should book a table
at a high-class restaurant.

62
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,160
However, it must be
a place with discounts.

63
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,670
Your classmate, Chu Chen.

64
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,800
Didn't he work in
a high-class restaurant previously?

65
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,570
Give him a call
and ask him to help us reserve a table.

66
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:55,830
That's not right.

67
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
It's troublesome.

68
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,670
It's fine.

69
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,500
You got him a new job.

70
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:02,500
Isn't it reasonable
for him to repay the favour?

71
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,070
If you are embarrassed to make the call,
I'll call him.

72
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,720
I...

73
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,600
I'll talk to him

74
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,130
when I eat with him.

75
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,780
(Chu Chen)

76
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,270
Answer it.

77
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:29,970
Hello, Chu Chen.

78
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,300
Hello, Shu Yan.

79
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,530
Say it. Book a table.

80
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,200
I was just about to call you.

81
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:35,800
Why did you call me first?

82
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,500
Is there anything you need?

83
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,930
Let's talk when we meet up.

84
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:39,900
All right.

85
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,920
I'll talk to him when we meet.

86
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,070
How is it?

87
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,300
What did she say?

88
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,270
Is she with her boyfriend?

89
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,570
I didn't get to say it.
I'll ask her about it later.

90
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,870
What were you doing?

91
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:55,870
I think Shu Yan

92
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,570
will never accept our apology.

93
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,630
No matter what,

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,230
we must think of something
to make up for our mistakes.

95
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:02,830
Yes.

96
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,000
It's all Ye Wei's fault.

97
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,470
All of us were fooled.

98
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,500
I think she's getting married soon.

99
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,840
She's going to be married?

100
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,730
You can prepare more gift money.

101
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,430
Actually, I'm looking for you

102
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,900
because Tianyu wants to bring me
to meet his parents.

103
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,770
We want to find a suitable restaurant
but we don't know where to go.

104
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,330
I didn't want to trouble you at first

105
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,000
but I was afraid
that Tianyu might disturb you.

106
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,130
Are you really
going to marry Han Tianyu?

107
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,400
I think you should think this through.

108
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,070
I've made my decision.

109
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,320
I can help you make a reservation
at the place I used to work at.

110
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,130
My uncle owns that restaurant.

111
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,530
Its environment and food are good.

112
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,800
You can get a discount too.

113
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:53,900
All right.

114
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,930
Thank you.

115
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,200
Yan,

116
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,100
are you happy now?

117
00:04:59,715 --> 00:05:01,845
Actually, I really want
to give you happiness.

118
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,470
Missing out on you

119
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,570
because of a letter in the past

120
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,270
is my biggest regret.

121
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,700
Let's just

122
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,430
forget about the past.

123
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,100
Right now,

124
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,200
I have no right to speak about this.

125
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,930
I'm really grateful to you.

126
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,840
I hope we can be good friends forever.

127
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,730
All right.

128
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,530
If you need my help in the future,

129
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,570
I will do my best.

130
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,130
As a friend.

131
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:35,930
Sure.

132
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:44,800
Why are you here suddenly?

133
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,830
I am working around the place

134
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,870
so I came here.

135
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:00,100
I miss you.

136
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,530
How have things been going?

137
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,300
That's right.

138
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,030
I've booked a restaurant
through Chu Chen.

139
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,200
However,

140
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,030
getting them married is just a process.

141
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:15,170
I must obtain happiness
in the final ending.

142
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,600
I want to do the things I like

143
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,200
with the person I like.

144
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,500
What is this?

145
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,100
A bracelet I buy for you.

146
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,030
No. This is too expensive.

147
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,600
Yan,

148
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,300
you must accept this

149
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,870
because you will
surely obtain happiness.

150
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,430
Hello.

151
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,370
Hello,

152
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,200
Chu Chen.

153
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,000
Are you free tomorrow?

154
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,400
I have something to ask you.

155
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,330
I see.

156
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,570
Sure.

157
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,870
What's wrong?

158
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,430
Are you drinking?

159
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,300
I drank a little.

160
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,530
Are you drinking without me?

161
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,800
Where are you?

162
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,640
I'll go and find you.

163
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:38,793
Send the address to me.

164
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,530
Cheers.

165
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,700
Seriously.

166
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,330
You are handsome
and you have a good personality.

167
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,200
Why do you have to feel sad

168
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,670
because your confession got rejected?

169
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,430
Because...

170
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,100
Yes?

171
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:19,230
I like her.

172
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,670
I have

173
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,470
lost her once.

174
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,700
It's all my fault.

175
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,770
However,

176
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,530
Yan is going to marry Tianyu.

177
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:44,200
I understand.

178
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,170
It's normal

179
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,370
to feel sad.

180
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,930
Why don't we do this?

181
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:50,430
In the future,

182
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,830
if you are sad,

183
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,000
I will accompany you

184
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,100
and drink with you until you are happy.

185
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,270
However,

186
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,470
I really want to go mad once.

187
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,700
I want to fight for her once.

188
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,770
I understand.

189
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,100
I understand everything.

190
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,230
But how can I comfort you?

191
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:21,970
Let's travel somewhere

192
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:23,400
and relax.

193
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,430
All right?

194
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,030
Mom.

195
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,570
Mom.

196
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,570
Why haven't you changed?

197
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,000
What's the rush?

198
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,060
(Ye Wei)

199
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,930
I'm downstairs.

200
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:55,970
Why are you here?

201
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:57,670
Wait for a while.

202
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,700
Mom.

203
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,230
Get changed quickly.

204
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,230
Don't let others complain about us.
I'm going to the supermarket.

205
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:07,770
Sure.

206
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,200
Tianyu.

207
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,500
Ye Wei.

208
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,030
Are you mad?

209
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,100
Why did you come here?

210
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:19,800
Are you going to bring Shu Yan
to meet your parents?

211
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:20,830
Yes.

212
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:21,930
What's wrong?

213
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,470
You know it.

214
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,970
I've always been supporting you.

215
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,700
What are you trying to do now?

216
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,830
Of course,
I want to give you a body examination.

217
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,030
A body examination

218
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,830
should be done at a suitable place.

219
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:48,830
Oh?

220
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:49,930
It'll postpone

221
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,330
Shu Yan's meeting with your parents.

222
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,430
You must arrange things properly.
They are very important friends of mine.

223
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,270
Don't worry, Chu.

224
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:20,970
Leave it to me.

225
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,400
They should be here soon.

226
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:28,170
I'm going to take a break.

227
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,870
Stay here and serve them.

228
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:30,370
All right.

229
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,500
Why does Chu look sad?

230
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,330
Is this the Hehuan Suite?

231
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:43,770
Yes.

232
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,170
No one is here?

233
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,930
Yes. You are the first person.

234
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:57,970
Hello.

235
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,430
Shu Yan.

236
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,630
How can you be late?

237
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,170
Don't you know how important today is?

238
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,330
Calm down.

239
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,570
I'm already at the entrance.

240
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,500
We are already an hour late.

241
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,370
How can you be later than us?
Are you doing this on purpose?

242
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:16,970
Tianyu.

243
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:17,730
Mom.

244
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:18,630
Where is she?

245
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:20,430
Why didn't she welcome us?

246
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,900
She's so rude.

247
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,630
She has gone to the washroom.
She will be here soon.

248
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,200
Sorry, Dear.

249
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,430
I thought I was late. I didn't expect
you to arrive at this time as well.

250
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,130
Mrs. Han.

251
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,770
It's you?

252
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,200
We are really fated.

253
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,030
I didn't expect to see you here.

254
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,870
I'm thinking the same.

255
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,430
Why is it you?

256
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,130
Hold on. Have you met each other?

257
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:45,600
Yes.

258
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,670
We met at the baking place.

259
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,270
That's great.

260
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,800
Don't stand here.

261
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:51,560
Let's go inside.

262
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,000
Sure.

263
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,520
Let's go.

264
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,300
Let's go, Mrs. Han.

265
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:53,680
Let's go.

266
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,440
Look at her outfit.

267
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,000
Let's go, Mom.

268
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:55,970
Let's go.

269
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,770
I heard your parents passed away early.

270
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,930
You had no parents to educate you.

271
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,330
No wonder you are so rude.

272
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,800
Yes, Mrs. Han.

273
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,870
My father passed away early

274
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,970
and my mother left home.

275
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,370
Since young,

276
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
I haven't had any good education.

277
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,770
It's a good thing anyway.

278
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,200
A cheating woman who leaves home

279
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,030
shouldn't be able to make any friends,

280
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:20,930
right?

281
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,500
Mom,

282
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,500
Shu Yan is a excellent girl.

283
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,600
She's good, virtuous,

284
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,500
and very sensible.

285
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:32,370
She also has a good temper.

286
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,080
If she marries into our family,

287
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,640
she will surely help me
treat both of you well.

288
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,830
Didn't I buy you

289
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,130
an expensive and proper outfit?

290
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,170
Why didn't you wear it?

291
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:48,930
What's with this punk girl outfit?

292
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:52,730
The outfit you bought me?

293
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:55,930
Tianyu, it's too expensive.
I can't bring myself to wear it.

294
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,600
Did you buy clothes for her?

295
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,730
I did buy one

296
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,570
because we are going to meet you.

297
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,070
But I brought the bag

298
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,070
you bought me.

299
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,000
I really like

300
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,730
the bag Tianyu bought for me.

301
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:09,880
Brat.

302
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,760
You only bought
a pair of socks for me usually

303
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,700
but you're generous
when it comes to other women.

304
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,230
This is unreasonable.

305
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,470
Eat more.

306
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,300
Eat more.

307
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,000
Shu Yan,

308
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,330
I've always been a blunt person.

309
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,000
I don't want to hide my feelings.

310
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,030
Mrs. Han,

311
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,570
just tell me.

312
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,070
You are not fit to become my son's wife.

313
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:36,470
First of all,

314
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,000
you have no family members and elders.

315
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:40,930
You are rude

316
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:42,730
and you are inappropriately dressed.

317
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,200
Reasonably speaking,

318
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,630
not many men will be interested in you

319
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,370
but Tianyu

320
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,930
likes someone like you.

321
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,630
I can't say anything as his mother.

322
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,230
However, I will educate you well
in the future.

323
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,570
You need to listen

324
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,170
and learn.

325
00:14:58,670 --> 00:14:59,270
Is that fine?

326
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:00,700
All right.

327
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,900
Of course, Mrs. Han.

328
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,970
I'm not an unreasonable
and old-fashioned woman.

329
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,530
People are promoting gender equality.

330
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,100
However, you can do it outside

331
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,330
but not in the family.

332
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,570
A family's life depends on a woman.

333
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:16,270
Men work outside
so they need to eat well

334
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,670
and live a comfortable life.

335
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,600
That is how
they can educate the children well

336
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,670
and go to work refreshed.

337
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,670
Yes.

338
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,870
I agree with you, Mrs. Han.

339
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,130
Also, men can't step foot
in the kitchen in our family

340
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,800
because the kitchen is too humid.

341
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,400
It'll affect the man's luck.

342
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,570
Girls nowadays are asking men

343
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,930
to cook in the kitchen

344
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,570
but this is not allowed in our family.

345
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,730
That's right.

346
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,800
When it comes to cooking,

347
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,200
I have to remind you

348
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,970
that Tianyu

349
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,870
eats in a disciplined manner.

350
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,300
He must have breakfast.

351
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,530
It must also be a nutritious meal.

352
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,470
It cannot be bought outside.

353
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,100
Outside food is filthy.

354
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,670
You must make it yourself.

355
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:58,870
Yes.

356
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,430
You're right.

357
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,200
Yes.

358
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,200
Mrs. Han, I understand.

359
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,730
No matter how busy I am,

360
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:04,870
I must also

361
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,430
make breakfast, lunch,
and dinner for Tianyu

362
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:08,130
right?

363
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:09,500
You are right.

364
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,530
You are very smart.

365
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,430
After you marry him,

366
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,630
you must give birth to three children.

367
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,700
The country is advocating for
quality childbirth and child upbringing.

368
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,160
The family environment will be better
if you have many children.

369
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,100
That's right.

370
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:22,670
In a few days,

371
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,770
I will take you to a hospital
for an examination.

372
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,430
Girls nowadays

373
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,830
lack self-respect.

374
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,530
They keep changing partners.

375
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,900
It's easy for them to fall ill.

376
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,330
Oh,

377
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,270
I'm not saying that you are indecent.

378
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:36,600
