=Episode 26=

4
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,060
Hello.

5
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,100
Yes.

6
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,200
Yes, that's me.

7
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,230
Vice President Lin is still in the US.

8
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,779
I think

9
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,030
it's possible

10
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,909
to match his schedule.

11
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,949
But first,

12
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,030
I must confirm it with my boss.

13
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:08,830
Han Tianyu?

14
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,060
What are you doing?

15
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,079
Shu Yan.

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,830
How ambitious you are.

17
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,779
You knew all along

18
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,060
that Shen Weizhou was
the heir to Norran Entertainment.

19
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,660
You dumped me just to him, didn't you?

20
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:19,449
Let go of me.

21
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:21,360
Stop wasting my time.

22
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,630
Shu Yan.

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,449
You must've started liking him

24
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,100
when I proposed to you, right?

25
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,230
That's why you fought with my mom.

26
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,649
You pulled that underwear stunt
to embarrass me.

27
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:34,460
Right.

28
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:36,749
Everything makes sense now.

29
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,730
Tell me.

30
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,130
When did you two start cheating?

31
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,300
Tell me!

32
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,200
So what if we did?

33
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,130
What can you do now?

34
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,279
All you do is act like

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,249
a barking stray dog.

36
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,549
What else can you do?

37
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,160
I'll kill you!

38
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:54,960
Security!

39
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,449
Calm down, you.

40
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,179
Let me tell you one last thing.

41
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,709
If you're still missing one dot

42
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,849
in the whole story.

43
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,179
You cheated with Ye Wei.

44
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,360
None of this
would've happened otherwise.

45
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,430
Cursed you!

46
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,730
Stay still.

47
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,530
Out!

48
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,330
Leader.

49
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,149
Han Tianyu. Are you coming or not?
Come now, or get replaced!

50
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,709
Wait, no! Don't replace me.

51
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,130
I'm on my way.

52
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,900
Miss.

53
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,230
Those insufferable fools.

54
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:57,960
It seems

55
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:00,600
I have to get it done myself.

56
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,000
What kind of crappy brush is this?

57
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,660
You're scrubbing my face off!

58
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,149
If my face

59
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,100
gets ruined, you're done for.

60
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,779
You're just

61
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,909
a third-rate performer doing tiny gigs.

62
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,609
You really think you're a superstar?

63
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,960
Take it or leave it.

64
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,579
Do you even have any work ethic?

65
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,149
Don't start throwing a tantrum.

66
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,330
You want to talk to me about work ethic?

67
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:25,579
A big shot like you

68
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,160
is beyond my league.

69
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,479
Han Tianyu,

70
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,860
what are you doing?

71
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,030
What's your deal?

72
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,179
Do you think

73
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,509
you're an A-lister now?

74
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,079
Get lost.

75
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,109
No, sir.

76
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:38,949
Please calm down.

77
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,709
I'll do an extra dance for you, okay?

78
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,349
Take it off.

79
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,200
Get lost.

80
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:43,400
Sir...

81
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,330
Long time no see, Han Tianyu.

82
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,330
How'd you end up as a street performer?

83
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:07,760
What?

84
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,100
Is the superstar here to mock me?

85
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,000
Of course not.

86
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,460
I'm here to work with you.

87
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,300
Work with me?

88
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,430
Yeah.

89
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,760
We have a common enemy.

90
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,360
What do you mean?

91
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,760
Shu Yan.

92
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,960
She stole my fiancé.

93
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,660
So what?

94
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,860
She has nothing to do with me anymore.

95
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,660
Are you really okay living like this?

96
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,449
Do you want to be looked down

97
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,860
by every random street troupe?

98
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,200
Do you want to be some homeless guy,

99
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,879
wandering around for shows?

100
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,530
Nothing I can do about it.

101
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,960
That Shen Weizhou has power,
influence, and money.

102
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,579
Now that Shu Yan's with him,

103
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,449
she can live worry-free for life.

104
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,530
People like me are nobodies.

105
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,700
I can't change anything.

106
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,030
Do you think Shu Yan is the only one

107
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,060
who can change her fate overnight?

108
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,960
What are you getting at?

109
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,260
Don't tell me you're into me.

110
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,979
Whatever Shu Yan has,

111
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,109
you can have it too.

112
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,930
A cheap woman like her

113
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,130
had no right to steal my man.

114
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,660
I've decided to teach her a lesson.

115
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,060
If we're lucky,

116
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,500
we could even
take over Norran Entertainment.

117
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,960
Then,

118
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,209
you get to punish
the woman who betrayed you,

119
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,709
and become

120
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:39,760
a world-famous superstar.

121
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,100
Doesn't that sound tempting?

122
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,330
So, how do I make it happen?

123
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,260
I'm all ears.

124
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,760
Why don't we

125
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,130
talk somewhere else?

126
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,230
I've taken care of the tax issues.

127
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,379
Shu Yan unknowingly
became one of the country's

128
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,809
top real estate tycoons.

129
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:15,760
Do you really think this is okay?

130
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,530
There's nothing wrong with it.

131
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,200
This is

132
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:22,160
the group's overseas

133
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,100
equity transfer agreement.

134
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,479
You really want to

135
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,840
transfer it to Wu Mengya?

136
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,919
You're not even going to
check with the old man?

137
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,810
(Overseas Equity Transfer Agreement
Party A: Shen Weizhou, Party B: Wu Mengya)

138
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,779
I'm the heir to the group.

139
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,109
Grandpa is already retired.

140
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,860
He has no right to interfere.

141
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,979
Trying to make changes
with your new position, huh?

142
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,530
What exactly are you trying to do?

143
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,709
If your physical report
didn't say everything was fine,

144
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,500
I would've thought you were dying.

145
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:53,730
You and Shu Yan have already broken up.

146
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:56,400
Her future happiness
has nothing to do with you.

147
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,560
I just want what's best for her.

148
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,660
I hope even long after now,

149
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,960
she can still be happy.

150
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,649
The person who sent Ye Wei

151
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,709
those files
about Shen Weizhou's identity

152
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,560
was you.

153
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:19,560
That's right.

154
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,960
But, she didn't get what I meant.

155
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,960
She made a few pointless decisions.

156
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,660
So, I hope you'll get it.

157
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:30,960
What do you want me to do?

158
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,749
Shu Yan has some real estate

159
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,179
under her name.

160
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,209
Buildings,

161
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,109
land,

162
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,160
apartments.

163
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,809
They are worth eighty million.

164
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,300
Eighty million?

165
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,730
Shu Yan?

166
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,360
Are you sure?

167
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:50,060
This...

168
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,160
This...

169
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,909
What do you want?

170
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,500
Help me with something.

171
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,300
Once it's done,

172
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,530
you'll get more than
a hundred times that.

173
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,230
A hundred times?

174
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,330
By the way,

175
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,979
your wife's connection to Shu Yan

176
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,430
is pretty interesting.

177
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:35,230
They're not just best friends.

178
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,260
They're also stepsisters.

179
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,209
Where have you been?

180
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,560
You didn't answer your phone.

181
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,300
Look at the time.

182
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,160
You're hiding something from me.

183
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,330
What?

184
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,549
You went to Shu Yan's mom to scam her,

185
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,030
and you failed.

186
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,560
How do you know that?

187
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,979
The people who sent you those photos

188
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,230
didn't ask you to go after her mom.

189
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,560
What matters now
is that Shu Yan has eighty million.

190
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,300
What?

191
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,430
Shu Yan has that much?

192
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,930
Shen Weizhou gave it to her.

193
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,209
What charm did she have

194
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,030
to make him so obsessed with her?

195
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,730
Shu Yan...

196
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,330
This might actually be good for us.

197
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,260
If Shu Yan were to die,

198
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,100
her only family,

199
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,600
which is her mother,

200
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,730
would inherit everything.

201
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,630
If Shu Yan dies,

202
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,260
and the money goes to her mother,

203
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,100
why would she share it with us?

204
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,900
Didn't you tell me

205
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,560
your dad had passed away?

206
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,760
Keeping that bottled up
must be hard, huh?

207
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,230
From what I heard...

208
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,530
your dad is actually alive and well.

209
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,060
Buddy,

210
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,330
you can't do this.

211
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:52,260
You borrowed money.
You should pay it back.

212
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,349
You have a business now. You're a boss.

213
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,579
Why wouldn't you have money?

214
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,160
What do you expect us to do?

215
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,730
For the time being,

216
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,560
I don't have any money.

217
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,760
Give me a little more time.

218
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,779
Give me one more month,

219
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,279
and I promise I'll pay you back.

220
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,849
Pay us two hundred thousand first.

221
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:09,549
The rest

222
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,509
can wait.

223
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,179
I really don't have it.

224
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,960
I don't even have ten thousand.

225
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:15,500
Then, you have this coming.

226
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,549
No, wait!

227
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,900
What are you doing?

228
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,379
You only need one kidney

229
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,649
to live.

230
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,379
Relax.

231
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,509
It won't hurt too much.

232
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:25,309
No!

233
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,100
Buddy!

234
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:27,549
This is illegal!

235
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:28,949
Please, I'm begging you!

236
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,960
Stop!

237
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,300
Ye Wei?

238
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,660
Why are you here?

239
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,300
Where's the woman you live with?

240
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,909
Oh.

241
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,800
She...

242
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,579
Ye Wei is here!

243
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,230
The debt collectors are gone!

244
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,430
Here's one million.

245
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,749
Use the money to save your skin.

246
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,300
Once everything is done,

247
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,679
I'll help you clear all your debts.

248
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,700
And

249
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,060
you get to live a high life.

250
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,200
One million?

251
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,530
This is a lot of money.

252
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,849
Where did you get this?

253
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,530
Save your curiosity.

254
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,949
The one who gave you this money

255
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,279
could make you disappear

256
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,549
without a trace.

257
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,009
Just do what you're told,

258
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:24,679
and this miserable life
will be over soon.

259
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,760
Otherwise,

260
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:29,100
we all die together.

261
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,060
Can you do it?

262
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,630
Yes, we can do it.

263
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,900
We'll do it.

264
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,309
This is the overseas equity
transfer agreement from Norran Entertainment.

265
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,379
It's been fully separated

266
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,860
from the group.

267
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,530
You now have control over it.

268
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,949
You really think
this pathetic little agreement

269
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:55,330
is enough to send me away?

270
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,849
To make me give you my blessing

271
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,549
and leave with the money?

272
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,930
There was never any love between us.

273
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:04,730
My family owed your father a debt.

274
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,879
I broke off the engagement.

275
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,260
So, I owed you compensation.

276
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,200
This money

277
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,700
is enough for you to live comfortably.

278
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,509
But I had the chance

279
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:16,360
to become the lady
of Norran Entertainment.

280
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,579
If it weren't for Shu Yan,

281
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,360
we would've been married long ago.

282
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,209
We wouldn't care about each other,

283
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,000
and live our separate lives.

284
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,100
Wu Mengya.

285
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,630
Whatever you're planning,

286
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,360
stop it right now.

287
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,679
What else can I do?

288
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,700
I just want to win you back.

289
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,660
It's fine.

290
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,449
While you still can,

291
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,700
enjoy this love of yours.

292
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,749
Love always ends sooner or later.

293
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,030
When it does,

294
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,430
you'll come back to me.

295
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,100
Do you think he knows our plan?

296
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,060
What now?

297
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,979
Do you know

298
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,349
how much the stuff he gave me is worth?

299
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,209
How much?

300
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:11,979
Forty million.

301
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,949
Forty million?

302
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,460
Does he think I'm a beggar?

303
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,900
He really thought
that would get rid of me?

304
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,630
Han Tianyu.

305
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,330
Kill Shu Yan for me.

306
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,800
When it's done,

307
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,230
you'll get everything
you've ever wanted.

308
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,000
I'll clean up the mess.

309
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,860
As for me,

310
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,430
Shen Weizhou will come back for me.

311
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,730
And then,

312
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,530
I'll make him regret

313
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,700
ever trying to brush me off.

314
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:04,660
Mr. Bai.

315
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,200
Help me look into something.

316
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,100
Thank you, honey.

317
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,230
We have to make sure
nothing goes wrong.

318
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,400
Got it.

319
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,100
Everything is ready.

320
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:18,449
Should we start right away?

321
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,330
Yes.

322
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,730
I believe you'll do great.

323
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,660
Wait for me.

324
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,060
I'll be right back.

325
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:48,650
(Here lies Shu Moshan)

326
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,860
Mengya hasn't made a move.

327
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,449
But Shu Yan's mother

328
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,430
illegally rented a gravel truck.

329
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:57,449
You mean...

330
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:58,479
It means

331
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,100
if Shu Yan dies,

332
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,379
all the real estate you gave her

333
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,260
will go to her mother.

334
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,130
Where's the gravel truck?

335
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,879
According to the global GPS tracking,

336
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,460
it's currently driving on Highway 404.

337
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,949
Shu Yan!

338
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:44,009
(Do you know?)

339
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,149
(Ever since the moment I was reborn,)

340
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,879
(I've been ready to face everything.)

341
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,879
(No matter what fate has in store,)

342
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,679
(I won't let anything happen to you.)

343
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,460
(I'll keep you safe.)

344
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,200
(I'll face it for you.)

345
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,630
