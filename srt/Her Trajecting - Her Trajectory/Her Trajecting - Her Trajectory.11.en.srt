=Her Trajecting=

2
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:41,460
(Every Trajectory Is You)

3
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,540
=Episode 11=

4
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:53,339
Wei, you have good taste.

5
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,899
You invited me to such a romantic place
to have a meal.

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,699
If I invite you to a meal,

7
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,550
we have to come to
a high-class restaurant like this, Xu.

8
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,490
Come.

9
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,099
Cheers.

10
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:04,990
All right.

11
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,969
Sorry, Mr. Wang.

12
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,999
I saw how friendly you were

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,490
after work

14
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,639
and accidentally called you Xu.

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,169
Yes.

16
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:22,450
It's all right.

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,750
I like it when you call me that.

18
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,520
You are pretty and capable after all.

19
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:32,099
Mr. Wang,

20
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,790
you are such a sweet talker.

21
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,969
However, I'm still miles apart

22
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,650
compared to Shu Yan.

23
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,939
Why do you always mention Shu Yan?

24
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:41,650
Do you like her that much?

25
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,920
Of course.

26
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,199
Shu Yan has good academic results.

27
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,250
She is pretty and smart.

28
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,469
More importantly,

29
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,050
she is very ambitious.

30
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,069
Moreover,

31
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,699
she is also in charge

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,250
of the artists' reality program.

33
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,269
What's the use
of having good academic results?

34
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,169
She is just a nerd

35
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:01,669
who doesn't know the ways of the world.

36
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,999
Moreover, her projects

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,090
were the results of my guidance.

38
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,739
Xu.

39
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,869
Yes?

40
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,660
Yan will never forget
how much you've helped her.

41
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,690
Well, Xu.

42
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,550
I'll go and tell Yan

43
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,950
to let me join this project as well.

44
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,120
I'm sure you know.

45
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:28,490
I've always wanted to change my job.

46
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,720
She is not the one
to make decisions for this project.

47
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,690
Did I say something wrong again?

48
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,220
This has nothing to do with you.

49
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,920
However, now that you mention it,

50
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,569
I do think

51
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:46,769
that you are more suitable
to run this program.

52
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,739
Really?

53
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,720
Yes.

54
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:53,790
But...

55
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,920
I'm worried that I might not do well.

56
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,820
You don't need to worry about the rest.

57
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,190
Just leave it to me.

58
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:01,739
Really?

59
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:02,720
Yes.

60
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,190
Xu,

61
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,850
you treat me so well.

62
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,350
Then,

63
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,039
please take care of me in the future

64
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,590
regarding work.

65
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,120
Cheers.

66
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,150
It's this woman.

67
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,250
Even if I don't like him,

68
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,739
no one else can steal
something that belongs to me.

69
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,590
Miss,

70
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,890
what do I need to do?

71
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,650
It's still very easy

72
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,790
to give a nameless brat
like her a hard time.

73
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,050
Just wait and see.

74
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,350
Shen Weizhou has been acting weirdly.

75
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,799
It feels like he knows

76
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,050
what will happen to me next.

77
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,990
Don't tell me...

78
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,690
Impossible.

79
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,950
This thing is already absurd enough.

80
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:22,280
(Tianqi)

81
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,520
In that case,

82
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,369
I must plan

83
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,550
my moneymaking direction in the future.

84
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,650
Let me think about it.

85
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,590
Look.

86
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,880
(How Douli got listed in three years)
Douli is trending now.

87
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,260
It only took three years
to get the company listed.

88
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:45,869
It's amazing.

89
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,550
He Ju is so amazing.

90
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,939
It has become a listed company
after three years in operation.

91
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,490
- That's incredible.
- Yes.

92
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,169
Yes.

93
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:52,739
It's so hot.

94
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,720
I saw a trending news today.

95
00:04:54,770 --> 00:04:55,369
Look.

96
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:55,969
Really?

97
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:58,169
How did the founder of Douli, He Ju,

98
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:01,790
get his company listed
in only three years?

99
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,169
- Look at this.
- I saw it too.

100
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,690
Many people are playing as well.

101
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,799
This is really popular now.

102
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,799
It's really amazing.

103
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,420
Yes. This is the one.

104
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,190
He Ju.

105
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:27,520
(He Ju)

106
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,820
I remember he used to study

107
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,950
at Nanling University

108
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:36,420
and he majored in Microelectronics
and Software Engineering.

109
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,799
Did you change the lock?

110
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,620
I did.

111
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,069
No one came here.

112
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,450
What's wrong, Boss?

113
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,850
It's nothing.

114
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,499
Install a security camera

115
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,890
at this door.

116
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,420
A security camera?

117
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,499
If you are afraid,

118
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,450
why don't I move here
and help you guard the door?

119
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,069
Can you leave?

120
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,250
If you can, leave immediately.

121
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,069
Fine. I'll leave.

122
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,150
Why are you so fierce?

123
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,950
(Meng Ya will surely
act against Shu Yan.)

124
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,120
(I must let Shu Yan have
a strong foundation in the company.)

125
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,390
(Grandpa appreciates good talent.)

126
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,820
(I need to find out)

127
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,390
(if there are any opportunities
during this period)

128
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,750
(that helps Shu Yan's career.)

129
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,220
(Douli's founder, He Ju.)

130
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,120
Grandpa will surely
see her in a different light.

131
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,620
Yan.

132
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,550
I want to speak to you.

133
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,039
My parents will be here soon.

134
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,020
Can you find some time to meet them

135
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,120
and talk about our marriage?

136
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,969
I'm not ready yet.

137
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,220
It'll be fine.

138
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,299
I've put in many good words for you.

139
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,199
Moreover,

140
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,590
they are very nice.

141
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,420
What's wrong with you?

142
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,376
Can't you see
all these melon seed shells?

143
00:07:02,377 --> 00:07:03,727
Don't you know how to clean up?

144
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,169
Are these the dishes you made?

145
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,039
Are you feeding this to my son?

146
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:10,250
Look. It's not nutritious at all.

147
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,990
Make it again.

148
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,250
Sure.

149
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,220
I'll tell you again when I'm free.

150
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,690
Sure.

151
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,950
Go back to work then.

152
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,350
Here.

153
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,950
I'm leaving then.

154
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,190
Shu Yan.

155
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,420
Yang Huiting.

156
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,900
Have lunch with me this afternoon.

157
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,420
I've sent the location to both of your phones.
I'll head there first. Go there later.

158
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:43,769
Sure.

159
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,590
Sure.

160
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,550
All right.

161
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,790
Let's pack our things and go.

162
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:51,920
All right.

163
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,720
Why do you know everything?

164
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,369
Tianyu.

165
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:05,320
- Yes. I completely missed it.
- Tianyu.

166
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,290
I'm going to eat with Huiting.

167
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,550
Wei must be bored to eat alone.

168
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,769
Can you have lunch with her?

169
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,920
This is not good.

170
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,539
Yan,

171
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,439
I'm fine.

172
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,039
It's fine.

173
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,150
It's decided then.

174
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,690
Remember.

175
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,039
Let's go.

176
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,790
Sure.

177
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,490
Let's go.

178
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,890
I can claim the expenses.

179
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,650
Then,

180
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,750
what should we eat?

181
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,090
Wait.

182
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,769
(I just need)

183
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,699
(to sever ties with her
before my marriage.)

184
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,190
(I can't let this go to waste.)

185
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,069
It's fine.

186
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,120
If you don't want to eat with me,

187
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,350
it's all right.

188
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,139
(Shu Yan, Please accept it.)

189
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,539
(Buy Wei a good meal.)

190
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,050
(She is too tired.
She needs to replenish some nutrition.)

191
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,990
Let's go. I'll bring you
to have a good meal.

192
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,190
Let's go.

193
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,920
Let's go.

194
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,290
Come on.

195
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,590
Let's eat.

196
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,490
Shu Yan.

197
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,839
I've confirmed the food reality show

198
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,969
you suggested last time.

199
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,650
My nephew is very interested
in this project.

200
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,620
Really, Mr. Wang?

201
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,990
That's wonderful.

202
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,999
I'll go with Huiting

203
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,990
to lock in other artists' schedules.

204
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,420
Wait.

205
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,720
I think the other artists
need to be changed.

206
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,769
Since it's a reality show,

207
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,450
we must create a hot topic.

208
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,469
I think

209
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:48,669
Li Yuan who often creates a topic
with Wang Xingxing

210
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:49,820
is the prime candidate.

211
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:50,999
Of course.

212
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,899
The model who was rumored

213
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,250
to be his ex-girlfriend

214
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,290
can be invited as well.

215
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,869
Mr. Wang,

216
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,250
I think

217
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,750
this is a private matter.

218
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,750
This is work.

219
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,369
If we do this,

220
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,050
there might be an issue.

221
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,620
Are you questioning my work ability

222
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,769
or my nephew's behaviour?

223
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,790
No.

224
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,439
I'm not questioning your ability.

225
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,650
However,

226
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,999
this idea is a double-edged sword.

227
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,999
If not handled carefully,

228
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,139
it might cause a huge problem.

229
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,169
Moreover,

230
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,139
this is not just

231
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,390
a food reality program.

232
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,539
We want

233
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,739
to tie down artists long-term

234
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,299
for long-term cooperation.

235
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,169
If he starts...

236
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:36,190
Shu Yan,

237
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,090
as a subordinate,

238
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,020
you only need to
follow your superior's arrangements.

239
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,099
If you can't even do this,

240
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,790
you are no different from a rookie.

241
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,520
Since you don't agree to this proposal,

242
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,669
fine.

243
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,150
You can quit this project.

244
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,850
Yang Huiting.

245
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:54,540
You and Ye Wei can
proceed with the next phase of work.

246
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,069
But Ye Wei doesn't have
the necessary resources.

247
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,890
She is also incapable of negotiating.

248
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,699
I will provide the resources

249
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,469
to you and Ye Wei.

250
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,490
You don't need to worry about this.

251
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,369
Are you still staying here?

252
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,890
We have work to discuss.

253
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,120
Are you just going
to let other people steal your project?

254
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,899
I can deal with my own problems.

255
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,499
Like I said, you could use me.

256
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,350
There's no need
to make all the extra effort.

257
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,469
You've always treated me so well.

258
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,320
What if I got used to it?

259
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,999
You can't help me all my life.

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,620
Why not?

261
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,869
I will help you forever in your life.

I mean...

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,639
I want to resolve this on my own

278
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,120
as much as possible.

279
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:18,739
If...

280
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,639
If I can't

281
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,199
deal with it in the future,

282
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,850
I will ask you for help.

283
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,490
All right.

284
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,020
Wait.

285
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:30,890
Did you say
they will invite Wang Xingxing?

286
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,890
Yes.

287
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:32,969
What's wrong?

288
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,369
(I remember Wang Xingxing)

289
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,999
(will be banned soon
because of a scandal.)

290
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,190
(In that case,)

291
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,690
(Wang Xu will also be demoted.)

292
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,950
(That's good.)

293
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,790
(I can use this opportunity)

294
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,850
(to make Shu Yan a manager.)

295
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,620
It's nothing.

296
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,169
That's good.

297
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:49,499
You can leave this project

298
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,739
and rest for a period of time.

299
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,639
Later, the company will still
give you some important work to do.

300
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,690
Later?

301
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,499
I mean

302
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,990
you are very capable.

303
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,870
The company will surely entrust you with
an important position in the future.

304
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,420
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

305
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,220
Then...

306
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,020
I'll be leaving.

307
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,569
Let me send you off.

308
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:11,199
It's fine.

309
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,790
I can leave on my own.

310
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,539
Mr. Wang.

311
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:20,999
Yes.

312
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,299
I think it's better

313
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,320
for Wang Xingxing
to lead the few rookies.

314
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,499
By doing this,
he can still keep his spotlight.

315
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,199
At the same time,

316
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:27,939
he can also

317
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,790
guide our company's artists.

318
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,690
You are right.

319
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,839
I know.

320
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,220
We will execute it
according to this proposal.

321
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,120
Didn't you say you'd invite Li Yuan?

322
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,290
You've been working with me for so long.
Don't you understand my intention?

323
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:45,369
Seriously.

324
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,720
None of you is as smart as Wei.

325
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,520
Does it mean

326
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,620
you kicked Shu Yan on purpose?

327
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,390
What do you mean on purpose?

328
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,869
I did it

329
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,520
according to the company's
assessment of work ability.

330
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,790
Yang Huiting,

331
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,320
if you are not willing to do this,
you can quit as well.

332
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:04,790
