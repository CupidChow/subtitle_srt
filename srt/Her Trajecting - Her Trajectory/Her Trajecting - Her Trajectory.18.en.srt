=Episode 18=

4
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:51,330
Lin Yuan.

5
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,770
Find out which company

6
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,230
Han Tianyue owes loan shark money to.

7
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,270
Put some pressure on him.
Push him to repay.

8
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,200
Hello?

9
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,070
Hello?

10
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,100
Han Tianyu, right?

11
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,200
You borrowed a total
of one million from our platform.

12
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,130
Your due date is in three days.

13
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,130
If you fail to repay on time,

14
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,330
you will be charged
100,000 in daily interest.

15
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:09,370
A hundred thousand?

16
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:10,900
Wait.

17
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,000
That wasn't mentioned
when I signed the contract.

18
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,770
Isn't it written in the contract?

19
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:18,700
We, Party A, reserve
the right of final interpretation.

20
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,630
That's it.

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,470
If you can't come up with the money,

22
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:22,800
just wait and see.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,500
Your heart, liver, spleen, lungs

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,970
will fetch a good price.

25
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:27,600
Hello?

26
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,030
You can't do this!

27
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:30,270
Hello?

28
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:36,970
What do I do now?

29
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,330
Right.

30
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,430
I need to marry Shu Yan ASAP.

31
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,600
With her money,

32
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,030
I can pay it back.

33
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:47,830
Yes.

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,500
Thanks, Tianyu.

35
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,500
Shu Yan.

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,430
Do you love me?

37
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,470
Of course.

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,970
I know I have a lot of flaws.

39
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,300
You've always put up with them.

40
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,300
We've been together for so many years.

41
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,230
I always thought

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,130
I'd marry you once my career took off.

43
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,100
But with all this happening now,

44
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,330
I don't want to be your burden.

45
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,800
(You want my money,)

46
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,830
(and want me to be the one to propose?)

47
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:17,100
(Han Tianyu,)

48
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,800
(you really are shameless.)

49
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,300
Money can always be earned again.

50
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,270
I'm not in a rush to get married.

51
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,370
You don't have to worry about that.

52
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,330
No.

53
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,770
You shouldn't think that way.

54
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,000
It's better for girls
to get married earlier.

55
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,870
I don't want you to be with me

56
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,730
for all these years
without a proper title.

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,370
That...

58
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,170
Other girls will make fun of you.

59
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,070
Didn't you use to say

60
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,330
getting married early

61
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,900
would affect your career?

62
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,330
Not anymore.

63
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,400
Look,

64
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,300
you've gotten me

65
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,630
such a great project opportunity.

66
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,330
And now I have a lot of fans too.

67
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,900
What's that saying again?

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,230
Right.

69
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:55,170
A man should start
a family before a career.

70
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,670
You have the look of a wife
who brings good luck.

71
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,830
So,

72
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,230
let's get married soon.

73
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,070
Even though I can't afford

74
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,930
a grand wedding right now,

75
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,100
I promise

76
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,700
our home

77
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,130
will only get happier from here.

78
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,830
Our home?

79
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,930
(A girl who lacks love)

80
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,430
(needs the warmth of a home.)

81
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,230
(You're bound to fall for that.)

82
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,630
(Absolutely despicable.)

83
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,430
(He's the one living off me,)

84
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,430
(but makes it sound
like he's providing for me.)

85
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,630
Are you...

86
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,030
Are you

87
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,570
not willing to marry me?

88
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,330
Are you looking down on me now?

89
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,470
Because I have no money?

90
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,470
No.

91
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,900
I have something to do.

92
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,500
I'll head out first.

93
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,800
It's pretty ridiculous, right?

94
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,230
Just to get his hands on all my assets,

95
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,730
he has to go out of his way
to treat me well.

96
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:57,430
He is selfish and shameless.

97
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,830
I had such terrible judgment
in my past life.

98
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:02,800
I was so dumb

99
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,830
and so love-crazed.

100
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,630
Because people are good at pretending.

101
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,900
You had no idea who he really was.

102
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,170
In your past life,

103
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,070
you were so kind and pure.

104
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,330
And Han Tianyu

105
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,230
was nothing but vile.

106
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,870
You always know how to comfort me.

107
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,600
Your birthday is coming up.

108
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,070
In this life, what would be your wish?

109
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,770
In my last life,

110
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,870
I got a cheap, pathetic proposal.

111
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,170
But in this life,

112
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,400
it won't be the same.

113
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,730
I'm here.

114
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,830
Why is no one around?

115
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,430
Shu Yan.

116
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,000
I love you.

117
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,770
What are you doing?

118
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,470
(She won't notice
it's a fake diamond, will she?)

119
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,630
Will you marry me?

120
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,630
I will.

121
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,700
Yes.

122
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,400
That's great!

123
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:22,200
Okay.

124
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,570
(Whatever I can do for Shu Yan,)

125
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,500
(I will do it.)

126
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,930
(I will never let them get married.)

127
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,130
(You must hate seeing me
this happy, don't you?)

128
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,930
(Please,)

129
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,800
(do whatever it takes
to marry my husband.)

130
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,800
So beautiful.

131
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:57,600
Right?

132
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,870
Happy birthday to you.

133
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,830
Happy birthday to you.

134
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,200
Happy birthday to you.

135
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,330
Happy birthday to you.

136
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,000
Thank you.

137
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,900
Happy birthday.

138
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,500
Happy birthday, Shu Yan.

139
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,500
Happy birthday!

140
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,870
No wonder

141
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,170
Yan's birthday party is so extravagant.

142
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,200
The gentleman

143
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,730
was proposing!

144
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,870
I hope

145
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,230
Shu Yan gets the best gift of her life.

146
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:37,200
Do you like it?

147
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:38,170
Yeah.

148
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,530
Shu Yan.

149
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,700
I envy you.

150
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,370
What a surprise!

151
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,270
I didn't expect it to be this romantic.

152
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,070
I envy you.

153
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,600
It's nothing, really.

154
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,970
As long as you mean it,

155
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,470
even better surprises

156
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,500
will come your way.

157
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,670
That's right.

158
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,100
If it comes from the heart,

159
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,800
even a cheap ring

160
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,030
would move me deeply.

161
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,470
Thank you.

162
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:09,930
Well, this 100-yuan one is not bad.

163
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,700
A 3,000-yuan proposal ceremony?

164
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:14,600
That's pricey.

165
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,700
This is daylight robbery.

166
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,370
Mr. Shen.

167
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:22,400
Did you hear?

168
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,200
The food show was a big hit.
The company wants to reward Shu Yan.

169
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,070
So on her birthday,

170
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,270
they're giving her a winery

171
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,100
to host a wine party.

172
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:29,970
A reward?

173
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:31,870
That's generous of them.

174
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,700
That's what Manager Yang said.

175
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,370
Sounds like the perfect opportunity.

176
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,900
I'm planning to propose to Shu Yan.

177
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:41,600
I'll invite a few close coworkers

178
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,330
and throw her a birthday party.

179
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,720
She'll think it's a birthday party,

180
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,770
but there's a surprise.

181
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,430
Mr. Shen,

182
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,170
I'm about to marry Shu Yan.

183
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,770
You have to come, okay?

184
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,930
(That'd drive you mad.)

185
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,470
Sure.

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,900
When the time comes,

187
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,600
I can even give you a hand.

188
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:03,100
Come on, let's toast.

189
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,200
Happy birthday!

190
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,170
Cheers!

191
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,670
Come on, come on! Happy birthday!

192
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:08,500
Thank you.

193
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,530
Happy birthday.

194
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,070
Back in college,

195
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,330
I took in a white cat.

196
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,430
The name was Bai.

197
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,400
When I was in college,

198
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,730
I also fed a stray cat.

199
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:36,900
It was white too.

200
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,000
It was also named Bai.

201
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,130
So what are your plans

202
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,200
from here on out?

203
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,730
Han Tianyu is going to propose to me

204
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:51,770
on my birthday.

205
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,300
I plan to say yes.

206
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:03,770
Yan.

207
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,100
Congrats on getting married soon.

208
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,170
Are you still mad at me?

209
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,200
Don't be mad.

210
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,300
Please don't be mad at me, okay?

211
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,200
I'm sorry.

212
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:22,200
Please don't be mad.

213
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,670
I really hope things can go back
to what it was.

214
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,100
We can be best friends again.

215
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,630
You're being so weird.

216
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,830
But I don't want to tolerate you.

217
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,570
Shu Yan.

218
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:46,470
You can't avoid me forever!

219
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,130
Shu Yan.

220
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,300
Could you really bear to watch me die?

221
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,370
Why is Shu Yan still not back?

222
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,700
She's been gone so long.

223
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:28,270
What are you doing?

224
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,130
Get out of my sight. Now.

225
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:56,870
Does it hurt?

226
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:58,500
Yeah.

227
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:00,170
I'm fine.

228
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,130
I'm sorry.

229
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,330
I should've come sooner.

230
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,530
We should call the police.

231
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:44,970
No.

232
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:51,930
Ye Wei will get arrested.
Don't ruin our plan.

233
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,430
What the heck was that?

234
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,900
We're supposed to be a couple.
We should sleep in the same room.

235
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:02,170
No way.

236
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:04,630
Once she comes upstairs,

237
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,130
I'm going to her room,

238
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,230
and we'll have a good time.

239
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,630
You scared me!

240
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,600
Why are you here?

241
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,970
I've been waiting for you.

242
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,670
What are you doing here?

243
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,270
Isn't this what you wanted?

244
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,400
Didn't you want excitement?

245
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,830
You're drunk, aren't you?

246
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,670
I'm just really happy.

247
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,270
Shu Yan was worried I'd get hurt,

248
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,770
so she came to save me.

249
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,770
Right now...

250
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,330
I really took everything too lightly.

251
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,330
I thought...

252
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,270
I only had to push Ye Wei
toward Han Tianyu.

253
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:21,730
But it turns out

254
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,230
things aren't that simple.

255
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,530
Ye Wei...

256
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:32,300
Ye Wei didn't just try to kill me,

257
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:36,800
she even took out a knife.

258
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,800
She actually used a knife

259
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,970
to cut her own wrist.

260
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,470
She slashed her own wrist.

261
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:43,500
Do you understand?

262
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,570
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,400
I got here too late.

264
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:50,500
I'll stay by your side to protect you.

265
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,130
I won't let anyone hurt you again.

266
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,780
(Shen Residence)

267
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:47,830
Grandpa.

268
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,330
I told you,

269
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,930
I'll cancel the engagement
with Meng Ya.

270
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,670
Can you stop letting her come over?

271
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:53,730
Whenever she comes,

272
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,970
she's always up to something.

273
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,070
Listen to me.

274
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,900
Your marriage

275
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,970
is not up to you.

276
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,170
When my dad abandoned my mom

277
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,470
to be with Ms. Lin,

278
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,970
was that not his decision?

279
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,700
