4
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,000
(Personnel disciplinary notice.)

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,500
Okay.

6
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,030
So,

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,030
Shu Yan did nothing wrong.

8
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,430
The ones at fault

9
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,800
are her fiancé

10
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,570
and her friend.

11
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:55,630
Yes.

12
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,930
A rep from the other company said

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,170
after she got pregnant,

14
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,400
they decided to forgive her.

15
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,230
So, the whole thing was quietly dropped.

16
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,730
According to our investigation,

17
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,430
all the ideas for the food variety show

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,530
were actually proposed by Shu Yan.

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,970
What about Douli?

20
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,970
Word is, they have been
busy with beta testing.

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,630
According to our evaluation,

22
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,430
this new app they launched

23
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,500
will bring

24
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:20,630
a real shift to the personal-media era.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,270
So, this young lady Shu Yan

26
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,470
has quite an eye for investments.

27
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,000
If her vision and mindset

28
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,130
can keep aligning with Weizhou's,

29
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,130
then that might actually be a good thing

30
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,170
for Norran Entertainment Group.

31
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,470
True.

32
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,430
Chairman.

33
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,070
Let's just

34
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,670
wait and see.

35
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,870
They booked a wedding venue, right?

36
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,370
Yes.

37
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,130
They kept it low-key though.

38
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,730
Hilltop Clubhouse?

39
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,100
That's right.

40
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,700
I got married in my last life there.

41
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,930
The place was an absolute mess.

42
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,000
Then, let's give them

43
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,430
a good slap in the face.

44
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,470
Alright.

45
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,870
Today is our first official date.

46
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,200
Let's not think
about those awful things.

47
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,500
Cheer up.

48
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,600
Okay.

49
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,430
Here.

50
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,930
Are you happy today?

51
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,230
Of course I am.

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,270
Congrats, congrats.

53
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,100
Thanks.

54
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:02,900
Please come in.

55
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,330
Sure.

56
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,300
Congrats.

57
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,400
Congrats.

58
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:07,830
Please come in.

59
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,330
There you are.

60
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,730
So, you really marrying the bestie.

61
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,770
And you said
she wasn't the marrying type.

62
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,530
Don't say that here.

63
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:18,570
Alright.

64
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,970
Where's your wife?

65
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,630
She said she didn't want to
attend a cheater's wedding.

66
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,230
That's harsh.

67
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,770
Isn't that Shu Yan?

68
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,200
When did she become so stunning?

69
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:33,900
Yan.

70
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,200
Congratulations.

71
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,600
But

72
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,670
I thought

73
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,270
it'd be better
to hand this to you in person.

74
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:48,470
Yan.

75
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,330
You came.

76
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,270
You look beautiful today.

77
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,130
But

78
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,000
I really don't need this.

79
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,570
Yan.

80
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,970
Clearly Shu Yan is more beautiful.

81
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,330
How could you

82
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,200
choose her bestie over her?

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,300
Did she dump you or what?

84
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,370
Just zip it
if you have nothing nice to say.

85
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,400
Just kidding.

86
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,300
Go help my mom tidy up.

87
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,530
Okay.

88
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,000
Hurry.

89
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,830
Still the same old you, huh?

90
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,770
Just let it be.

91
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,870
(Civil Lawsuit Petition)

92
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,170
Congrats.

93
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,230
Are you serious?

94
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,000
You are really suing me?

95
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,100
Why are you here?

96
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,100
Ye Wei.

97
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,530
I'm really grateful to you.

98
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,440
What are you trying to say?

99
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,870
I am truly happy for you.

100
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,330
You are finally with him now.

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,830
I know you are not feeling great.

102
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,030
But what's done is done.

103
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,830
You carefully picked up

104
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,770
something I had already thrown away.

105
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,670
Han Tianyu bought me this

106
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,070
when we were planning to marry.

107
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,730
I don't need it now.

108
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,400
So, it is yours.

109
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,500
(The thing she threw away?)

110
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,700
(She had wanted to break up
with Han Tianyu all along?)

111
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,770
(No way.)

112
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,070
Wei's wedding dress is so pretty.

113
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:54,870
Yeah.

114
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,770
It really is.

115
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,300
And now,

116
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,530
let us welcome the most beautiful bride.

117
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,430
Please give a warm round of applause

118
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,300
to welcome the bride

119
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,770
as she makes her grand entrance.

120
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,370
(I snatched him from her.)

121
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,870
(Shu Yan's man and family)

122
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,500
(all belong to me now.)

123
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,700
(I won.)

124
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,530
(Now it is time to start over.)

125
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,570
Let us wish the newlyweds

126
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:51,100
a happy union as husband and wife.

127
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,130
Wait a second.

128
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,900
We are the bride's childhood friends.

129
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,970
Ye Wei.

130
00:06:59,070 --> 00:06:59,730
I'm here.

131
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,830
Your childhood friends?

132
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,500
Sort of.

133
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,330
Who wants to catch the bouquet?

134
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,830
Me.

135
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,800
You want me to catch it?

136
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:13,470
But honestly,

137
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,570
I really do not want yours.

138
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,100
What are you trying to do?

139
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,730
Where did you get the nerve?

140
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,170
How rude and classless.

141
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,300
You must be the cheater's mom.

142
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,230
You do look like a heartbreaker too.

143
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,370
Watch your mouth!

144
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:28,170
Security!

145
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,370
Chase them all out!

146
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,600
It's fine. We will walk out ourselves.

147
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,300
Every second we stay here

148
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,670
makes us sick to our stomachs.

149
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,970
Get lost!

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,830
Bye!

151
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,700
What a joke.

152
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,770
Your classmates are really something.

153
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,700
They were even tougher
when they used to bully me.

154
00:07:57,301 --> 00:07:59,380
(Douli)

155
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,430
Weizhou!

156
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,130
Douli's launch day numbers blew up.

157
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,280
Didn't you already know that?

158
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,030
Yeah.

159
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,830
But,

160
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,370
I'm still so thrilled.

161
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,200
Tell me then,

162
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,570
now that they're married,

163
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,400
do you think your fate has changed?

164
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,030
Maybe.

165
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,270
But,

166
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,500
I should still stay alert.

167
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,530
You get the door.

168
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,430
What are you doing here?

169
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,200
Can't I come back to my own place?

170
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,730
When did you change the passcode?

171
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,330
I came today because I wanted to talk.

172
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:03,300
But judging from the look of things,
it seems like a bad time.

173
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,130
Ms. Shu Yan.

174
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,000
Long time no see.

175
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,100
Allow me to formally introduce myself.

176
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,530
My name is Wu Mengya.

177
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,430
I am Shen Weizhou's

178
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,530
fiancée.

179
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:19,970
You...

180
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,000
You're his fiancée?

181
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,430
Yan...

182
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,870
It is not what you think.

183
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,630
I was going to call and explain,

184
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:33,430
but you kept ignoring my calls.

185
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,130
I could not reach you,

186
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,030
so I had no choice but to come in person

187
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,500
and ask for a time to talk.

188
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,300
Shu Yan,

189
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,330
I can explain everything.

190
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:44,700
Is she telling the truth?

191
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,300
It's true.

192
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,070
She used to be my fiancée.

193
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,500
But after you showed up,

194
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,570
he unilaterally ended the engagement.

195
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:56,900
Wu Mengya!

196
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,770
So, I'm the other woman.

197
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,030
It's not like that!

198
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:06,730
Shu Yan!

199
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:08,870
Shu Yan!

200
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:12,570
You...

201
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,130
I need a moment.

202
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:14,770
Shu Yan!

203
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:15,870
Well?

204
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,570
Do you like the surprise I prepared?

205
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,370
What are you trying to do?

206
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:21,570
What do I want?

207
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,700
I want you back by my side.

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,230
There's no love between us.

209
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,770
But, there's benefit between us.

210
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,400
Fine.

211
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,070
I will give you whatever you want.

212
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,930
But until then,

213
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,030
stay away from me.

214
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,630
Shu Yan!

215
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:35,400
That depends on how you behave.

216
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,500
Shu Yan!
