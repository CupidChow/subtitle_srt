=Episode 17=

4
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,600
This is not bad.

5
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:47,900
Yes.

6
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,270
This is good, right?

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,400
When we want to have a leisure meal

8
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,000
and eat something good,
we can come here.

9
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,270
This is a public area.

10
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,300
Can you be careful?

11
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,270
No one will say anything
if we act openly.

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,870
It's not bad indeed.

13
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,300
Right?

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,670
What?

15
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,900
Are you worried
that your woman might see us?

16
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,130
Wu Mengya,

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
can you shut up?

18
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,670
No.

19
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,330
Baby.

20
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,330
Don't you like this?
Why didn't you take it?

21
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,900
(I underestimated Han Tianyu.)

22
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,530
(He did that with Ye Wei last night)

23
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:33,970
(but he can still pretend
to be infatuated with me.)

24
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:36,030
(It's really disgusting.)

25
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:47,000
(Things don't seem to go
according to plan.)

26
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,100
(If Han Tianyu)

27
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,830
(is a bigger jerk than I imagined...)

28
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,970
(That means it's not over yet.)

29
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,500
Shu Yan,

30
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,830
I will never let you live happily.

31
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,830
I will also not let you get married.

32
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,070
Do you think this needs to be changed?

33
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,130
Hey, Chu Chen.

34
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,400
What's wrong?

35
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,430
You don't seem to be in a good mood.

36
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:58,570
Let me ask you.

37
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,130
Sure.

38
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,470
If

39
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,200
the person you like

40
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,900
has a girlfriend,

41
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,300
what will you do?

42
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,930
I will tell him

43
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,970
and wish him well.

44
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,930
What if he is not happy?

45
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:15,630
For example?

46
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,530
For...

47
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,300
For example...

48
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,830
What if the partner

49
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,070
of the person you like

50
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,070
is having an affair?

51
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,400
I must tell him then.

52
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:27,730
No.

53
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,030
If you tell him,

54
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,880
he will think
that you are doing it on purpose.

55
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,370
I don't care.

56
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,770
If it was me,

57
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,330
I'll surely tell him.

58
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,530
Then,

59
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,200
I'll let him make the decision.

60
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:46,870
She...

61
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,330
Everyone,

62
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,730
I have something to announce.

63
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,630
Due to the release of the food program,

64
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,500
Han Tianyu has a certain fanbase now.

65
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,370
He will be busier from now on,

66
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,300
so he needs an assistant.

67
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,120
Ye Wei, since you don't have
a fixed position now,

68
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,040
you will become Han Tianyu's
personal assistant in the future.

69
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,880
You should get someone else.

70
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,130
I think Ye Wei is suitable.

71
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,400
She knows Tianyu's work

72
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,570
and habits well.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,270
Han Tianyu, you have a magazine
photo shoot this afternoon.

74
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:14,900
Ye Wei,

75
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:16,800
get prepared for the job.

76
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,270
Yes.

77
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Shu Yan.

78
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,530
Shu Yan.

79
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,800
I've reflected on myself
in the last few days.

80
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,200
I was wrong.

81
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,770
Perhaps

82
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,770
I thought of you
as the closest person to me

83
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,300
so I neglected your feelings.

84
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,630
Shu Yan,

85
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,970
can you forgive me?

86
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,100
Yan,

87
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,370
you are too important to me.

88
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,470
I can't lose you.

89
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,030
I will wait for you to calm down.

90
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,870
When you've calmed down,

91
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,530
our relationship will still remain.

92
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:11,830
Don't worry.

93
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,400
I won't disturb your life
after you get married.

94
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,700
We should become each other's light.

95
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,800
Our relationship
shouldn't end like this.

96
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,030
It seems like you are still angry at me.

97
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,600
Thank you for speaking up for me.

98
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,170
Consider it.

99
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,930
I won't disturb you anymore.

100
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,000
If I hadn't
experienced my previous life,

101
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,670
I would've believed her.

102
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,070
It seems like

103
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,930
she knows your weakness well.

104
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,200
She might also be telling the truth too.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,030
Give me a good expression.

106
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,770
Three, two, one.

107
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:15,670
Good.

108
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,370
Three, two, one.

109
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,730
Three, two, one.

110
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,800
Good. Give me a bit of movement as well.

111
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,100
Good.

112
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,600
Three, two, one.

113
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:26,900
Good.

114
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,830
All right. The gaze.

115
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,900
Very good.

116
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,030
Okay.

117
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:35,770
Perfect.

118
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,530
All right,

119
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,470
take a break for now.

120
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:44,670
You've worked hard.

121
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,900
I was looking at the photoshoot angle.

122
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,030
This angle

123
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,430
suits you better.

124
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,430
All right.

125
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,530
Go and take a break.

126
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,730
I'm heading over.
Call me if you need anything.

127
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,800
I think she has fallen for me.

128
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:43,200
No.

129
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,100
It's this leg.

130
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,900
Why are you here?

131
00:07:58,670 --> 00:07:59,870
What are you doing here?

132
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,430
My leg still hurts

133
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:18,030
from the injury last time.

134
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,760
Does it hurt like this?

135
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,730
Tianyu,

136
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:37,970
we can't do this.

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,830
Don't do this.

138
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:27,100
(Assistant Director)

139
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:27,800
This style

140
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,370
is good.

141
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,000
This is not bad.

142
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:30,870
Chen!

143
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,670
Ask Mr. Han to get ready.

144
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:35,262
The next shoot is the white outfit.

145
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,100
Sir.

146
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,030
Sir.

147
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:37,730
Sir.

148
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,730
I couldn't find Mr. Han.

149
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,530
I couldn't find his assistant as well.

150
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,900
Go and find him!

151
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:46,470
I'm in a rush today.

152
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,770
Can you bring the models
for the later photo shoot

153
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,700
forward?

154
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,430
Can you do that?

155
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,030
Sir,

156
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,070
the models are scheduled
to be here tonight.

157
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,000
They are not here yet.

158
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,400
What are you doing?

159
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,100
Can't you do such a little thing?

160
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,900
Get it done immediately.

161
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,100
I have to do the shoot now!

162
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:03,170
I'll go and find him.

163
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,070
85% of the users

164
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:10,800
of the Douli Video Software
are people born in the 90s.

165
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,070
Moreover, 72% of them are young people
from first and second-tier cities.

166
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:17,370
Once this software goes on the market,

167
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,930
it will become the market's trend.

168
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,720
(Future Development)

169
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,920
(Empowering daily life with 5G)

170
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,330
This is the plan.

171
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,000
Mr. Shen.

172
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:27,870
Ms. Shu.

173
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:28,770
Do you think

174
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,570
you have other suggestions?

175
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,630
With your skills

176
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,500
and control,

177
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,170
I don't think there will be any problem.

178
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:35,830
Yes.

179
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,170
I believe a new era

180
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,800
can be created

181
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,130
under your leadership, Mr. He.

182
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:44,530
Thank you for your recognition.

183
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,130
I won't let both of you down.

184
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,770
After doing this,

185
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,230
what will happen to Shu Yan?

186
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:56,870
Will you still marry her?

187
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:57,900
Of course.

188
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,170
What is our relationship then?

189
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,600
What's wrong?

190
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,470
Aren't you buddies?

191
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:06,830

192
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:07,970
capable people

193
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,370
always have two wives.

194
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,630
It's fine.

195
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,240
We just need to
keep it a secret from her.

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,200
We will maintain
this thrilling relationship.

197
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,470
Don't you feel happy
if we can keep doing this?

198
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:26,770
All right.

199
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,630
I have to go to the shoot.

200
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,130
Han Tianyu,

201
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,100
don't try to fool me.

202
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:42,370
I won't let both of you get married.

203
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:45,230
Sorry.

204
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,730
Gosh,

205
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,400
what are you doing?

206
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:50,730
We have a fixed schedule
for the photo shoot.

207
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,930
Do you know
that this is a breach of contract?

208
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,730
I'm going to talk to your company.

209
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,770
Sorry.

210
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,430
Mr. Han wasn't feeling well

211
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,070
so we went to the hospital

212
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,600
and it took some time.

213
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm really sorry.

214
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:05,970
If you feel unwell,

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,700
you should inform us.

216
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,870
Well, how about this?

217
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,600
I'll take responsibility for the loss
you incurred during this period.

218
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,370
You caused the photo shoot to be delayed
due to your disappearance.

219
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,300
Do you know how urgent this is?

220
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,670
Unless

221
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,170
you pay for all the costs
of today's photo shoot.

222
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,900
Then, we won't go to your company.

223
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,530
No, I...

224
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,600
It's all right.

225
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,730
I'll take responsibility.

226
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,300
Calm down.

227
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,670
Let's get back to work, all right?

228
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:30,600
Okay.

229
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,330
No problem.

230
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:31,930
You said so.

231
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,470
All right.

232
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,080
Let's continue.

233
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,770
Get to work.

234
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,170
Thank you.

235
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,830
We should only compensate them
for the two hours when we went missing.

236
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,530
Why should we pay the fees
for the whole photo shoot?

237
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,800
They are obviously
taking advantage of us.

238
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,440
They will surely do this

239
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,700
because they know
I don't want the company to know this.

240
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:03,800
It's fine.

241
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,400
But

242
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,730
you need to pay a lot of money.

243
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,530
It's nothing
if it can be solved with money.

244
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,320
If the company finds out,
we will be in danger.

245
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,830
The damages for breach of contract

246
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,070
might be tenfold compared to
the money I have to pay now.

247
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,170
Sorry, Tianyu.

248
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,830
It's all my fault for being incapable.

249
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:25,570
I can't help you at all.

250
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:32,500
It's all right.

251
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,130
Who do you think I am?

252
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,730
I am your man.

253
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,630
Moreover,

254
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:39,070
I'm making good money from stocks.

255
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,730
I have money.

256
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,730
(The delayed revelation)

257
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,600
(that the head of U Technology
had fled abroad)

258
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,000
(brought alarm bells to the
political and economic industries.)

259
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,520
After the Fourth Meeting
from the Sixth Board of Directors...

260
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,300
(Finance Today)

261
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,160
Wang Zhongyao has been appointed
as the company's general manager.

262
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,170
The delayed revelation

263
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,000
that the head of U Technology
had fled abroad

264
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,400
brought alarm bells to the
political and economic industries.

265
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,170
After the escape of
the head of U Technology,

266
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,730
he has now been missing for 27 days.

267
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,870
What should I do?

268
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,200
Seriously.

269
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,170
Why do all bad things

270
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,670
happen to me?

271
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,570
Then,

272
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:22,700
if you sell them all,

273
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,730
will you cut your losses?

274
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,530
Are you a fool?

275
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,370
The market has crashed
to daily limit-down levels.

276
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,330
Every investor knows about it.

277
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,300
Come on.

278
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,400
Tell me. Who will still buy the stocks?

279
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:36,830
Then, what should we do?

280
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,130
Will I be so annoyed
if I know what to do?

281
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,630
Did you invest everything you have?

282
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,400
The problem is
more serious than you think.

283
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:46,870
I even took a loan.

284
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:48,930
A loan?

285
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:50,930
Then...

286
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,570
What should we do?

287
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:53,900
Miss,

288
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,200
can you stop

289
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,900
talking nonsense?

290
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,770
Oh.

291
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,460
(Shen Weizhou)

292
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,270
Hello.

293
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:14,200
Mr. Bai. All right.
I'm coming immediately.

294
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,630
What should I do?

295
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,270
I can't pay the loan sharks.

296
00:15:27,270 --> 00:15:27,870
That's right.

297
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,230
Shu Yan has money.

298
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,170
Her grandfather left her a house
in her hometown.

299
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,640
If I marry her, everything will be mine.

300
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,720
He didn't tell me
he took a loan with the loan sharks.

301
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,270
It seems like he is getting anxious now.

302
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,600
Let me help you

303
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,900
