=Episode 19=

4
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,900
Let's have lunch outside today.

5
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:51,330
Hello.

6
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,670
Hello.

7
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,230
A ring?

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,100
An engagement ring?

9
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,370
Yes.

10
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,200
I'm engaged.

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,630
You are a good match with Tianyu.

12
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,570
It's so pretty.

13
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:05,330
I envy you a lot.

14
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,330
Congratulations.

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,230
Thank you.

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,670
Go inside.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,870
Move inside.

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,070
Aren't you planning
to cancel the marriage?

19
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,600
Why did you announce it to the public?

20
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,630
I announced it to the public
because I wanted to cancel the marriage.

21
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,930
Then, when things are exposed,

22
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,400
Han Tianyu's career will take a big hit.

23
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:36,700
Don't worry.

24
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,470
I won't be lenient.

25
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,170
This weekend,

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,030
I will make Han Tianyu pay dearly again.

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,200
I'll find some time at the weekend
to let Shu Yan meet my parents.

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,560
My mother has to a attend baking class
at the cultural center.

29
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,570
She's quite busy

30
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,700
and doesn't have time.

31
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,400
It sounds like

32
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,670
an interesting gathering.

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,870
I want to be there too.

34
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,230
Silly Girl.

35
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:00,430
We are meeting my parents.

36
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,430
How can I explain it to my mother
if I bring two women with me?

37
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,970
Come on.

38
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,400
Did something good happen?

39
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,370
Why are you so happy?

40
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,630
Are you discussing

41
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,630
Shu Yan's meeting with your parents?

42
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:16,200
I think it's almost time.

43
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,230
Yes.

44
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,530
I didn't know Tianyu was so considerate.

45
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,070
I'm really looking forward to it.

46
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,330
Is there anything else
that you expect me to do?

47
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:26,870
A good man will buy
a new outfit for his woman

48
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,770
before meeting his parents.

49
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,270
You can't give her a pair of shoes.

50
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,700
Giving a pair of shoes
means chasing her away.

51
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,040
Friends can give shoes as a gift.

52
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,900
Oh.

53
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,230
I see.

54
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,360
It's my first time
meeting someone's parents.

55
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,800
I don't know about it.

56
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,600
Apart from the fridge, there's nothing
else that I need to move from here.

57
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,430
Yan.

58
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
I'm leaving after I give this to you.

59
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,070
This is your birthday gift.

60
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:23,070
(This pair of high heels
have appeared before me again.)

61
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,170
(Are the gears of fate)

62
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,470
(going to start turning again?)

63
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,670
(Whatever.)

64
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,300
(I must change the trajectory
of my fate in this life.)

65
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:34,470
This pair of shoes looks nice.

66
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:36,400
Buy it for me as my birthday gift.

67
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,430
I'll leave them here.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,730
Shu Yan,

69
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,400
besides this,

70
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,700
I also want to give you
another marriage gift.

71
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,100
Baida Square's baking class

72
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,330
makes good cakes.

73
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,370
You and Tianyu like to eat desserts.
I can sign up for the class.

74
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,070
Let's go
and learn it together, all right?

75
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,200
Baida Square's baking class?

76
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,270
You must bake the cake
exactly the same as theirs.

77
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,070
My son loves this shop's desserts.

78
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,280
If you can't replicate it,

79
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,600
bake it a few more times.

80
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,900
(That is where Han Tianyu's mother
attends the baking class.)

81
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,230
(This has never happened in the past.)

82
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,130
(I'm sure Ye Wei has improved)

83
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,830
(because of my change in attitude.)

84
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,500
What?

85
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,270
Don't you...

86
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,230
Don't you feel like going?

87
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,370
No.

88
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,630
Thank you.

89
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,930
Shu Yan, thank you
for giving me an opportunity.

90
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,730
I was drunk last night.

91
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,920
It was my fault.
Thank you for letting go of the past.

92
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,170
I won't disappoint you again.

93
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,170
I will do my best
to become your new ray of light.

94
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,200
My best buddy.

95
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,230
(I'm sure
I don't have the talent to act.)

96
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,630
(It's too tiring.)

97
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,230
(I know this is a bait)

98
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,870
(and I still have to pretend
to take it.)

99
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,170
I'm leaving then.

100
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,170
All right.

101
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,930
This is great.

102
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,900
If the villain isn't that evil,

103
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,130
I might become soft-hearted.

104
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Since all of you
are going to be evil until the end,

105
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,030
I'm really grateful.

106
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,280
(Cat Boarding Agreement)

107
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,230
Tell me honestly.

108
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,930
Where are you going?

109
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
Why did you
send Bai to boarding suddenly?

110
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,800
(Many things have changed now.)

111
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:19,730
(I don't know)

112
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,000
(when my accident will happen)

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,880
(and whether it might
be brought forward or not.)

114
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,170
(If the time comes,)

115
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,330
(Shu Yan will be left alone
without support again.)

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,280
I'm just preparing for the worst.

117
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:31,570
That's right.

118
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
I need your help

119
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,200
with something.

120
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:35,930
Say it.

121
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,370
However, you must

122
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,470
keep this a secret from grandpa.

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,900
I want to transfer all the properties
under my name to Shu Yan.

124
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,830
What?

125
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,600
Are you crazy?

126
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,630
If the old chairman
finds out about this,

127
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:49,700
he won't agree to it.

128
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,600
Have you experienced
losing the person you love the most?

129
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,970
If you are given another chance,

130
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,800
you will surely
give her everything you have

131
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,960
because you're afraid
that you won't do enough for her.

132
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,770
It's true.

133
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,830
I've loved you before.

134
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:17,970
What do you mean?

135
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,800
I think the three of us won't work.

136
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,300
To protect the relationship
between the three of us,

137
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,970
some things must be sacrificed.

138
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,100
What are you trying to say?

139
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,100
I'm going to marry Shu Yan.

140
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,300
You know that.

141
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,270
If I met you first,

142
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,200
I guarantee

143
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,330
I will love you until I can't resist.

144
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,570
However, this is fate.

145
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,800
So,

146
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,370
I think we should break up.

147
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,600
Are you trying to silence me?

148
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,570
Don't worry, Tianyu.

149
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,100
I won't say anything.

150
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,470
I will never let you feel unhappy.

151
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,900
This isn't about being happy or not.

152
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,330
It's just

153
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,870
responsibility.

154
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,030
Yes.

155
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,670
Responsibility.

156
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,030
Responsibility.

157
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,130
Hello, Teacher.

158
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:29,900
Hello, Yan.

159
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,970
Let's begin.

160
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,300
Move.

161
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,600
This is my spot.

162
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,370
Your name isn't written here.

163
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,830
How is it your spot?

164
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,670
We all spent money
on attending the class.

165
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:45,900
Why are you special?

166
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,370
You need to obey your elders.

167
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,000
Move.

168
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,600
Hello, Madam.

169
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,100
I'm sorry.

170
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,430
It's our first time here

171
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,570
and we don't know the rules.

172
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:57,500
We'll leave now.

173
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,900
Why should you apologize?

174
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,760
Acting superior because she's older.
How rude.

175
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,770
Miss,

176
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,170
you are so sensible.

177
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,630
Unlike someone

178
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,700
who has no manners at all.

179
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,560
(Norran Entertainment)

180
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,400
Hello, Manager Yang.

181
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,870
Help me deliver this document later.

182
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,400
Sure.

183
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:22,500
(Husband)

184
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,770
What is it?

185
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,070
Mom, I'm hungry.

186
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,900
Where's Dad?

187
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,000
Isn't he at home?

188
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,400
He has gone out because he is busy.

189
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,730
He went out?

190
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:34,630
Where did he go?

191
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,700
I don't know.

192
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,730
I want you, Mom.

193
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,700
Mu, be a good girl. Stay home.

194
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,800
I'm coming back right now.

195
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,400
Where are you going?

196
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,800
I have an emergency back home.

197
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,130
Can you send me home?

198
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,130
Get in.

199
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:52,730
All right.

200
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,970
Mr. Bai, thank you for sending me home.

201
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:16,830
I'm leaving.

202
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:22,630
Bye.

203
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,900
You only stay at home and do nothing.

204
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,000
You couldn't even take care of Mu
when I asked you to.

205
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,370
I can't rely on you to do anything.

206
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,300
I'm taking care of the child every day.

207
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,700
Can't I go out and do something?

208
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:37,970
Do something?

209
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:40,570
You're always hanging out
with your friends

210
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,630
and playing with your phone on the sofa.

211
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:46,270
Mu is still growing
and you're feeding her instant noodles?

212
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,320
What's wrong
with eating instant noodles?

213
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,870
You work overtime every day

214
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,870
and think you make hundreds of millions.

215
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:56,670
You...

216
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,030
Eat.

217
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,870
Miss,

218
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,030
for a beginner,
you are doing really well.

219
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,300
Unlike some other people.

220
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,720
I don't even know what she's making.

221
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:20,270
Madam,

222
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,370
I like to cook

223
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,470
normally.

224
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,630
I'm also interested

225
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,900
in baking.

226
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,900
Really?

227
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,830
Young girls

228
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,170
should learn from you.

229
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,270
Unlike some people

230
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,930
who have really ugly cakes.

231
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,370
It's not for you.

232
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,470
How is it your business?

233
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:36,770
What?

234
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:37,800
What did you say?

235
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,670
I'm saying that my boyfriend
knows how to make this.

236
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,070
He can make it for me.

237
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:43,400
It's none of your business.

238
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,000
If you can talk back to me,

239
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,670
you should think about

240
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,000
doing what the teacher asked.

241
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,330
I'm done.

242
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,830
Gosh, Ms. Shu.

243
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,670
This is a really nice cake.

244
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,070
You are amazing.

245
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,570
Dear.

246
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,130
Tianyu.

247
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,000
Why are you here?

248
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:14,530
Yan.

249
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,270
I want to shop at the store in front.

250
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,230
Come with me.

251
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,430
Wei,

252
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,630
Tianyu is here

253
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,430
to buy a new set of clothes for me

254
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,330
so I can wear it
when we meet his parents.

255
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:25,030
Why don't you join us?

256
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,270
You have better taste than me.

257
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,300
I need you to help me out.

258
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,970
There's no need to trouble Wei.

259
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,600
Your taste now is good.

260
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:36,730
All right.

261
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,930
Since Tianyu will accompany Yan,

262
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,030
I'll be leaving then.

263
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:41,070
Great.

264
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,000
Wei, Bye.

265
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,400
It's fine, Yan.

266
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,570
Let's meet again next time.

267
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:46,700
I gave you

268
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,600
your birthday gift and wedding gift.

269
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:49,770
Next time,

270
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,770
you must treat me to a feast.

271
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:52,800
All right.

272
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,500
Let's meet again next time.

273
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,930
The two of us haven't
gone on a date for so long.

274
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,170
Let's go.

275
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,000
Yan,

276
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,270
remember

277
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,770
that you saved my life.

278
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,130
I survived

279
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,700
because of you.

280
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,070
Of course.

281
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,130
(Of course, I will remember)

282
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,800
(that I died because of you.)

283
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,430
Grandpa.

284
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:33,900
Meng Ya, you're here.

285
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,070
There's no need to visit me every day.

286
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,930
Young people like you
should do your own things.

287
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:41,800
That won't do.

288
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,300
I've not had

289
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:45,030
any family since young.

290
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,630
My elders passed away early.

291
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,400
The only family member I have

292
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,730
is you, grandpa.

293
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,500
You are such a sweet talker.

294
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,000
Here.

295
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,830
Have some tea.

296
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,300
Grandpa,

297
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,570
have you heard about Douli?

298
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,330
Is there a reason why you mention this?

299
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,200
The person in charge
of this company came to me previously.

300
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,670
He was a fraud

301
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,630
so I rejected him.

302
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,700
However, Weizhou

303
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,500
invested in this company
for some reason.

304
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,500
I wonder who charmed him.

305
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,800
What do you think?

306
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,430
Just let it be for now.

307
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,630
Weizhou will sober up one day.
