00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,860
You...

5
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:47,030
You...

6
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,979
- You are attacking someone.
- Where does this mad woman come from?

7
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,430
You are the mad woman. Not me.

8
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:53,879
- The police are here. Run.
- Let's go.

9
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,630
Let's go.

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,560
Thank you.

11
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,260
You are welcome.

Defeating the evil dragon

13
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:14,460
to save our young men

14
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,630
is our mission.

15
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,260
Are you okay?

16
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,579
Since we are fated to meet each other,
let's go treasure hunting together.

17
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:25,400
Let's go.

18
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,200
What are you looking for?

19
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,230
You...

20
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:37,900
Tell me.

21
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,800
How about

22
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,649
you tell me where you live?

23
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,830
I'll send you home.

24
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,260
I'm looking for treasure.

25
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,860
Look. I found it.

26
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,630
This is an amulet.

27
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,060
There's a...

28
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,460
There's a special symbol on top.

29
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,830
Can you see it?

30
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,830
This was from my grandpa.

31
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,930
He said that it could bring
its owner beautiful blessings.

32
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,560
Your grandpa must have loved you.

33
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,500
But he has become a star in the sky now.

34
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,479
I miss him so much.

35
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,379
I miss him so much.

36
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,309
Don't cry.

37
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,760
What about your other family members?

38
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,360
My parents

39
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,360
abandoned me when I was very young.

40
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,400
Don't look so sad.

41
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,730
You should smile more.

42
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,579
My grandpa taught me this.

43
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,600
According to him, this is

44
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,160
how you give someone your blessings.

45
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:30,060
Now, I'll give you my blessings.

46
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,630
Wake up.

47
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,160
Don't sleep here.

48
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,079
Where's your house?

49
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,260
I'll send you home.

50
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,130
Bai.

51
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,960
Let me tell you a secret.

52
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:18,879
I was drunk last night.

53
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,379
When I woke up,

54
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,260
I was sleeping on the grass.

55
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,500
And a stranger was sleeping beside me.

56
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,460
Do you think he's a pervert?

57
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,249
Otherwise, who would sleep

58
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,509
beside someone

59
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,600
who was obviously drunk?

60
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,530
Now that I think about it,
it was quite dangerous.

61
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,309
I should quit drinking after this.

62
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,200
I swear...

63
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,530
I swear to you.

64
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,909
I won't drink ever again.

65
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,900
Okay?

66
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,000
Shu Yan.

67
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,709
We have to go to class.

68
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,579
Let's go.

69
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,749
I have to go.

70
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,909
I'll visit you again next time.

71
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,279
Let's go.

72
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,060
Okay.

73
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,909
Bai, you've met someone kind.
You have a shelter now.

74
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,880
Unfortunately,
I can't bring you back to the hostel.

75
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,149
Sir.

76
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,130
You have to be hospitalized
for around half a month.

77
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,049
Okay.

78
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,230
Thank you.

79
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,760
Excuse me.

80
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:10,949
Do you know

81
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:13,400
who's the girl who always
feeds a kitten here?

82
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,430
No.

83
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,530
Thank you.

84
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,660
You are welcome.

85
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,130
Bai.

86
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,230
Bai.

87
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:48,900
Listen to me.

88
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,779
He is our company's newly signed artist.

89
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,149
Mr. Shen Weizhou.

90
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,230
Let's welcome him.

91
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,930
(It's her.)

92
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,800
(Am I too late?)

93
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,079
I'm sorry.

94
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,330
I'm tipsy.

95
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,460
Did I nag too much?

96
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,930
What you said

97
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,230
will come true.

98
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,030
But sometimes,
you can't achieve something

99
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,830
through hard work alone.

100
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,000
For some,

101
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,449
they are born into

102
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,230
a great life that others
can never achieve.

103
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,960
For some, the efforts
they've put in their whole life

104
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:45,909
can be

105
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:48,530
easily crushed by someone more superior.

106
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,730
Maybe that's fate.

107
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,200
But we

108
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,160
have to work hard

109
00:07:58,550 --> 00:07:59,779
to make our dream come true,

110
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,660
right?

111
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,730
Thank you.

112
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:13,960
Cheers.

113
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,530
Thank you for comforting me today.

114
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,530
I'm home now.

115
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,060
See you tomorrow.

116
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,730
See you tomorrow.

117
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,360
I know that this is not right.

118
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,500
But I can't help myself.

119
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:53,330
Just consider this a dream
under the influence of alcohol.

120
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,309
(Shu Yan.)

121
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:14,779
(Ye Wei)

122
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,309
(Why didn't you pick up my call?)

123
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,700
(I really don't know
why our classmates would act that way.)

124
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:21,349
(I just wanted to resolve the past)

125
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:23,400
(so that you wouldn't be
traumatized by it anymore.)

126
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,379
(We are best friends.)

127
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,160
(I won't hurt you.)

128
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,309
(Han Tianyu)
(Shu Yan)

129
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,530
(What's wrong with you?)

130
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,849
(Ye Wei and I waited
outside your house for so long.)

131
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:36,760
(You didn't pick up our calls either.
I have already sent her home.)

132
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,279
(You are her friend.)

133
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,330
(If there's a misunderstanding,
just talk it out.)

134
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,030
(We'll talk tomorrow.)

135
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,660
Please marry each other
as soon as possible.

136
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,130
Hurry up and stay out of my life.

137
00:09:59,080 --> 00:09:59,930
Hello?

138
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,530
Sorry

139
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,530
for calling you so late at night.

140
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,509
Am I disturbing you?

141
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,530
No.

142
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,900
I was working late today.

143
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,130
So, I didn't have time to reply to you.

144
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,500
Well.

145
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:16,430
How have you been

146
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,949
for the past few years?

147
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,749
I

148
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,960
really regret what I said to you

149
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,130
back then.

150
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,449
I'm sorry, Shu Yan. I accidentally
told him that you like him.

151
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:29,100
Look. It's Chu Chen.

152
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,000
Shu Yan.

153
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,330
Do you think you are that popular?

154
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,000
I hate you too.

155
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,660
I'm about to transfer to another school.
Let's not see each other ever again.

156
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,830
Then

157
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,549
why did you

158
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,079
say those things to me back then?

159
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,900
Because of your letter.

160
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,100
I was hurt.

161
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,630
My letter?

162
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,730
Have you forgotten?

163
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,479
Back then, I burned the midnight oil

164
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,030
to write a letter to confess to you.

165
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,879
Forget it.

166
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,700
It's too late.

167
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,230
Wait.

168
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,509
Are you saying

169
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,930
that you wrote me a letter

170
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,709
and I wrote you a letter in return?

171
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,730
Yes.

172
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,030
I still have

173
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,560
that letter with me until now.

174
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,000
Chu Chen.

175
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,630
Let's have a talk face-to-face tomorrow.

176
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,730
Bring my letter with me.

177
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,660
Okay.

178
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,700
(I didn't write any letter back then.)

179
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,530
Shu Yan.

180
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:41,000
Since childhood,

181
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,860
you can only take what I give you.

182
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:45,960
You shouldn't take

183
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,700
what you want without my permission.

184
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,800
It's time to punish you.

185
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,700
After all,

186
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,860
I've endured it for too long.

187
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,509
I think this looks quite good.

188
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,049
Yes.

189
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,479
We'll do it this way.

190
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,149
Right?

191
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,400
Okay.

192
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,979
(We'll support you. We love you.)

193
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,210
(Zhou)

194
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,330
You look beautiful today.

195
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,379
I went shopping with Jiaojiao yesterday.

196
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,349
And I wanted

197
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,930
to change my style.

198
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,949
Right?

199
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,179
Shu Yan is beautiful.

200
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,000
Yes.

201
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,709
Are you still my girlfriend?

202
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,160
I can't recognize you anymore.

203
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,749
I want to give you a surprise.

204
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,640
It's long overdue for you
to dress up like this.

205
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,530
You are beautiful.

206
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,760
Mr. Shen.

207
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,000
Have a cup of water.

208
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,560
Shu Yan.

209
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,379
The show is about to start soon.

210
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,800
Why are you chatting here
instead of getting the show ready?

211
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,560
I...

212
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,660
Mr. Shen.

213
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,760
Let me bring you to your changing room.

214
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:22,879
Han Tianyu.

215
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,349
- Let's go.
- Let's get changed together.

216
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,300
Me?

217
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:26,679
Baby.

218
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,279
Let's talk

219
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,549
after the show.

220
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,560
Go ahead.

221
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,530
You look so sweet together.

222
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,260
Your boyfriend really clings to you.

223
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,109
Yan.

224
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,800
You look beautiful today.

225
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,709
We should stop chatting.

226
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:42,679
Let's brace ourselves

227
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,700
and get our job done today.

228
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,730
Okay.

229
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,330
(I'll support you. Zhou.)

230
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,749
Shu Yan.

231
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,379
Look.

232
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,800
Tianyu is so hot.

233
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,560
He looks okay.

234
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,079
If you like him,

235
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,160
you can have him.

236
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,630
What nonsense are you talking about?

237
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,709
(I love you.)
Zhou! Shen Weizhou!

238
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,480
- So handsome!
- So hot!

239
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:20,230
Shen Weizhou.

240
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:23,130
(He has so many female fans.)

241
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:28,330
Shu Yan.

242
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,179
What is it?

243
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,679
You look beautiful today.

244
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,060
So many men are staring at you.

245
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,800
I'm jealous.

246
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,130
I'm the only one
who can look at you. Right?

247
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,560
