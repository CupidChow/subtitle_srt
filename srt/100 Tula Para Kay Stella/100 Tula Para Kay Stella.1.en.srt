So you won't hate her.

48
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,855
She should have given you a shirt, too.

49
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,565
Anyway,

50
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,567

Wear that on Freshie's Night.

Can we do the sound check?

69
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,421

Are you the one singing?

87
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:41,299
Am I being haunted now?

88
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,222
Why don't you go inside?

89
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,975
I'll just go...

90
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:55,397
-Huh?
-[stammering] I'll just go home.

91

Why?

92
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:02,862
My pants are...

94
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:12,372
Stand up.

Good to go.

101
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:55,915
Thank God it didn't rain.

102
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,793
They said it would rain.

103
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:01,504
Haven't brought an umbrella
for three years now.

104
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,592
What do you like more, sunny or rainy?

105
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:07,427
Sunny.

106
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,595
What?

107
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,681
I hate gloomy weather.

108
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,016
Really?

109
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,770

You don't talk much, do you?

113
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,260
I have a speech defect.

114
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:54,933
I don't stutter when I read.
I do when I speak long sentences.

115
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:59,688
That's why I limit myself
to three words per sentence.

116
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,731
Why limit to three?

117
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,817
So I won't stutter.

118
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,403
So what if you stutter?

119
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,697
They'll laugh at me.

00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,366
Then what?

122
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,827
So what if they laugh?

123
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,912
We're in college now.

124
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:19,040
College is the time to know yourself.

125
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,793
Once you do...

126
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:23,920
be proud.

127
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,635

00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:30,333
but cute.

190
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,587
[stammers] Will it get published?

191
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:35,672
Well,

192
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:38,967
[in English] that's up
to the literary editor to decide.

193
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,761
[in Tagalog] Let's just wait
for the next issue, okay?

194
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,056
[boy] Mr. Rasul is here!

195
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,395
[Mr. Rasul speaking English]
Good morning, class.

196
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,438
[all] Good morning, sir.

197
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:52,480
[Mr. Rasul] Walking, right?

198
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:53,815
[all] Yes, sir.

199
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,899
[Stella] Sir!

200
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,235
[in Tagalog] Sorry, I'm late.

201
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:59,404
Why is your lipstick black, miss?

202
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,363
[all laughing]

203
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:02,782
Why is the sky blue?

204
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,200
[all laughing]

205
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:05,952
Why is your blood red?

206
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:09,581
Sir, why do we turn yellow with hepatitis?

207
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:10,957
[all laughing]

208
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,709
Ever thought about that?

209
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,502
Figure it out, sir.

210
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,962
[Stella] Shh...

211
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,591
[Mr. Rasul speaking English] We do
walking almost every day.

212
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:22,427
[in Tagalog] Why is it in PE?

213
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,638
What's up with your shorts?

214
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:29,392
Why did you take walking for PE?

215
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,561
It's easy.

216
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,072
[panting]

217
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,657
Are you all right?

218
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:46,743
Yes.

219
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,250
-[Fidel retching]
-[Stella] <i>Go. Just let it out.</i>

220
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:56,127
[Fidel gasping]

221
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,629
[Fidel] Sorry, it's disgusting.

222
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:58,922
Don't look.

223
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,840
Disgusting?

224
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:03,134
You should've seen me
when I first got drunk.

225
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,095
You practice race walking later.

226
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,806
[both imitating stammering]
Are you okay, Fidel?

227
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:09,933
Pregnant, right?

228
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:12,143
Is this how you throw up?

229
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,647
[imitating retching]

230
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,441
Want me to kick your balls?

231
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,323
I guess I'll see my bandmates.

232
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,244
-Stella?
-Mmm?

233
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,081
[stammers] I love to write...

234
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,000
poems.

235
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:35,959
Really?

236
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,213
And then?

237
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,595
[stammering] I can't talk properly.

238
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:53,810
I also suck at an easy
PE class like walking.

239
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:57,981
You must think...

240
00:14:58,273 --> 00:14:59,357
I'm a wimp.

241
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,735
Of course not.

242
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,071
You're the only one who thinks so.

243
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,994
[stammers] I submitted

244
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:15,165
one of my poems to<i> The Seedling.</i>

245
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,583
Mmm-hmm?

246
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,544
Wait for it in the next issue.

247
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:21,796
Okay. I'll wait for it.

248
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:23,715
What's the title?

249
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,175
Just wait.

250
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:26,968
What is it?

251
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,511
You'll see.

252
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,347
Bummer.

253
00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:33,350
[Fidel]<i> Poem number two: "Destiny."</i>

254
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,186
<i>"I don't believe in destiny</i>

255
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,772
<i>But now I think I do</i>

256
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,066
<i>I am thrilled and happy</i>

257
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,692
<i>I hope this pushes through"</i>

258
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:46,529
<i>Poem number seven: "Bad Luck Magnet."</i>

259
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,449
<i>"I am a bad luck magnet</i>

260
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:51,951
<i>Failed by my pants and stomach</i>

261
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:54,579
<i>I am amazed that sometimes</i>

262
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,998
<i>Bad luck comes with surprises"</i>

263
00:15:57,582 --> 00:16:00,001
[Stella] Have you been
to the other side of Mt. Arayat?

264
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:01,628
[Fidel] Not yet.

265
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,755
[Stella] Come on, let's go!

266
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,258
I have class.

267
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:08,760
Jeez!

268
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,012
Just this once.

269
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:12,722
I can't.

270
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,892
Next time, come with me.

271
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:36,496
Ma'am...

272
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,791
[stammering] Why wasn't it published?

273
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,335
Is it bad?

274
00:16:42,711 --> 00:16:45,005
[in English] Fidel,
it doesn't mean it's bad.

275
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:46,923
I'm sorry,

276
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:50,176
[in Tagalog] but the literary editor
might be looking for something else.

277
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:54,097
[in English] Let me guess.

278
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,474
You wanted someone to see the poem.

279
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:00,895
[in Tagalog] The girl with black lipstick?

280
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,691
Is that why you're so affected?

281
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,195
Fidel, just give it to her directly.

282
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,573
It's for her anyway, right?

283
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,200
Ma'am,

284
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:18,872
I have written many poems for her.

285
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,582
Uh-huh...

286
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,585
Can you pick...

287
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:28,214
Can you pick the best...

288
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:30,216
for her?

289
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,554
[chuckles] How many are there?

290
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:36,181
Ten.

291
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,643
[in English] How sweet.

292
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,312
[in Tagalog] Give her all of them.

293
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,689
[in English] I'm sure she'll be flattered.

294
00:17:45,732 --> 00:17:47,025
[Barrie in Tagalog] <i>Skip class tomorrow.</i>

295
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,818
Let's just hang out.

296
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,989
I might flunk. My sister will scold me.

297
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:56,368
Won't it just be
your first time skipping class?

298
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,828
You got a point.

299
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,039
Actually, tomorrow,

300
00:18:01,122 --> 00:18:04,292
I've only got NatSci and PE.
I think we can hang out.

301
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:05,960
[in English] Nice!

302
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,837
[in Tagalog] I want to go AWOL.

303
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,839
Why go AWOL?

304
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:11,716
Stella,

305
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,677
we're special.

306
00:18:14,302 --> 00:18:16,388
We were born to rock and roll.

307
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:20,183
My socio prof said,

308
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,060
[in English] "Formal education

309
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:24,437
only seeks to manufacture workers

310
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,398
for greedy capitalists."

311
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:30,068
[in Tagalog] Shall we join the system
or revolt against it?

312
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,363
You're actually deep.

313
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,531
But stubborn.

314
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:35,657
[chuckles]

315
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,951
Come here, you.

316
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,994
Stop it!

317
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,830
I'm ticklish.

318
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,332
[both laughing]

319
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,713
Fine! I'll skip class tomorrow.

320
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,631
[Barrie] Really?
[Stella] Yes.

321
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:54,134
Son, let's eat.

322
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,553
I'm not hungry.

323
00:18:58,013 --> 00:18:59,472
Are you okay?

324
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:03,059
How's school?

325
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:05,270
Fine.

326
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:09,149
Know what, son?

327
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,985
You must do well in school.

328
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,571
Once you graduate,

329
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:16,031
I'm sure

330
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,492
companies will fight over you.

331
00:19:21,411 --> 00:19:22,787
[in English] Ten seconds more.

332
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,790
The higher the pulse rate,
the healthier you are.

333
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:31,671
Okay, time's up!

334
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,518
Excuse me.

335
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:47,437
Lansangan, right?

336
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,440
[in Tagalog] We're classmates in Comm.

337
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,275
[in English] I'm Danica Sandico.

338
00:19:53,234 --> 00:19:55,487
[in Tagalog] I sit in the front.

339
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:59,491
Anyway, we're going to study
for the midterms.

340
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,159
Want to come?

341
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,080
[indistinct]

342
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:07,540
Let's go?

343
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:08,625
Okay.

344
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:15,423
[in English] See? You made it
through two semesters already.

345
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:17,175
[in Tagalog] Time flies so fast, right?

346
00:20:17,258 --> 00:20:21,346
The other day you were just scolding us
over our failed reporting.

347
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,639
-Mmm-hmm.
-Right?

348
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,307
[all laughing]

349
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,600
Ma'am.

350
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:26,518
[in English] Yes?

351
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:31,523
[stammers] Ma'am, when can we see
our grades in Social Science 2?

352
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:34,442
[in Tagalog] Don't worry. You all passed.

353
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:35,777
[all cheering]

354
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,989
[imitates stammering] Mr. Grade-conscious,

355
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,783
let's eat first!

356
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:44,244
Indeed. So, you brats,

357
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,621
let's party!

358
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,206
[all chattering]

359
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:08,810
Don't worry, Mr. Lansangan.

360
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,647
You got the highest grade.

361
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,610
Are you planning
on transferring to Manila?

362
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,240
I don't know yet, ma'am.

363
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:45,305
My sisters will kill me.

364
00:21:45,764 --> 00:21:48,350
I got horrible grades.

365
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:50,060
All of my classes.

366
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:54,397
Even Psych 101?

367
00:21:55,732 --> 00:21:57,275
Especially Psych 101.

368
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:00,737
That class was very easy!

369
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:03,573
It's because...

370
00:22:04,616 --> 00:22:06,076
It's because you're stubborn!

371
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:09,913
[stammering] You waste your time
on unimportant things!

372
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,332
Why don't you just study hard?

373
00:22:12,415 --> 00:22:14,250
You're always late.

374
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:15,710
You're always absent.

375
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:18,588
You go... You go to class groggy.

376
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:22,634
The band gets a lot gigs lately.
I need time for--

377
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:25,512
Think about your future!

378
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:29,516
You can't always live in the moment!

379
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,151
[in English] Sorry.

380
00:22:47,826 --> 00:22:49,244
[in Tagalog] Don't be sorry.

381
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,496
You're right.

382
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:54,833
Can you...

383
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:57,043
help me with my studies next school year?

384
00:22:59,254 --> 00:23:00,755
Please?

385
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:11,266
If... If help is all you need...

386
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:14,102
why not?

387
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,273
But...

388
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:21,901
help is all I can give.

389
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:26,740
You have to do the actual work.

390
00:23:27,824 --> 00:23:29,117
Of course.

391
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:32,912
So,

392
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,165
see you in June.

393
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,335
Take care.

394
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,003
You too.

395
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:53,308
<i>Poem number 12, "Study Buddy."</i>

396
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:56,311
<i>"In our Biology class next semester</i>

397
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:59,189
<i>We will examine the frogs and tadpoles</i>

398
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:01,649
<i>If ever we're classmates in Chemistry</i>

399
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:06,029
<i>We will study... free electrons?"</i>

400
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,574
<i>Poem number 20: "LPA."</i>

401
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,285

00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:13,912
<i>But I fear none</i>

403
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:15,747
<i>Just one gaze at you</i>

404
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,083
<i>And I have my sun"</i>

405
00:25:03,128 --> 00:25:04,337
Fidel!

406
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:08,633
-Stella!
-What's up?

407
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:13,471
Check out that hair! Why so nice?

408
00:25:13,805 --> 00:25:15,724
Let's fix it.

409
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:17,434
Hey!

410
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:18,560
Hey!

411
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:19,644
What?

412
00:25:21,896 --> 00:25:23,189
I'm just not used to it.

413
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:30,530
[stammers] I'm not used to seeing you
without your makeup and lipstick.

414
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:32,282
Does it look bad?

415
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:33,533
No!

416
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:35,785
What's your schedule?

417
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:36,870
Here. I just got it.

418
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:39,039
Let me see.

419
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:40,749
Look.

420
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:43,418
We're classmates in Hum 1 and Comm 3.

421
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:44,961
So early!

422
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:48,131
[in English] Hi, guys! Stella Puno.

423
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:49,215
Psych.

424
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,676
[in Tagalog] I love music.

425
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:54,971
My favorite band is Rivermaya.

426
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:58,099
I also love Barbie's Cradle.
Of course, Sugarfree.

427
00:25:58,183 --> 00:26:00,268
-[boy] Go, Tampururaught!
-[chuckles]

428
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,687
We've disbanded.

429
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:05,357
Studies first.

430
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:08,068
[in English] Hi.

431
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:11,404
My name is Fidel Lansangan.
I am 18 years old--

432
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:12,489
What are you reading?

433
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,116
This is Communication 3.

434
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,660
You're supposed to learn
how to speak spontaneously.

435
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:23,166
[stammers in Tagalog]
Sir, I can recite better when I use--

436
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:24,751
[in English] Put it down.

437
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:36,471
[in Tagalog] <i>Poem number 20: "Rose."</i>

438
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:38,390
<i>"Under that black lipstick</i>

439
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:40,475
<i>Are rose-colored lips</i>

440
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:42,310
<i>She still looks cool</i>

441
00:26:42,394 --> 00:26:44,854
<i>Ever extraordinary"</i>

442
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:49,442
[singing in English] <i>Somebody owns you now</i>

443
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:53,279
<i>I'll try to live somehow</i>

444
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,657
[in Tagalog] Amazing how they came
up with those lyrics.

445
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,825
So sad!

446
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:58,326
It's brilliant.

447
00:26:58,743 --> 00:26:59,661
Let's rewind.

448
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,749
That's what I like
about Filipino music today.

449
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:08,586
They focus on the emotions.

450
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:11,297
Not much sexy stuff.

451
00:27:11,631 --> 00:27:14,426
No corny digital instruments.

452
00:27:15,468 --> 00:27:16,761
[chuckles]

453
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,430
-Right?
-Mmm.

454
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:23,768
Know what?

455
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:25,770
I'll lend this to you.

456
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:26,980
Which one?

457
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:28,064
This.

458
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,275
I want this back.

459
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:32,360
Take care of it. It's my favorite.

460
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:35,030
I'll lend you the others, too.

461
00:27:36,197 --> 00:27:37,407
Here.

462
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:40,702
What? They're good. Listen to Sugarfree.

463
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,871
Try track four.

464
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:44,414
People are...

465
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:47,584
People are using CDs now.

466
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,669
Why all these tapes?

467
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:53,173
I don't like CDs. They break easily.

468
00:27:53,506 --> 00:27:54,424
Besides,

469
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:57,010
I don't have a player.

470
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:02,349
Do you have...

471
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:05,143
a recording of...

472
00:28:07,687 --> 00:28:10,023
that song you performed
last Freshies' Night?

473
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:13,777
No, I don't.

474
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,782
We were supposed to record
a demo last summer.

475
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,409
But Barrie and I broke up.

476
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:26,206
Career and love life never
go well with each other.

477
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:28,416
Broke up?

478
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,589
Grab your stuff. Hurry!

479
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,926
Hurry up! Come, I'll show something.

480
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:40,762
-Come on.
-Stella, wait!

481
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:43,473
-What? Hurry!
-This is the ladies' room!

482
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:45,725
[stammers] They might think I'm peeping.

483
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:47,560
Do you see anybody else?

484
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:49,729
Hurry up. Close the door.

485
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,023
Get in!

486
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,034
Stella.

487
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:05,370
Shh.

488
00:29:11,418 --> 00:29:13,712
Look at these.
[giggles]

489
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:17,132
[Fidel] "Who's your crush?"

490
00:29:17,632 --> 00:29:20,385
[Stella] This barely had
any responses back then.

491
00:29:21,094 --> 00:29:23,763
Look at it now!

492
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:25,390
[Fidel] Have you answered?

493
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:29,936
[in English] Secret!

494
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,521
[in Tagalog] Seriously.

495
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:33,523
Where's your answer?

496
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,650
-You wanna know?
-Mmm.

497
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:41,281
[Fidel] Hmm?

498
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:44,492
[stammers] What? Our teacher in Walking?

499
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,702
Yes.

500
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,038
Seriously?

501
00:29:48,121 --> 00:29:50,248
[laughing]

502
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:53,335
Of course not!

503
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:55,253
That's foolish!

504
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:57,756
I'm sure most of the answers
here aren't serious.

505
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,759
You really believed I had
a crush on Mr. Rasul?

506
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:02,635
Marker.

507
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,679
Hand me a marker.

508
00:30:08,725 --> 00:30:14,272
FIDEL "HUGE" LANSANGAN

509
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:15,982
[Fidel] What are you doing?

510
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:20,820
What is that?

511
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:21,905
Why?

512
00:30:22,364 --> 00:30:27,702
When girls who know you read this,
and they encounter you on the campus,

513
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:30,663
they will never look at you
the same way again.

514
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,041
Genius!

515
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:34,876
-You are crazy.
-[woman calling out]

516
00:30:34,959 --> 00:30:35,877
[knock on door]

517
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,837
[woman] Is anybody in there?
Open the door.

518
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:39,130
Go in there!

519
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:40,715
Hurry!

520
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:44,427
[opening door]

521
00:30:49,224 --> 00:30:50,684
[conversing indistinctly]

522
00:30:51,142 --> 00:30:52,477
I still have class.

523
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:54,938
So?

524
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:56,940
I can't be late.

525
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:58,900
[Stella] Keep it down!

526
00:30:59,734 --> 00:31:01,236
They'll leave at some point.

527
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,445
Relax.

528
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:03,697
[woman 1] Huge?

529
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,781
[woman 2 laughing]

530
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:06,658
[woman 2] Is he really?

531
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,493
His name's familiar.

532
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:11,079
He's our classmate in one subject!

533
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,289
I remember now...

534
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:16,334
What if we're in a relationship?

535
00:31:17,585 --> 00:31:18,628
What?

536
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:22,173
We can pretend to be lovers.

537
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:27,137
So even if they see us here
together, they'd just say,

538
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:29,097
"Look at those lovers,

539
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,308
they had to do it in the bathroom
'cause they couldn't wait."

540
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:34,978
You're such a goof.

541
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:36,813
Why?

542
00:31:37,105 --> 00:31:39,065
Kiss me out there.

543
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:41,401
Stop it.

544
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:47,907
[both laughing]

545
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,746
[chattering indistinctly]

546
00:31:58,626 --> 00:31:59,961
Just a sec.

547
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:02,630
What happened to you?

548
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:05,633
He joined a fraternity.
Had their initiation.

549
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:07,135
[Stella] You joined a fraternity?

550
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:08,219
He thinks he's cool.

551
00:32:08,553 --> 00:32:11,181
Stella, you look different now.

552
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:12,849
Where are you going?

553
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:14,601
Hang out with us.

554
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:17,145
No, thanks. We're going home.

555
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:18,063
Let's go home.

556
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:20,315
Is he your boyfriend?

557
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:22,942
Fidel is my friend.

558
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,153
That's a relief.

559
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:28,531
-Thought you'd replace me with some loser.
-[all laughing]

560
00:32:28,615 --> 00:32:29,491
Loser?

561
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:31,326
Loser, eh?

562
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:33,453
He's a nice kid.

563
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:37,248
Helpful, hardworking, smart.

564
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:39,084
And you?

565
00:32:39,793 --> 00:32:42,712
So full of yourself,
yet your grades are pathetic.

566
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:43,797
Wait.

567
00:32:44,673 --> 00:32:46,341
And that hat.

568
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:48,051
You think it looks good on you?

569
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:49,969
Feel cool with it?

570
00:32:50,345 --> 00:32:51,471
It's ridiculous.

571
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:54,974
[Barrie] You!

572
00:32:55,684 --> 00:32:56,893
Are you courting Stella?

573
00:32:59,312 --> 00:33:03,483
[stammers] No, we're just friends.

574
00:33:03,858 --> 00:33:05,694
[imitating chicken clucking]

575
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:09,739
Sounds like a hen!

576
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:11,157
Come on, let's go home.

577
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:12,617
Stella.

578
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:14,953
Do you like him?

579
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:20,375
If I tell you I do, what's it to you?

580
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:21,292
Come on.

581
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:28,258
<i>Poem number 28: "Filthy."</i>

582
00:33:29,217 --> 00:33:30,844
<i>"Am I ambitious to believe</i>

583
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:32,887
<i>That you like me, too?</i>

584
00:33:33,471 --> 00:33:35,223
<i>I'm just a filthy kid</i>

585
00:33:35,306 --> 00:33:36,975
<i>Asking the heavens for you"</i>

586
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:40,520
How many poems will you give her?

587
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,106
[in English] Thirty.

588
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,483
Thirty?

589
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,701
Ma'am?

590
00:33:58,246 --> 00:33:59,414
[sniffling]

591
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:01,958
[stammers in Tagalog] Are you all right?

592
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,047
Damn it, Fidel!

593
00:34:07,464 --> 00:34:10,467
Why do you keep bothering
me with your love life?

594
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:12,469
Don't you have a mother?

595
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:18,933
I don't.

596
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:21,895
She's no...

597
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:25,690
She's no longer with my father.

598
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,195
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

599
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:32,030
[in English] I'm just...

600
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:38,870
They brought my daughter
to a rehab yesterday.

601
00:34:41,873 --> 00:34:48,463
[in Tagalog] I might resign from school
so I can look after her.

602
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,218
[in English] I don't know
where I went wrong as a mother.

603
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:57,764
[in Tagalog] I gave her
everything she wanted.

604
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:02,394
[in English] My husband and I thought
she was going to take up Law.

605
00:35:04,771 --> 00:35:06,356
But people change.

606
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,360
[in Tagalog] One day, she's a top student.

607
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:13,071
[in English] The next day,

608
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,365
she's an...

609
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:19,160
She's...

610
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,789
an addict!

611
00:35:23,998 --> 00:35:25,917
[crying]

612
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:30,797
Ma'am.

613
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:36,678
[in Tagalog] Maybe if the next day,
she's an addict,

614
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,265
the day after,

615
00:35:41,516 --> 00:35:42,559
she might change.

616
00:35:44,728 --> 00:35:46,479
Me, for instance.

617
00:35:46,938 --> 00:35:51,776
[stammers] They think I'm an addict
with the way I speak.

618
00:35:52,861 --> 00:35:55,071
[chuckles] Fidel!

619
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:00,744
[sighs]

620
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:02,954
You're such a comedian.

621
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:09,169
You know what my dream is?

622
00:36:10,211 --> 00:36:14,174
To perform for a large crowd.

623
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:17,427
I want to see everyone doing this...

624
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:22,307
singing along because they know
my song's lyrics.

625
00:36:22,682 --> 00:36:23,808
Kick-ass, right?

626
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:27,437
[stammering] Your dream is nice.

627
00:36:27,812 --> 00:36:32,192
Just don't neglect your studies.

628
00:36:32,734 --> 00:36:33,860
Yeah.

629
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:38,198
So even if you don't reach your dream,

630
00:36:38,615 --> 00:36:39,866
you have a fallback.

631
00:36:40,408 --> 00:36:41,618
I know.

632
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:47,791
Can you help with my Psych Stat?
The midterm is coming.

633
00:36:49,334 --> 00:36:50,585
When are you free?

634
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:53,213
Sunday night.

635
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:55,382
I'll just go to your house.

636
00:36:56,383 --> 00:36:59,010
Our house is so-so.

637
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:02,555
Did I say I'm buying it?
We're just studying.

638
00:37:04,766 --> 00:37:06,142
Before I forget.

639
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,314
My poems.

640
00:37:11,898 --> 00:37:13,942
I want you to read them.

641
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:17,821
I don't have a PC. I'll read them
on your computer on Sunday.

642
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:18,988
What are they about?

643
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:23,952
Hey! What about?

644
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:25,787
Never mind.

645
00:37:26,663 --> 00:37:28,331
You'll see on Sunday.

646
00:37:35,046 --> 00:37:36,840
Hey, you!

647
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:39,217
Didn't I tell you to quit your band?

648
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:42,595
I saw on your classmate's Friendster
you're performing in school.

649
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,680
What?

650
00:37:44,222 --> 00:37:46,307
Our last performance was last year.

651
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:48,768
Stop messing around.

652
00:37:49,394 --> 00:37:50,687
Messing around?

653
00:37:55,066 --> 00:37:57,318
Here. Shove my grades in your face.

654
00:38:01,322 --> 00:38:05,035
If only you studied
this hard last school year,

655
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:07,162
your transcript wouldn't look so bad.

656
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,706
Companies take a look at these things.

657
00:38:10,165 --> 00:38:10,999
Wow.

658
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:13,251
"Stella, your grades are high
this semester.

659
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:15,170
Congratulations. Keep it up."

660
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,297
That sounds better, right?

661
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:19,716
Damn this life. Can't do anything right.

662
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:21,843
Stella, Mommy and Daddy are gone.

663
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:24,596
You should fix your life.

664
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:27,349
So I could follow Ulysses in Canada.

665
00:38:27,557 --> 00:38:29,768
I'm tired of looking after you.

666
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:33,355
Go to him. Fly to Canada. Don't mind me.

667
00:38:33,438 --> 00:38:34,439
Give me that.

668
00:38:39,152 --> 00:38:41,738
[music on TVs playing]

669
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:03,968
Here.

670
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,395
This explains the cowboy hat.

671
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:16,022
Biceps Boys!

672
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:17,941
Damn corny, right?

673
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,402
After we disbanded,

674
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:22,696
an agent contacted me.

675
00:39:23,113 --> 00:39:26,991
At first, I wanted to decline,
but I couldn't resist the pay.

676
00:39:28,576 --> 00:39:30,370
You never told me.

677
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:33,957
I posted a bulletin on Friendster.

678
00:39:37,877 --> 00:39:39,713
You know I rarely go online.

679
00:39:40,505 --> 00:39:44,092
You could've texted me.

680
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,261
Text?

681
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:48,555
We weren't good.

682
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:50,557
We broke up.

683
00:39:51,099 --> 00:39:52,726
Why would I tell you?

684
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:55,854
Don't you love me anymore?

Pa.

697
00:40:33,141 --> 00:40:34,225
What's the occasion?

698
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:36,186
Our home is so tidy.

699
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:40,398
[stammers] My friend and I are
just going to review.

700

Girl or guy?

00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:44,319
Pa, does it matter?

702
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:53,203
Pa, we're just going to review!

703
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:54,662
[in English] Just in case!

704
00:40:54,746 --> 00:40:56,956
[in Tagalog] Milk is pricey these days.

705
00:40:57,874 --> 00:41:00,210
-Good luck!
-Good luck, guys, later.

706
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:14,391
Who are you looking at?

707
00:41:14,474 --> 00:41:16,351
Who are you looking at?

708
00:41:17,727 --> 00:41:20,230
Is that guy the boss of Stratus Records?

709
00:41:20,313 --> 00:41:21,690
Yes, that's our boss.

710
00:41:21,773 --> 00:41:23,900
The one on stage is our road manager.

711
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:24,901
Why?

712
00:41:26,444 --> 00:41:28,863
Maybe you can introduce me to them later?

713
00:41:28,947 --> 00:41:30,949
Of course.

714
00:41:31,032 --> 00:41:33,576
But they're busy now. I'll try.

715
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:35,286
Why though?

716
00:41:35,912 --> 00:41:36,955
Nothing.

00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:41,668
Eat well.

Guys, backstage.

Good luck!

Good luck! Break a leg!

722
00:41:51,052 --> 00:41:52,762
Stella, can I ask you a favor?

723
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:57,225
Can you not watch our performance?

724
00:41:57,642 --> 00:42:00,061
What? Why?

725
00:42:01,604 --> 00:42:03,523
I'm feeling really shy.

726
00:42:06,443 --> 00:42:08,278
What a bummer!

[crowd cheering]

728
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:32,969

Awkward.

00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:46,608
I'm Hunter, by the way.

Sorry,

00:43:21,309 --> 00:43:22,310
[in English] Anyway,

740
00:43:23,561 --> 00:43:25,355
I just came to meet with the, uh...

741
00:43:26,564 --> 00:43:28,566
talents I'll be working with soon.

742
00:43:29,109 --> 00:43:30,819
More like, working "on."

743
00:43:31,695 --> 00:43:34,989
[in Tagalog] If only I wasn't friends
with those at Stratus.

744
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:38,201
[in English] It's nice to meet you.

745
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:44,082
[Barrie speaking Tagalog] <i>Someone talked
to me at the bar earlier.</i>

746
00:43:44,165 --> 00:43:47,043
An old man. A clerk in a bank.

747
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:51,798
My God, he gave me an indecent proposal!

748
00:43:55,427 --> 00:43:57,595
Crazy, right?

749
00:43:57,679 --> 00:43:59,889
You do look like a stripper.

750
00:44:01,391 --> 00:44:02,684
Really now?

751
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:05,186
Really?

752
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:08,565
Wow!

753
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:12,485
-Male stripper, huh?
-With matching prop!

754
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:14,320
[laughs]

755
00:44:15,071 --> 00:44:17,365
Yuck! That's disgusting. Enough.

756
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:19,242
Stop it. You look stupid.

757
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:21,369
Disgusting. Sit down.

758
00:44:25,957 --> 00:44:27,042
You know what?

759
00:44:28,752 --> 00:44:30,086
I missed you.

760
00:44:33,882 --> 00:44:35,091
Well,

761
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:37,260
I'll go home now.

762
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:39,012
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

763
00:44:41,097 --> 00:44:44,142
It's getting late. I'll get scolded.

764
00:44:44,517 --> 00:44:45,894
It's still early.

765
00:44:46,227 --> 00:44:47,854
I really need to go.

766
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:51,399
Come on, stay here first.

767
00:44:52,567 --> 00:44:53,610
Seriously.

768
00:44:55,153 --> 00:44:56,404
I'll go ahead.

769
00:44:56,905 --> 00:44:59,074
Stop. I'll go ahead.

770
00:44:59,532 --> 00:45:00,950
Old times' sake?

771
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:04,371
[rooster crowing]

772
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:24,683
What day is it?

773
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,561
What?

774
00:45:29,354 --> 00:45:30,814
What day is it?

775
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:32,691
Monday, why?

776
00:45:33,525 --> 00:45:34,526
Shit.

777
00:45:36,027 --> 00:45:37,028
No, why?

778
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:40,156
Fidel and I were supposed to
review together yesterday.

779
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,241
It's almost midterm.

780
00:45:45,537 --> 00:45:46,538
Fidel?

781
00:45:47,706 --> 00:45:48,998
That stuttering nerd?

782
00:45:51,501 --> 00:45:52,752
Watch your language.

783
00:45:53,503 --> 00:45:55,046
He's nice.

784
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:58,508
Where were you supposed to study?

785
00:45:58,591 --> 00:45:59,592
At his place.

786
00:46:00,135 --> 00:46:01,344
With other classmates?

787
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:02,804
Just us.

788
00:46:04,931 --> 00:46:05,974
Careful.

789
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:07,684
You never know what he might do.

790
00:46:09,394 --> 00:46:10,937
Like what you did to me?

791
00:46:13,773 --> 00:46:16,735
Danica, do you want a photocopy of this?

792
00:46:17,193 --> 00:46:18,194
Sure.

793
00:46:18,611 --> 00:46:22,240
Just tell the photocopier guy
it's for Danica.

794
00:46:22,657 --> 00:46:24,242
He'll let you skip the line.

795
00:46:24,743 --> 00:46:25,744
How come?

796
00:46:26,244 --> 00:46:27,370
We're cousins.

797
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:35,128
Fidel.

798
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:40,216
I've been looking everywhere for you.

799
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:42,802
Sorry.

800
00:46:43,053 --> 00:46:44,721
I was in Manila last night.

801
00:46:47,098 --> 00:46:48,767
You could've texted me.

802
00:46:52,812 --> 00:46:53,813
Hey.

803
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:55,607
Are you mad?

804
00:46:56,107 --> 00:46:57,108
Could you just...

805
00:46:57,650 --> 00:46:59,444
Could you just bug me later?

806
00:46:59,527 --> 00:47:00,653
[shushing]

807
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:02,614
Is that so?

808
00:47:03,823 --> 00:47:04,783
Later then!

809
00:47:04,866 --> 00:47:05,867
-Stella!
-[clattering]

810
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:06,993
[all shushing]

811
00:47:08,078 --> 00:47:09,537
Stella! Stella!

812
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:10,622
What?

813
00:47:11,247 --> 00:47:12,248
What's your problem?

814
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,668
Problem?

815
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:18,588
Why are you doing this to me?

816
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:21,007
I said I'm sorry.

817
00:47:22,342 --> 00:47:25,762
What did I do to you
for you to treat me like that?

818
00:47:27,055 --> 00:47:28,014
I waited for you.

819
00:47:28,264 --> 00:47:29,391
[scoffs]

820
00:47:29,474 --> 00:47:30,517
There!

821
00:47:31,393 --> 00:47:33,770
Can't you study on your own?

822
00:47:37,148 --> 00:47:38,525
Are you serious with your...

823
00:47:39,192 --> 00:47:40,360
Your academics?

824
00:47:42,487 --> 00:47:44,906
[stammering] It's midterm next week.

825
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:48,243
Why so complacent?

826
00:47:48,326 --> 00:47:51,329
You prioritized your thing with Barrie.

827
00:47:52,205 --> 00:47:53,456
I thought...

828
00:47:54,416 --> 00:47:56,334
[stammers] I thought you broke up?

829
00:47:56,876 --> 00:47:59,629
Fidel, Barrie joined a boy band in Manila.

830
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:04,384
I went there with him to make connections.

831
00:48:04,467 --> 00:48:06,678
I want to be part
of their recording company.

832
00:48:08,972 --> 00:48:10,306
If you were me,

833
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:13,518
would you pass up the opportunity?

834
00:48:15,603 --> 00:48:17,981
Besides, I'm sick of school.

835
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:22,986
What will I do with Psych?

836
00:48:25,196 --> 00:48:28,033
You know that music is my passion.

837
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:34,789
Fidel, we're reforming Tampururaught.

838
00:48:37,542 --> 00:48:39,878
Barrie's no longer the bassist,

839
00:48:40,503 --> 00:48:42,922
but he's financing the demo recording.

840
00:48:44,632 --> 00:48:46,634
He's also endorsing us to Stratus.

841
00:48:49,346 --> 00:48:50,805
You need to choose.

842
00:48:53,391 --> 00:48:54,392
Studies...

843
00:48:55,518 --> 00:48:56,644
or band?

860
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:08,693
It's your first time
seeing a gay beatboxer, right?

861

I'll beatbox for you.

866
00:51:19,662 --> 00:51:21,039
I don't sing. I'm not good.

867
00:51:21,122 --> 00:51:24,125
I'm not expecting a Mark Bautista
kind of performance.

868
00:51:24,209 --> 00:51:25,210
Come on.

You need to hear him sing.

[in Tagalog] what's your background

[stammering] No background, sir.

892
00:52:56,593 --> 00:52:59,095
I really don't sing.

893
00:52:59,596 --> 00:53:01,181

Let us hear it, please.

895
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:14,694
Are you gonna let us hear you sing or not?

<i>So come on up to me and close the door</i>

924
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:07,974
<i>Nobody's made me feel this way before</i>

925

<i>You're everything I wanted and more</i>

926
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:25,200
<i>You're everything I wanted</i>

927
00:55:27,452 --> 00:55:30,163
<i>You're everything I wanted</i>

928
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:38,213

929
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:40,090
[all cheering]

930
00:55:40,173 --> 00:55:43,551
[in Tagalog] Again,
we are the Young Performer's Guild,

931
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:47,138
the #1 performing arts group here in PRU.

932
00:55:47,222 --> 00:55:50,517
[in Tagalog] If you know
how to play instruments, dance, act,

933
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:51,726
or sing,

934
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:53,645
[in English] our org... Rather, our family

935
00:55:53,728 --> 00:55:55,855
will be very happy
to have you as a member.

936
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:57,899
[all applauding]

937
00:55:59,776 --> 00:56:02,237
[in Tagalog] Surely,
many will join our organization.

938
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,738
Most of them are your fans.

939
00:56:04,656 --> 00:56:05,657
Our fans.

940
00:56:06,449 --> 00:56:07,450
Congrats.

941
00:56:07,534 --> 00:56:08,702
[cell phone ringing]

942
00:56:18,461 --> 00:56:19,462
[in English] Hello?

943
00:56:20,171 --> 00:56:22,507
[in Tagalog] <i>Fidel? It's Danica.</i>

944
00:56:23,341 --> 00:56:24,634
Danica who?

945
00:56:25,468 --> 00:56:26,678
Danica!

946
00:56:26,761 --> 00:56:29,014
Will you be back in Pampanga
this semester break?

947
00:56:29,764 --> 00:56:30,765
Why?

948
00:56:31,641 --> 00:56:33,768
It's my birthday in November.

949
00:56:33,935 --> 00:56:36,146
The celebration will be in Fontana.

950
00:56:36,479 --> 00:56:40,108
<i>I sent you the invitation
to our Yahoo group.</i>

951
00:56:43,111 --> 00:56:45,363
[stammers] I'm quite busy.

952
00:56:45,447 --> 00:56:46,448
<i>Really?</i>

953
00:56:46,865 --> 00:56:48,199
Even during the break?

954
00:56:48,491 --> 00:56:50,160
Don't you miss the block?

955
00:56:51,077 --> 00:56:55,582
Joeffer, Mads and Lester are going.

956
00:56:57,959 --> 00:56:59,085
How...

957
00:57:01,421 --> 00:57:02,589
How about Stella?

958
00:57:04,174 --> 00:57:05,258
I don't know.

959
00:57:06,051 --> 00:57:10,221
I sent her an invite,
but she hasn't confirmed.

960
00:57:11,639 --> 00:57:13,058
[upbeat music playing]

961
00:57:13,141 --> 00:57:15,310
[people chattering]

962
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:21,524
[in English] Excuse me.

963
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,862
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you!

964
00:57:25,945 --> 00:57:27,739
[in Tagalog] Why are you quiet?

965
00:57:28,448 --> 00:57:30,033
Don't mind me.

966
00:57:32,369 --> 00:57:33,536
[knocking]

967
00:57:34,371 --> 00:57:35,497
Fidel!

968
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:40,085
-Fidel!
-[in English] Happy birthday!

969
00:57:40,168 --> 00:57:41,670
Thank you!

970
00:57:42,545 --> 00:57:44,047
-[in Tagalog] Am I late?
-Not really?

971
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:45,757
-I brought pizza.
-Thank you.

[all chattering]

974
00:58:03,942 --> 00:58:06,444
Carry me, Fidel! It's my birthday.

975
00:58:07,237 --> 00:58:08,780
Where should I take you? Here?

976
00:58:08,863 --> 00:58:11,282
Farther! Farther!

977
00:58:11,366 --> 00:58:12,909
Come on.

978
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:18,164
On the other side. Hurry!

979
00:58:18,248 --> 00:58:19,249
Stella?

980
00:58:19,332 --> 00:58:20,709
You're so slow.

981
00:58:21,459 --> 00:58:22,752
Just a sec.

982
00:58:28,174 --> 00:58:29,175
Stella!

983
00:58:32,053 --> 00:58:33,054
How are you?

984
00:58:33,138 --> 00:58:34,097
What?

985
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:35,682
How are you?

986
00:58:36,474 --> 00:58:38,393
I'm fine. How about you?

987
00:58:39,477 --> 00:58:40,478
Why are you late?

988
00:58:41,396 --> 00:58:42,480
What?

989
00:58:42,897 --> 00:58:43,898
What?

990
00:58:43,982 --> 00:58:45,400
Why are you late?

991
00:58:45,483 --> 00:58:46,943
Oh, why am I late?

992
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:50,196
I waited for my sister Shirley
to come home first.

993
00:58:56,077 --> 00:58:57,328
Aren't you swimming?

994
00:58:58,455 --> 00:58:59,789
What's that?

995
00:59:00,915 --> 00:59:02,375
Aren't you swimming?

996
00:59:02,459 --> 00:59:04,961
Nah! I have no extra clothes.

997
00:59:05,337 --> 00:59:06,880
Wait for me.

998
00:59:06,963 --> 00:59:08,715
[stammers] I'll just change.

999
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:10,342
You'll change. Okay.

1000
00:59:10,425 --> 00:59:11,760
I'll join you in a bit.

1001
00:59:14,387 --> 00:59:16,514
Remember our Freshies' Night?

1002
00:59:18,016 --> 00:59:19,601
The first time we met?

1003
00:59:20,518 --> 00:59:21,603
And?

1004
00:59:23,438 --> 00:59:24,856
So weird.

1005
00:59:25,732 --> 00:59:28,693
It was noisy at the gym entrance.

1006
00:59:31,529 --> 00:59:34,074
But I clearly heard someone singing.

1007
00:59:35,575 --> 00:59:37,619
Are you sure that wasn't you?

1008
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:40,997
[stammering] Let's say that was indeed me.

1009
00:59:43,124 --> 00:59:49,673
The gym's entrance was far from my spot.

1010
00:59:50,423 --> 00:59:54,135
How did my voice reach the entrance?

1011
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:56,429
[laughing] I was belting?

1012
00:59:58,181 --> 00:59:59,182
I don't know.

1013
01:00:00,350 --> 01:00:01,393
Come to think of it,

1014
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,771
the singer wasn't stuttering.

1015
01:00:05,355 --> 01:00:07,565
It might not be you.

1016
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:14,531
Actually, when I sing...

1017
01:00:15,532 --> 01:00:16,491
I don't.

1018
01:00:16,574 --> 01:00:17,826
Don't what?

1019
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:20,370
I don't stutter.

1020
01:00:20,453 --> 01:00:22,747
See? That was you!

1021
01:00:23,331 --> 01:00:24,791
Magic?

1022
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:31,589
The universe conspired
so we could meet that night.

1023
01:00:32,048 --> 01:00:34,718
So the universe is a singer now?

1024
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:38,430
I also have...

1025
01:00:39,305 --> 01:00:41,391
something to clarify.

1026
01:00:42,642 --> 01:00:44,060
What is it?

1027
01:00:45,228 --> 01:00:50,650
Why were you so nice to me back then?

1028
01:00:51,026 --> 01:00:52,444
Back then?

1029
01:00:52,902 --> 01:00:54,446
Not anymore?

1030
01:00:55,864 --> 01:00:58,575
What I mean is...

1031
01:01:00,035 --> 01:01:05,665
of all people you could be nice to...

1032
01:01:06,791 --> 01:01:09,711
of all people you could befriend...

1033
01:01:11,546 --> 01:01:13,089
why me?

1034
01:01:13,882 --> 01:01:15,425
I don't know.

1035
01:01:17,886 --> 01:01:21,014
You see, some relationships...

1036
01:01:21,848 --> 01:01:23,808
don't require reasons.

1037
01:01:25,852 --> 01:01:26,728
Some...

1038
01:01:28,146 --> 01:01:29,314
just happen.

1039
01:01:29,856 --> 01:01:31,941
[all cheering]

1040
01:01:36,321 --> 01:01:38,865
Me again?

1041
01:01:39,449 --> 01:01:40,658
Fine, bastards!

1042
01:01:40,742 --> 01:01:41,659
Dare!

1043
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:42,994
Here's your dare.

1044
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:48,917
Give a dirty dance
to your ultimate crush here.

1045
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:50,835
[all cheering]

1046
01:01:53,963 --> 01:01:55,465
[boy] I'm pressured.

1047
01:01:56,675 --> 01:01:58,677
[all exclaiming excitedly]

1048
01:02:06,726 --> 01:02:07,811
Stop me!

1049
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:20,365
[in English] Truth or Dare?

1050
01:02:20,448 --> 01:02:21,825
Dare!

1051
01:02:22,283 --> 01:02:24,619
[in Tagalog] If you're still a virgin,

1052
01:02:24,703 --> 01:02:28,873
walk like a Miss Universe.

1053
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:31,418
[all cheering]

1054
01:02:33,336 --> 01:02:35,338
You thought I wouldn't do it?

1055
01:02:37,382 --> 01:02:39,092
[all shouting]

1056
01:02:39,175 --> 01:02:40,176
Stella!

1057
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:43,013
[in English] Truth or Dare?
Truth or Dare?

1058
01:02:43,388 --> 01:02:44,431
Dare or Truth?

1059
01:02:45,515 --> 01:02:46,933
[in Tagalog] Fine. Truth.

1060
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:50,979
Gee, I don't know what to ask.

1061
01:02:51,062 --> 01:02:53,523
We barely see you these days.

1062
01:02:53,606 --> 01:02:55,025
Do you still go to class?

1063
01:02:55,108 --> 01:02:56,109
That's the question?

1064
01:02:56,192 --> 01:02:59,029
Joeffer, you're wasting it.

1065
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:02,741
Among our blockmates,

1066
01:03:02,824 --> 01:03:05,577
who, for you, can pass as your boyfriend?

1067
01:03:06,119 --> 01:03:08,538
The one with whom
you can imagine yourself claiming...

1068
01:03:09,956 --> 01:03:11,499
"Sure! Let's be a couple."

1069
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:17,130
Politically incorrect question!
Why limit it to just "boyfriend"?

1070
01:03:17,213 --> 01:03:21,051
Fine! Boyfriend or girlfriend
or anything you like.

1071
01:03:21,134 --> 01:03:22,135
Answer it!

1072
01:03:22,761 --> 01:03:27,432
[in English] One, two, three, four--

1073
01:03:27,515 --> 01:03:29,768
[in Tagalog] No, actually,
I already have a boyfriend.

1074
01:03:29,851 --> 01:03:31,102
He'll pick me up tomorrow.

1075
01:03:31,186 --> 01:03:32,687
[boy] Who's your boyfriend?

1076
01:03:34,356 --> 01:03:35,273
Hunter.

1077
01:03:35,357 --> 01:03:36,441
Who?

1078
01:03:36,941 --> 01:03:39,235
-Where's he from?
-He's a director from Manila.

1079
01:03:39,319 --> 01:03:41,738
Why are there follow-up questions?
Spin it.

1080
01:03:41,821 --> 01:03:44,240
[in English] Wait!
You didn't answer the question.

1081
01:03:44,324 --> 01:03:45,700
The question is,

1082
01:03:45,784 --> 01:03:49,537
[in Tagalog] who among our blockmates
can pass as your boyfriend?

1083
01:03:49,621 --> 01:03:53,249
Your relationship status is irrelevant.

1084
01:03:55,001 --> 01:03:56,878
Answer it!

1085
01:03:58,129 --> 01:03:59,297
[retching]

1086
01:03:59,756 --> 01:04:01,675
[all screaming]

1087
01:04:06,137 --> 01:04:08,682
[boy] What a party-pooper!

1088
01:04:21,653 --> 01:04:24,280
I heard inside
that you have a new boyfriend.

1089
01:04:24,739 --> 01:04:26,074
Yet again.

1090
01:04:28,326 --> 01:04:30,245
We were batchmates in high school.

1091
01:04:31,121 --> 01:04:32,997
You had six boyfriends, right?

1092
01:04:36,418 --> 01:04:37,919
Nice.

1093
01:04:38,003 --> 01:04:39,462
[in English] Judgmental.

1094
01:04:43,091 --> 01:04:45,010
[in Tagalog] I'm not judging you.

1095
01:04:48,596 --> 01:04:52,684
Of all things, why bring that up?

1096
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:56,521
That was your reputation in high school.

1097
01:04:57,689 --> 01:04:59,274
Don't worry.

1098
01:04:59,357 --> 01:05:02,277
It's normal
to look for people to cling to.

1099
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:05,071
Especially when you feel unloved.

1100
01:05:05,989 --> 01:05:08,366
Why are you even here?
Are you our blockmate?

1101
01:05:09,117 --> 01:05:11,286
Von, Grandpa wants to talk to you.

1102
01:05:12,287 --> 01:05:14,164
Find a quiet spot.

1103
01:05:14,247 --> 01:05:15,248
Okay.

1104
01:05:15,415 --> 01:05:16,499
Hello, Grandpa?

1105
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:17,459
Who's that?

1106
01:05:18,126 --> 01:05:19,336
Oh, him?

1107
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:23,840
He's Von, my cousin.
Library photocopier guy.

1108
01:05:24,758 --> 01:05:27,844
I guess he's not familiar
to you because...

1109
01:05:28,136 --> 01:05:29,888
you barely go to the library.

1110
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:37,187
I was just asking.

1111
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:52,846
[in English] Hey, excuse me, bro!

1112
01:06:52,929 --> 01:06:55,056
[in Tagalog] I'm looking
for a villa occupied

1113
01:06:55,140 --> 01:06:57,308
by a bunch of students from PAC.

1114
01:06:59,477 --> 01:07:01,563
I forgot the number,

1115
01:07:01,646 --> 01:07:03,523
but I know it's on this street.

1116
01:07:04,274 --> 01:07:05,316
[in English] 3226.

1117
01:07:05,692 --> 01:07:06,943
[in Tagalog] Right. Thanks!

1118
01:07:07,027 --> 01:07:08,111
And you are?

1119
01:07:08,194 --> 01:07:10,405
Oh, right. I'm Hunter.

1120
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:13,116
I'm picking up my girlfriend.

1121
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:14,534
Stella.

1122
01:07:16,453 --> 01:07:18,204
[Chuck] This is so romantic, Fidel!

1123
01:07:18,288 --> 01:07:19,873
[in English] Fifty poems!

1124
01:07:19,956 --> 01:07:21,750
[in Tagalog] Why didn't you
give these to her?

1125
01:07:22,375 --> 01:07:24,044
She has a boyfriend.

1126
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:27,130
Hello! You could've done it way back.

1127
01:07:28,006 --> 01:07:29,257
What's the point?

1128
01:07:29,966 --> 01:07:35,597
[stammers] Stella wants her dreams
to come true.

1129
01:07:36,973 --> 01:07:38,975
These won't help her.

1130
01:07:44,522 --> 01:07:46,441
I'm a bit nervous, sweetheart.

1131
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:49,069
[in English] You're perfect.

1132
01:07:49,152 --> 01:07:50,362
You're gonna be a star.

1133
01:07:51,237 --> 01:07:53,073
I promise you. Come here.

1134
01:07:54,282 --> 01:07:56,701
-[in Tagalog] Wait. My lipstick...
-[scoffs]

1135
01:07:57,660 --> 01:07:59,537
[in English] Sorry.
[sighs]

1136
01:08:00,789 --> 01:08:02,290
It's almost 1:00 now.

1137
01:08:02,374 --> 01:08:03,792
[in Tagalog] Let's go.

1138
01:08:05,001 --> 01:08:06,711
[song playing on laptop]

1139
01:08:15,178 --> 01:08:16,429
[in English] Catchy, right?

1140
01:08:16,846 --> 01:08:19,391
[in Tagalog] Would be a great carrier
single for an album.

1141
01:08:21,059 --> 01:08:22,644
[in English] The market
is already saturated

1142
01:08:22,727 --> 01:08:24,062
with this brand of music.

1143
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:28,942
[in Tagalog] We have Kitchi Nadal,
Barbie Almalbis,

1144
01:08:29,025 --> 01:08:32,112
and dozens of others who try
to emulate the same branding.

1145
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,488
How is yours different?

1146
01:08:33,571 --> 01:08:36,116
[in Tagalog] Well, I was thinking
of making Stella's image

1147
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:37,409
much darker.

1148
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:40,370
Sometimes drifting towards punk.

1149
01:08:40,704 --> 01:08:43,707
-Something like--
-Avril Lavigne... sir.

1150
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:46,042
How old are you, Stella?

1151
01:08:48,044 --> 01:08:49,295
Eighteen, sir.

1152
01:08:56,386 --> 01:08:59,639
You're familiar with Lolligurlz, right?

1153
01:09:01,808 --> 01:09:02,809
[Stella]<i> I'm not a kid!</i>

1154
01:09:02,892 --> 01:09:06,396
Don't tell me what I can and cannot do!

1155
01:09:06,938 --> 01:09:08,773
[in English] Are you fucking serious,
Stella?

1156
01:09:08,857 --> 01:09:09,983
Lolligurlz?

1157
01:09:10,442 --> 01:09:13,695
[in Tagalog] Gyrating like a go-go dancer

1158
01:09:13,778 --> 01:09:16,114
[in English] while singing awful songs
about God-knows-what?

1159
01:09:16,197 --> 01:09:18,533
[in Tagalog] If that's what it takes
to get into the industry,

1160
01:09:18,616 --> 01:09:20,243
then fine, I'll do it!

1161
01:09:20,952 --> 01:09:22,704
We've been together for a year now.

1162
01:09:22,787 --> 01:09:24,956
Nothing's happening!
I haven't gone places.

1163
01:09:25,248 --> 01:09:27,417
[car tires screeching]

1164
01:09:28,585 --> 01:09:30,295
[in English] Is that what I am
for you, Stella?

1165
01:09:30,378 --> 01:09:32,088
[in Tagalog] So you'd achieve
your ambitions?

1166
01:09:32,172 --> 01:09:33,173
That's it?

1167
01:09:40,388 --> 01:09:41,389
See this?

1168
01:09:41,473 --> 01:09:42,432
See this?

1169
01:09:42,515 --> 01:09:43,516
Fine.

1170
01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:45,310
Watch this.

1171
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:47,729
What the hell? Stop!

1172
01:09:48,104 --> 01:09:49,814
Enough already!

1173
01:09:52,192 --> 01:09:53,318
Sweetheart, that's enough.

1174
01:09:53,401 --> 01:09:55,320
Don't you ever call me "sweetheart"!

1175
01:09:55,403 --> 01:09:56,571
You're a user!

1176
01:09:56,696 --> 01:09:57,697
[in English] Get out!

1177
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:03,536
I said get the hell out of my car!

1178
01:10:09,542 --> 01:10:11,336
[strumming chord loudly]

1179
01:10:15,048 --> 01:10:16,216
Stella!

1180
01:10:16,758 --> 01:10:19,010
Are you ever going back to school?

1181
01:10:21,846 --> 01:10:25,141
Your professor told me
you no longer go to class.

1182
01:10:25,225 --> 01:10:26,267
What are you doing?

1183
01:10:26,351 --> 01:10:28,186
Band stuff again?

1184
01:10:28,269 --> 01:10:29,270
Please.

1185
01:10:29,562 --> 01:10:31,523
If you plan to lecture me, not today.

1186
01:10:31,606 --> 01:10:32,732
I'm not in the mood.

1187
01:10:32,816 --> 01:10:35,151
Shine and I already spoke
to you about this.

1188
01:10:35,235 --> 01:10:36,695
I already told you.

1189
01:10:36,778 --> 01:10:38,488
So what if this is what I wanted?

1190
01:10:38,571 --> 01:10:39,989
We gave you a chance before.

1191
01:10:40,073 --> 01:10:42,534
What happened?

1192
01:10:42,617 --> 01:10:43,618
Nothing!

1193
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:45,829
When you need money, who do you pester?

1194
01:10:45,912 --> 01:10:48,206
-Me!
-Who else can I turn to?

1195
01:10:48,289 --> 01:10:50,417
You're such a burden!

1196
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:54,796
-Why are you blaming me?
-You're ruining my plans!

1197
01:10:54,879 --> 01:10:59,592
Ulysses is getting impatient there
in Canada.

1198
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:01,761
So this is about him. Then go!

1199
01:11:02,053 --> 01:11:04,973
If you can't wait to fuck,
by all means, go!

1200
01:11:14,065 --> 01:11:15,275
I'm sick of this house.

1201
01:11:15,775 --> 01:11:17,277
I'm sick of you!

1202
01:11:23,742 --> 01:11:27,120
[in English] Oh, my God!
Abnormal Psych is so haggard.

1203
01:11:27,787 --> 01:11:29,706
Who's gonna report for our group?

1204
01:11:32,334 --> 01:11:37,213
[stammers in Tagalog] Me, but ma'am
might get annoyed with my speech.

1205
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:38,882
[all laugh]

1206
01:11:39,174 --> 01:11:40,967
Fine, I volunteer!

1207
01:11:41,593 --> 01:11:44,346
Just don't fail me in the peer evals.

1208
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:45,847
-[in English] Go, Erin!
-Thank you!

1209
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:47,474
[cell phone ringing]

1210
01:11:55,398 --> 01:11:56,983
Hello? Stella?

1211
01:11:57,317 --> 01:11:58,318
<i>Fidel?</i>

1212
01:11:58,610 --> 01:11:59,903
[in Tagalog] Are you in Manila?

1213
01:12:00,111 --> 01:12:01,446
<i>Yes, why?</i>

1214
01:12:03,448 --> 01:12:06,201
Nothing. I just wanted to see you.

1215
01:12:06,993 --> 01:12:08,953
Is there a problem?

1216
01:12:10,246 --> 01:12:11,706
<i>Nothing, nothing!</i>

1217
01:12:12,332 --> 01:12:14,209
I just want to hang out.

1218
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:15,919
<i>Actually,</i>

1219
01:12:16,961 --> 01:12:19,964
[stammers] I'm finishing a paper
with my groupmates.

1220
01:12:21,383 --> 01:12:22,550
<i>I see.</i>

1221
01:12:23,301 --> 01:12:25,303
It's fine. Just focus.

1222
01:12:26,262 --> 01:12:28,723
No, no, no. Wait. Uh...

1223
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:34,604
What time can you come here in Manila?

1224
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:40,527
Sir, your order.

1225
01:12:40,610 --> 01:12:42,195
How's my hair?

1226
01:12:42,612 --> 01:12:43,822
Looks good, sir!

1227
01:12:49,577 --> 01:12:50,620
Fidel.

1228
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:54,582
Sorry, I got lost.

1229
01:12:57,168 --> 01:12:58,169
It's fine.

1230
01:13:00,046 --> 01:13:03,466
Choose your order.

1231
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:04,884
My treat.

1232
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:09,889
[stammers] Their bestseller here
is pork tonkatsu.

1233
01:13:12,308 --> 01:13:14,019
I'll just have a beer.

1234
01:13:23,069 --> 01:13:24,404
How are you?

1235
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:29,034
It's been a while.

1236
01:13:30,452 --> 01:13:32,037
You've been busy.

1237
01:13:32,996 --> 01:13:34,372
Very!

1238
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:39,085
I'm also vying for honors.

1239
01:13:41,421 --> 01:13:47,052
Busy with the rehearsals
of the Performer's Guild.

1240
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:49,929
Really? You're performing?

1241
01:13:50,180 --> 01:13:51,348
How about you?

1242
01:13:51,848 --> 01:13:54,434
How's your... How's your...

1243
01:13:54,517 --> 01:13:55,852
boyfriend?

1244
01:13:56,186 --> 01:13:57,520
Hunter?

1245
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,856
We broke up.

1246
01:14:02,275 --> 01:14:03,276
Thank you.

1247
01:14:05,945 --> 01:14:07,113
That's good.

1248
01:14:07,906 --> 01:14:09,032
What's good?

1249
01:14:11,576 --> 01:14:14,204
The first time I saw him,

1250
01:14:14,579 --> 01:14:16,998
I didn't like his aura.

1251
01:14:18,124 --> 01:14:19,417
[chuckling] Aura.

1252
01:14:20,293 --> 01:14:21,461
-[laughing]
-You're psychic now?

1253
01:14:26,049 --> 01:14:27,050
How about you?

1254
01:14:27,926 --> 01:14:29,344
Do you have a girlfriend?

1255
01:14:29,928 --> 01:14:30,929
Me?

1256
01:14:31,513 --> 01:14:32,514
None.

1257
01:14:33,098 --> 01:14:34,140
Why?

1258
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:36,101
[in English] Busy.

1259
01:14:39,729 --> 01:14:42,399
[in Tagalog] How come you were able to
squeeze me into your schedule?

1260
01:14:42,482 --> 01:14:43,775
Of course.

1261
01:14:43,858 --> 01:14:44,943
It's you.

1262
01:14:56,955 --> 01:14:58,415
[crying] Back then...

1263
01:15:00,917 --> 01:15:03,628
my big sisters used to sing, too.

1264
01:15:05,463 --> 01:15:07,882
Whenever there was a fiesta,

1265
01:15:08,508 --> 01:15:10,969
we were always called to perform.

1266
01:15:15,682 --> 01:15:17,392
Now, it's over.

1267
01:15:20,937 --> 01:15:23,064
They quit because...

1268
01:15:25,025 --> 01:15:27,861
Mommy and Daddy had an accident.

1269
01:15:29,237 --> 01:15:30,447
[in English] Sorry.

1270
01:15:33,324 --> 01:15:38,121
[in Tagalog] My sister Sunshine left
right away to work abroad.

1271
01:15:38,997 --> 01:15:44,419
My sister Shirley transferred to Nursing.

1272
01:15:48,006 --> 01:15:50,258
That's the popular course now, right?

1273
01:15:53,053 --> 01:15:56,056
That's why they're doing this to me...

1274
01:15:57,307 --> 01:15:59,559
Why they're forcing me to quit.

1275
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:05,774
It's unfair that they want me
to quit just because they did.

1276
01:16:06,483 --> 01:16:09,569
That's the practical thing to do.
Maybe they're thinking,

1277
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:12,614
"We already gave up. So should you."

1278
01:16:17,494 --> 01:16:20,246
Stella, it's all right.

1279
01:16:22,332 --> 01:16:23,792
Fidel...

Can I sleep in your dorm?

1283
01:16:45,480 --> 01:16:49,859
[stammering] I don't think outsiders

Is it okay if I bring you to a hotel?

1285
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:58,159
-No, it's fine.
-I'll pay for it.

1286

01:38:30,618 --> 01:38:33,913
We're still performing
at the Freshies' Orientation.

1642
01:38:33,997 --> 01:38:35,498
Why quit now?

1643
01:38:35,957 --> 01:38:37,500
What's the point?

1644
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:38,668
The point?

1645
01:38:38,752 --> 01:38:40,795
[in English] We're all counting on you!

1646
01:38:50,555 --> 01:38:53,850
You were fine even before,

1647
01:38:53,933 --> 01:38:55,393
before I became a member.

1648
01:38:55,894 --> 01:38:58,104
I'm still talking to you!

1649
01:38:58,980 --> 01:39:00,648
Is this because of Stella?

1650
01:39:02,484 --> 01:39:05,653
Fidel, your world doesn't have to stop...

1651
01:39:06,196 --> 01:39:08,406
just because you didn't end up together!

1652
01:39:32,472 --> 01:39:33,390
Son?

1653
01:39:35,058 --> 01:39:36,810
Your mom sent you something.

1654
01:39:43,733 --> 01:39:47,028
I mentioned to her that you graduated.

1655
01:39:48,238 --> 01:39:49,739
And I got you this.

1656
01:39:51,658 --> 01:39:54,619
It goes well with your Mom's gift.

1657
01:39:55,787 --> 01:39:58,665
Wear these on your job interviews.

1658
01:40:05,839 --> 01:40:09,259
Just leave it there.

1659
01:40:10,844 --> 01:40:14,180
Not that I'm pressuring you,

1660
01:40:14,723 --> 01:40:17,475
but since you graduated...

1661
01:40:19,102 --> 01:40:21,062
It's been five months.

1662
01:40:22,147 --> 01:40:25,066
When are you planning to look for a job?

1663
01:40:37,579 --> 01:40:38,621
Hey, Fidel!

1664
01:40:39,414 --> 01:40:41,416
You're Chuckie's roommate, right?

1665
01:40:42,292 --> 01:40:44,044
This is Raffy, my boyfriend.

1666
01:40:44,294 --> 01:40:45,795
What are you doing here?

1667
01:40:46,963 --> 01:40:48,882
[in English] Job interview. Research firm.

1668
01:40:50,008 --> 01:40:51,217
[in Tagalog] I'll get some smokes.

1669
01:40:51,301 --> 01:40:52,886
I thought you quit?

1670
01:40:52,969 --> 01:40:54,846
You swore on your mother's grave!

1671
01:40:56,514 --> 01:40:57,932
I love him so much.

1672
01:40:59,517 --> 01:41:00,935
How's your interview?

1673
01:41:04,314 --> 01:41:06,649
You know what? I have a solution.

1674
01:41:06,733 --> 01:41:11,654
Let's go to an audition
for a nationwide competition.

1675
01:41:12,113 --> 01:41:14,532
You sing, I beatbox, like before.

1676
01:41:15,784 --> 01:41:16,868
I don't know.

1677
01:41:17,118 --> 01:41:18,995
Come on, Fidel!

1678
01:41:19,412 --> 01:41:20,663
[in English] You deserve to be heard.

1679
01:41:20,747 --> 01:41:22,749
And I really think we should go for it.

1680
01:41:22,832 --> 01:41:23,750
[in Tagalog] I've gotten rusty.

1681
01:41:23,917 --> 01:41:26,628
Whatever. I'll wait for you. Be there.

1682
01:41:27,003 --> 01:41:28,088
Ciao!

1683
01:41:35,345 --> 01:41:37,305
[cell phone ringing]

1684
01:41:44,354 --> 01:41:45,271
[in English] Hello?

1685
01:41:45,355 --> 01:41:46,272
[Stella] <i>Fidel?</i>

1686
01:41:46,940 --> 01:41:48,525
Yes, ma'am. Speaking.

1687
01:41:48,692 --> 01:41:51,528
[in Tagalog] <i>You haven't
changed your number.</i>

1688
01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:53,071
<i>You busy?</i>

1689
01:41:53,321 --> 01:41:55,073
<i>I have your poems.</i>

1690
01:41:56,658 --> 01:41:58,702
[Fidel] I thought they were destroyed.

1691
01:41:58,785 --> 01:42:00,161
How did you get them?

1692
01:42:00,662 --> 01:42:03,957
Danica put it back together.

1693
01:42:05,625 --> 01:42:07,210
Such a hardworking girl.

1694
01:42:08,169 --> 01:42:10,171
No wonder she's summa cum laude.

1695
01:42:12,882 --> 01:42:14,259
Have you read them?

1696
01:42:14,926 --> 01:42:15,760
Yes.

1697
01:42:19,514 --> 01:42:20,640
I'm amused.

1698
01:42:21,266 --> 01:42:23,852
I can see the improvement in your writing.

1699
01:42:24,811 --> 01:42:27,272
The first half is funny.

1700
01:42:27,981 --> 01:42:30,108
Like you were forcing rhyme.

1701
01:42:31,234 --> 01:42:32,527
It's wonderful, though.

1702
01:42:32,610 --> 01:42:34,279
You got better and better.

1703
01:42:35,071 --> 01:42:38,033
You even wrote in English.

1704
01:42:40,243 --> 01:42:42,120
But honestly?

1705
01:42:42,620 --> 01:42:46,082
I don't dig the latter half.

1706
01:42:47,876 --> 01:42:48,877
Why?

1707
01:42:49,794 --> 01:42:51,004
Uh...

1708
01:42:51,546 --> 01:42:55,050
They no longer mirrored
the actual events in my life.

1709
01:42:55,633 --> 01:42:58,386
I used "mirror" in a sentence.

1710
01:42:58,470 --> 01:42:59,721
Awesome.

1711
01:43:04,434 --> 01:43:05,435
Look.

1712
01:43:07,395 --> 01:43:08,438
[in English] Finally.

1713
01:43:10,231 --> 01:43:12,817
[in Tagalog] We're on the other side
of Mt. Arayat.

1714
01:43:14,694 --> 01:43:16,029
[Fidel] Finally.

1715
01:43:17,739 --> 01:43:19,616
Too bad the sky is gloomy.

1716
01:43:22,410 --> 01:43:24,704
You told me back then

1717
01:43:25,330 --> 01:43:27,957
[stammers] you liked rainy

1718
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:29,793
more than sunny days?

1719
01:43:31,294 --> 01:43:35,382
Listening to music is better
when it's raining.

1720
01:43:38,510 --> 01:43:39,761
That was before.

1721
01:43:49,688 --> 01:43:51,898
The hundredth poem...

1722
01:43:54,067 --> 01:43:55,694
Have you read it?

1723
01:44:02,367 --> 01:44:03,493
It's not here.

1724
01:44:04,494 --> 01:44:05,954
It's faded.

1725
01:44:11,334 --> 01:44:12,877
It is.

1726
01:44:15,672 --> 01:44:17,424
What's the title?

1727
01:44:20,051 --> 01:44:21,845
I forget.

1728
01:44:22,679 --> 01:44:24,848
What's the content?

1729
01:44:26,516 --> 01:44:27,809
What's it about?

1730
01:44:29,978 --> 01:44:32,897
Can't you recall at least a verse?

1731
01:44:36,317 --> 01:44:38,903
I really can't remember.

1732
01:44:40,280 --> 01:44:41,281
Sorry.

1733
01:44:53,084 --> 01:44:54,377
Time to go.

1734
01:45:11,186 --> 01:45:12,354
What?

1735
01:45:17,859 --> 01:45:19,652
I like you.

1736
01:45:22,072 --> 01:45:24,199
I love you.

1737
01:45:25,867 --> 01:45:28,703
[stammers] That's the point...

1738
01:45:29,496 --> 01:45:31,581
of the final poem.

1739
01:45:33,875 --> 01:45:35,460
Since when?

1740
01:45:36,753 --> 01:45:38,338
[in English] First year.

1741
01:45:43,551 --> 01:45:45,637
[in Tagalog] Why tell me now?

1742
01:45:47,806 --> 01:45:49,933
Because you stutter?

1743
01:45:52,018 --> 01:45:55,647
You think I wouldn't like you
because you stutter?

1744
01:45:56,147 --> 01:45:58,108
Or is this about your three-word rule?

1745
01:46:00,360 --> 01:46:01,903
Why, Fidel?

1746
01:46:03,363 --> 01:46:05,532
How many words do you even need?

1747
01:46:06,074 --> 01:46:07,242
Huh?

1748
01:46:09,035 --> 01:46:10,286
[in English] I... Like... You.

1749
01:46:14,040 --> 01:46:15,583
I... Love... You.

1750
01:46:16,710 --> 01:46:18,336
[in Tagalog] Why didn't you just say it?

1751
01:46:27,971 --> 01:46:29,472
Did you love...

1752
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:33,393
Did you love me, too, Stella?

1753
01:46:45,530 --> 01:46:47,282
I still do.

1754
01:46:52,078 --> 01:46:54,414
Back in third year...

1755
01:46:59,210 --> 01:47:02,422
when you were willing
to let go of that offer,

1756
01:47:02,505 --> 01:47:03,798
what bar was it again?

1757
01:47:03,882 --> 01:47:05,759
Tipsy Tarsier.

1758
01:47:07,385 --> 01:47:08,803
I realized...

1759
01:47:09,721 --> 01:47:12,098
you were willing to sacrifice for me.

1760
01:47:18,813 --> 01:47:20,273
What happened?

1761
01:47:22,901 --> 01:47:24,611
Why did you leave?

1762
01:47:26,529 --> 01:47:31,743
[stammers] Why did you replace me
just like that?

1763
01:47:33,203 --> 01:47:34,204
[in English] Sorry.

1764
01:47:34,746 --> 01:47:36,081
[in Tagalog] Tell me.

1765
01:47:40,502 --> 01:47:41,628
Because...

1766
01:47:44,798 --> 01:47:49,552
[crying] Because I use every
man who pursues me.

1767
01:47:50,929 --> 01:47:52,722
Barrie, Hunter...

1768
01:47:52,806 --> 01:47:54,474
You, almost.

1769
01:47:55,016 --> 01:47:56,226
I don't want to use you.

1770
01:47:56,309 --> 01:47:58,186
Not you.

1771
01:47:58,687 --> 01:48:00,605
So I distanced myself.

1772
01:48:05,276 --> 01:48:06,695
After that,

1773
01:48:07,112 --> 01:48:11,157
I left home and wandered off.

1774
01:48:13,243 --> 01:48:14,703
I remember...

1775
01:48:15,745 --> 01:48:17,038
it was raining then.

1776
01:48:19,582 --> 01:48:21,167
Von found me.

1777
01:48:23,878 --> 01:48:25,880
I thought it was you.

1778
01:48:28,049 --> 01:48:30,427
I wanted it to be you.

1779
01:48:31,803 --> 01:48:33,555
But it was Von who found me.

1780
01:48:35,306 --> 01:48:36,307
Don't go!

1781
01:48:36,391 --> 01:48:38,560
-Hey! Let me out.
-I said don't go!

1782
01:48:38,643 --> 01:48:41,104
-I said let me out!
-You're not going anywhere!

1783
01:48:41,187 --> 01:48:42,856
Why leave?

1784
01:48:44,649 --> 01:48:47,235
You don't have anywhere to go.

1785
01:48:50,739 --> 01:48:52,240
Stay here.

1786
01:48:53,908 --> 01:48:55,326
Let's live together.

1787
01:48:57,704 --> 01:49:01,166
I know I don't have much.

1788
01:49:02,375 --> 01:49:03,918
My house is small.

1789
01:49:05,003 --> 01:49:07,047
My life's simple.

1790
01:49:12,260 --> 01:49:13,845
But, Stella,

1791
01:49:14,679 --> 01:49:16,765
I can take care of you.

1792
01:49:19,225 --> 01:49:21,394
You have nothing.

1793
01:49:24,064 --> 01:49:25,482
Me, too.

1794
01:49:27,776 --> 01:49:29,402
Then let's stick together.

1795
01:49:29,861 --> 01:49:31,363
Let's be partners.

1796
01:49:35,867 --> 01:49:37,660
I'll drive you crazy.

1797
01:49:39,496 --> 01:49:40,663
Great!

1798
01:49:41,998 --> 01:49:43,625
Crazy is fun!

1799
01:49:48,254 --> 01:49:50,048
[screams]

1800
01:49:53,134 --> 01:49:54,886
[laughs]

1801
01:49:55,470 --> 01:49:56,763
[Stella]<i> Because of him...</i>

1802
01:49:58,890 --> 01:50:01,184
<i>Because of him, I learned how to love</i>

1803
01:50:01,559 --> 01:50:03,645
without using people.

1804
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:10,151
[crying]

1805
01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:22,706
[crying] Fidel, don't cry like that.

1806
01:50:26,334 --> 01:50:27,335
Is it...

1807
01:50:30,046 --> 01:50:31,548
no longer possible...

1808
01:50:32,674 --> 01:50:35,135
[stammers] for us to end up together?

1809
01:50:36,803 --> 01:50:37,846
Enough.

1810
01:50:43,351 --> 01:50:44,936
That's enough.

1811
01:51:12,922 --> 01:51:14,632
Von and I are married now, Fidel.

1812
01:51:18,928 --> 01:51:21,389
We're having a baby.

1813
01:51:22,682 --> 01:51:25,185
You and I are no longer possible.

1814
01:51:31,524 --> 01:51:33,193
[in English] Sorry.

1815
01:51:35,070 --> 01:51:36,654
[in Tagalog] Not anymore.

1816
01:51:44,496 --> 01:51:46,956
This is for you.

1817
01:51:51,002 --> 01:51:54,172
That's what we performed
on Freshies' Night.

1818
01:51:59,761 --> 01:52:01,680
Come on, it's almost dark.

1819
01:52:01,763 --> 01:52:02,764
I need to go home.

1820
01:52:02,847 --> 01:52:04,641
Stella, wait.

1821
01:52:08,561 --> 01:52:10,772
Damn, it hurts so much.

1822
01:52:13,108 --> 01:52:14,192
It does.

1823
01:52:21,157 --> 01:52:23,159
[stammers] You became my world.

1824
01:52:24,744 --> 01:52:26,913
Shit, I'm so corny.

1825
01:52:26,996 --> 01:52:28,748
What will I do now?

1826
01:52:28,832 --> 01:52:30,458
What will I do?

1827
01:52:31,918 --> 01:52:33,253
<i>Nothing.</i>

1828
01:52:33,336 --> 01:52:35,672
<i>My world has crumbled.</i>

1829
01:52:38,258 --> 01:52:39,926
How do I...

1830
01:52:40,510 --> 01:52:44,514
How do I move on from this?

1831
01:52:49,769 --> 01:52:51,479
I know you.

1832
01:52:53,565 --> 01:52:55,942
You can do it.

1833
01:52:57,819 --> 01:52:59,738
You will move on.

1834
01:53:01,740 --> 01:53:03,575
You will shine.

1835
01:53:05,493 --> 01:53:07,829
<i>Forget about me and you will shine bright.</i>

1836
01:53:14,085 --> 01:53:16,880
I don't deserve to be your world.

1837
01:53:21,801 --> 01:53:23,553
You can do it.

1838
01:53:42,155 --> 01:53:43,406
[Stella on tape] <i>Fidel.</i>

1839
01:53:43,490 --> 01:53:46,785
<i>Sorry it took this long.</i>

1840
01:53:48,870 --> 01:53:51,414
<i>I'm recording this from my room.</i>

1841
01:53:51,498 --> 01:53:54,084
<i>Don't expect studio quality.</i>

1842
01:53:54,542 --> 01:53:56,044
<i>Anyway,</i>

1843
01:53:56,503 --> 01:53:59,589
<i>this is for the nicest</i>

1844
01:53:59,881 --> 01:54:02,634
<i>and the smartest person I know.</i>

1845
01:54:03,051 --> 01:54:04,052
<i>Fine.</i>

1846
01:54:04,135 --> 01:54:05,804
<i>Cute, too.</i>

1847
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:15,146
[singing] <i>See these thousands of people</i>

1848
01:54:17,232 --> 01:54:22,112
<i>Each with his own path to pave</i>

1849
01:54:23,613 --> 01:54:29,244
<i>For sure we'll struggle and get scared</i>

1850
01:54:29,369 --> 01:54:30,412
[phone ringing]

1851
01:54:30,954 --> 01:54:31,996
[Fidel speaking English] <i>Hello, Chuck?</i>

1852
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:33,873
[in Tagalog] <i>Ready to audition?</i>

1853
01:54:35,709 --> 01:54:39,462
The panelists were all smiles.
I think we're in!

1854
01:54:40,213 --> 01:54:43,508
[stammers] I hope so.
I cracked on the last chorus.

1855
01:54:43,591 --> 01:54:46,553
Yeah, but don't worry.

1856
01:54:46,845 --> 01:54:48,847
What they're after is potential.

1857
01:54:49,431 --> 01:54:50,932
[cell phone chiming]

1858
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:57,981
What's the matter?

1859
01:55:01,192 --> 01:55:02,193
Hey!

1860
01:55:04,612 --> 01:55:06,031
Don't kill yourself.

1861
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:08,533
We're not in?

1862
01:55:11,911 --> 01:55:13,496
[sighs]

1863
01:55:13,580 --> 01:55:14,873
Oh, well.

1864
01:55:15,874 --> 01:55:18,668
[stammers] There will be other chances.

1865
01:55:19,085 --> 01:55:22,088
Let's do better next time.

1866
01:55:23,465 --> 01:55:25,717

[in Tagalog] Sol, sweetie, get my coffee.

1872
01:55:37,270 --> 01:55:38,938
[in English] I'll just go
to the bank first--

1873
01:55:39,022 --> 01:55:40,023
Ma'am!

1874
01:55:43,568 --> 01:55:45,320
Fidel?

1875
01:55:45,862 --> 01:55:46,905
Fidel!

1876
01:55:49,032 --> 01:55:50,784
[in Tagalog] How have you been?

1877
01:55:51,868 --> 01:55:56,247
Sol, sweetheart, this is Fidel,
my former student from PAC.

1878
01:55:56,331 --> 01:55:58,541
Fidel? The one you were telling me about?

1879
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,460
Uh...

1880
01:56:00,543 --> 01:56:02,045
Oh, no.

1881
01:56:02,128 --> 01:56:03,630
What about me?

1882
01:56:03,713 --> 01:56:05,382
You know,

1883
01:56:05,465 --> 01:56:07,884
poems and stuff.

1884
01:56:08,760 --> 01:56:10,345
Wait, the bank is closing.

1885
01:56:10,428 --> 01:56:12,681
Sol, sweetheart, you go order.

1886
01:56:12,764 --> 01:56:14,724
-Fidel, I'll leave you two.
-Okay, ma'am.

1887
01:56:14,808 --> 01:56:15,975
[in English] Okay, bye-bye.

1888
01:56:16,059 --> 01:56:17,060
[in Tagalog] See you.

1889
01:56:19,729 --> 01:56:22,774
What happened to you
and the black lipstick girl?

1890
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:25,193
Wow.

1891
01:56:25,402 --> 01:56:26,986
You know about her.

1892
01:56:27,445 --> 01:56:28,655
Uh...

1893
01:56:29,948 --> 01:56:32,742
[stammering] We didn't end up together.

1894
01:56:34,703 --> 01:56:36,538
That's how it goes, right?

1895
01:56:36,830 --> 01:56:41,960
You don't end up with the person you want.

1896
01:56:43,336 --> 01:56:44,963
Is that so?

1897
01:56:45,213 --> 01:56:47,090
[chuckles]

1898
01:56:48,883 --> 01:56:54,639
Are you that daughter of Mrs. Barloza--

1899
01:56:54,723 --> 01:56:56,182
Who went to rehab?

1900
01:56:56,266 --> 01:56:57,350
Yup, that's me.

1901
01:56:57,434 --> 01:56:58,768
Don't worry. I'm fine now.

1902
01:56:58,852 --> 01:57:00,770
I'm into swimming now.

1903
01:57:04,858 --> 01:57:05,942
What are you doing?

1904
01:57:07,402 --> 01:57:09,612
Writing.

1905
01:57:10,071 --> 01:57:11,239
A poem?

1906
01:57:11,322 --> 01:57:12,866
Can I see?

1907
01:57:13,575 --> 01:57:16,411
It's... It's not yet finished.

1908
01:57:16,703 --> 01:57:18,121
It's ugly.

1909
01:57:19,289 --> 01:57:20,915
I'm still looking for--

1910
01:57:20,999 --> 01:57:22,000

[stammers] I haven't thought
of a rhyme for "boulder."

[in English] "Conquer"!
