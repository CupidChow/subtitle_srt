1
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:28,233
Bit by bit, we are starting to
get a relatively clearer picture as

2
00:00:28,258 --> 00:00:33,115
to how exactly this community quarantine
on the Philippines' capital region

3
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:34,864
Metro Manila will
be implemented.

4
00:00:34,889 --> 00:00:37,704
Beginning March 17 until April 13,

5
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:41,539
the entire Luzon is under
enhanced community quarantine.

6
00:00:41,564 --> 00:00:45,475
A strict home quarantine will
be observed in all households.

7
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:52,789
Community quarantine is hereby
imposed in the entire of Metro Manila.

8
00:00:52,814 --> 00:01:00,898
And in other areas, the LGUs are advised
to abide by the following guidelines.

9
00:01:00,923 --> 00:01:05,945
Movement shall be limited to
accessing basic necessities;

10
00:01:06,256 --> 00:01:12,387
Provision for food and essential
health services shall be regulated;

11
00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:17,035
and there will be heightened
presence of uniformed personnel

12
00:01:17,234 --> 00:01:20,812
to enforce quarantine procedures.

13
00:01:28,953 --> 00:01:32,880
In accordance with the recommendation
by the Inter-Agency Task Force

14
00:01:32,905 --> 00:01:36,326
or IATF headed by
the Department of Health

15
00:01:36,326 --> 00:01:41,750
Malacañang said it's all systems go for
the implementation of the total lockdown

16
00:01:41,775 --> 00:01:46,750
all over the Philippines
starting tomorrow, March 15, 2020.

17
00:01:46,894 --> 00:01:49,814
And will last for a
month and a half.

18
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:53,426
Contingent on the spread of
the deadly COVID-19 virus.

19
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:54,010
Damn.

20
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:59,949
As of yesterday, the total number of
active COVID-19 cases in the country is 34

21
00:01:59,974 --> 00:02:03,540
and seven infected
Filipinos have already died.

22
00:02:03,647 --> 00:02:06,289
With the implementation
of the total lockdown,

23
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:10,902
only those who fall in the category
of essential government workers,

24
00:02:10,902 --> 00:02:15,531
frontliners or those working
in the hospital, media men

25
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:20,428
and food manufacturing workers are
allowed to come out of their dwelling.

26
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:24,507
The rest of the population,
especially senior citizens and children

27
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,531
who are considered vulnerable to the
coronavirus, are advised to stay at home

28
00:02:29,604 --> 00:02:33,650
and take precautionary measures
like wearing a face mask,

29
00:02:33,675 --> 00:02:38,513
handwashing and social distancing
to prevent the spread of the virus.

30
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:42,642
Based on the latest data released
by the World Health Organization,

31
00:02:42,642 --> 00:02:47,188
there are currently over 1.5
million cases around the globe

32
00:02:47,188 --> 00:02:51,734
and almost 100 thousand deaths
due to the coronavirus.

33
00:02:51,734 --> 00:02:57,532
80 percent of the world's COVID-19 cases
are those considered immunocompromised

34
00:02:57,557 --> 00:03:00,013
or currently suffering from other diseases

35
00:03:00,038 --> 00:03:04,726
like hypertension, diabetes
and cancer related illnesses.

36
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:09,168
Meanwhile, following the total
lockdown of countries in North America...

37
00:03:09,193 --> 00:03:13,851
including the United States and
Canada and other European countries...

38
00:03:21,773 --> 00:03:28,062
like the UK, France, Italy and Spain,
other Southeast Asian countries...

39
00:03:34,045 --> 00:03:40,660
like Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and
Indonesia are also closing its borders...

40
00:04:13,898 --> 00:04:18,934
As the number of COVID-19 cases
continue to rise around the world.

41
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,138
Hundreds of thousands
of passengers, including...

42
00:04:33,302 --> 00:04:38,083
Returning citizens and mostly
tourists are stranded, leaving them...

43
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:45,239
with no choice but to rebook.

44
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:53,357
or cancel their flights.

45
00:05:33,628 --> 00:05:34,712
I’m gonna wash.

46
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:56,594
Hey, babe, are you sure
that your Aunt Angie

47
00:07:56,619 --> 00:07:58,878
is going to be okay with
my parents staying with her?

48
00:07:58,903 --> 00:08:02,490
- Of course, Aunt Angie loves guests.
- And Pippa as well?

49
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:04,385
She loves kids, too.

50
00:08:04,994 --> 00:08:06,615
- Here you go.
- Okay.

51
00:08:06,711 --> 00:08:07,837
Sure.

52
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:17,450
I just want to get some
work done before they arrive.

53
00:08:17,475 --> 00:08:19,983
- I'm so tired.
- Yeah, go ahead.

54
00:08:21,575 --> 00:08:23,285
Thank you, by the way.

55
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,937
My pleasure.

56
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:29,573
After all this time,

57
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,932
I still can't understand
why you eat your sandwiches like that.

58
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:36,616
If I didn't eat my sandwich like this,
then you would never have noticed me.

59
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,624
- I noticed you for other reasons.
- Like what?

60
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:42,749
Like your beautiful smile, babe.

61
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:46,014
Alright. No.

62
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:50,373
I only have this beautiful
smile because of you.

63
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:55,160
Speaking of food, actually.

64
00:08:55,656 --> 00:08:57,241
How about for lunch?

65
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,477
I can make sinigang, extra sour.
Just like your parents like.

66
00:09:01,502 --> 00:09:04,100
And some chicken adobo
for Aunt Angie.

67
00:09:04,184 --> 00:09:07,644
- Sounds good, no okra?
- No okra just for you.

68
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:09,241
Yeah, sorry.

69
00:09:09,266 --> 00:09:11,815
Even if I love it,
I'll take it out for you.

70
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,741
You're my olive girl,
so it's fine.

71
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:16,362
How about groceries
for the rest of the week?

72
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:18,534
I went grocery shopping yesterday

73
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,444
so I think we should be
good for about a week or so.

74
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,650
No idea what's going to happen
next when the lockdown starts.

75
00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:29,749
- Does anyone?
- Actually it starts tomorrow.

76
00:09:29,774 --> 00:09:30,897
What about work?

77
00:09:31,532 --> 00:09:35,514
I go in at around 9 AM,
and I should be done by dinner time.

78
00:09:35,665 --> 00:09:36,724
Sure.

79
00:09:38,365 --> 00:09:41,096
Alright, this was a complete
mess at the moment.

80
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:42,913
I don't know what's
going to happen next.

81
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:44,726
Just be careful out there.

82
00:09:44,773 --> 00:09:47,272
We'll see. I really don't
know what's going on yet.

83
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,233
No, I don't think anyone does.

84
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:50,260
Yeah.

85
00:09:51,214 --> 00:09:54,843
UK's been completely
a mess lately as well.

86
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,179
- Everywhere is a mess.
- Yeah.

87
00:09:58,204 --> 00:10:02,459
That's how it is in the end. But
we'll get through it, we always do.

88
00:10:09,337 --> 00:10:12,799
Sofia, you behave.

89
00:10:23,393 --> 00:10:25,228
Please come in.

90
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:27,098
- Good morning Ma'am.
- Good morning.

91
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:30,919
- Sir, good morning.
- Good morning.

92
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:33,571
- This is everything.
- Go inside.

93
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,467
Please bring them inside
the room. Kindly arrange them.

94
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:41,721
Also clean the bathroom please
because we have visitors coming today.

95
00:10:41,721 --> 00:10:45,099
- I'll take care of it.
- Thank you.

96
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,817
Yuck.

97
00:10:54,229 --> 00:10:56,856
These people are such pigs.

98
00:10:57,943 --> 00:10:59,570
Give it to me.

99
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:04,497
Ugh, disgusting!

100
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:05,732
Come here.

101
00:11:08,556 --> 00:11:10,558
- Oh my!
- Mom, what's that?

102
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,460
That's nothing.

103
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:14,636
They are so dirty.
So disgusting.

104
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:18,040
It's sickening, leaving
their mess behind.

105
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:19,524
So nasty!

106
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:22,505
So vulgar! My God!

107
00:11:24,106 --> 00:11:28,666
You know, they will
probably go to hell.

108
00:11:28,691 --> 00:11:33,404
- Why?
- They only think of their wordly desires.

109
00:11:33,457 --> 00:11:37,317
So don't be like them.

110
00:11:37,638 --> 00:11:39,973
Do you want a banana,
or an apple?

111
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:42,757
Apple comes fine
with the sandwich.

112
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:51,249
Do you know that this Corona Virus
is a sign that we are all sinners?

113
00:11:53,142 --> 00:11:55,373
We are all being punished for our sins.

114
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:57,982
Because now the world
is full of carnal desires.

115
00:11:58,007 --> 00:12:02,720
The youth of today is
immersed in sexual pleasures.

116
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,578
See, your father left us
for another woman.

117
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:15,656
Why? Because I'm
a one-man woman.

118
00:12:16,492 --> 00:12:19,152
I'm scared to go to hell.

119
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:24,015
Don't think of boys yet.

120
00:12:27,845 --> 00:12:31,307
- Hi ma'am, we are already done.
- Thank you.

121
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:33,918
Where is the AC repairman?

122
00:12:33,943 --> 00:12:37,726
Oh Jomar? He was
supposed to be here already.

123
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:39,753
I'll check on him.

124
00:12:40,495 --> 00:12:42,080
Maybe that's him.

125
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:47,211
- Come in.
- Good morning.

126
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:51,090
I'm sorry for being late.

127
00:12:51,115 --> 00:12:55,870
It was hard to get in your
building they were so strict.

128
00:12:56,124 --> 00:13:00,015
- The AC is here.
- I'll go ahead, please fix their AC.

129
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:00,916
Thank you ma'am.

130
00:13:00,941 --> 00:13:03,338
I'm going to take the trash out
and get something from downstair.

131
00:13:03,363 --> 00:13:04,280
Sure.

132
00:13:04,305 --> 00:13:06,557
The AC is leaking.

133
00:13:06,646 --> 00:13:09,691
It doesn't cool the room.

134
00:13:10,482 --> 00:13:13,694
I will check first, maybe
it needs more freon.

135
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:17,336
Do you have a ladder I can use?

136
00:13:17,361 --> 00:13:18,458
Excuse me.

137
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:20,421
- Would you be able to take this?
- Yes, sir.

138
00:13:20,446 --> 00:13:21,446
Thank you.

139
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:23,739
Walk faster.

140
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,181
Ma'am, take the elevator.

141
00:13:29,073 --> 00:13:31,180
No, sir. We're not allowed.

142
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:34,227
- We have garbage.
- Are you sure?

143
00:13:34,252 --> 00:13:37,164
Yeah, we need to use the stairs.

144
00:13:37,203 --> 00:13:39,898
- Okay.
- Thank you.

145
00:13:40,081 --> 00:13:41,225
Open it.

146
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:45,334
Go down there.

147
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:15,891
- Hey, how was your morning?
- Good morning sir, I'm doing good.

148
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,376
- Good, you ready to go, shall we?
- Shall we?

149
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:18,615
Yeah.

150
00:16:30,728 --> 00:16:32,605
So what are you doing
during the lockdown?

151
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,258
I'm going to go back
to my province, sir.

152
00:16:36,143 --> 00:16:38,061
You'll be back in a
couple of weeks, right?

153
00:16:38,099 --> 00:16:40,020
I think so, sir.

154
00:16:40,277 --> 00:16:42,951
- Do you have it?
- Of course.

155
00:17:03,603 --> 00:17:05,511
Thank you, sir.

156
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:07,204
Thank you, you take
care of yourself, okay?

157
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:08,856
- Alright, sir.
- Thank you.

158
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:58,289
Ma'am, your AC is fixed.

159
00:17:58,314 --> 00:18:01,192
Thank you, how much?

160
00:18:01,217 --> 00:18:02,499
Three thousand.

161
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:03,650
- Are you done?
- Yeah.

162
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:04,784
Sir, it's done.

163
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:06,407
- How much?
- Three thousand.

164
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:09,814
I'll take care of the ladder.

165
00:18:11,384 --> 00:18:12,731
Thank you.

166
00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:16,549
Boys, when are we
doing the transfer?

167
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:19,558
- Probably tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

168
00:18:21,265 --> 00:18:23,267
I don't want to get caught.
This is my big moment.

169
00:18:23,292 --> 00:18:25,751
- No problem.
- I did a lot of work to get this quiet.

170
00:18:25,776 --> 00:18:26,796
No shit.

171
00:18:26,908 --> 00:18:28,075
Thank you boss.

172
00:18:28,762 --> 00:18:29,763
I got you.

173
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:31,165
And you.

174
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:38,869
This isn't what we talked about.

175
00:18:40,073 --> 00:18:41,290
What we talked about?

176
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:45,358
- Where's the rest?
- It's good for now.

177
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,711
For now?

178
00:18:49,113 --> 00:18:50,853
This isn't what we talked about.

179
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,517
That's good for now.

180
00:18:53,093 --> 00:18:54,094
Where's the rest?

181
00:18:54,119 --> 00:18:55,876
I'll get you the rest later.

182
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:58,761
- Not later.
- I always pay, right?

183
00:18:59,407 --> 00:19:03,666
Always pay? Who's to say you're not
going to screw me over like the others?

184
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:06,330
That's true, but you're just
going to have to trust me.

185
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:08,357
I don't trust you.

186
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:10,236
Too bad.

187
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:15,879
- I'm not playing.
- That's good for now.

188
00:19:17,605 --> 00:19:20,233
I want the full payment.

189
00:19:20,258 --> 00:19:23,094
Who do you think you are?

190
00:19:24,233 --> 00:19:26,197
Who do you think you are?

191
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:28,812
Don't put that on my chest.

192
00:19:31,575 --> 00:19:34,703
I brought you on this deal
because I wanted to help you.

193
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:38,014
I'm doing you a favor.

194
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:40,416
What favor? Where's the rest?

195
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:46,295
What are you going to do?

196
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:48,469
You'll get your payment.

197
00:19:48,993 --> 00:19:50,847
I'm going to rat you out.

198
00:19:51,439 --> 00:19:53,157
You're going to rat me out?

199
00:19:53,182 --> 00:19:55,313
You sure you want to do that?

200
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,298
Sure you want to do that?

201
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:02,072
Try me.

202
00:20:04,678 --> 00:20:05,783
Try me.

203
00:20:06,134 --> 00:20:09,137
- You're unbelievable.
- Excuse me?

204
00:20:09,162 --> 00:20:11,018
Get off me.

205
00:20:11,432 --> 00:20:13,309
Stupid slut.

206
00:20:15,444 --> 00:20:18,489
- You don't know what's coming for you.
- Coming for me?

207
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:23,322
Move.

208
00:20:25,356 --> 00:20:27,842
- Can you believe that?
- Crazy, man.

209
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:32,347
I always pay, right?

210
00:20:35,676 --> 00:20:37,260
Relax, boss.

211
00:20:37,966 --> 00:20:39,105
Damn bitch.

212
00:21:05,828 --> 00:21:07,746
Jean has a show today.

213
00:21:08,302 --> 00:21:09,800
Which one is Jean again?

214
00:21:15,913 --> 00:21:18,165
Oh, her.

215
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:23,171
For days now, much has been talked
about corona virus and it's deadly nature.

216
00:21:23,243 --> 00:21:26,747
- Theories from the medical...
- She looks so good.

217
00:21:26,772 --> 00:21:29,958
This has been discussed
numerous times but this time around...

218
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:31,334
They're talking about surviving.

219
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,622
We invited someone

220
00:21:32,647 --> 00:21:34,505
- from the Christian community.
- It's about the covid thing.

221
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:37,449
Why would they get a
pastor instead of a nurse?

222
00:21:37,474 --> 00:21:39,186
Please welcome
Pastor Dante Cruz.

223
00:21:39,585 --> 00:21:40,648
Hello, Pastor.

224
00:21:40,673 --> 00:21:42,482
What do you think
about this pandemic?

225
00:21:42,507 --> 00:21:45,761
Well, first of all,
thank you for having me.

226
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:50,332
I think this is a sign
that God is watching us.

227
00:21:51,324 --> 00:21:54,535
And this is what we've
been preoccupied with

228
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,710
that we tend to center our lives

229
00:21:56,735 --> 00:22:01,772
with earthly material things
that we tend to forget him.

230
00:22:02,202 --> 00:22:03,286
On the other hand.

231
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,993
Anything bad happens,
it's just God's will.

232
00:22:06,018 --> 00:22:08,936
Remember God's grace,
and it's everlasting...

233
00:22:08,961 --> 00:22:12,272
What kind of qualifications do
you need to be a pastor anyway?

234
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:14,693
Believe in God.

235
00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:17,435
So 90 percent of the population?

236
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,436
Do not fear for I'm with you.

237
00:22:20,454 --> 00:22:26,001
Do not be dismayed for I am your God
and I will strengthen you and help you.

238
00:22:26,047 --> 00:22:27,674
I will uphold you in
my righteousness.

239
00:22:27,699 --> 00:22:29,561
Sounds like bullshit to me.

240
00:22:29,912 --> 00:22:34,124
Who even watches this nowadays?
I wonder how the ratings are doing.

241
00:22:34,149 --> 00:22:35,957
Do you mean to tell us, Pastor,

242
00:22:35,982 --> 00:22:39,998
that we deserve this pandemic
and God led this to happen?

243
00:22:40,315 --> 00:22:42,398
Well, let me put it this way.

244
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,250
This pandemic, I believe is a
result of our own shortcomings.

245
00:22:48,382 --> 00:22:50,426
In a way, it's our fault.

246
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:58,451
Because there are some theories that
were saying that the virus was invented

247
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:00,982
or scientifically modified.

248
00:23:01,537 --> 00:23:06,967
In order to create chaos and disrupt
our activities, which is happening now

249
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,179
Assuming we all survive this pandemic,

250
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:14,139
how can we prevent this
from ever happening again?

251
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,358
I have a simple answer for that.

252
00:23:17,574 --> 00:23:21,584
Repent, repent, and repent.

253
00:23:21,803 --> 00:23:26,028
It's the right time that we
denounce all our earthly desires.

254
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:29,096
So what do you mean,
exactly by that, Pastor?

255
00:23:29,121 --> 00:23:30,998
Is the world coming to an end?

256
00:23:31,023 --> 00:23:33,272
No doubt about it.

257
00:23:33,498 --> 00:23:35,096
The end of the world is upon us.

258
00:23:35,121 --> 00:23:39,375
And this pandemic is only one
of the many signs attached to it.

259
00:23:39,905 --> 00:23:47,133
What we urgently need and do
is ask forgiveness for all our sins.

260
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:51,157
And do things according
to God's teachings.

261
00:24:03,005 --> 00:24:04,256
- Babe.
- Yes?

262
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:06,134
- Guess who messaged?
- Who?

263
00:24:06,673 --> 00:24:07,840
Candice.

264
00:24:09,553 --> 00:24:10,793
What she's saying?

265
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:12,847
She's asking about tonight.

266
00:24:15,302 --> 00:24:19,140
But we have your parents, Pippa
and Aunt Angie, coming over.

267
00:24:19,165 --> 00:24:20,977
It's the lockdown
tonight as well.

268
00:24:21,067 --> 00:24:22,923
I don't think it's a good time.

269
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:27,167
I mean, we've been trying to set
this up for a while and now she's...

270
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:31,235
I'll just get more details.

271
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,961
Yeah, we'll figure it out later.
I'll just finish cooking.

272
00:24:33,986 --> 00:24:35,665
Okay. Smells good.

273
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,270
I can smell the onions
on your hand though.

274
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:06,966
It must be them.

275
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,404
- Hello.
- Hi.

276
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:17,556
Come in. Hi Pippa.

277
00:25:17,556 --> 00:25:20,392
- It's so good to see you.
- Hi there.

278
00:25:20,392 --> 00:25:23,979
- I brought you some stuff.
- Just put it in the kitchen.

279
00:25:23,979 --> 00:25:26,148
Aunt, let me help you with that.

280
00:25:26,148 --> 00:25:27,775
- How are you?
- Okay, I'm fine.

281
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:29,568
Alright, here.
Let's get this out.

282
00:25:29,568 --> 00:25:32,571
- Look at you.
- I've missed you.

283
00:25:32,886 --> 00:25:36,077
That's fine. Hey Dad.

284
00:25:36,717 --> 00:25:37,384
I got to get this off.

285
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:39,078
You're so much bigger, aren't you?

286
00:25:39,118 --> 00:25:40,496
- How are things?
- Very well.

287
00:25:40,496 --> 00:25:41,872
- How are you? Yeah.
- Good.

288
00:25:41,872 --> 00:25:43,022
We're so excited to have you.

289
00:25:43,047 --> 00:25:44,370
Do you guys want some tea?

290
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:46,397
Yes, please. That
would be lovely.

291
00:25:46,422 --> 00:25:48,476
Well, let's go.

292
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:51,632
Oh, this is pretty heavy.

293
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:58,376
Let's get everyone some tea.

294
00:26:04,103 --> 00:26:07,231
Come and sit next to Dad.

295
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:10,445
Look at you.
Look how big you've gotten.

296
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,158
Yes, he has.

297
00:26:13,685 --> 00:26:18,440
- He's doing really well at school now.
- Really what grade is he in now?

298
00:26:18,534 --> 00:26:21,954
I know it's not grade
anymore is it? Classes?

299
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:23,779
Yeah, it's class. Class one.

300
00:26:23,804 --> 00:26:26,517
- I've been in the Philippines too long.
- Yeah. Clearly.

301
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:29,074
- Clearly.
- We know.

302
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:31,106
- Sorry.
- Yeah, we do know.

303
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,549
What have you been up to?

304
00:26:32,581 --> 00:26:35,709
- You've been traveling around as well.
- Yes.

305
00:26:35,734 --> 00:26:38,637
We've had a lot of fun.

306
00:26:38,757 --> 00:26:39,930
Yeah.

307
00:26:39,955 --> 00:26:42,583
I got to get out of here
because I might get stuck.

308
00:26:42,794 --> 00:26:46,839
And with this lockdown thing
or whatever it's crazy.

309
00:26:46,864 --> 00:26:49,436
- I'll just go serve this to them.
- Yeah, sure.

310
00:26:54,934 --> 00:26:56,811
Here you go.

311
00:26:57,797 --> 00:26:59,633
What did you do there?

312
00:27:01,717 --> 00:27:04,678
- I went swimming.
- You went swimming.

313
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,707
Do you like to swim now?

314
00:27:06,732 --> 00:27:09,902
- Thank you. I need this.
- I'll be right back.

315
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:19,340
- So how are things in the UK right now?
- It's wonderful, it's cold there.

316
00:27:19,365 --> 00:27:24,283
It's not like how it is here.
I wanted to stay in my place.

317
00:27:24,308 --> 00:27:27,436
My house is longer,
but I have to get back.

318
00:27:27,978 --> 00:27:33,275
- What's your favorite vegetable?
- My favorite vegetable is "kalabasa."

319
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:36,153
- Kalabasa?
- That's right.

320
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,559
- Pumpkin.
- Okay.

321
00:27:38,714 --> 00:27:40,883
Wait, enough about me.
How was your wedding?

322
00:27:40,908 --> 00:27:42,728
I'm sorry I missed it.

323
00:27:42,753 --> 00:27:44,996
I can't believe you
haven't seen the videos yet.

324
00:27:45,512 --> 00:27:47,598
Yeah, I can't wait to see it.
You have to show me.

325
00:27:47,623 --> 00:27:49,802
I need a copy for myself
so I can see.

326
00:27:49,827 --> 00:27:53,459
- I'll send you a copy.
- I'm gonna cry by myself.

327
00:27:53,484 --> 00:27:58,322
Yeah, well, we had
a really fun week.

328
00:28:00,235 --> 00:28:03,238
Yeah, it would have been better if
you'd been there with us of course.

329
00:28:03,263 --> 00:28:06,642
Just been busy with work, just preparing
before the lockdown and everything.

330
00:28:06,683 --> 00:28:07,785
Yeah.

331
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,458
I know it's a work from home

332
00:28:10,492 --> 00:28:14,542
but I still need to have a stable
internet access, just to get the work done.

333
00:28:14,566 --> 00:28:16,109
Then taking time off hasn't.

334
00:28:16,164 --> 00:28:18,583
So you what? You really
have a duty tomorrow?

335
00:28:18,629 --> 00:28:20,130
- Yes.
- Oh, no.

336
00:28:20,155 --> 00:28:24,063
Yeah, it's been hectic and it's
only going to get more hectic now.

337
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:27,304
- You have to be safe.
- Yes.

338
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:29,498
Because you're going to
have a baby soon, right?

339
00:28:29,498 --> 00:28:33,836
Well, not during the pandemic, but
yeah, the hospital has explained all safety

340
00:28:33,836 --> 00:28:37,798
precautions to us, so we're aware
how to be safe during this time.

341
00:28:38,543 --> 00:28:43,464
Hopefully after the pandemic.
Edward can also give me a baby finally.

342
00:28:44,221 --> 00:28:46,473
But we'll see if he
changes his mind.

343
00:28:46,498 --> 00:28:48,125
And you let Aunt take
care of the babies?

344
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,899
You guys have fun
and do your thing.

345
00:28:53,914 --> 00:28:56,458
Aunt Angie, your favorite food.

346
00:28:56,483 --> 00:28:58,569
- Thank you.
- Oh, wow.

347
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:02,573
- Oh, my goodness.
- Ria, I miss your cooking.

348
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:07,453
This is the best. Speaking
of the best, you know what?

349
00:29:07,703 --> 00:29:12,416
My first, wait, second husband.
You remember Bill right?

350
00:29:12,416 --> 00:29:13,041
Yes.

351
00:29:13,041 --> 00:29:17,671
He was also the best at cooking,
but he was the worst in bed, I mean.

352
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:21,425
Aunt! There's a kid here.

353
00:29:22,317 --> 00:29:23,944
Sorry, sweetheart.

354
00:29:23,969 --> 00:29:28,724
It's okay. He's a
big boy, come on.

355
00:29:31,018 --> 00:29:33,604
You remember George. Right?

356
00:29:33,629 --> 00:29:38,717
Okay, so George, he's like, if
you remember, he's like around 65.

357
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:42,588
The problem with him we're not together
now is because he would always sleep on me.

358
00:29:42,613 --> 00:29:44,114
I mean, do you do that to girls?

359
00:29:44,402 --> 00:29:48,952
When you and the girl gets ready and she's
all set to go, you don't do that, honey.

360
00:29:48,952 --> 00:29:50,871
You're already on top.
And he falls asleep.

361
00:29:50,871 --> 00:29:52,754
You're like, I just
want to slap him.

362
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,767
Men, they don't change.

363
00:29:55,792 --> 00:29:58,613
Yeah, well, we're still young.

364
00:29:59,421 --> 00:30:02,508
Here in the Philippines they
say "when you still can, go for it."

365
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:06,412
When you still can,
have some fun. Right?

366
00:30:07,429 --> 00:30:09,139
Come on Carol, they can.

367
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:10,224
I'm sorry.

368
00:30:17,147 --> 00:30:18,190
[chattering]

369
00:30:19,858 --> 00:30:23,445
When we do these
last even the...

370
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:26,006
Hello everyone.

371
00:30:26,031 --> 00:30:28,242
Thank you so much for coming.

372
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:32,120
Thank you, enjoy.

373
00:30:32,145 --> 00:30:34,443
I really like that.

374
00:30:38,544 --> 00:30:41,588
Hello everyone. Good evening.

375
00:30:41,613 --> 00:30:44,161
Thank you so much for coming.

376
00:30:44,825 --> 00:30:47,094
- Are you enjoying?
- Yes.

377
00:30:47,344 --> 00:30:52,933
Edward, your father and I are
just so happy that you found love.

378
00:30:53,141 --> 00:30:56,895
And that the two of you are
going to have a future together.

379
00:30:57,145 --> 00:31:01,191
Ria, we welcome
you into the family.

380
00:31:01,748 --> 00:31:08,046
I just wanted to share a few words
about partnership and being together.

381
00:31:09,404 --> 00:31:12,219
Being in a partnership, you need...

382
00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:16,719
It was a great day. And
the dress was amazing.

383
00:31:16,744 --> 00:31:19,205
Ria, you really looked
so gorgeous in that dress.

384
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:23,672
- Thanks, Mom.
- Look at that handsome guy.

385
00:31:23,697 --> 00:31:25,782
- Look at daddy.
- Edward looks so hot.

386
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:32,576
Know this marriage is a sacred bond
through good times and bad times.

387
00:31:33,574 --> 00:31:37,077
I'm very happy for you both. And
we are going to be there for you.

388
00:31:37,102 --> 00:31:38,922
As we have been with you before.

389
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:41,486
So we wish you the very best.

390
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:45,328
Do you think they
look very much in love?

391
00:31:46,048 --> 00:31:50,094
It does not boast.
It does not envy.

392
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:56,564
Like what I always tell you
who is patient? It's your father.

393
00:31:58,476 --> 00:32:03,064
And who is more kind.
It's still your father.

394
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:06,543
Edward.

395
00:32:07,053 --> 00:32:11,057
Please take good
care of my daughter.

396
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:13,135
I love you.

397
00:32:14,312 --> 00:32:17,658
You guys are so beautiful.

398
00:32:17,683 --> 00:32:21,242
- What's the name of that friend?
- Erin.

399
00:32:22,194 --> 00:32:24,446
- You knew her a long time, right?
- Yes.

400
00:32:26,258 --> 00:32:29,720
Wow Carol, you look like a bombshell.

401
00:32:29,745 --> 00:32:32,507
You know what? I have
to stop myself from crying.

402
00:32:32,532 --> 00:32:35,431
My friendship with Ria
started seven years ago

403
00:32:35,456 --> 00:32:38,894
when she was introduced to
me by one of our close friends.

404
00:32:38,948 --> 00:32:42,347
And since then, she has
always been my best friend.

405
00:32:42,372 --> 00:32:45,500
My partner in crime,
and my confidant.

406
00:32:46,427 --> 00:32:51,558
Ria, I hope that this marriage will not
change the special bond that we have.

407
00:32:52,597 --> 00:32:54,015
And Edward,

408
00:32:54,708 --> 00:32:57,377
I hope that you take
good care of her.

409
00:32:58,361 --> 00:33:00,892
Please keep in mind
that I will always be here,

410
00:33:00,917 --> 00:33:03,479
no matter what challenge
you guys may face.

411
00:33:04,358 --> 00:33:09,464
I wish you all the best and I hope that
you may love each other unconditionally.

412
00:33:09,972 --> 00:33:12,041
Congratulations, newlyweds.

413
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,628
It's such a nice setup.

414
00:33:26,653 --> 00:33:28,447
- Well, here you are again.
- Yes,

415
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:32,052
Hello.

416
00:33:34,093 --> 00:33:35,136
Hey.

417
00:33:37,881 --> 00:33:39,437
Are you sure this time?

418
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:43,136
Because you've already
stood us up twice.

419
00:33:47,363 --> 00:33:48,614
We can't right now.

420
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:50,406
My parents are over.

421
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,026
Maybe a bit later tonight,
maybe around nine.

422
00:33:57,051 --> 00:33:58,764
I'll need to double
check with Ria.

423
00:34:00,315 --> 00:34:02,460
Yeah, I'll confirm with her
and I'll get back to you.

424
00:34:02,993 --> 00:34:04,143
But are you sure this time?

425
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,788
Okay, just before
lockdown, then.

426
00:34:08,691 --> 00:34:09,858
Alright, I'll talk to you later.

427
00:34:10,046 --> 00:34:11,189
Yeah.

428
00:34:11,214 --> 00:34:14,009
That's really so sad
you weren't there.

429
00:34:14,034 --> 00:34:16,526
I would have loved
a speech from you.

430
00:34:20,815 --> 00:34:23,318
Grandma, I need to pee.

431
00:34:23,343 --> 00:34:25,387
Alright, he needs
to use the bathroom.

432
00:34:25,412 --> 00:34:27,644
Yeah, I'll take him.

433
00:34:28,953 --> 00:34:31,080
That's just this way.

434
00:34:34,196 --> 00:34:36,448
Just through this room.

435
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:40,635
It's good, they're spending time.
It's been so long.

436
00:34:40,781 --> 00:34:43,575
- Do you need any help?
- No, it's okay.

437
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,520
Okay. I'll be out here
when you're done.

438
00:35:16,925 --> 00:35:18,034
Have a seat.

439
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:20,486
Did you wash your hands?

440
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:24,039
- Yes.
- Well, good.

441
00:35:24,064 --> 00:35:26,284
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

442
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:27,977
- You good?
- Yes.

443
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:31,174
Pippa.

444
00:35:32,962 --> 00:35:35,745
You know I love you, right?

445
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:41,856
Do you ever feel that
I don't love you at all?

446
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:46,157
No dad, I also love you.

447
00:35:46,794 --> 00:35:47,878
Really?

448
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:51,700
Do you understand why
I'm not always around?

449
00:35:51,725 --> 00:35:54,183
Yes daddy, I understand.

450
00:35:56,526 --> 00:35:57,612
Okay.

451
00:35:58,697 --> 00:36:00,112
How do you like it here?

452
00:36:03,287 --> 00:36:11,921
Do you ever think that maybe someday
you'd want to stay here with me and Ria?

453
00:36:18,899 --> 00:36:21,182
You do know why
I'm not around right?

454
00:36:23,275 --> 00:36:25,886
You know, we live far apart,

455
00:36:25,911 --> 00:36:29,128
and you know you're with your
grandma and grandpa at the moment.

456
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:30,775
But it's not forever.

457
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:35,112
I need just a couple more years?
You can come over.

458
00:36:35,723 --> 00:36:36,800
Stay here.

459
00:36:38,577 --> 00:36:40,201
Just give me a bit of time.

460
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:43,954
Would you like that?

461
00:36:57,633 --> 00:37:00,969
Pippa, you look just so
much like your mother.

462
00:37:04,436 --> 00:37:05,521
Come here.

463
00:37:17,477 --> 00:37:19,182
That's your friend, right?

464
00:37:19,207 --> 00:37:21,917
[chattering]

465
00:37:22,785 --> 00:37:25,467
[chattering]

466
00:37:25,492 --> 00:37:28,378
So in love. Sweet moments...

467
00:37:28,403 --> 00:37:30,889
- It's time.
- Already?

468
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:32,972
Yeah, we have to be two
hours early for the flight.

469
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:36,544
- We're going to go.
- I'm gonna miss you.

470
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:37,965
I'm gonna miss you too.

471
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,839
Thank you so much. But we really
have to pack and a lot of things to do.

472
00:37:40,864 --> 00:37:42,859
[chattering]

473
00:37:42,884 --> 00:37:45,136
- I mean, it must have been nice.
- Yeah, it was fine.

474
00:37:45,161 --> 00:37:46,926
Let me get that for you.

475
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,367
- You take care.
- For sure.

476
00:37:50,392 --> 00:37:55,689
You go with grandpa. You
need to spend more time with him.

477
00:37:55,689 --> 00:37:59,275
No, it's good. It's nice to
have a visit once in a while.

478
00:37:59,275 --> 00:38:00,944
See you soon Pippa.

479
00:38:00,944 --> 00:38:03,780
Won't you like to spend a
little more time with your son?

480
00:38:03,805 --> 00:38:08,476
A little bit more often, maybe after
this whole pandemic situation is over.

481
00:38:08,635 --> 00:38:10,679
Well, visiting is
not enough, is it?

482
00:38:10,704 --> 00:38:11,621
I mean.

483
00:38:11,646 --> 00:38:13,648
He does need a father.

484
00:38:13,673 --> 00:38:16,893
- He's better off in the UK.
- He's not, what makes you think that?

485
00:38:16,918 --> 00:38:19,562
Why would he be
better without a father?

486
00:38:19,587 --> 00:38:23,133
The education system is better in the UK,
healthcare system is better in the UK.

487
00:38:23,133 --> 00:38:25,235
He's young, he
doesn't need that.

488
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,153
What he needs is an education.

489
00:38:27,178 --> 00:38:30,229
No, he doesn't.
He needs a father.

490
00:38:30,254 --> 00:38:32,131
Well, I'm not ready for that.

491
00:38:32,701 --> 00:38:35,203
Do you know what, young man?
You need to grow up.

492
00:38:35,228 --> 00:38:36,913
He's better off in the UK.

493
00:38:36,938 --> 00:38:39,357
- He's better off in the UK, I'm not ready.
- He's your responsibility.

494
00:38:39,382 --> 00:38:40,925
He's your son.

495
00:38:41,183 --> 00:38:46,980
You have just been relying on me
and your father to look after your child.

496
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:51,284
- Your child needs to be with you.
- Let's not fight in front of him.

497
00:38:52,323 --> 00:38:54,927
He wants to be with you.

498
00:38:55,253 --> 00:38:57,421
Take responsibility.

499
00:38:57,446 --> 00:38:59,073
I just told you, I'm not ready.

500
00:38:59,658 --> 00:39:01,952
Jim, help me out here.

501
00:39:01,977 --> 00:39:02,936
This is...

502
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:06,261
Edward, we told
you numerous times.

503
00:39:06,286 --> 00:39:10,582
It is high time you take responsibility
for your responsibilities in life.

504
00:39:11,657 --> 00:39:17,622
You are immature, childish, and
above everything else, you are selfish.

505
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:20,544
It's just about you, you, you.

506
00:39:20,915 --> 00:39:27,589
Do you ever give any thought to myself,
to your father, to your son, to his life?

507
00:39:27,614 --> 00:39:31,246
What is best for him,
not what is best for you?

508
00:39:34,531 --> 00:39:36,325
You know what, Mom? Just go.

509
00:39:37,526 --> 00:39:39,793
- Well, that's it?
- Yes.

510
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:44,383
You're going to let us walk
out of the door with your son.

511
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:47,388
No emotion.

512
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:50,516
You started this. Just go.

513
00:39:51,573 --> 00:39:54,557
Say goodbye to your son atleast.

514
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:56,648
Give him a hug.

515
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,637
Honey, let's go. We need
to catch the flight, come on.

516
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:08,940
- Come on, let's go.
- That's a waste of time.

517
00:40:08,965 --> 00:40:10,925
Where's that damn mask?

518
00:40:11,634 --> 00:40:12,383
Let's go.

519
00:40:12,408 --> 00:40:14,285
- See you soon aunt. Take care.
- Take care.

520
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,645
Take care Ria.

521
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,631
Come on, come.

522
00:40:37,947 --> 00:40:40,491
How would you define
a relationship, Doc?

523
00:40:40,976 --> 00:40:45,230
Well, personally a relationship for
me is synonymous with connection.

524
00:40:45,255 --> 00:40:50,600
Maybe with another person, an animal,
a thing, or even a place.

525
00:40:50,711 --> 00:40:52,670
But from a psychological standpoint,

526
00:40:52,971 --> 00:40:56,292
study suggests that
a relationship focuses on

527
00:40:56,862 --> 00:41:01,995
the interaction between two individuals;
paying close attention to both behavior

528
00:41:02,031 --> 00:41:06,612
and what goes on in people's minds,
like emotions and cognitions.

529
00:41:06,651 --> 00:41:10,604
Okay, so how do people know
that they are in good relationships?

530
00:41:10,692 --> 00:41:14,032
Well, basically, when there
is harmony between them;

531
00:41:14,057 --> 00:41:16,563
when they complement each other,

532
00:41:16,588 --> 00:41:19,935
when both parties are free to
do and say what pleases them

533
00:41:20,007 --> 00:41:23,052
and when trust is present
and added in a relationship.

534
00:41:24,205 --> 00:41:27,959
So the term toxic relationship
has been a byword these days.

535
00:41:27,984 --> 00:41:30,044
- Yes.
- So how would you define Doc,

536
00:41:30,069 --> 00:41:31,839
what is a toxic relationship?

537
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:36,604
Alright, simply put, it is the
opposite of a healthy relationship.

538
00:41:36,629 --> 00:41:42,135
Now, some signs of a toxic relationship
are fear of confrontation, dishonesty,

539
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,894
patterns of disrespect,
lack of support,

540
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:48,097
miscommunication,
resentment, and jealousy.

541
00:41:48,627 --> 00:41:52,006
What are the common
types of relationship?

542
00:41:52,031 --> 00:41:55,492
Okay, we have six commonly
considered types of relationships.

543
00:41:55,517 --> 00:42:00,847
There is a platonic where you
have a relationship without sex.

544
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:06,792
We have the romantic or feelings of
love and attraction through commitment,

545
00:42:07,218 --> 00:42:09,971
intimacy and infatuation.

546
00:42:10,418 --> 00:42:14,214
There's what we call codependent,
which is basically an imbalanced

547
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:18,058
relationship because one partner
typically has to take care of the other.

548
00:42:18,317 --> 00:42:23,572
There's a casual relationship where
it involves sex without commitment.

549
00:42:23,597 --> 00:42:26,767
There's the one we just
discussed, the toxic relationship,

550
00:42:26,792 --> 00:42:28,006
which is unhealthy

551
00:42:28,064 --> 00:42:30,480
because it harms you emotionally,
physically and psychologically.

552
00:42:30,505 --> 00:42:34,067
- I need to get ready.
- And there's the open relationship.

553
00:42:34,092 --> 00:42:38,283
Which is a consensual
non-monogamous relationship

554
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:40,894
where both partners
sleep with other people.

555
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:43,326
Yeah, pretty much.

556
00:42:43,351 --> 00:42:46,354
Would you consider
these healthy?

557
00:42:47,894 --> 00:42:50,063
Yes and no.

558
00:42:50,088 --> 00:42:55,175
Yes, because there are some who can't,
or aren't ready for commitment,

559
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,636
but in other aspects,
they're ready to have sex.

560
00:42:57,736 --> 00:43:00,009
Now, the same goes
in an open relationship.

561
00:43:00,034 --> 00:43:04,931
Some couples, as their relationship
progresses, resort to engaging in sex

562
00:43:04,956 --> 00:43:09,502
with other people, not because they
are no longer in love with their partners,

563
00:43:09,527 --> 00:43:13,360
but it's just to add flavor
or spice to the relationship.

564
00:43:13,692 --> 00:43:18,875
And no, because it leads
to a lack of self-esteem

565
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,925
for oneself,
or in relationships in general.

566
00:43:22,323 --> 00:43:26,619
So with regards to open relationships
or just any relationship in general,

567
00:43:26,644 --> 00:43:31,862
why is it common to have sex with other
persons, for example, say a threesome?

568
00:43:31,887 --> 00:43:33,430
Okay, that's a good one.

569
00:43:33,501 --> 00:43:37,588
Now, according to studies and
some accounts, a lot of people

570
00:43:37,613 --> 00:43:42,327
consider a threesome to be like
some kind of ultimate sexual fantasy.

571
00:43:42,802 --> 00:43:47,307
They also get the satisfaction of knowing
two people want to have sex with them.

572
00:43:47,332 --> 00:43:49,792
So I suppose you can
say it's an ego boost.

573
00:43:49,894 --> 00:43:53,784
Well, again, these are based on
years of research and studies...

574
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:59,065
First and foremost, don't sacrifice
too much for your relationship.

575
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:04,128
You know, relationships tend to
work best with a mutual give and take.

576
00:44:04,153 --> 00:44:06,989
Another one is don't lose
yourself in the relationship.

577
00:44:07,015 --> 00:44:09,416
Being close to your partner is a positive,

578
00:44:09,441 --> 00:44:13,034
but it's also important
not to lose your individuality.

579
00:44:13,345 --> 00:44:19,797
And lastly, don't avoid every conflict,
you know, by dealing with minor problems

580
00:44:19,822 --> 00:44:24,300
as they arise, you can prevent
them from blowing up into major fights.

581
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:26,429
Very well said, Dr. Pineda.

582
00:44:26,454 --> 00:44:30,683
What an enlightening discussion
we had today. I certainly learned a lot.

583
00:44:30,708 --> 00:44:32,418
Thank you for being on our show.

584
00:44:32,443 --> 00:44:33,652
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

585
00:44:33,677 --> 00:44:34,762
Hey, it's me.

586
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:37,518
Yeah.

587
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:41,859
So, 9 PM?

588
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:57,133
- So I was thinking.
- What is it? About Candice?

589
00:44:58,368 --> 00:45:01,872
- Do you want us to cancel?
- No.

590
00:45:01,897 --> 00:45:06,710
If anything, I'm excited.
It's just I'm a bit nervous as well.

591
00:45:06,744 --> 00:45:07,944
That's alright.

592
00:45:08,425 --> 00:45:15,093
Well, we've been planning this for a while.
She's finally said that she's available,

593
00:45:15,118 --> 00:45:18,398
- So just roll with it, see how it goes?
- Yes.

594
00:45:19,757 --> 00:45:22,093
Do we have enough food, you think?

595
00:45:22,801 --> 00:45:27,181
I think so. I don't know
how to do this really.

596
00:45:28,023 --> 00:45:32,098
Does she stay? We do it,
and then she goes, or...

597
00:45:32,779 --> 00:45:36,676
I don't know. I've always...
What is the etiquette?

598
00:45:38,674 --> 00:45:39,749
Showtime.

599
00:45:39,774 --> 00:45:42,026
I think that should
be her, I'll let her in.

600
00:45:49,827 --> 00:45:52,682
- Hello, come in.
- Hi.

601
00:45:52,707 --> 00:45:54,710
Hi Ria, where's Edward?

602
00:45:54,809 --> 00:45:56,644
Right there preparing
our cheese platter.

603
00:45:56,669 --> 00:45:58,504
- Hi.
- Hello. How are you?

604
00:45:58,529 --> 00:46:03,187
- Nice to finally see you guys.
- After two, or three failed attempts...

605
00:46:03,212 --> 00:46:06,085
- I'm sorry.
- That's alright.

606
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:08,171
That's a nice-looking
cheese platter, Edward.

607
00:46:08,459 --> 00:46:10,825
Thanks. Have you eaten already?

608
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:12,393
- This is fine.
- Okay.

609
00:46:14,433 --> 00:46:18,280
- To tonight.
- To tonight.

610
00:46:22,737 --> 00:46:25,698
How's work with you and Edward?

611
00:46:25,979 --> 00:46:31,985
I mean, as a nurse, it's going to be a bit
hectic in the coming months, but it's okay.

612
00:46:32,224 --> 00:46:36,398
I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to
deal with you being away for so often.

613
00:46:37,581 --> 00:46:40,063
I just have to work.
It's okay making money.

614
00:46:41,568 --> 00:46:43,053
Let's see what we can do.

615
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:45,382
Alright. Cheers.

616
00:46:45,407 --> 00:46:47,265
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

617
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:52,964
That's good wine.

618
00:46:54,082 --> 00:46:58,002
- Welcome. Come inside the room.
- Thank you.

619
00:46:59,127 --> 00:47:01,588
Nice place guys.

620
00:47:01,613 --> 00:47:04,946
My God, you have
an amazing view.

621
00:47:05,171 --> 00:47:09,425
- How long have you lived here?
- Since we got married. About three years.

622
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,047
Yeah, it's been
about three years now.

623
00:47:11,356 --> 00:47:14,192
Came over here
just straight away.

624
00:47:14,733 --> 00:47:16,618
Yeah. Oh, okay.

625
00:47:16,911 --> 00:47:21,375
In terms of the ground rules
that you set up.

626
00:47:21,407 --> 00:47:24,899
I've done my shaving thing,
I felt really weird.

627
00:47:24,924 --> 00:47:26,592
- I've done that.
- Thank you.

628
00:47:26,617 --> 00:47:30,438
Candice, I know you sent us your results,
and I just wanted to give you ours.

629
00:47:30,463 --> 00:47:35,032
But even with all of this, I'd like
us to take some pills just to be safe.

630
00:47:35,202 --> 00:47:39,789
It's just so that none of us can
pass on any diseases to each other.

631
00:47:39,814 --> 00:47:41,899
Thank you. Help me with that.

632
00:47:41,924 --> 00:47:44,794
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

633
00:47:44,819 --> 00:47:46,024
Thank you.

634
00:48:06,775 --> 00:48:07,776
That smells good.

635
00:48:07,801 --> 00:48:09,469
Yeah, that's going to help.

636
00:48:13,313 --> 00:48:15,594
Sorry, it's a little bit strong.

637
00:48:16,838 --> 00:48:18,256
Thank you.

638
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:48,728
If you want to come inside me,
just please use a condom.

639
00:48:48,782 --> 00:48:51,118
For that part, it's okay.

640
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:53,568
- He can finish inside me.
- Okay. Cool.

641
00:48:53,593 --> 00:48:54,969
- You sure?
- Yeah.

642
00:48:54,994 --> 00:48:55,723
Okay.

643
00:48:55,748 --> 00:48:57,750
- Yeah, that's good.
- Alright.

644
00:53:28,454 --> 00:53:29,496
Shoot.

645
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,626
- What's wrong?
- I messed up.

646
00:53:34,313 --> 00:53:35,690
Did you cum?

647
00:53:37,236 --> 00:53:39,488
- Sorry.
- Did you just cum?

648
00:53:39,513 --> 00:53:40,653
Yeah.

649
00:53:46,428 --> 00:53:50,390
- Are you serious?
- I couldn't hold it.

650
00:53:50,415 --> 00:53:52,301
What the heck?

651
00:53:53,645 --> 00:53:55,480
Wait Ria.

652
00:54:18,026 --> 00:54:21,989
Sorry. I know this isn't
what we agreed to.

653
00:54:25,164 --> 00:54:29,036
We have some pills
that you can take.

654
00:55:33,597 --> 00:55:34,639
It's okay.

655
00:55:35,205 --> 00:55:39,317
I think we can all agree that what
happened isn't what we talked about.

656
00:55:40,191 --> 00:55:41,613
Are you okay?

657
00:55:43,124 --> 00:55:45,209
It's not about that.

658
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,621
It's about my boyfriend.

659
00:55:48,682 --> 00:55:52,262
What about your boyfriend?
What happened?

660
00:55:53,004 --> 00:55:54,881
What happened?

661
00:55:58,945 --> 00:56:01,364
So what's up?
You wanted to talk.

662
00:56:01,403 --> 00:56:05,332
Yeah, well, I invited you today because
I wanted to celebrate about something.

663
00:56:05,456 --> 00:56:06,457
Okay.

664
00:56:09,106 --> 00:56:10,566
I'm really nervous.

665
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:15,221
But it's really big news.

666
00:56:16,368 --> 00:56:17,953
I don't know how to say it.

667
00:56:19,306 --> 00:56:20,683
Use words.

668
00:56:22,919 --> 00:56:25,713
Is it a big promotion?

669
00:56:25,738 --> 00:56:28,324
No, it's something bigger.

670
00:56:29,618 --> 00:56:32,152
Tell me about it.
I'm excited to hear.

671
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:35,520
Well, how do I say this?

672
00:56:37,296 --> 00:56:39,382
What happened?

673
00:56:43,038 --> 00:56:46,500
I'm pregnant
and he wants to abort the baby.

674
00:56:49,065 --> 00:56:51,150
I'm so sorry to hear that.

675
00:56:53,473 --> 00:56:55,161
Okay, what's going on?

676
00:56:55,259 --> 00:57:02,641
Well, this is not the kind of thing you
just spring up on somebody like that.

677
00:57:03,382 --> 00:57:05,550
We talked about
things like this, right?

678
00:57:06,606 --> 00:57:07,606
Right?

679
00:57:07,996 --> 00:57:10,371
I'm not, we're not ready.

680
00:57:10,926 --> 00:57:12,820
What do you mean
we're not ready?

681
00:57:12,845 --> 00:57:14,638
- We've been together for years.
- It's not about that.

682
00:57:14,663 --> 00:57:16,165
- It's about...
- It's about what?

683
00:57:17,645 --> 00:57:21,392
- I'm sorry, guys.
- It's okay, we're here.

684
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:25,290
I'm not ready to commit to this.

685
00:57:25,315 --> 00:57:31,332
- To commit to me?
- Can you just calm down?

686
00:57:32,251 --> 00:57:40,426
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

687
00:57:46,198 --> 00:57:49,690
Stop it!
People are looking at us.

688
00:57:49,715 --> 00:57:53,135
Why? Don't you love me?
Answer me.

689
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:56,332
Stop it. Alright. I'm not ready.

690
00:57:59,626 --> 00:58:00,715
Chris?

691
00:58:05,683 --> 00:58:09,520
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to put it out on you.

692
00:58:14,270 --> 00:58:16,981
Well, thank you, guys.

693
00:58:17,006 --> 00:58:19,425
- Thanks as well.
- For letting me.

694
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:21,371
Yeah, sorry again.

695
00:58:21,396 --> 00:58:24,590
- We'll see you out.
- Let's go.

696
00:58:29,077 --> 00:58:33,289
- Thanks for coming in.
- And I'm really sorry about what happened.

697
00:58:33,314 --> 00:58:35,150
No, it was my fault.

698
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:43,869
- I want to make it up to you.
- What do you mean?

699
00:58:43,894 --> 00:58:45,604
You deserve to be satisfied.

700
00:58:45,629 --> 00:58:48,382
- Unlike what happened before.
- How?

701
00:58:48,407 --> 00:58:50,309
Let's find a guy.

702
00:58:59,287 --> 00:59:02,415
I'm sorry, guys.

703
00:59:02,567 --> 00:59:04,164
- It's alright.
- It's fine.

704
00:59:37,325 --> 00:59:40,244
I haven't seen you around before.
Are you from around here?

705
00:59:40,916 --> 00:59:42,334
My friend lives here.

706
00:59:43,356 --> 00:59:44,371
Yeah.

707
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:46,341
Which floor?

708
00:59:47,478 --> 00:59:48,521
Seventh.

709
00:59:49,031 --> 00:59:51,536
- You guys are eighth?
- Yes.

710
00:59:52,305 --> 00:59:55,350
- You visit often?
- First time actually.

711
00:59:55,627 --> 00:59:56,684
Yeah.

712
00:59:57,154 --> 00:59:59,698
- This is a nice building.
- Yeah, it is.

713
01:00:01,289 --> 01:00:02,504
I like your tats.

714
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,505
Thank you.

715
01:00:04,676 --> 01:00:05,871
They look good.

716
01:00:13,098 --> 01:00:17,060
So if you're not busy,
you want to come over, have a drink?

717
01:00:20,297 --> 01:00:21,298
Yeah.

718
01:00:23,094 --> 01:00:24,971
- Sure.
- Okay.

719
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,414
My friends can wait.

720
01:00:30,951 --> 01:00:34,066
So you said that you're
not from around here.

721
01:00:34,091 --> 01:00:37,371
Are you from Manila, or nearby?

722
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,375
Guess what country I'm from?

723
01:00:41,811 --> 01:00:43,312
Which country?

724
01:00:43,954 --> 01:00:46,551
Judging by your accent.

725
01:00:48,667 --> 01:00:51,503
- America?
- Close, Canada.

726
01:00:51,528 --> 01:00:55,198
- Canada.
- Yeah, but I'm part Filipino.

727
01:00:55,223 --> 01:00:56,637
- Really?
- Yeah.

728
01:00:56,755 --> 01:00:59,981
- You guys are having a good day?
- Yeah, it's been good.

729
01:01:00,238 --> 01:01:01,668
Yeah, me too.

730
01:01:01,826 --> 01:01:03,369
You have a lot of friends here?

731
01:01:04,253 --> 01:01:06,797
A few, actually. Yeah.

732
01:01:07,114 --> 01:01:09,283
- Are you here for business?
- What's that?

733
01:01:09,308 --> 01:01:11,477
- Here for business?
- Yeah.

734
01:01:12,282 --> 01:01:15,010
Got to be sociable for
this kind of business.

735
01:01:15,081 --> 01:01:16,145
Yeah.

736
01:01:27,951 --> 01:01:31,000
- Are you guys married?
- Yeah.

737
01:01:31,025 --> 01:01:33,694
We've been married
for three years now.

738
01:01:33,989 --> 01:01:35,323
You guys look good together.

739
01:01:35,348 --> 01:01:37,912
- Thank you.
- Everything's going well?

740
01:01:38,273 --> 01:01:39,983
Yeah, I think so.

741
01:01:40,635 --> 01:01:41,678
No complaints?

742
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:44,162
Your wife is really quiet.

743
01:01:45,129 --> 01:01:46,881
Why are you so quiet?

744
01:01:47,431 --> 01:01:48,807
If you don't mind me asking.

745
01:01:48,832 --> 01:01:51,710
- Some stuff earlier, I'm okay though.
- Okay?

746
01:01:52,415 --> 01:01:55,126
It looks like you guys
had a gathering here earlier.

747
01:01:55,151 --> 01:01:59,934
Yeah, I mean, we had a
female friend over earlier.

748
01:02:00,647 --> 01:02:03,184
Okay. Just trying
something different.

749
01:02:04,135 --> 01:02:06,220
Just before lockdown happens.

750
01:02:07,406 --> 01:02:08,698
Crazy, though. Lockdown, huh?

751
01:02:08,723 --> 01:02:10,575
Yeah, definitely.

752
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,812
Just trying to, you know, get some
stuff out of the way before it happens.

753
01:02:13,812 --> 01:02:15,897
Yeah, stuff out of the way.

754
01:02:15,897 --> 01:02:18,775
Yeah, you know,
some new experiences.

755
01:02:20,961 --> 01:02:22,587
I'm just going to
grab something.

756
01:02:22,612 --> 01:02:23,996
- I'll be back in a moment.
- Alright.

757
01:02:24,772 --> 01:02:27,817
- Sure you don't want any more wine?
- Yeah, I've had enough today.

758
01:02:27,849 --> 01:02:28,848
Okay.

759
01:02:29,285 --> 01:02:30,703
Do you want some more?

760
01:02:30,728 --> 01:02:32,104
Yeah, sure. Why not?

761
01:02:33,707 --> 01:02:35,375
I'm a wine drinker.

762
01:02:53,018 --> 01:02:55,187
Andrew, do you partake?

763
01:02:56,307 --> 01:02:58,225
Oh, hell yeah, I do.

764
01:03:07,318 --> 01:03:11,322
Take some of this, relax a bit.
Maybe we can...

765
01:03:16,632 --> 01:03:18,968
Perhaps go into another room?

766
01:03:20,879 --> 01:03:22,130
Another room?

767
01:03:22,155 --> 01:03:27,802
I'm just curious, have you
ever had a threesome before?

768
01:03:31,259 --> 01:03:35,340
Not really my thing,
but I'm open.

769
01:03:35,411 --> 01:03:36,770
Okay.

770
01:03:37,871 --> 01:03:40,332
- Are you okay with that?
- Yeah.

771
01:03:40,357 --> 01:03:46,020
That's what we were doing earlier.
It's just having fun with people.

772
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:50,974
Alright, so what do you say
we go into the other room?

773
01:03:57,514 --> 01:03:59,345
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

774
01:04:02,565 --> 01:04:04,484
- Just join us when you're ready.
- Okay.

775
01:04:31,915 --> 01:04:33,333
Welcome.

776
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:49,642
You guys look good here.

777
01:04:50,337 --> 01:04:51,648
Thank you.

778
01:05:01,476 --> 01:05:03,478
- Do you mind?
- Yeah, go for it.

779
01:06:05,752 --> 01:06:07,253
You can sit here if you want.

780
01:06:08,557 --> 01:06:09,892
I'll start here.

781
01:06:14,713 --> 01:06:17,751
- Maybe we should start?
- Yes.

782
01:07:25,146 --> 01:07:27,792
- Who is this?
- Andrew.

783
01:07:28,066 --> 01:07:30,220
No, I can explain.

784
01:07:30,245 --> 01:07:31,246
Please stop!

785
01:07:31,271 --> 01:07:32,630
Slut.

786
01:07:34,007 --> 01:07:36,384
What? You messed
with the wrong guy.

787
01:07:57,366 --> 01:07:58,913
Let's play a game.

788
01:08:01,766 --> 01:08:03,142
What do you have in mind?

789
01:08:05,553 --> 01:08:06,638
What do you got?

790
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:11,575
Top drawer to your right.

791
01:08:15,275 --> 01:08:16,902
- This?
- Yeah, that one.

792
01:08:25,725 --> 01:08:27,268
That kind of game.

793
01:08:47,997 --> 01:08:49,457
Just got to make sure.

794
01:08:54,623 --> 01:08:56,693
Drawer to the left.

795
01:08:59,082 --> 01:09:00,731
Thank you, sir.

796
01:10:14,448 --> 01:10:15,449
Damn.

797
01:10:19,418 --> 01:10:20,794
This is nice.

798
01:11:38,665 --> 01:11:40,041
I'm close.

799
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:25,989
Next?

800
01:12:27,304 --> 01:12:28,593
Who are you?

801
01:12:29,155 --> 01:12:31,422
How did you get here?

802
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:34,370
- Get her down.
- Get off me!

803
01:12:34,395 --> 01:12:37,257
Shut up!
You wanted this, right?

804
01:12:39,609 --> 01:12:42,191
- Hold her.
- Get off!

805
01:12:43,382 --> 01:12:44,863
You shut up!

806
01:12:44,988 --> 01:12:49,952
Screw you!

807
01:12:50,012 --> 01:12:54,382
Shut your mouth!

808
01:12:54,407 --> 01:12:57,994
This is what you guys wanted, right?
Aren’t you excited?

809
01:13:01,133 --> 01:13:02,801
There you go.

810
01:13:02,826 --> 01:13:05,890
You got what you deserve!
You slut!

811
01:13:05,915 --> 01:13:07,679
Next. Let's go. Come on.

812
01:13:07,704 --> 01:13:09,973
Get off of me!

813
01:13:09,998 --> 01:13:11,960
Flip her!

814
01:13:16,096 --> 01:13:18,849
You let this
happen to your wife.

815
01:13:22,963 --> 01:13:25,742
Go all the way!

816
01:13:26,941 --> 01:13:30,509
You need to shut up!
Shut your mouth!

817
01:13:33,234 --> 01:13:34,942
There you go. Finish it off.

818
01:13:43,999 --> 01:13:46,194
Finish it off.

819
01:13:47,419 --> 01:13:48,670
Alright, guys.

820
01:13:56,256 --> 01:13:57,716
Good boy.

821
01:14:03,702 --> 01:14:07,444
Go get changed,
what are you standing here for?

822
01:14:07,907 --> 01:14:10,702
Why are you guys taking
so long? Get changed.

823
01:14:14,847 --> 01:14:17,366
Big man, what are
you going to do, huh?

824
01:14:17,391 --> 01:14:18,832
What are you gonna do?

825
01:14:19,366 --> 01:14:22,272
Call the police, I dare you!

826
01:14:26,797 --> 01:14:27,997
Are you guys okay?

827
01:14:30,559 --> 01:14:32,990
You good and happy?

828
01:14:33,015 --> 01:14:34,466
Satisfied?

829
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:42,021
Thank you for the night.

830
01:14:42,046 --> 01:14:44,330
Thank you for the invite.
Thank you for the food and wine.

831
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:46,684
I'll leave now.

832
01:14:47,497 --> 01:14:49,552
Oh, sorry.

833
01:14:49,982 --> 01:14:51,281
The key.

834
01:14:53,785 --> 01:14:56,553
You both deserve this.

835
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:02,215
Game's over.

836
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,771
Screw you!

837
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:19,005
I'm so sorry.

838
01:15:19,092 --> 01:15:21,650
It’s not your fault.

839
01:15:21,675 --> 01:15:22,885
I'm so sorry.

840
01:16:39,192 --> 01:16:40,527
Let's go, guys.

841
01:18:31,869 --> 01:18:34,333
The president has put the entire Luzon

842
01:18:34,358 --> 01:18:38,168
under what the palace calls
an enhanced community quarantine.

843
01:18:38,192 --> 01:18:42,905
We now have on the line Duterte's spokesman
Salvador Panelo to talk more about this.

844
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:45,560
Mr. Secretary, thank you for taking
our call. Welcome to the program.

845
01:18:45,585 --> 01:18:48,458
- I have to go to work now.
- Don't go to work.

846
01:18:49,492 --> 01:18:51,244
Why not?

847
01:18:51,269 --> 01:18:53,911
Because it's hell out there.
You should stay here.

848
01:18:54,737 --> 01:18:57,240
- Stay here?
- Yes.

849
01:18:57,289 --> 01:19:00,652
- I mean, look at this.
- Exactly.

850
01:19:00,677 --> 01:19:02,874
- You should stay here where it's safe.
- I'm a nurse!

851
01:19:03,252 --> 01:19:05,129
It's a pandemic.

852
01:19:06,434 --> 01:19:08,019
I don't even know
when you'll be back.

853
01:19:08,044 --> 01:19:10,035
We should stay here
and talk about this.

854
01:19:10,919 --> 01:19:12,834
Talk about what Edward?

855
01:19:12,859 --> 01:19:14,670
We should talk about
what happened last night.

856
01:19:17,460 --> 01:19:21,077
- This was all your idea.
- My idea? I did this for you.

857
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,608
- For me?
- Yes, for you.

858
01:19:23,633 --> 01:19:26,628
- I thought it's what you wanted.
- You're the one who wanted this.

859
01:19:26,653 --> 01:19:27,833
I didn't want this.

860
01:19:27,858 --> 01:19:30,622
You're the one who's
been asking for this for ages.

861
01:19:30,647 --> 01:19:31,980
I didn't want this!

862
01:19:33,050 --> 01:19:36,167
Yes, you're the one
who invited him over.

863
01:19:37,214 --> 01:19:40,654
It took months for us
to plan with Candice.

864
01:19:40,879 --> 01:19:44,774
- And you invite that asshole.
- I thought this is what you wanted.

865
01:19:47,038 --> 01:19:50,680
Remember, you're the one who
came inside that slut Candice,

866
01:19:50,705 --> 01:19:52,705
you can't even give me a kid.

867
01:19:52,944 --> 01:19:54,779
And you cum inside her?

868
01:20:00,333 --> 01:20:02,668
I did not mean
for that to happen.

869
01:20:03,652 --> 01:20:05,026
But it did.

870
01:20:13,450 --> 01:20:15,074
You could have said no.

871
01:20:16,551 --> 01:20:18,177
I was doing it for you.

872
01:20:19,491 --> 01:20:21,910
Well, then. I guess we're
both to blame, aren't we?

873
01:20:25,407 --> 01:20:28,536
What was your plan all along?
If I didn't push through with this.

874
01:20:28,577 --> 01:20:30,097
What would you do? Leave me?

875
01:20:30,269 --> 01:20:34,036
- Why would I leave you?
- Like you did with your son?

876
01:20:34,539 --> 01:20:38,794
- You're used to that, aren't you?
- Do not bring him into this.

877
01:20:38,819 --> 01:20:42,280
I left that life for you.
And what about you?

878
01:20:42,305 --> 01:20:45,176
You can't even get rid of
that slut out of your mind.

879
01:20:45,201 --> 01:20:47,268
That ex-girlfriend from before.

880
01:20:47,672 --> 01:20:50,425
Can you get your dead wife
out of your head?

881
01:20:51,387 --> 01:20:53,666
Stop blaming me. I have a job.

882
01:20:53,691 --> 01:20:56,652
You are the only thing keeping
me together through all of this.

883
01:20:56,677 --> 01:20:58,644
That's not my job.

884
01:20:58,988 --> 01:21:03,034
- I have another job to go to.
- Ria, don't go.

885
01:21:03,685 --> 01:21:06,105
Stay! Ria!

886
01:21:12,220 --> 01:21:15,411
The number of COVID-19 cases is on the rise

887
01:21:15,436 --> 01:21:18,331
based on the latest data
from the Department of Health.

888
01:21:18,534 --> 01:21:22,168
Frontline health workers and
authorized government officials

889
01:21:22,193 --> 01:21:25,059
will only be exempted
in the said lockdown.

890
01:21:25,108 --> 01:21:30,480
As well as those who need to go out for
medical reasons and humanitarian reasons.

891
01:21:30,505 --> 01:21:33,258
Also the transport
of basic necessities.

892
01:21:33,283 --> 01:21:38,262
On the other hand, some human
rights defenders are holding protests

893
01:21:38,287 --> 01:21:42,875
in some parts of Luzon in resistance
to the announcement of the president.

894
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:47,533
Human rights groups believed
that the imposition of the lockdown

895
01:21:47,558 --> 01:21:50,393
is a restriction on
certain human rights.

896
01:21:50,418 --> 01:21:52,332
The inter-agency task force,

897
01:21:52,357 --> 01:21:55,185
in coordination with the
different local government units,

898
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:56,988
continue to monitor...

899
01:22:07,692 --> 01:22:10,737
Can you show me the
CCTV from this morning?

900
01:22:10,762 --> 01:22:12,015
What time sir?

901
01:22:13,229 --> 01:22:17,023
- 1 AM at the elevator.
- 1 AM?

902
01:22:20,718 --> 01:22:21,774
This one?

903
01:22:21,799 --> 01:22:23,670
No, the other elevator.

904
01:22:33,666 --> 01:22:34,718
This one?

905
01:22:34,976 --> 01:22:36,352
This your friends?

906
01:22:37,438 --> 01:22:40,858
- Is he from this building?
- No, sir.

907
01:22:48,358 --> 01:22:51,778
Fast forward to 3 AM.

908
01:23:09,225 --> 01:23:10,893
Can you open the door please?

909
01:23:12,906 --> 01:23:14,551
Can you open the compartment?

910
01:23:15,209 --> 01:23:17,399
- Wait.
- What's the problem?

911
01:23:17,509 --> 01:23:19,302
I will check the
compartment, please.

912
01:23:19,327 --> 01:23:20,328
Three.

913
01:23:27,414 --> 01:23:28,832
Sir, positive!

914
01:23:28,857 --> 01:23:32,076
- Don't move!
- Positive!

915
01:23:32,101 --> 01:23:35,038
- What's happening?
- Don't move!

916
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:36,111
Turn around.

917
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:37,267
- Hands up.
- Don't move!

918
01:23:39,690 --> 01:23:40,857
This one.

919
01:23:41,563 --> 01:23:42,573
Those two.

920
01:23:42,598 --> 01:23:43,999
Are they from this building?

921
01:23:44,024 --> 01:23:44,938
No, sir.

922
01:23:44,963 --> 01:23:46,474
Hands up.

923
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:49,087
Is there any problem?

924
01:23:55,529 --> 01:23:56,822
Is there a problem?

925
01:24:01,007 --> 01:24:02,240
Thanks.

926
01:24:02,265 --> 01:24:03,576
Are you sure, sir?

927
01:25:12,674 --> 01:25:14,718
Keep fighting.

928
01:25:17,129 --> 01:25:19,476
Don't give up.

929
01:25:19,585 --> 01:25:25,205
Son, don't leave us.
