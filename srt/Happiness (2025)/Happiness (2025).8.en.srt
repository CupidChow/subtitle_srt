<i>[Previously]</i>

3
00:00:12,944 --> 00:00:14,555
<i>The situation is not good right now.</i>

4
00:00:14,555 --> 00:00:17,418
<i>I might have to escalate the operation
to the next level.</i>

5
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:20,454
<i>We're sorry, the number you are trying
to reach is not available…</i>

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,780
<i>Where have you been?</i>

7
00:00:28,585 --> 00:00:29,668
<i>I went for a walk.</i>

8
00:00:29,668 --> 00:00:31,200
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,315
<i>You come back and
immediately go to the bathroom.</i>

10
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,074
<i>Right now, whoever has food and water…
It's very simple.</i>

11
00:00:38,074 --> 00:00:38,979
<i>Let's pool it all together.</i>

12
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:40,875
<i>We can divide it equally among everyone.</i>

13
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,262
<i>That way, we can all survive together.</i>

14
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:43,243
<i>Hey!</i>

15
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:44,631
<i>That's not fair.</i>

16
00:00:44,631 --> 00:00:46,360
<i>I planned ahead.</i>

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,798
<i>Those who didn't… deal with it.</i>

18
00:00:53,026 --> 00:00:55,202
<i>We're going to fill our wallets too!</i>

19
00:00:55,202 --> 00:00:56,979
<i>How did you get that?</i>

20
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:59,274
<i>In times like these,
we have to look out for ourselves.</i>

21
00:00:59,274 --> 00:01:02,914
<i>Let's celebrate! Cheers!</i>

22
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,193
<i>What's this?</i>

23
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,844
<i>Someone was just bitten to death
by one of the infected.</i>

24
00:01:09,844 --> 00:01:12,471
<i>The bite marks were made
after the stab wound.</i>

25
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:15,360
<i>The infected… wouldn't use a weapon</i>

26
00:01:15,972 --> 00:01:18,394
<i>I need to find out who's infected.</i>

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,741
See? She's really infected.

28
00:02:11,741 --> 00:02:13,280
And she still lied to us.

29
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:15,590
Maybe she wasn't lying.

30
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,240
Maybe she's infected but doesn't know it.
That's why we all have to be careful.

31
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,718
But now, she's going to cause trouble
for all of us.

32
00:02:21,718 --> 00:02:22,960
Just throw her out.

33
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,720
Yeah! Throw her out! Throw her out!

34
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,820
Hey! Aim is still human.

35
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,700
I think if anyone else gets infected,

36
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,580
we should lock them up in a room
they can't escape from.

37
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,380
Yes. For everyone's safety,

38
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:39,260
we should find a room, lock them up separately,
seal the door,

39
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,220
and take anyone who's been
in close contact with them too.

40
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,540
- Right?
- Who? Who's been in close contact?

41
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:45,100
Yeah, who?

42
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,260
- Who?
- Grandma Jin.

43
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,692
- What?
- Grandma Jin?

44
00:02:48,692 --> 00:02:50,346
Grandma Jin has been close to Aim, right?

45
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,260
Me? I wasn't bitten.

46
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,580
Grandpa Chan, tell them.

47
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,500
You weren't bitten? See that?

48
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,820
I saw Aim tending to Grandma's wound.

49
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,700
- What? There's a wound?
- See?

50
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,100
She was bitten. The wound on her finger,
on her hand.

51
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,260
- There's a wound.
- The wound on her hand, that's it.

52
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,980
No! I cut myself
with a knife while cooking.

53
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:18,980
If Aim is infected,
then you're at risk, Grandma.

54
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,380
You have to quarantine yourself.

55
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,140
- Yes, yes.
- Jee!

56
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,580
What are you saying? You little brat!

57
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:24,980
What now?

58
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,300
Go get Grandma Jin.

59
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,100
- No! Don't!
- Don't!

60
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,260
- Come here!
- Let go! Let go!

61
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,860
Do you really have to do this?

62
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,015
She's infected!
Take her away, quickly!

63
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,498
- Are you happy now, Jee?
- Stop!

64
00:03:36,498 --> 00:03:38,630
- Grandma is old already.
- I said stop!

65
00:03:45,186 --> 00:03:48,260
We'll have Aim and Grandma quarantined
in the same place as Jeu.

66
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
But is it a good idea for them
to stay together like that?

67
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,860
Yeah.

68
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,940
It'll be easier for us to manage the food.

69
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,540
Then hurry up and go.
Why are you still here? Go.

70
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,614
Go, Grandma. Go to quarantine.

71
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,380
- Grandpa Chan, come here.
- Let go of Grandma.

72
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,980
- Grandpa Chan, come here.
- It's okay.

73
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,285
- Grandpa Chan.
- Grandma is old.

74
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:06,260
- It's just quarantine.
- Grandma is old already…

75
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,220
- No.
- Let's go now.

76
00:05:14,722 --> 00:05:18,560
<i>[Happiness]</i>

77
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:43,243
<i>A moment, please.</i>

78
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,620
<i>There's a lot here. A lot.</i>

79
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,500
<i>Honey?</i>

80
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,060
<i>There are performance-enhancing drugs.</i>

81
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,420
<i>There are muscle-building drugs.</i>

82
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,933
<i>There are boxes of vitamin C.</i>

83
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:14,380
<i>The company didn't consent to this.</i>

84
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,100
<i>Honey,</i>

85
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,500
<i>dinner is ready.</i>

86
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,620
<i>Da?</i>

87
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,620
<i>Yes?</i>

88
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,060
<i>Let's eat.</i>

89
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,300
<i>Da…</i>

90
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,180
<i>I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

91
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,420
<i>Are you stressed about work?</i>

92
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,060
Please follow up on
Run's antibody test results for me.

93
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,802
I have to go deal with the VIP guests.

94
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,860
Please have a seat.

95
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,300
Grandma, for safety reasons,

96
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,820
I'm going to lock the door and ask you
to stay in this area only.

97
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,740
Even though you're not showing
any symptoms yet,

98
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,540
you're still considered a suspected case.

99
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,060
I'm sorry, Grandma.

100
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,420
It's okay, dear.

101
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,700
Don't feel bad, Run. I understand.

102
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,940
Don't be afraid.
I'll stay here and watch over you.

103
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,180
It's okay. Go back upstairs.

104
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,220
And what about Jee?

105
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,300
How can you still care about him
after what he did to you?

106
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,700
That ungrateful brat.

107
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,700
Grandpa, please go back to your room and rest.

108
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,460
I promise I'll take good care of Grandma.

109
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,399
Just go, don't worry about me.

110
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,580
Go take care of Yayee
and clean your wound in the room first.

111
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:30,900
Okay.

112
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,540
I'll walk Grandpa Chan back to his room.

113
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,180
Let's draw.

114
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,300
Prach, you're back?

115
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,300
I'm back.

116
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,460
What happened to you, Prach?

117
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:58,900
I slipped and fell. I have a small cut,

118
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,220
but don't worry, Yayee. I'll be fine.

119
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,780
You can go back to playing.

120
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,780
Okay.

121
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,940
You're so clumsy.

122
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,180
Come here. Let me help you.

123
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,580
Give me your arm.

124
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,540
Let's clean your wound.

125
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,700
Ouch, it hurts.

126
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,300
It hurts a lot. Blow on it.

127
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,220
Are you messing with me?
Or do you want to do it yourself?

128
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,420
It hurts. Blow on it.

129
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,660
Blow on what?

130
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,820
You looked stressed,

131
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,820
so I was just playing around.
Come on, continue.

132
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,780
Who cuts their own wrist?

133
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,300
If I didn't do it, everyone would be in danger.

134
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,140
We didn't know who was infected.

135
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,780
Would you let everyone be in danger like this?

136
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
Alright, alright.

137
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,060
Stop talking. Your saliva could get
in the wound and it will rot.

138
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,660
I don't think the wound will rot,

139
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,900
but I might catch your craziness.

140
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:50,820
I'm not doing it anymore.

141
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,180
Come on. Help me out.

142
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,180
No.

143
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,420
Come on, do it.

144
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,020
I can't do it myself.

145
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,300
I got hurt, and I don't have much strength.

146
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,060
Please do it for me.

147
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,780
This one. And this one. Put it here.

148
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,180
This is the medicine. Okay.

149
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,420
No. Do it yourself.

150
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:09,700
Excuse me. I can help you with that.

151
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,420
That would be great, Beam. Come in.

152
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,420
Perfect. Otherwise, he might get tetanus
and have to get his arm amputated.

153
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,940
It won't be that bad.

154
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,820
Excuse me. Let me see.

155
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,700
That's a deep cut.

156
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,820
This might sting a little.

157
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,220
Now you're quiet, huh?

158
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,300
It's far from the heart.

159
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,002
This might sting a little.

160
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:45,300
About the head of security…

161
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,940
I think the killer might still be
in this condo.

162
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,060
Yeah.

163
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,060
Aunt Noi, have you seen anyone
having conflicts in the condo?

164
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:03,420
The head of security.

165
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,340
I often saw him scolding Security Guard Ohn.

166
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,020
<i>Hey, Ohn!</i>

167
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:21,420
<i>What the hell are you doing?
You're not even checking who comes and goes.</i>

168
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,220
<i>You're just sitting there reading.</i>

169
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,540
<i>But if I see anyone unfamiliar or suspicious,
I stop them and check.</i>

170
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,900
<i>Don't argue with me.</i>

171
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,820
<i>I'm not arguing, sir. I'm just explaining.</i>

172
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,340
<i>You're still arguing with me?</i>

173
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,900
<i>Do your job properly.</i>

174
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,346
Have you seen your boss
having problems with anyone?

175
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,140
Aunt Noi.

176
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,321
I often see the boss and Aunt Noi arguing.

177
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,820
It's usually just about work matters.

178
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,700
Thank you very much.

179
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,700
Sure.

180
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,220
There's one more thing.

181
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,780
I've also seen Ju…

182
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,020
Do you know anything
about the head of security?

183
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,540
I think the head of security had arguments
with everyone.

184
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,940
<i>Hey! What's the big deal?
I'm in a hurry to get to work.</i>

185
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,300
<i>- If you want to eat, go buy it yourself.
- No, you have to buy it back for me first.</i>

186
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:34,020
Most recently, I saw him arguing
with that lawyer, Tattep.

187
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,060
<i>Hey!</i>

188
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,460
<i>I put a cone there. How can you let
someone else park there?</i>

189
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,940
<i>But this is… a common area.</i>

190
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,460
<i>Whoever arrives first gets to park first.
It's the condo management's rule.</i>

191
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:47,592
<i>If you're not happy with that, Mr. Tattep,
you can report it to the management.</i>

192
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,220
<i>Are you challenging me?</i>

193
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,180
<i>I'm not challenging you, sir.
I'm just doing my job.</i>

194
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,940
<i>You just do your job, and I'll do mine.</i>

195
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,300
<i>Okay, then please move your car.</i>

196
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,426
<i>We'll see about that.</i>

197
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,420
We've already questioned
a group of housekeepers.

198
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,340
If we get information from another group,

199
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,880
we might be able to find some answers.

200
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,460
The housekeeper's group is just
working-class people,

201
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,700
like the head of security.

202
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,220
It's normal for them to argue,

203
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,719
but I don't think they have a motive

204
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:24,073
to rob or kill anyone for money,

205
00:15:24,073 --> 00:15:25,954
as they're not that different in social status.

206
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,220
I suspect the lawyer, Tattep.

207
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,140
Why do you think it's him?

208
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,460
Physically, he looks strong.

209
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,700
Killing someone wouldn't be difficult for him.

210
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,540
As for motive, he has a rather
negative attitude towards everyone,

211
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,660
and he's also short-tempered.

212
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,220
If he gets angry at someone, I think…

213
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,140
he might do something unexpected.

214
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,420
My time is precious. I'll give you 15 minutes.

215
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,660
Ask whatever you want.

216
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,220
What's your relationship
with Miss Net and Miss Rangrong?

217
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,580
Net… is my wife.

218
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,060
Rangrong is my secretary.

219
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,140
If you don't have any other relationship
with Miss Rangrong,

220
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,900
that means…

221
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:16,940
someone in the condo could have
a crush on her, right?

222
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,140
Rangrong is beautiful. Everyone likes her.

223
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,143
So that means…

224
00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:26,700
the head of security could have a crush
on Miss Rangrong, right?

225
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,060
I know what you're implying.

226
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,220
But I don't care
if she has a boyfriend or a fling.

227
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,540
But someone like Rangrong would
never date the head of security.

228
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,700
But I heard that you and the head of security
had an argument.

229
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,180
Was it about Miss Rangrong?

230
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,820
Are you accusing me of killing
the head of security?

231
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,460
I'm a lawyer.

232
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,180
If I'm unhappy with someone, I sue them.

233
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,420
Why would I kill?

234
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,545
And how would I even do it?

235
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,860
I can countersue you.

236
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,380
I'm not accusing you.

237
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,700
- I'm just investigating.
- Time's up.

238
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,900
I'm leaving.

239
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,900
And also, what you're doing is a waste of time.

240
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,260
I think you should go find some food
for the residents, like you did before.

241
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,115
That would be much better.

242
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,860
I think I'll use my own methods.

243
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:46,660
What are you doing here?

244
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,420
I have something to discuss with you.

245
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,260
I'm not sure if you have some time.

246
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,380
Can I come in and talk to you?

247
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,420
Sure, come in.

248
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,220
Whose book are these?

249
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,054
They're mine.

250
00:18:13,054 --> 00:18:14,901
I'm taking online university courses

251
00:18:15,447 --> 00:18:17,532
for a bachelor's degree in IT.

252
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,660
Is there something you need, Officer?

253
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,180
Yes. I want to ask you some questions
about the head of security.

254
00:18:25,214 --> 00:18:26,620
Officer,

255
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,380
I really didn't kill the boss.
I have no reason to do something like that.

256
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,180
Okay. I understand.

257
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,904
But I might need your help with something.

258
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,420
The system automatically deletes footage
at the end of every month

259
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:45,091
and records over the old files.

260
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,780
You scolded me so much,
and now you're asking for my help?

261
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,940
I'd love to help, really, but

262
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:58,980
I can't.

263
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,812
In this situation, I need to keep the power
for myself.

264
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,580
You understand, right?

265
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,700
I understand.

266
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,220
I was going to take you
to film something fun. Let's go.

267
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,460
Hey, hold on.

268
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,260
I'm a top-tier content creator.

269
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,659
I don't just have one power box.

270
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,260
There you go.

271
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,020
But it's been several days.
I've probably used up all the power.

272
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,140
How about this?

273
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,580
Try asking the other rooms.
If they don't have any, come back.

274
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:33,780
Give it to me.

275
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,420
- Give it to me.
- Yes, ma'am.

276
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,058
Don't use it all up. Be careful with it
and return it to me.

277
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,691
Come on. Helping the authorities makes you
a good citizen.

278
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,390
Stop.

279
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,340
Rewind it a little.

280
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,340
Play it again.

281
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,700
It looks like 40 minutes are missing.

282
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,100
Someone deliberately tampered
with this footage.

283
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,180
You mean someone destroyed evidence?

284
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,380
The person who did this
deliberately edited the footage

285
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,700
but kept the file because they were afraid
it would look suspicious.

286
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:52,690
Whoever did this would must have both IT
expertise and regular CCTV room clearance.

287
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,700
Yes. The footage is indeed skipping.

288
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,420
I saw you reading a computer book.

289
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,505
I need your help figuring this out.
What do you think could have caused this?

290
00:21:22,445 --> 00:21:25,500
I'm not sure what caused it, either.

291
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:31,700
Do you know… who has access to the CCTV room?

292
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,900
Well, there's…

293
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,580
Aunt Noi, my boss, and me.

294
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:45,260
Your boss… has passed away.

295
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:50,180
And Aunt Noi said the key to the CCTV room
was stolen.

296
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:56,580
I don't understand why you're trying
to corner me into confessing

297
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,940
when I didn't do anything.
I have nothing to do with this.

298
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,180
When you saw me
at the garbage disposal area,

299
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,717
what were you doing?

300
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,500
Well… I was throwing away a dead rat.

301
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,460
You even opened the bag to look.

302
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:10,460
That's right.

303
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,940
I didn't actually see it myself.

304
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,757
Should we go take a look?

305
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,180
Well… Here's the knife I used to kill the rat.

306
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,860
And the blood on it is the rat's blood.

307
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,500
But the size of the knife matches the wound.

308
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:32,220
The day you argued with the head of security,

309
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,140
he walked away from you
because Aunt Noi showed up.

310
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,460
<i>I will…</i>

311
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,380
And then he came back to talk to you again.

312
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,940
You had a heated argument that day.

313
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,260
<i>If you argue with me
in front of Aunt Noi again, I'll kill you.</i>

314
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,982
What were you arguing about?

315
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,580
You killed the head of security, didn't you?

316
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,860
<i>If you didn't take it, then who did?</i>

317
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,460
<i>Only you and I have access to that room.</i>

318
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,260
<i>I told you, I didn't take it. Damn it!</i>

319
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,420
<i>Help me.</i>

320
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,860
<i>Help me!</i>

321
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,940
You knew there were security cameras.

322
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:35,220
You knew where they were in this condo,

323
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,340
so you decided to cover up the murder.

324
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,940
Meanwhile, Jee's video of the infected
is going viral on social media.

325
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,620
So you chose this method.

326
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,420
You let the infected bite the body
and then brought it back to the utility room.

327
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,180
And then you came back to the CCTV room

328
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,620
and deleted the footage of you killing
the head of security.

329
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:07,593
And you kept the knife with you

330
00:26:07,593 --> 00:26:09,393
because you were afraid it would be evidence.

331
00:26:12,513 --> 00:26:15,700
I… I didn't kill anyone. You're framing me.

332
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,380
If you confess now,
it will be in your best interest.

333
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,635
Your sentence will be lighter.

334
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,220
With this much evidence, you can't escape.

335
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,460
I really didn't kill anyone.

336
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,069
What's your connection to the Next drug?

337
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,267
I don't know anything about any Next drug.

338
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,980
I have another question.

339
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,140
What's your connection
to the death of the trainer, Hack?

340
00:26:46,178 --> 00:26:50,580
Okay. Okay, I-I-I confess.

341
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,340
I-I-I confess.

342
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,220
B-B-But I didn't mean to kill the boss.

343
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,340
He took my money.
And I needed it for my mother.

344
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,860
<i>I'm not arguing with you, sir.
I just want my money back.</i>

345
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,860
<i>Please give it back to me.
I need to give that money to my mother.</i>

346
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,180
<i>I didn't take it. Don't talk nonsense.</i>

347
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,980
<i>Why are you saying this, sir?
How can you say that?</i>

348
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,940
<i>If it weren't you,
then who else would take it?</i>

349
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,420
<i>Damn it!</i>

350
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,340
He took my money.
And I needed it for my mother.

351
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,620
My mother was waiting for me.

352
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:20,340
And I don't know anything
about this Next drug.

353
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,420
I'm sorry.

354
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,900
I'm really sorry, Officer. I'm so sorry.

355
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,700
Please believe me, officer.

356
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,700
Y-Y-You can arrest me later. Please.

357
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,420
Please.

358
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,580
Stop!

359
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:21,240
He will die if he goes out there like that.

360
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,780
Judging by Security Guard Ohn's behavior,

361
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,260
I don't think he killed Hack.

362
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,460
So the killer is still inside the condo?

363
00:28:37,028 --> 00:28:38,028
Yes.

364
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:44,420
Hey, Yayee.

365
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,580
Where did you guys go?

366
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,220
Were you playing detective?

367
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,100
- Hmm.
- I want to play too.

368
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:57,125
Sure. Then I want you to gather information
in the room, Yayee.

369
00:28:57,125 --> 00:29:01,365
We'll investigate outside.
We have to work as a team.

370
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,700
Okay. I like gathering information.

371
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,700
You're so smart.

372
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,700
Do your best.

373
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,700
Beam, do you have any more information
to share with us?

374
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,780
There's still a lot of footage
that was edited out.

375
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,420
I don't think it will be easy to recover.

376
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,288
I'll take care of it.

377
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:46,940
Please give this to Director.

378
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,940
Yes, Inspector.

379
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,780
With the power and internet being cut off
like this, I think it's good for kids.

380
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,700
How so?

381
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,580
Well… They won't be playing mobile games
or using social media.

382
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,420
They'll have to find other things to do.

383
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,780
By the way, Prach has been gone for a while.

384
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:16,660
Oh, Prach is probably dealing
with the head of security's body.

385
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:20,900
Typical him - lone wolf type,
super private too.

386
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,546
It's hard to find a girlfriend like that.

387
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:27,460
But aren't you and Prach together?

388
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,580
Well…

389
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,580
I meant when we were kids. Like…

390
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,020
- Oh…
- We're still young and all that.

391
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,020
It was so complicated before we dated.

392
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:48,180
Run, you're… not very good at lying, are you?

393
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:51,032
Yeah.

394
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:54,100
Why did you two lie and say you're married?

395
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,500
Actually,

396
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,140
I just wanted to move out on my own.

397
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:06,740
My dad always treats me like a child,

398
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:11,180
like I'm not grown up.
I wanted to show him that I was,

399
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,100
so I asked Prach to marry me.

400
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:20,180
But before we could finalize our plan,
this whole thing happened.

401
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,420
At first, when I moved in here,
I thought this place was heaven.

402
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,100
But now it's hell.

403
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,900
Whether it's hell or heaven depends
on the people, not the place.

404
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:47,493
Run, do you think all humans are born evil?

405
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,260
No.

406
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:56,260
I think children are born pure.

407
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,280
But look at us now, Run.

408
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,347
We've been quarantined for a week,

409
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,740
and the people we thought were good
have shown their true colors.

410
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,317
We don't even know how much the people
we live with every day

411
00:32:11,871 --> 00:32:14,380
have been corrupted by this evil.

412
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:19,340
Some people, when they're in survival mode,
they act like this.

413
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,305
It would be nice
if everyone in the world were good.

414
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,500
I have something to announce.

415
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,900
Announcements all day long.

416
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,885
Next time, get everything sorted out
before making an announcement.

417
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,203
This has nothing to do with me.

418
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,500
Hack is dead.

419
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,500
What?

420
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,700
And he died in this condo
before it was locked down.

421
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,140
Then what about the person they arrested?

422
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:17,460
Hack was involved in distributing the drug
that's causing the Rage Disease.

423
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,932
- Drug?
- Hey.

424
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,180
So we need to question everyone.

425
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,180
Please cooperate.

426
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,900
He's already dead. Just let it go.

427
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:33,500
We should be more afraid of the infected.

428
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,100
- True.
- Yeah, right.

429
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,595
I have one more thing to announce.

430
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:43,460
Security Guard Ohn is now a suspect
in the murder of the head of security.

431
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,620
- Hmm?
- What?

432
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,180
See? They killed each other.

433
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:51,220
Security Guard Ohn must have killed Hack.

434
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,420
Security Guard Ohn didn't kill Hack.

435
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,710
But the suspect who killed Hack

436
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,835
is definitely involved in distributing
the drug that's causing this disease.

437
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:08,746
From now on, please cooperate
with the authorities.

438
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,142
Otherwise, you'll be considered guilty.

439
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,850
Right, Mr. Lawyer?

440
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,500
That's right.

441
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,060
Do you know the trainer named Hack?

442
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:26,380
Well… I kind of know him.
He's a fitness trainer, right?

443
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,723
Did he use or distribute any unusual drugs?

444
00:34:31,723 --> 00:34:33,371
And do you know about a drug called Next?

445
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,900
Next?

446
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,060
I want to know… what your connection is
to the trainer, Hack.

447
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:45,167
We just talked about guy stuff, you know.

448
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,340
I never bought anything from him.

449
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,220
I was just a regular client.
I hired him for training.

450
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:06,406
Did he ever offer you any supplements or drugs?

451
00:35:06,406 --> 00:35:09,220
I've never heard of this drug.

452
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,260
Are you sure it doesn't sound familiar?

453
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,660
Of course.

454
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,700
Miss Sophida,

455
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,580
I'll ask you directly.

456
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,334
You exercised with him,

457
00:35:19,924 --> 00:35:23,260
but did you have a relationship
that went beyond trainer and client?

458
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,660
No.

459
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,700
Do you know about the Next drug?

460
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,700
I don't know it.

461
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:31,700
You didn't take it?

462
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,700
I didn't.

463
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,860
Hack was a trainer.

464
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,620
Anyone who wanted to exercise just called him,
and he would come teach them.

465
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,540
Hack? Who's that? I don't know him.

466
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,460
I-I-I just deliver things.

467
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,500
What drug?

468
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,740
Let me make this very simple.

469
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,500
Do you know about the Next drug?

470
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,980
The Next drug that you delivered to all
those people, for the trainer named Hack?

471
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,365
You said you were the one delivering it,
right? Right?

472
00:35:57,365 --> 00:35:59,893
I don't know anything about
any Next drug.

473
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,180
We've recovered the deleted footage.

474
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,700
Put it on the big screen.

475
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,220
<i>Inspector.</i>

476
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,060
Yes, Director?

477
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,660
Security Guard Ohn did kill
the head of security, just like you said.

478
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,300
I have more information now.

479
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,100
<i>There's footage of Hack discussing drug deals
with several people in the condo.</i>

480
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,257
<i>I'll send you the complete list.</i>

481
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,540
Are you okay? Do you need anything else?

482
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,860
I'm okay. I don't need anything else.

483
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,140
Aim, are you hungry?

484
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,335
I brought you some food.

485
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,860
I already ate, Run.

486
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,299
Fah and Grandpa Chan
have been taking turns bringing me food.

487
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,860
Are you okay, Aim?

488
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,700
Even if I'm not okay, I have to be.

489
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:30,060
Just hold on a little longer, Aim.

490
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,970
We're trying to find a way to help everyone.

491
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,820
Then… I'll put this away for now.

492
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,820
Okay.

493
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,820
Hello, Grandma.

494
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,052
Oh, Run.

495
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,591
I brought you some food.

496
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:20,482
Thank you so much, dear.

497
00:38:20,482 --> 00:38:23,660
Dr. Beam will be here to
give you a check-up soon.

498
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,980
Are you feeling any symptoms?

499
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,700
I'm feeling great.

500
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,380
That's good.

501
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,780
How about Grandpa Chan?

502
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,500
He went back up to get some things
from his room.

503
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,260
Grandpa Chan is so stubborn.

504
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,700
He wouldn't go back upstairs
no matter how many times I told him to.

505
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:43,380
He goes up and down so many times a day,
bringing me all sorts of things.

506
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:48,700
He even cleaned the whole place-swept
and mopped until it was spotless.

507
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,900
I couldn't believe my eyes.

508
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:54,700
He never did anything like that
when he was in his own room.

509
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:01,100
Grandpa is so different when he's with you
compared to when he's with us.

510
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,340
Grandpa Chan seems strict and likes to nag.

511
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:06,785
Don't mind him, Run.

512
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,353
And how is Aim doing?

513
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,620
Don't worry about Aim.

514
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,900
I'll take care of her.

515
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,300
I feel so sorry for Aim.

516
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,380
She's such a good girl.

517
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,460
Ever since she came to stay with me,

518
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:30,540
she's been doing this and that,
taking care of Grandpa and me.

519
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,566
She wouldn't even go out.

520
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:38,464
Except for that day when
you called for a meeting

521
00:39:38,464 --> 00:39:41,502
to find the infected
person who killed Naitan.

522
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:49,340
So Aim never left your room?

523
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:54,060
Yes. Aim is afraid of the infected,
so she wouldn't go anywhere.

524
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:56,380
She stayed and took care of Grandpa and me
the whole time.

525
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:01,401
Can you tell me what Aim was doing
when you found Naitan's body?

526
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,620
<i>Seeing Aim makes me miss my daughter.</i>

527
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,580
<i>Jee's mother.</i>

528
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,900
<i>But she disappeared.</i>

529
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:27,980
<i>She left Jee with us when he was just a baby,
and she never contacted us again.</i>

530
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,580
<i>I don't know whether she's alive or dead.</i>

531
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:32,395
<i>Honey, can you please stop talking about her?</i>

532
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,340
<i>It's a waste of time and energy.</i>

533
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,036
<i>No matter how much you wish for it,
she's not coming back.</i>

534
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:44,786
<i>Even though he says that,
he actually loves Jee very much.</i>

535
00:40:44,786 --> 00:40:48,826
<i>Because he thinks of Jee as a replacement
for Grandpa's daughter.</i>

536
00:40:50,985 --> 00:40:54,165
<i>If you don't mind,</i>

537
00:40:54,165 --> 00:40:59,105
<i>can you think of me as
another granddaughter?</i>

538
00:41:00,756 --> 00:41:03,580
<i>That's wonderful, Aim.</i>

539
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,220
<i>I'll have one granddaughter.</i>

540
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,380
<i>Now look closely, dear. Are there any more?</i>

541
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,900
<i>New content, guys.</i>

542
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:14,767
<i>Out of nowhere, this person asks to be
my grandma's granddaughter</i>

543
00:41:14,767 --> 00:41:16,380
<i>and moves into our room.</i>

544
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:20,580
<i>What do you guys think?
Should we let her stay or kick her out?</i>

545
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,260
<i>It's okay, it'll heal.</i>

546
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,260
If you don't believe me, you can ask Aim too.

547
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,180
I believe you, Grandma.

548
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,140
So Aim's wound was caused
by an infected bite?

549
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:47,823
We were outside that day. It was very chaotic.

550
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:13,340
If Aim didn't leave the room
and didn't go anywhere,

551
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,700
then it means there's another infected person
in the condo.

552
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,820
Who could it be?

553
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,959
At the residents' meeting
to find the infected person…

554
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,540
Uncle Tao wasn't there.

555
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:42,434
Prach,

556
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,180
when Naitan died,
Uncle Tao wasn't there either.

557
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,626
I was just about to go see Uncle Tao.

558
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,300
So you already knew?

559
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,913
Can you please tell me
what you're going to do next time?

560
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,340
Okay.

561
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,700
I'll tell you next time.

562
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,096
So what are we going to do?

563
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,121
Aunt Noi probably won't let us
into the room.

564
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:09,900
Right.

565
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,555
I didn't think of that.

566
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,702
I'll handle it.

567
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:32,860
You're here again?

568
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,260
Can't you just leave us alone?
I want to rest.

569
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:41,540
We'd like to ask for some amulets
from Uncle Tao.

570
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,540
To protect ourselves from the infected.

571
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,260
Those things only work for those
who believe in them.

572
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,820
You guys don't believe it,
so it won't be useful to you.

573
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,260
You're done here, so just go back.

574
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,862
We've already questioned the residents,

575
00:43:54,862 --> 00:43:57,081
but Uncle Tao is the only one
we haven't questioned yet.

576
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,686
He is sick.

577
00:44:00,686 --> 00:44:03,380
Why would you want a sick person
to go down to the meeting?

578
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,980
That's perfect.
We have Dr. Beam with us.

579
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,660
Why don't we let him examine Uncle Tao?

580
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,660
Can I do a basic check-up on him?

581
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:11,180
I'm in a hurry.

582
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,340
No need! No need.

583
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:16,500
I-I-I have medicine. He's not that sick.

584
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,540
I can take care of him myself.
You guys can go back now.

585
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:22,140
Are you hiding something from us?

586
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,380
I'm not hiding anything.

587
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:25,588
But if you come in here,
I'll consider it trespassing. Go away!

588
00:44:25,588 --> 00:44:27,468
If you have nothing to hide,
why are you afraid?

589
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:30,540
What's all the commotion?

590
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,900
Have you no heart? Let the sick man rest.

591
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,980
I told you he is sick.
You guys don't believe me?

592
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,460
Please leave now! Go!

593
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,340
I apologize for the disturbance.

594
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,740
But how is Uncle Tao feeling?

595
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:46,317
Well… It's nothing serious.

596
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:47,988
Just… aches and pains
here and there. And…

597
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:49,900
I can't stop coughing.

598
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,004
Let me examine you.

599
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,260
Alright.

600
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:01,820
Take a deep breath.

601
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,020
Good.

602
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:06,860
Again.

603
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:13,100
It's probably from lack of sleep.
Your immune system must be low.

604
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,740
With everything going on in the building,
how can anyone sleep well?

605
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:23,060
Then I'll share with you
some anti-anxiety medication.

606
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,916
It should help you sleep better.

607
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,340
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

608
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:31,180
You can take the medicine to my room later.
I need to rest now.

609
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,180
Get plenty of rest.

610
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:34,180
Thank you.

611
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,365
Get plenty of rest, Uncle Tao.
So you can recover quickly.

612
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:48,380
Thank you.

613
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:49,380
Sure.

614
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,060
Stop! Don't hurt him!

615
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,180
Stop!

616
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,472
Let's just quarantine Tao here.

617
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:44,685
No, we have to quarantine Uncle Tao
in the fitness room for safety reasons.

618
00:46:44,685 --> 00:46:47,882
He's never had symptoms like this before.
This is the first time.

619
00:46:47,882 --> 00:46:50,100
And it will probably be the only time.

620
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,864
I'll take care of him. Okay?

621
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,700
That's not possible.

622
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:57,765
What's the big deal about this?
I told you I can take care of him!

623
00:46:57,765 --> 00:46:59,620
We only have two choices.

624
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:01,590
Either Uncle Tao quarantines himself
in the fitness room

625
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:03,990
or he goes outside with the infected.

626
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,380
- All done.
- Okay.

627
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,180
Soon everyone will be in here.

628
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:39,208
I know why Uncle Tao wasn't bitten
by the infected.

629
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,780
It's not because of his meditation bowl.

630
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,220
<i>It's really gone! It's really gone!</i>

631
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,580
It's because he's already infected.

632
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:57,540
The infected don't bite each other.

633
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:01,540
When I examined Uncle Tao,
I didn't see any bite or scratch marks.

634
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,580
Did you give Uncle Tao any medicine?

635
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:11,113
Just regular medicine.

636
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,460
And some supplements.

637
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,180
Where did you buy the medicine?

638
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,796
I bought it from that fitness guy.

639
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:24,140
He said it would help with heart disease,

640
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:27,389
and when he took it, he actually got better.

641
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,180
He wasn't tired or weak anymore.

642
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:32,820
And his heart didn't hurt like it used to.

643
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,700
How long has he been taking it?

644
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,610
Not that long.

645
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,140
Probably just one pack.

646
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:44,100
But when the medicine ran out,
he started feeling worse again.

647
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,305
All roads lead back to Hack.

648
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:10,620
But at least we know that the Next drug is
being distributed in many forms.

649
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,948
And more importantly,

650
00:49:13,012 --> 00:49:18,260
none of the buyers seem to know
the true effects of Next.

651
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:23,288
Even Hack, the drug dealer,
chose to take it himself.

652
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,056
Is it possible that Hack was killed

653
00:49:27,056 --> 00:49:29,306
because he knew this drug turns people
into the infected?

654
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:37,100
Hack might have been killed because he knew
the true identity of the culprit.

655
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:42,700
<i>But you know I don't like to wait.</i>

656
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:47,340
<i>And if there are too many infected to control,
it could affect our other businesses.</i>

657
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,180
<i>You know what to do.</i>

658
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,460
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

659
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,780
Come in.

660
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:00,140
Excuse me.

661
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:05,401
The lab reported that
the rat that received Run's blood

662
00:50:05,401 --> 00:50:07,500
had become infected again and died.

663
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,844
Run's blood can't be used to develop a vaccine
at this time.

664
00:50:28,764 --> 00:50:29,764
Inspector.

665
00:50:34,504 --> 00:50:35,505
Yes?

666
00:50:35,505 --> 00:50:36,991
The information I gave you,

667
00:50:36,991 --> 00:50:38,265
<i>what have you found?</i>

668
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,780
The residents in this condo
bought drugs from Hack.

669
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,450
So some people got infected
from using the drug, right?

670
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,500
Yes.

671
00:50:48,014 --> 00:50:52,919
But the problem is,
whether they're buying or selling,

672
00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:54,094
everyone is a victim.

673
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:57,860
<i>But in the end, it all leads back to Hack,</i>

674
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:00,500
and we can't seem to get any further.

675
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:04,660
You have to keep investigating!
I've given you all the information I have!

676
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:06,620
<i>I'll give you three more days.</i>

677
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:09,340
The drug distributor must be
in The Breathe Condo.

678
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:12,540
If they created this disease,
they must have a cure.

679
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:16,060
And if we can't find a cure for the infected,
I'll have to…

680
00:51:17,728 --> 00:51:19,379
<i>You know what to do.</i>

681
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,529
I'll have to eliminate all the infected.

682
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,700
What's got you in such a good mood, Fah?

683
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,220
You've been smiling from a mile away.

684
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:59,300
Just smile to make
the world a brighter place.

685
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,340
Want some? I brought you a lot.

686
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:03,180
No, thanks. I'm going to bed.

687
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,860
Goodnight.

688
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:10,660
You seem very cheerful.
It must be the black magic, huh?

689
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:13,220
Who are you calling black magic?

690
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,220
You, of course.

691
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,891
Saying that means…

692
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,847
You don't want to eat these cheese bites

693
00:52:19,847 --> 00:52:24,180
and French croissants with almond fillings?

694
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:28,500
Aren't those cheese bites and almond croissants
right here now?

695
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,263
- Oh.
- It's the same stuff as always.

696
00:52:31,263 --> 00:52:33,180
Why are you acting surprised?

697
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,740
Then don't eat it.

698
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:38,500
Alright, alright! Sorry. Just put it here.

699
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:41,780
Are you going to eat or not?
I'll throw it to you.

700
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,260
Ah…

701
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,180
What's wrong with you?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

702
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,860
Get out of here! Go!

703
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:06,500
What is going on?

704
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:12,540
Run away now! Run! Go!

705
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:15,900
- Where should I go?
- Just go! Run! Run!

706
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,983
Where should I go?

707
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,220
Don't!

708
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:38,780
Run away!

709
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,700
Uncle Tao!

710
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,262
Stop!

711
00:55:37,687 --> 00:55:38,901
<i>Why did you kill him?</i>

712
00:55:40,024 --> 00:55:41,672
<i>You said it was just a quarantine.</i>

713
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:42,308
<i>Tao!</i>

714
00:55:42,308 --> 00:55:44,155
<i>Just quarantine yourself.</i>

715
00:55:44,155 --> 00:55:45,519
<i>Just quarantine yourself, huh?</i>

716
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:47,151
<i>We're not the ones killing her.</i>

717
00:55:47,151 --> 00:55:49,170
<i>The infected will be the ones doing it.</i>

718
00:55:49,715 --> 00:55:50,715
<i>Remember that.</i>

719
00:55:51,986 --> 00:55:54,222
<i>This is what's been happening all along, Net.</i>

720
00:55:55,071 --> 00:55:57,469
<i>The evidence is clear.</i>

721
00:55:57,469 --> 00:55:59,114
<i>Just pay me.</i>

722
00:55:59,998 --> 00:56:02,787
<i>He said it would help me with something.</i>

723
00:56:14,152 --> 00:56:15,296
<i>It's me.</i>

724
00:56:15,296 --> 00:56:16,901
<i>The mastermind behind all of this…</i>

725
00:56:16,901 --> 00:56:20,343
<i>Wait until you find evidence
to support your conclusion.</i>

726
00:56:21,390 --> 00:56:22,390
<i>Open it now!</i>

727
00:56:23,189 --> 00:56:24,627
<i>Open the door!</i>

728
00:56:24,627 --> 00:56:25,627
<i>Open it!</i>
