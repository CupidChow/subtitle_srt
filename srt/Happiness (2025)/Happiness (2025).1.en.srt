Do you remember anything from that day?

3
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,600
I went to a water fight, and it was so hot…

4
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:37,200
I felt dizzy, so he brought me here.

5
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,040
Don't worry, I'll take care of you.

6
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,040
Then I was thirsty…

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,200
So thirsty.

8
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,120
I'm going to ask you straight up,
did you use any drugs?

9
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,935
Then when I woke up…

10
00:01:06,935 --> 00:01:11,007
Shit! Don't come any closer!
Don't come any closer!

11
00:01:11,007 --> 00:01:12,310

13
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,748
Why is it that as we grow up…

14
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:23,710
finding happiness
becomes harder and harder?

15
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,186
Sometimes I wonder…

16
00:03:38,984 --> 00:03:41,968
if the day I'll ever be
truly happy will arrive.

17
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,280
Actually, maybe you just haven't found
the right kind of happiness.

18
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,600
For me, it's simple.
Happiness is being right here.

The Songkran festival has begun!
People are splashing water everywhere.

21

This year is especially wild,
with tons of tourists,

00:04:08,212 --> 00:04:11,677

23
00:04:11,677 --> 00:04:14,958
And now, officers have closed off the roads
with barricades

24
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:18,360
to prevent traffic from entering the area.

25
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,346
This closure will take effect at noon.

26
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:24,141
The roads will be closed off
from this 13th to 15th.

27
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,800
Should we call a mechanic, Kai?

28
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,480
Oh, no need, Inspector. I can handle this.

Attention all units, all units,

we have a report of an affray
at the Sukhnitra 24 Hotel.

31
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:53,920
Looks like we won't be going back
to the station anytime soon, Inspector.

32
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,410
- Attention all units, all units.
- Alright, let's go.

33

Code 4 checking, we have a report of
an affray at the Sukhnitra 24 Hotel.

34
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:02,608
Repeat, Code 4, please check.

35
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,880
It's so quiet, Inspector. Don't you think?

36
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,126
You're the police, right? This way, please.

37
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,880
- First, a banging sound from Room 1311.
- Uh-huh.

38
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,280
I thought it was normal,
but then I heard a man scream.

39
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,240
It was so loud and scary that
I had to call the police.

40
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,052
Wait a minute. How many people checked in?

41
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:34,680
Two people. A man and a woman.

42
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,720
It's probably a couple fighting.

43
00:06:37,704 --> 00:06:38,704
This room.

44
00:07:29,818 --> 00:07:30,824
Oh my God!

45
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,606
It looks like he was slashed
in the neck, Inspector.

46
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:55,267
I don't think so.

47
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,080
How many people did the staff say checked in?

48
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:03,684
Two people.

49
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,454
So how come there is only one body?

50
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,571
Calm down, miss.

51
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,000
Help me…

52
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,080
What do you remember?

53
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:51,840
I went to a water fight, and it was so hot…

54
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,360
I felt dizzy, so he brought me here.

55
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,232
Come on, let's get you some rest.

56
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,520
Slowly, slowly, no need to rush.

57
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,923
Ah, okay.

58
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,793
Are you tired, huh?

59
00:10:14,428 --> 00:10:15,480
Do you have any water?

60

I'm thirsty.

61
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,840
And then I was so thirsty.

I've had a good life until retirement,

174
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,600
and I know that
a happy life is a debt-free life.

175
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,760
But I don't want to live here anymore.

176
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,920
We've lived here for decades,
you've grown up here.

177
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,120
We can still live. We can live.

178
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,160
But don't you want to change anything?

179
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,280
Don't you want a better life?

180
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,124
Dad, please, let's move.

181
00:23:29,063 --> 00:23:31,054
Please, Dad.

182
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,920
It's fine to live here. Low expenses.

183
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,240
I think I'd better go take a shower.

184
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,320
Dad…

185
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,445
Are you free?

186
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,880
Yeah, sure. Let's meet at the usual place.

187
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,306
- Run.
- Yo!

188
00:24:23,001 --> 00:24:25,160
- Come.
- Whoa!

189
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,400
You know me so well.

190
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,400
You've been ordering spicy raw beef salad
since we were in the academy.

191
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:40,189
Superb. It tastes so good.

192
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,400
So, what's on your mind? Spill it.

193
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,490
- It's my dad again.
- Uh-huh.

194
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,610
He keeps nagging me.

195
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,480
Doesn't everyone nag you?

196
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:04,694
Well, you're so stubborn,
of course everyone nags you.

197
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,240
Come on, tell me what happened.

198
00:25:12,001 --> 00:25:13,007
Well…

199
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,080
My neighbors were fighting again,

200
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:24,679
and I tried to help,
but my dad accused me of meddling.

201
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:25,719
Now who's in the wrong?

202
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:27,450
Me, again.

203
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,305
Seriously?

204
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,760
It's normal for your dad, isn't it?

205
00:25:32,536 --> 00:25:36,176
Come on, think like parents.
No one wants their kids getting into trouble.

206
00:25:39,729 --> 00:25:42,426
I'm so want to get my dad
out of that flat, for real.

207
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,529
So, how's work going for you?

208
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:51,409
It's okay, you know, the usual.

209
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,976
- That's it?
- Yeah.

210
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,406
Come on now, tell me more.
I just told you many things, non-stop.

211
00:25:59,406 --> 00:26:00,726
Tell me more now!

212
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,600
Okay then,

213
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:09,840
so normally,
can a small woman able to kill a big man?

214
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,130
Kill?

215
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:20,610
Well, maybe with a knife and a gun.

216
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,040
Or if it were me, I'd just break his neck.

217
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,680
Oh, she's not a woman like you.

218
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,047
What's wrong with a woman like me?

219
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,311
I mean, like a normal woman, not like you.

220
00:26:34,311 --> 00:26:36,711
Could she bite a man's neck to kill him?

221
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:45,400
If she bites…
maybe she'd have to bite the main artery.

222
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,560
That's the fetal spot.

223
00:26:47,657 --> 00:26:48,977
- The main artery?
- Yeah.

224
00:26:53,897 --> 00:26:54,947
Show me how you'd bite.

225
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:26,456
Are you crazy?

226
00:27:34,864 --> 00:27:36,864
Who gonna bites someone's neck like that?

227
00:27:41,377 --> 00:27:44,697
Hmm. This duck beak is pretty tasty too.

228
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,400
Hey, why are you stealing my food?
There's plenty!

229
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,141
Right, if anyone gives you vitamins or
any kind of medicine,

230
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:57,000
- don't take it, okay?
- Why not?

231
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,400
Just trust me on this one.

232
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,600
What the heck?

233
00:28:02,336 --> 00:28:05,720
I told you so much,
but you didn't tell me anything.

234
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,560
You were just mumbling. How annoying.

235
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,001
You're speaking Thai, speak clearly!

236
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:14,281
An-noy-ing.

237
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,760
An-noy-ing!

238
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,767
- Good.
- Annoying!

239
00:28:21,634 --> 00:28:24,600
- Annoying!
- Alright, I get it.

240
00:28:36,004 --> 00:28:38,314
I told you, you don't have to walk me home.

241
00:28:38,314 --> 00:28:39,714
I'm not a weak woman!

242
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,040
I know you're not weak,
but I wanted to walk with you.

243
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,600
Well, you can go back now.

244
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,280
Okay, okay.

245
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,120
And when you get up there,
don't argue with your dad again.

246
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,240
Listen to what he says.

247
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,785
Oh, you're not taking my side at all.

248
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:07,318
He's saying those things because
he cares about you. Don't be stubborn.

249
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,680
You're starting to sound more and more
like my dad.

250
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,633
Go back now. Go on, go.

251
00:29:16,953 --> 00:29:18,385
Go on now.

252
00:29:18,385 --> 00:29:19,827
Alright, alright. Go up there first.

253
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:27,811
[Day 2]

254
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,880
Hey, Top.

255
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,600
Having trouble again today, huh?

256
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,120
How did you know?

257
00:29:51,433 --> 00:29:56,600
Every time you start a sentence with "Hey, Top."
like this. There's always something going on.

258
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,880
But then you also say that every day.

259
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:05,440
Oh, so you're saying
I cause trouble every day? Huh?

260
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,520
Isn't it true?

261
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,600
Well, it is true. Can't argue with that.

262
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,240
Run, there's trouble.

263
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,000
You think you're so smart,
lecturing me about being a cop.

264
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,520
Please don't hurt me.
I just want you to go back to work…

265
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,760
What do you know?

266
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,520
When I first became a cop,
you weren't even born yet, Tarn.

267
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,960
Hey, did you call Run?

268
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,257
- Uncle…
- Fine.

269
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:40,799
I'll talk to Run alone.

270
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,440
Everyone else, stay out of this.
Or I'm going to stab until guts spill out!

271
00:30:47,656 --> 00:30:49,376
Let's go, let's go.

272
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,280
Uncle, please calm down.

273
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,960
Don't talk to me like that.
You always badmouth me.

274
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,960
Why aren't you being a smartass
like the other day?

275
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,800
Uncle, trust me. Slowly put down the knife.
Let's talk calmly, put down the knife.

276
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,560
I'm going to get arrested anyway,
so we might as well die together!

277
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:13,640
Uncle! Uncle, please calm down. How about this?

278
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,800
My boss is getting promoted to Commander.

279
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,560
If you want to be a cop again,
I can talk to him for you.

280
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,280
It's better than this, uncle.
And this way, it's not wrong.

281
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,390
Ow! Let go of me!

282
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,990
Top, check on Tarn!

283
00:31:43,874 --> 00:31:44,879
Let go of me!

284
00:31:46,751 --> 00:31:48,240
- Run!
- Let go of me!

285
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,040
Are you alright?

286
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,640
Tarn! That's enough.

287
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,920
Tarn, please stop. Tarn!

288
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,520
Tarn, stop it! Stop.

289
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,640
Tarn, stop!

290
00:32:55,562 --> 00:32:56,569
Tarn?

291
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,840
Run, are you okay?

292
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,680
I'm fine. Just a little scratch.

293
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,840
This area is under control.
We'll take it from now on.

294
00:34:56,599 --> 00:34:59,723
- Take care of the infected and the body.
- Yes, ma'am.

295
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,760
Where are you taking Tarn to?

296
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,520
In this case, she's infected.
We have to take her for treatment.

297
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,760
Infected with what?

298
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,000
That wound, you were scratched, right?

299
00:35:40,915 --> 00:35:43,360
We need to take you to the center.

300
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,560
Why should I?

301
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,080
We need to test you for infection.

302
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,480
And if you're infected,
you'll have to undergo treatment.

303
00:35:56,268 --> 00:35:57,274
Kai,

304
00:35:58,944 --> 00:36:00,889
how's that thing
I asked you to look into going?

305
00:36:00,889 --> 00:36:04,449
Oh, Inspector, you came at the perfect time.
Like you knew something was up.

306
00:36:05,047 --> 00:36:07,207
So, did you find anything? What did you get?

307
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,120
Headquarters sent this additional over.
It's really suspicious.

308
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,280
Did she use any drugs?

309
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:36,080
So, what kind of drug is it, Kai?

310
00:36:38,617 --> 00:36:41,457
Headquarters hasn't been able
to identify it yet.

311
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,176
But the important thing is, Inspector,

312
00:36:44,176 --> 00:36:46,416
they've never seen this drug before.

313
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,642
We need to find more evidence.

314
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,760
Okay, I'm on it.

315
00:37:05,421 --> 00:37:13,389
[Special Outbreak Control Command]

316
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:55,000
[Medical Operations Department]

317
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,440
May I search your belongings?

318
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,520
All clear.

319
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,640
Can I go home now?

320
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,200
After you change,
we'll take you to the quarantine room.

321
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,680
Quarantine? But I only came to get tested.

322
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,320
Shouldn't I be getting tested at a hospital?

323
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,840
What are you planning to do?

324
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:48,760
To be sure you're not infected,
we need to monitor you for 24 hours.

325
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,000
And what if I refuse?

326
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,880
You wouldn't want to end up like her,

327
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,120
who hurt the people you love
unaware, would you?

328
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,680
Then can I borrow a phone?

329
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,960
Hello? Who is this?

330
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,040
Hey, it's me. Can you contact my dad?

331
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,240
Run? Is that you? Whose number is this?

332
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,303
Just do it, okay? Tell him…

333
00:39:41,076 --> 00:39:43,262
- I'm not coming home.
- Why not?

334
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,680
I'm… going to stay at a friend's house
for a few days.

335
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,440
Which friend? You have friends?

336
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,520
Just contact him, okay?

337
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,640
I'll call back later. That's all.

338
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,760
Run? Hello? Run?

339
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,440
Room 48.

340
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,368
Do you think I'm a prisoner?

341
00:41:00,032 --> 00:41:01,632
So I have to stay in this room?

342
00:41:03,448 --> 00:41:06,563
If you don't show any symptoms tonight,
we'll test you again tomorrow,

343
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:08,119
and if you're clear,

344
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:09,479
you can go home.

345
00:41:10,184 --> 00:41:11,744
But if I'm infected,

346
00:41:12,865 --> 00:41:14,505
I'll become like Tarn, right?

347
00:41:18,816 --> 00:41:20,056
Good luck.

348
00:43:17,802 --> 00:43:19,802
Yutthasak Suwannasiri,

349
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,360
Director of the Special Control Unit,
a key figure in the country.

350
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:29,160
All news about him disappeared four years ago.

351
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,880
Then how did you find this information?

352
00:43:31,616 --> 00:43:32,623
I have my ways.

353
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,306
This kind of news is hidden on the deep web.

354
00:43:35,306 --> 00:43:39,361
All the important national matters,
he's been involved in every single one.

355
00:43:39,361 --> 00:43:40,370
And what about the drug?

356
00:43:41,104 --> 00:43:42,672
You should check this place out.

357
00:43:42,672 --> 00:43:46,521
My sources say Yutthasak is in charge there.

358
00:43:46,521 --> 00:43:48,921
It might be related to
the drug you're looking for.

359
00:43:49,609 --> 00:43:51,489
And do you know what this drug is?

360
00:43:52,784 --> 00:43:54,952
Based on the info I have,
I'm not entirely sure either.

361
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,004
[Day 3]

362
00:44:16,073 --> 00:44:17,833
Miss Run's blood test results are back.

363
00:44:29,587 --> 00:44:30,589
Negative?

364
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,960
- It's been 24 hours, right?
- Yes.

365
00:44:40,873 --> 00:44:43,953
Then let her go,
but have someone follow her discreetly.

366
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,200
Keep monitoring her condition.

367
00:44:58,064 --> 00:44:59,904
Restricted area, no entry.

368
00:45:00,776 --> 00:45:02,056
I have business with him.

369
00:45:06,072 --> 00:45:07,352
Please wait a moment.

370
00:45:09,384 --> 00:45:10,384
Let him in.

371
00:45:13,561 --> 00:45:14,563
Please come in.

372
00:45:30,536 --> 00:45:31,736
I need to talk to you.

373
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,482
Ready to work?

374
00:45:51,761 --> 00:45:52,768
What is this drug?

375
00:46:05,937 --> 00:46:08,297
Why do you think this drug is related to me?

376
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:16,410
You should stop with the irrelevant talk.

377
00:46:29,865 --> 00:46:33,705
If you help us, I'll tell you everything.

378
00:46:38,489 --> 00:46:40,249
But the longer you take to decide,

379
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,360
the more infected there will be.

380
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:50,241
In the past few days,
we've almost lost control of the situation.

381
00:47:06,488 --> 00:47:09,688
And we don't know how much longer
we can hold out.

382
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,800
All we can do now is keep it under wraps.

383
00:47:27,808 --> 00:47:30,968
Contain everything.
Don't let any news leak out.

384
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:38,566
This afternoon, police apprehended
a crazed gunman who opened fire in an alley

385
00:47:38,566 --> 00:47:41,840
while people were enjoying
in Songkran festival.

386
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,120
Hey, put the gun down!

387
00:47:47,792 --> 00:47:52,192
Just yesterday, we brought in someone
from the Special Suppression Unit.

388
00:47:53,689 --> 00:47:55,849
Not sure if you know her.

389
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,321
Run is with you?

390
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:06,848
She's at risk of infection.

391
00:48:14,497 --> 00:48:16,057
What the hell is this infection?

392
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,560
Right now, no one knows
the details of this infection.

393
00:48:23,865 --> 00:48:25,705
That's why we need your help.

394
00:48:50,562 --> 00:48:51,563
Hi…

395
00:48:57,002 --> 00:48:58,522
Are you still thirsty?

396
00:49:01,057 --> 00:49:02,097
Not really.

397
00:49:03,592 --> 00:49:04,992
Just let me go.

398
00:49:08,522 --> 00:49:10,002
Look, I'm perfectly healthy.

399
00:49:15,329 --> 00:49:16,329
This way, please.

400
00:49:53,265 --> 00:49:54,465
Clean, Room 48.

401
00:49:58,677 --> 00:50:01,957
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey! What are you doing?

402
00:50:02,865 --> 00:50:03,865
Open up!

403
00:50:07,433 --> 00:50:09,840
Open the door! The key? The key!

404
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,440
Tarn…

405
00:50:21,737 --> 00:50:24,142
Run, I need water. Water…

406
00:50:24,142 --> 00:50:26,255
Tarn, are you better now?

407
00:50:26,255 --> 00:50:28,615
Run, I'm thirsty. I need water. Water…

408
00:50:30,232 --> 00:50:33,183
Open the door! Why did you go in there?

409
00:50:33,183 --> 00:50:35,572
I said, 'Open the door and come out!'
Come out!

410
00:50:35,572 --> 00:50:36,972
I need water…

411
00:50:38,336 --> 00:50:39,716
Open the door!

412
00:50:39,716 --> 00:50:41,396
There's no more water, Tarn.

413
00:50:41,396 --> 00:50:43,240
I need water… water… water…

414
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,960
There's no more water.
Tarn, pull yourself together.

415
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,160
The key! Quick!

416
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,000
The drug… drug…

417
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,883
- What drug, Tarn?
- The drug, Run… drug…

418
00:50:53,883 --> 00:50:57,277
- Open!
- The drug… The drug… The drug!

419
00:50:57,277 --> 00:50:59,520
- Open the door!
- Someone brought the drug.

420
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,640
Who?

421
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:02,360
Come out! Open it!

422
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,787
- Who did you buy it from, Tarn?
- It's dangerous in there.

423
00:51:03,787 --> 00:51:05,200
Answer me, Tarn.

424
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,505
- Who was it that day? Answer me, Tarn.
- Come out!

425
00:51:07,505 --> 00:51:08,935
It's dangerous in there.

426
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,124
Miss Run!

427
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:23,240
Miss Run!

428
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,366
What happened?

429
00:51:44,862 --> 00:51:46,143
Miss Run!

430
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:56,310
[Next Episode]

431
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:57,315
Don't shoot!

432
00:53:00,524 --> 00:53:01,965
But we don't know who they are.

433
00:53:01,965 --> 00:53:05,067
I need you to investigate
who's involved in this operation

434
00:53:06,062 --> 00:53:07,532
to stop the spread…

435
00:53:08,152 --> 00:53:09,551
In exchange for…

436
00:53:09,551 --> 00:53:11,028
anything you ask for.

437
00:53:13,178 --> 00:53:15,130
So, where did that agency take you?

438
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:16,192
Why do you want to know?

439
00:53:25,844 --> 00:53:29,647
I'm just checking to make sure
there are no other infected people.

440
00:53:30,649 --> 00:53:32,760
- What am I supposed to do?
- Calm down.

441
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:33,901
Look, calm down.

442
00:53:37,029 --> 00:53:39,982
Do you want him dead?
He's still alive!
