1
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:12,345
[This series is a work of fiction.
All characters, locations, and events are entirely fabricated.]

2
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:16,019
[Previously]

3
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:18,281
To prevent the spread of the disease,

4
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:21,415
please quarantine yourselves
in your own units.

5
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:25,997
As for food and other management,
we will take care of it.

6
00:00:27,242 --> 00:00:31,885
We can use this opportunity
to gather more information on the residents.

7
00:00:31,885 --> 00:00:34,678
Do you think we've missed anyone?

8
00:00:35,794 --> 00:00:37,478
Everyone seems suspicious.

9
00:00:37,478 --> 00:00:40,157
Eating the same thing for days?
I'll be bored to death.

10
00:00:40,157 --> 00:00:41,244
Your mom is calling.

11
00:00:41,244 --> 00:00:42,927
Mommy loves you, Yayee.

12
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:46,983
Run, please bring her back to me.

13
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:50,015
Her blood only temporarily inhibits
the disease's progression.

14
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:51,730
We need to do another blood test.

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,583
I can't be there.

16
00:00:52,583 --> 00:00:54,353
If you want to do the test,
you have to come here.

17
00:00:54,353 --> 00:00:56,094
And another thing…

18
00:00:57,547 --> 00:00:59,292
She's alive.

19
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:02,975
And because of that,
we need you to give us more blood samples.

20
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:05,522
You and our child will be okay.

21
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,930
Run!

22
00:02:55,414 --> 00:02:57,114
Open the door.

23
00:04:57,518 --> 00:05:00,055
[Happiness]

24
00:05:00,055 --> 00:05:01,283
Why are you doing this?

25
00:05:01,283 --> 00:05:02,969
If you were me,
you would do the same.

26
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,603
I wouldn't use violence like this.

27
00:05:04,603 --> 00:05:07,091
We don't have time.

28
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:11,005
What do you mean?

29
00:05:11,005 --> 00:05:17,502
The lab results show that
Run's blood has a self-healing reaction.

30
00:05:20,242 --> 00:05:23,233
Your blood may contain antibodies.

31
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,512
Even though there's only
a 10% chance right now,

32
00:05:25,512 --> 00:05:31,705
but if you cooperate, many infected people
could be cured of this disease.

33
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:37,491
We need more of your blood.

34
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:44,695
Then take it.

35
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:10,670
Thank you very much.

36
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,022
And don't forget to drink plenty of water.

37
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:16,402
Promise me you'll make this work.

38
00:06:25,901 --> 00:06:28,809
Here are the asthma inhalers you asked for.

39
00:06:46,609 --> 00:06:49,277
Is there something you need?

40
00:06:49,277 --> 00:06:52,351
What have you two been up to?

41
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:55,529
We went to exercise.

42
00:06:58,268 --> 00:07:02,603
Did you hurt while exercising?

43
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:03,669
Let me take a look at your wound.

44
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:06,603
It's okay. I think Run is fine.

45
00:07:07,705 --> 00:07:10,382
I was just being clumsy, Beam.

46
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:12,200
Do you need anything?

47
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,456
Oh, I just wanted to share some food
with you guys.

48
00:07:15,456 --> 00:07:18,110
And I have some useful things for Yayee.

49
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:20,055
Do you want to give it to her yourself?

50
00:07:20,055 --> 00:07:21,251
Okay.

51
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:22,517
Thank you very much.

52
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,625
I think…
you probably have something else to do.

53
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,532
Anyway, thank you very much.

54
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:32,840
You can go back now.
I'll take it to her.

55
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,120
How rude…

56
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:41,696
Yes, I have some things
to take care of.

57
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll come visit Yayee again another day.

58
00:07:46,114 --> 00:07:47,918
Okay, thank you.

59
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:49,527
I'll excuse myself, then.

60
00:07:49,527 --> 00:07:50,560
Thank you, Beam.

61
00:07:58,024 --> 00:07:59,704
He's still as kind as ever.

62
00:08:03,268 --> 00:08:04,709
Let's go inside. Come on.

63
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:12,796
Yayee, I'm back.
I brought your medicine.

64
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:16,631
Hang in there.

65
00:08:17,823 --> 00:08:20,840
I'm sorry for leaving you alone, Yayee.

66
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:24,360
I'm used to being alone.

67
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:27,560
It's okay.

68
00:08:30,688 --> 00:08:32,560
Don't worry about me.

69
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:36,648
Okay, come here.

70
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:44,997
Okay, ready? One… two… three!

71
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:55,076
Feeling better?

72
00:08:55,864 --> 00:08:57,392
I'm okay now.

73
00:08:58,902 --> 00:09:01,000
Run, did you see my mommy?

74
00:09:05,824 --> 00:09:08,840
Mommy is outside. They won't let her in.

75
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:12,012
How is Mommy?

76
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:21,280
Don't worry, Yayee.

77
00:09:21,985 --> 00:09:25,600
Mommy is in a safe place. Don't worry.

78
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:29,208
I miss Mommy.

79
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,009
It's okay. Stay with me for now.

80
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,296
Don't worry.

81
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:55,142
A vitamin C soap.

82
00:09:55,142 --> 00:09:59,059
I want to tell you that all the products
from Fahra's shop are of guaranteed quality.

83
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:01,416
You'll definitely look amazing
after using them.

84
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,257
Don't forget to click
the notification bell, everyone.

85
00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:06,384
Today I have to get rest
and take care of my skin

86
00:10:06,384 --> 00:10:07,385
because tomorrow,

87
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:10,156
I will be in a big event that the
live-streaming with other customers.

88
00:10:10,156 --> 00:10:13,089
Anyway, don't forget to add
these amazing products to your cart.

89
00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:14,361
Bye-bye. XOXO.

90
00:10:15,593 --> 00:10:18,994
Well, the sales were amazing today.

91
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,902
How are you doing, my friend?

92
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:24,382
Are your eyes any better?

93
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:28,427
Yeah, they're better now,
but still hurt a little.

94
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,737
I think it's probably a stye.

95
00:10:30,576 --> 00:10:32,484
You didn't listen to me.

96
00:10:32,484 --> 00:10:34,563
I told you not to overwork yourself.

97
00:10:34,563 --> 00:10:36,889
You know there's not enough light
to write scripts at night?

98
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:38,927
I turn on the lights when I write.

99
00:10:38,927 --> 00:10:42,894
I can't stop writing.
They're rushing to start filming.

100
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:46,501
And I have to submit the script next week.

101
00:10:48,222 --> 00:10:50,200
I've been writing for almost a year now,

102
00:10:51,093 --> 00:10:52,555
and I've only finished one story.

103
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:53,759
Must be a meticulous job.

104
00:10:54,814 --> 00:10:56,836
Here, here.
I'll give you a box of supplements.

105
00:10:56,836 --> 00:10:57,995
This one is amazing.

106
00:10:59,878 --> 00:11:01,709
What about you?

107
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:04,315
Are you buying this condo
for these boxes to live in or something?

108
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:10,323
Honestly, I want to be with a boy too.

109
00:11:10,323 --> 00:11:14,441
But from the first day I lived here
until today, it's been a year.

110
00:11:14,441 --> 00:11:17,302
And you've been with me every day.

111
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,178
It's just temporary.

112
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,552
Why are you complaining so much?

113
00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:23,384
Temporary, huh?
It's been almost a year already.

114
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:25,661
We are together so much that
people think we're a couple.

115
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:27,961
I've been completely friend-zoned.
No guy ever hits on me.

116
00:11:29,439 --> 00:11:31,613
Do you want a boyfriend that badly?

117
00:11:31,613 --> 00:11:34,805
Well, yeah. Don't you want one?

118
00:11:34,805 --> 00:11:36,600
Nah, I don't want one.

119
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,840
I want a stable career

120
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,797
because I want money.

121
00:11:42,797 --> 00:11:45,159
If you want to be rich, get a rich man.

122
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,736
You get both a boy and money.

123
00:11:47,736 --> 00:11:49,113
What if you break up?

124
00:11:49,113 --> 00:11:50,200
Won't you be miserable?

125
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:53,078
Oh, right.

126
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:55,119
But what about the orders
my customers placed?

127
00:11:55,119 --> 00:11:57,443
How am I going to deliver them?

128
00:11:57,443 --> 00:11:58,443
You're right.

129
00:11:59,522 --> 00:12:01,086
If I submit the script,

130
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,004
how am I going to go out
and get the check?

131
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,089
Hey, watching them won't help.

132
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:26,598
There's nothing you can do about it.
Get back to work.

133
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:29,567
Okay.

134
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:34,204
Honey, we're out of food.

135
00:12:34,204 --> 00:12:35,680
- This case can be overturned.
- Okay.

136
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,031
- And this part…
- Okay.

137
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:38,037
Do this part well.

138
00:12:38,037 --> 00:12:39,802
Are you even listening to me?

139
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:45,600
Let me finish this work first, honey.

140
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,332
What work?

141
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:49,600
You're not even going to court.

142
00:12:50,451 --> 00:12:53,051
I just asked
what we're going to eat tonight.

143
00:12:53,051 --> 00:12:54,920
Whatever you make, I can eat it.

144
00:12:56,314 --> 00:12:58,440
Make what?
There's nothing to make, honey.

145
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,584
Nothing? What about the relief packages
they just gave us?

146
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:03,914
The relief packages?

147
00:13:03,914 --> 00:13:07,264
They gave us two bags,
but there are three of us here.

148
00:13:07,264 --> 00:13:08,757
It's not going to be enough.

149
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:16,385
Are you saying that
Rangrong is stealing our food?

150
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:21,271
That's heartless.

151
00:13:21,271 --> 00:13:26,383
I told you, Rangrong is stuck here
because she was helping me with work.

152
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:33,040
It's okay.

153
00:13:34,478 --> 00:13:37,017
I don't have to eat.
I'm on a diet anyway.

154
00:13:44,301 --> 00:13:46,729
Jee, come eat.

155
00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:48,480
Stop playing with your phone.

156
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:51,958
How much food do we have left?

157
00:13:53,297 --> 00:13:56,119
This is the last day's worth.

158
00:13:56,119 --> 00:13:58,398
When will they deliver more?

159
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:03,749
[Is it real?]

160
00:14:03,749 --> 00:14:05,027
[Just a content?
Pretty scary, though.]

161
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:06,163
[That's cap.]

162
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,371
Here, I'll help you.

163
00:14:12,371 --> 00:14:13,371
Okay.

164
00:14:14,203 --> 00:14:16,115
Here, hold this.

165
00:14:18,787 --> 00:14:19,787
Let's go.

166
00:14:23,352 --> 00:14:24,352
Oh.

167
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:26,930
Why doesn't he turn off the engine?

168
00:14:29,151 --> 00:14:30,151
Mister…

169
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:36,122
Hey, why did you leave the engine
running like this?

170
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:37,226
Turn it off, please.

171
00:14:41,053 --> 00:14:42,214
- Hey,
- I think…

172
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,214
what are you doing?

173
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:46,546
Hey!

174
00:14:53,353 --> 00:14:54,353
What the hell?

175
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:03,841
Open the door! Open the door!

176
00:15:03,841 --> 00:15:06,704
The keycard? The keycard!

177
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:12,553
Go, quickly! Go!

178
00:15:15,563 --> 00:15:18,720
Hey, you. Just now…

179
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,024
I found something.
It was covered in blood.

180
00:15:21,773 --> 00:15:23,794
- A monster! A monster!
- It bit someone's neck!

181
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:25,352
Wait a minute.
Calm down and tell us.

182
00:15:25,352 --> 00:15:26,480
What kind of creature is in the condo?

183
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,505
- I don't know what it was. The blood…
- Is it a movie promotion?

184
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:31,992
You know, that Happy Horror movie
they're filming at our condo?

185
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:33,737
How clueless.

186
00:15:33,737 --> 00:15:34,745
Hey, I'm serious.

187
00:15:34,745 --> 00:15:37,671
It's true. If you don't believe me,
go see for yourself.

188
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:40,669
Go alone. I'm not coming with you.
Take a look.

189
00:15:40,669 --> 00:15:42,590
It was covered in blood, Auntie.

190
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:45,148
- What kind of creature was covered in blood?
- But our condo is sealed off.

191
00:15:45,148 --> 00:15:47,172
Who would come in to promote a movie?

192
00:15:47,172 --> 00:15:52,744
Or could it be related to the new disease
that the Special Control Unit announced?

193
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:54,729
I don't know, Auntie.
It was soaked in blood.

194
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:56,000
What did it look like?

195
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,053
Bloody… It was covered in blood,
with wide eyes.

196
00:15:58,053 --> 00:16:00,932
It wasn't a human. It looked like a human,
but covered in blood.

197
00:16:00,932 --> 00:16:03,358
It… It bit someone's neck in the car.

198
00:16:03,358 --> 00:16:05,099
He's dead. He died right there.

199
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,509
What?

200
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:11,495
Everyone, don't leave the condo,
and don't let anyone…

201
00:16:11,495 --> 00:16:13,068
Lock the doors! Lock the doors!

202
00:16:13,068 --> 00:16:15,052
- What?!
- Lock the door! Lock the door!

203
00:16:15,052 --> 00:16:16,052
Quickly!

204
00:16:18,098 --> 00:16:19,160
Lock the door?

205
00:16:21,704 --> 00:16:22,940
Hurry up!

206
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,168
It's done. It's locked.

207
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:25,168
Come on.

208
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:27,349
Back away.

209
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:31,689
Open up!

210
00:16:31,689 --> 00:16:33,435
Hey, who is that?

211
00:16:33,435 --> 00:16:34,705
Hurry up and open the door for him.

212
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:36,480
Is he one of our residents?
Open the door for him.

213
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,337
- Is he one of us?
- Don't open the door.

214
00:16:37,337 --> 00:16:38,341
Open up!

215
00:16:38,341 --> 00:16:39,711
Why not?

216
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:40,711
No!

217
00:16:41,573 --> 00:16:42,740
Oh, no…

218
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,058
- That's the foreigner from next door.
- No matter what, don't open the door.

219
00:16:44,058 --> 00:16:45,448
I remember him.

220
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:45,962
Open up!

221
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:47,080
If he's a resident,
then hurry up and open it.

222
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,997
Well, he looks normal.
Why can't we open it?

223
00:16:48,997 --> 00:16:50,627
No matter what, don't open the door.

224
00:16:50,627 --> 00:16:51,446
Trust him on this.

225
00:16:51,446 --> 00:16:52,737
Open up the door, please!

226
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:55,320
Oh, just open the door for him.
He's making a big fuss.

227
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,772
Yeah, if he's also a resident,
open it, quickly.

228
00:16:56,772 --> 00:16:58,517
Trust him.
Don't open it.

229
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,730
Just one quick open, done.

230
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,781
Help me, please! Come on!

231
00:17:03,465 --> 00:17:06,186
Maybe he's being chased by robbers.
Open the door for him, quickly.

232
00:17:06,186 --> 00:17:07,686
I can't hear what he's saying.
Open the door so we can talk to him.

233
00:17:07,686 --> 00:17:09,849
Maybe he's being robbed. Just open it.

234
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:11,080
They're coming!

235
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,583
They're coming! They're coming!

236
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,511
See?

237
00:17:16,511 --> 00:17:17,558
Just like what I saw.

238
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:18,624
It's a monster!

239
00:17:18,624 --> 00:17:20,649
A monster! A monster…

240
00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:22,282
But why hasn't it attacked him?

241
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:34,104
Prach…

242
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:37,840
Is he going to be okay?

243
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:46,531
Back away!

244
00:17:46,531 --> 00:17:47,787
It's transforming!

245
00:17:47,787 --> 00:17:49,144
What's that?

246
00:17:49,144 --> 00:17:50,353
It can transform!

247
00:17:55,412 --> 00:17:56,279
What should we do?

248
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,920
Help me! Quickly!

249
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,980
Help with what?

250
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,916
There's some over there. Grab it.

251
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,227
And how will that help?

252
00:18:02,227 --> 00:18:03,392
Come help me!

253
00:18:03,392 --> 00:18:04,914
What is it?

254
00:18:04,914 --> 00:18:05,915
Why are you sticking it up?

255
00:18:05,915 --> 00:18:07,550
Get the tape! Quickly!

256
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,080
- Get the tape!
- Hurry up!

257
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,467
- Help me. Stick it on.
- Stick it up. Quickly!

258
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:17,059
The top, too.

259
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:18,059
Hurry up!

260
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,818
I have an urgent announcement
for all citizens.

261
00:18:47,818 --> 00:18:52,320
The spread of the new disease
is rapidly expanding.

262
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:57,015
And the number of infected people
is increasing as well.

263
00:18:57,015 --> 00:18:59,410
The Special Control Unit
is doing everything it can

264
00:19:00,143 --> 00:19:02,486
to control the situation
and prevent it from escalating.

265
00:19:03,303 --> 00:19:05,843
We are also restricting access
to certain areas

266
00:19:05,843 --> 00:19:09,011
to prevent further spread of the infection.

267
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:19,333
The spread of the disease is happening rapidly.

268
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:23,088
There are two ways to get infected,

269
00:19:23,088 --> 00:19:26,383
one is by taking an unknown drug,

270
00:19:26,383 --> 00:19:30,055
and the other is by being bitten

271
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:33,100
or scratched by someone
who is already infected.

272
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:38,840
Therefore, please do not…
trust anyone easily

273
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:43,009
to prevent infection…

274
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:49,413
Does everyone understand?

275
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:50,669
Understand what?

276
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:52,300
What are we supposed to understand?
I'm so confused.

277
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,261
He just announced
what we're supposed to do.

278
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:58,925
Auntie, so can we go outside or not?

279
00:19:58,925 --> 00:19:59,973
What do we do now?

280
00:19:59,973 --> 00:20:02,749
Was that thing we saw real
or just part of the content?

281
00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:07,305
Right. And how did this disease
get into our condo?

282
00:20:07,305 --> 00:20:09,080
So I can't go outside?

283
00:20:10,234 --> 00:20:13,000
Let's figure out what to do next.

284
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:20,141
Everything's a mess.
I guess we can't work anymore.

285
00:20:24,935 --> 00:20:28,419
You have to pressure them more.
We can't wait any longer.

286
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:30,189
I'm afraid I can't do that.

287
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:33,800
Think about your wife, Yutthasak.

288
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:42,941
Hello, residents of The Breathe.

289
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:45,823
We hope you are all cooperating
with the quarantine

290
00:20:45,823 --> 00:20:49,219
to prevent the spread of the infection.

291
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:51,975
Please eat your food sparingly,

292
00:20:51,975 --> 00:20:54,756
as we will not be able
to deliver any more supplies

293
00:20:54,756 --> 00:20:57,880
until our officers have cleared the area.

294
00:20:58,711 --> 00:21:01,760
Thank you for your continued cooperation.

295
00:21:05,353 --> 00:21:06,353
So,

296
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,887
will we survive this?

297
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:10,600
We're almost out of food.

298
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,626
It's okay. Don't be scared.

299
00:21:15,883 --> 00:21:18,501
They said everything would be fine.

300
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:20,000
They're just saying that.

301
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,153
Look down there. There are so many infected.

302
00:21:26,153 --> 00:21:28,906
They're just tricking us
into waiting for our deaths.

303
00:21:28,906 --> 00:21:32,094
Just stay with me.
I'll take care of everything.

304
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,303
Trust me.

305
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:38,385
Indulge me.

306
00:21:38,385 --> 00:21:41,040
Whatever you want, I can get it for you.

307
00:21:42,747 --> 00:21:43,747
Come here.

308
00:21:50,599 --> 00:21:52,612
Are we really going to survive this?

309
00:22:13,478 --> 00:22:15,210
Tao, time to eat.

310
00:22:16,393 --> 00:22:17,393
Sure.

311
00:22:25,507 --> 00:22:26,765
Is this all we have, Noi?

312
00:22:28,311 --> 00:22:29,311
That's all.

313
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,513
All right, I'll eat whatever we have.

314
00:22:37,513 --> 00:22:38,520
I can eat anything.

315
00:22:39,563 --> 00:22:43,298
Are you crazy? You can't just meditate
and magically feel full.

316
00:22:43,298 --> 00:22:46,080
Well, this isn't a normal situation.

317
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,311
You have to understand that.

318
00:22:47,311 --> 00:22:51,394
Tomorrow, they'll bring us more food.
It's not a big deal.

319
00:22:51,394 --> 00:22:55,560
Dear, have you seen
what's going on down there?

320
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Even if they bring food tomorrow,
who would dare go out and get it?

321
00:23:04,376 --> 00:23:05,697
Are you going to volunteer?

322
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:09,807
Then what are we going to do?

323
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:14,174
I don't know. Just eat first.

324
00:23:28,854 --> 00:23:32,380
Anyone else out of food?
I'm all out.

325
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,001
I'd like to know if anyone is willing to
go get things from the minimart downstairs.

326
00:23:36,001 --> 00:23:37,926
I'll pay a reasonable hazard fee.

327
00:23:37,926 --> 00:23:39,607
If you're interested,
meet me in the lobby.

328
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,602
Someone opens the door for us.

329
00:23:45,602 --> 00:23:46,602
Hmm?

330
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:11,449
Wow, it seems like
a lot of people are out of food.

331
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:14,435
Well, I'm out of food, too.

332
00:24:14,435 --> 00:24:17,568
So I'd like to contribute a little.

333
00:24:17,568 --> 00:24:18,568
My room, too.

334
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:22,421
How much do I have to pay? Name it.

335
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:23,560
Who's willing to go out?

336
00:24:24,468 --> 00:24:26,374
So I can discuss the hazard pay properly.

337
00:24:32,223 --> 00:24:34,905
I'll go.

338
00:24:34,905 --> 00:24:35,905
I'll go too.

339
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,590
How much per person would be appropriate?

340
00:24:46,981 --> 00:24:48,289
We'll go too.

341
00:24:49,283 --> 00:24:50,720
Someone is desperate for money.

342
00:24:53,604 --> 00:24:56,560
As for your money, keep it.

343
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,989
We'll go get the food anyway.

344
00:25:01,879 --> 00:25:02,994
Wait a minute!

345
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:08,504
Leave the money. I want the money, too.

346
00:25:08,504 --> 00:25:11,876
It's okay. Someone has already volunteered
to go for free.

347
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,275
I've changed my mind.

348
00:25:15,207 --> 00:25:16,253
How much will you give us?

349
00:25:25,522 --> 00:25:26,661
Two thousand.

350
00:25:27,505 --> 00:25:28,908
It's just a short trip.

351
00:25:32,847 --> 00:25:33,847
One,

352
00:25:35,562 --> 00:25:36,806
two,

353
00:25:36,806 --> 00:25:37,806
three,

354
00:25:39,141 --> 00:25:40,141
and the rest.

355
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:42,344
Hey, you guys…
That's alright.

356
00:25:50,565 --> 00:25:52,245
This is all we have.

357
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:53,245
Six thousand?

358
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:56,303
I'll help out
with another two thousand.

359
00:25:56,303 --> 00:25:57,583
I want a share too.

360
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,073
How are we going to get out there?

361
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:14,855
There are infected people
all over the place.

362
00:26:20,268 --> 00:26:21,812
Let's go then. I'll lead the way.

363
00:26:23,092 --> 00:26:26,939
Just hurry up and do it. I've already paid.

364
00:26:26,939 --> 00:26:30,966
Yeah, hurry up. Don't dilly-dally.

365
00:26:33,482 --> 00:26:34,548
Maybe tomorrow?

366
00:26:39,697 --> 00:26:40,697
I have a plan.

367
00:26:42,115 --> 00:26:45,055
I'll lure them away first,
then you guys follow.

368
00:26:47,961 --> 00:26:48,994
Are you serious, Prach?

369
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,148
Can you open it?

370
00:27:47,148 --> 00:27:48,350
- Not yet.
- Maybe it's locked.

371
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:55,106
Are you done yet?

372
00:27:56,294 --> 00:28:00,231
This is too slow. Slower than the line
at the movie theater.

373
00:28:01,644 --> 00:28:03,905
Hey, hurry up, hurry up! Help me out here!

374
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,264
Hey, why are there so many of you?

375
00:28:33,264 --> 00:28:35,505
Hurry up! There are tons of them coming!

376
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:37,936
Where did everyone go?

377
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:40,900
Hurry up!

378
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,125
Here, I will strip naked for you.

379
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:43,745
Hey!

380
00:28:43,745 --> 00:28:45,478
Do you want a strip show or what?

381
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,420
Who is there?

382
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:37,174
If you don't come out, I'll shoot!

383
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,998
Please don't shoot me!

384
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,243
What are you doing here?

385
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:15,202
I… I'm just scared.

386
00:30:15,202 --> 00:30:17,515
There are infected people everywhere outside.

387
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:24,961
Are you hurt?

388
00:30:34,609 --> 00:30:36,771
The coast is clear, hurry up!

389
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:39,046
We have to go now! They'll be back soon.

390
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:40,517
Por, open the door!

391
00:30:40,517 --> 00:30:41,517
Por!

392
00:30:44,063 --> 00:30:44,906
Open it.

393
00:30:44,906 --> 00:30:46,174
Hurry!

394
00:30:46,174 --> 00:30:47,174
Come, quickly!

395
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,356
Get out of here! Go quickly!

396
00:30:54,356 --> 00:30:55,153
Don't touch!

397
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,840
Get out of here! Go!

398
00:30:59,496 --> 00:31:02,113
Oh, come on!
Why are there so many of them?

399
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:20,360
- Come in! Get inside!
- Open the door.

400
00:31:25,328 --> 00:31:26,328
What do we do now?

401
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:28,130
There are so many of them!

402
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,504
Go to the back door!

403
00:31:29,504 --> 00:31:31,193
- Quickly! Go on!
- Go ahead! Go!

404
00:31:31,193 --> 00:31:31,767
Go!
Let's go!

405
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:34,519
- Go quickly!
- Hurry!

406
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:35,879
Go, go, go!

407
00:31:48,434 --> 00:31:50,082
Run, get everyone back.

408
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:51,083
I'll handle this.

409
00:31:51,083 --> 00:31:52,083
Prach!

410
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,453
Prach!

411
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,329
Run, get everyone back inside.
I'll stay here with Prach.

412
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:03,080
Go on, everyone!

413
00:32:05,615 --> 00:32:06,087
Go!

414
00:32:06,087 --> 00:32:07,614
- What's next? Hurry.
- Go!

415
00:32:29,866 --> 00:32:30,866
Hurry!

416
00:32:31,691 --> 00:32:33,301
Come on. Hurry up.

417
00:32:44,449 --> 00:32:45,449
Hurry!

418
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,637
Dr. Beam!

419
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,569
Hurry up!

420
00:33:06,665 --> 00:33:07,720
Dr. Beam, come on.

421
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,720
- Let's go!
- Quickly!

422
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,523
Hurry up!

423
00:33:10,523 --> 00:33:12,968
Open the door! We're back! Quickly!

424
00:33:14,607 --> 00:33:15,720
Hurry up, open the door!

425
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,544
Open the door!

426
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:18,894
- Open the door, please!
- Open the door! Open it quickly!

427
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:20,517
- Open it! Now!
- Open up.

428
00:33:20,517 --> 00:33:22,480
We got a lot of stuff.

429
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,065
- Open it! Quickly!
- Open the door, please!

430
00:33:25,065 --> 00:33:26,360
We got a lot of stuff.

431
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,777
Open up, quickly!

432
00:33:27,777 --> 00:33:28,670
Hurry up!

433
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,760
- Open up, now!
- Open it!

434
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,350
- Wow, that's a lot of stuff.
- Hurry up!

435
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:32,619
Open the door, Auntie!

436
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:35,674
You guys, leave the stuff there,
and go wherever you want.

437
00:33:35,674 --> 00:33:36,990
Yeah, get out of here.

438
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:39,141
Are you crazy? Open the door!

439
00:33:39,141 --> 00:33:40,757
Open the door, Auntie! Quickly!

440
00:33:40,757 --> 00:33:42,224
- Oh, wait a minute!
- What are you saying?

441
00:33:42,224 --> 00:33:44,304
How do we know
that you're not infected?

442
00:33:44,304 --> 00:33:45,552
- Yeah.
- Right.

443
00:33:45,552 --> 00:33:48,320
I can't let you in.
Once you're out, you're out.

444
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,082
- Yeah.
- We're not infected.

445
00:33:50,082 --> 00:33:53,080
You already got your hazard pay.
What else do you want? Just go.

446
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,101
Is this a joke to you?

447
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:56,610
Is a human life
only worth two thousand baht?

448
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:57,742
- Please open the door.
- Open it!

449
00:33:57,742 --> 00:33:58,880
Don't bother.

450
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,344
Move! What's the big deal?

451
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,911
You're not going to open it, are you?
Not opening?

452
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:05,572
Remember this?

453
00:34:05,572 --> 00:34:08,794
Remember how this tastes? Huh?

454
00:34:08,794 --> 00:34:10,266
If you don't open it,
you don't get to eat!

455
00:34:10,266 --> 00:34:11,533
- Hey, what are you doing?
- You'll have nothing!

456
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:13,600
Hey! Don't you dare!

457
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:16,836
You don't get to eat it!

458
00:34:16,836 --> 00:34:18,755
Hey! Guys, the infected are coming! Quickly!

459
00:34:18,755 --> 00:34:22,505
- Hurry up! Open the door!
- Open it quickly!

460
00:34:22,505 --> 00:34:25,020
No way! I can't open it!

461
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,545
- Give me that!
- What are you doing?

462
00:34:26,545 --> 00:34:28,849
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

463
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:31,400
If we get infected, everyone will die!
You'll be responsible!

464
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,695
Then we all die!
No one will be responsible!

465
00:34:33,695 --> 00:34:36,349
The infected are coming! Open up now?
They are coming!

466
00:34:38,737 --> 00:34:40,703
Go quickly! Go, go, go!

467
00:34:43,118 --> 00:34:44,715
The rage people are coming!

468
00:35:01,096 --> 00:35:02,874
You guys are so selfish.

469
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:14,450
So what?

470
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,450
Wait!

471
00:35:19,616 --> 00:35:21,568
- Let go!
- Don't take it all! Let me have some.

472
00:35:21,568 --> 00:35:22,832
We deserve this.

473
00:35:22,832 --> 00:35:24,684
- Don't fight, everyone.
- Take this one.

474
00:35:24,684 --> 00:35:27,370
- Don't fight over it, guys!
- Wait!

475
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,371
Stop it!

476
00:35:28,371 --> 00:35:30,084
Don't fight over it! Don't fight!

477
00:35:30,084 --> 00:35:32,222
- Don't fight, everyone!
- Calm down!

478
00:35:32,222 --> 00:35:33,572
- Open up!
- Don't fight over it!

479
00:35:33,572 --> 00:35:35,212
Open the door, please!

480
00:35:35,212 --> 00:35:37,200
Don't open it! Stop!

481
00:35:37,913 --> 00:35:39,098
Don't open it!

482
00:36:04,114 --> 00:36:05,114
Yoshi, come on.

483
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:06,832
Hey!

484
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:08,743
- Everyone, calm down!
- Wait!

485
00:36:08,743 --> 00:36:10,096
- Please give me something!
- Wait!

486
00:36:10,096 --> 00:36:10,888
Wait!

487
00:36:10,888 --> 00:36:12,604
- Please, I only got a little.
- Hold on.

488
00:36:12,604 --> 00:36:13,506
Wait!

489
00:36:13,506 --> 00:36:14,920
- Give it to me first.
- Yoshi, take it.

490
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:17,216
Don't fight over it!
Everyone, calm down!

491
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:18,216
Put it down!

492
00:36:21,172 --> 00:36:22,252
Stop it right now!

493
00:36:23,246 --> 00:36:25,417
And put all the food back in there.

494
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:28,659
Now!

495
00:36:28,659 --> 00:36:30,839
I said put all the food back in there!

496
00:36:50,218 --> 00:36:53,776
And all of you,
go back to your own rooms.

497
00:36:54,483 --> 00:36:57,196
As for the food,
I'll distribute it to you guys.

498
00:36:58,842 --> 00:37:02,004
You can divide it equally among the others,

499
00:37:02,004 --> 00:37:05,708
but I paid the most,
so my room should get the most.

500
00:37:05,708 --> 00:37:07,379
- That's right.
- Yeah!

501
00:37:07,379 --> 00:37:09,973
I also paid. I should get the food.

502
00:37:09,973 --> 00:37:11,457
If you didn't pay, you don't get any.

503
00:37:12,077 --> 00:37:13,640
How can you say that, Tattep?

504
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,520
- Why not?
- It's true. I paid, so I should get more.

505
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,441
- Yeah.
- We live together, so we have to share--

506
00:37:19,476 --> 00:37:24,431
All of these foods,
we risked our lives to get it for you.

507
00:37:24,431 --> 00:37:27,520
So we have the right
to distribute it however we want.

508
00:37:28,465 --> 00:37:31,808
If you're not happy with that, go ahead!

509
00:37:32,731 --> 00:37:34,901
Go get the food yourselves!

510
00:37:34,901 --> 00:37:39,804
And more importantly,
your money means nothing

511
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:41,425
compared to your lives!

512
00:37:42,709 --> 00:37:47,746
And this food, I promise
I'll distribute it equally among you.

513
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,658
Thank you very much.

514
00:38:10,968 --> 00:38:14,398
Net, I have a small favor to ask.

515
00:38:14,398 --> 00:38:16,933
I saw that your room is quite spacious,

516
00:38:16,933 --> 00:38:19,880
so I was wondering if it would be okay
for Aim to stay with you.

517
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,915
Of course, it's fine…

518
00:38:21,915 --> 00:38:22,934
It's not convenient.

519
00:38:26,158 --> 00:38:27,320
We still have plenty of space in our room--

520
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,030
There are already three people
in our room.

521
00:38:30,232 --> 00:38:31,468
Including Rangrong.

522
00:38:34,057 --> 00:38:36,288
Three people,
we should get three bags.

523
00:38:47,319 --> 00:38:49,060
Here, I brought you the food.

524
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,200
Thank you.

525
00:38:52,846 --> 00:38:57,205
Mrs. Jintana, would it be alright
if Aim stayed with you?

526
00:38:57,205 --> 00:38:58,303
Would that be convenient?

527
00:38:58,303 --> 00:38:59,377
Aim…

528
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,552
the kind cashier?

529
00:39:02,552 --> 00:39:03,552
Yes.

530
00:39:17,315 --> 00:39:20,686
Aim, weren't you scared being out there alone?

531
00:39:24,471 --> 00:39:25,494
How did you survive?

532
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:28,788
Aim, I'm going home now.

533
00:39:28,788 --> 00:39:30,400
Can you wait for Ked to replace you?

534
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,400
Bye-bye.

535
00:39:46,902 --> 00:39:50,674
See? The world needs to know.
We have to do something.

536
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:03,900
If they won't say anything, then we have to.

537
00:40:05,244 --> 00:40:06,601
Let's make some content.

538
00:40:11,111 --> 00:40:14,025
No. I don't want any trouble.

539
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:15,320
You can make money from it, Aim.

540
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:21,204
If you do this with me,
this content will be a hit.

541
00:40:21,204 --> 00:40:22,377
Really?

542
00:40:22,377 --> 00:40:26,625
Of course, Aim. Just imagine,
if a million people watch it,

543
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:28,290
how much money will we make?

544
00:40:29,744 --> 00:40:32,323
We just have to go out and film one clip,

545
00:40:32,323 --> 00:40:35,218
just for a moment,
and then post it online.

546
00:40:35,218 --> 00:40:39,676
People can watch our clip,
and the money will keep rolling in.

547
00:40:39,676 --> 00:40:40,840
It's so simple.

548
00:40:43,266 --> 00:40:46,960
Simple and easy work.

549
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:48,946
Aren't you interested?

550
00:40:57,364 --> 00:40:58,526
- Where are you?
- Jeu.

551
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:04,729
Jeu, where are you?

552
00:41:07,277 --> 00:41:08,290
Jeu?

553
00:41:14,328 --> 00:41:15,570
Jeu, is that you?

554
00:41:16,984 --> 00:41:18,291
Is it you, Jeu?

555
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,983
Come here.

556
00:41:26,983 --> 00:41:27,983
Jeu!

557
00:41:30,057 --> 00:41:31,747
Jeu, there's blood!

558
00:41:31,747 --> 00:41:33,969
- What blood?
- What's wrong with you, Jeu?

559
00:41:33,969 --> 00:41:34,665
What?

560
00:41:34,665 --> 00:41:36,597
What happened to you?
You're bleeding!

561
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,136
My nose is bleeding.

562
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,796
And what are you doing here?

563
00:41:43,796 --> 00:41:45,960
I came to find the cat.

564
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,783
Did you find it? I'm scared.

565
00:41:47,783 --> 00:41:52,883
Not yet, but I remember I let it out
right here last night.

566
00:41:53,739 --> 00:41:56,700
This is not the time to worry about a cat.
We're supposed to be in our rooms.

567
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,000
Look at you now!

568
00:41:59,105 --> 00:42:02,000
Clean it up. I want to get back now.
I'm really scared, Jeu.

569
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,079
Hurry up.

570
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:04,405
- Okay.
- Hurry and clean it up.

571
00:42:13,616 --> 00:42:15,094
Jeu, what do we do now?

572
00:42:20,682 --> 00:42:23,109
- Go!
- Jeu, close it quickly!

573
00:42:23,861 --> 00:42:25,453
I told you not to come down here, didn't I?

574
00:42:25,453 --> 00:42:26,517
- Go!
- It's all because of you.

575
00:42:26,517 --> 00:42:28,246
We can talk later. Just go.

576
00:42:28,998 --> 00:42:32,767
Just now, when I was in the minimart,

577
00:42:32,767 --> 00:42:37,058
I saw… something that looked like…

578
00:42:37,058 --> 00:42:38,442
Aim, wait a minute.

579
00:42:38,442 --> 00:42:41,532
Your tone doesn't seem scared enough.
Can you bring it up a bit?

580
00:42:41,532 --> 00:42:43,403
Make it vivid, so people can picture it.

581
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:45,381
Try again.

582
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:46,792
Continue.

583
00:42:46,792 --> 00:42:48,915
What I saw…

584
00:42:48,915 --> 00:42:51,952
It looked like…

585
00:42:52,712 --> 00:42:55,740
like it wasn't human at all.

586
00:43:00,575 --> 00:43:01,576
Hey!

587
00:43:01,576 --> 00:43:03,279
It's fine.

588
00:43:03,279 --> 00:43:04,450
Can you move a little closer?

589
00:43:05,998 --> 00:43:07,282
A little bit more.

590
00:43:07,282 --> 00:43:08,283
Right there.

591
00:43:08,283 --> 00:43:10,703
And when you're telling the story,
I need some tears.

592
00:43:13,273 --> 00:43:14,274
Let's try again.

593
00:43:14,274 --> 00:43:15,239
Continue, okay?
- Hey!
- Give me that.

594
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:20,059
This isn't right.

595
00:43:20,059 --> 00:43:22,014
We don't have any information
about this yet.

596
00:43:22,014 --> 00:43:25,450
If this video gets out, it will scare people
and cause misunderstandings.

597
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:26,998
- Give me back my phone.
- I won't.

598
00:43:28,725 --> 00:43:31,180
If you want it back,
you have to promise me that

599
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,181
you won't spread misinformation like this.

600
00:43:32,181 --> 00:43:33,805
Beam, what are you doing?
Give me back my phone.

601
00:43:33,805 --> 00:43:34,805
No.

602
00:43:36,968 --> 00:43:39,424
Fine! I won't post it.

603
00:43:39,424 --> 00:43:40,509
Give me back my phone!

604
00:43:42,525 --> 00:43:43,525
Are you sure?

605
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,538
Yes.

606
00:43:50,344 --> 00:43:51,466
Let's go, Aim.

607
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:17,403
How about that?
I told you to stay in the room.

608
00:44:17,403 --> 00:44:19,593
You almost got bitten to death,
didn't you?

609
00:44:19,593 --> 00:44:21,544
Alright. I'm sorry, okay?

610
00:44:26,308 --> 00:44:28,481
What's wrong with your back?
Why is it bleeding?

611
00:44:28,481 --> 00:44:29,481
Huh?

612
00:44:31,391 --> 00:44:32,391
Let me see.

613
00:44:34,466 --> 00:44:35,737
You've been scratched!

614
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:39,062
Am I going to turn into
one of those rage people?

615
00:44:40,934 --> 00:44:42,371
Are you going to bite me?

616
00:44:48,536 --> 00:44:50,091
When did this happen?

617
00:44:51,683 --> 00:44:53,908
Calm down. Stay calm.

618
00:44:55,503 --> 00:44:57,374
I have an idea.

619
00:44:57,374 --> 00:44:59,230
Follow me. Quickly!

620
00:45:00,304 --> 00:45:02,525
Come on, hurry up.

621
00:45:05,167 --> 00:45:06,774
Before things get any worse,

622
00:45:06,774 --> 00:45:10,031
we need to find out
who's working with the trainer.

623
00:45:12,148 --> 00:45:14,320
It has to be someone in this condo.

624
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,880
Good. You're working your back muscles.

625
00:45:18,455 --> 00:45:21,684
If we find out, we might be able
to track down the mastermind.

626
00:46:34,968 --> 00:46:37,600
In case there are infected
hiding in the condo…

627
00:46:49,102 --> 00:46:53,249
Director, we found the trainer
who was suspected to be infected.

628
00:46:53,249 --> 00:46:54,249
He's dead.

629
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:58,063
And we still haven't found the trainer.

630
00:46:58,063 --> 00:46:59,063
Clear everything out.

631
00:46:59,818 --> 00:47:00,985
Dispose of the body.

632
00:47:08,557 --> 00:47:11,233
You knew all along
that the trainer was dead, didn't you?

633
00:47:11,233 --> 00:47:12,233
Yes.

634
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,788
So you lied to us?

635
00:47:15,788 --> 00:47:16,908
I didn't lie.

636
00:47:17,978 --> 00:47:20,945
I just didn't think you needed to know

637
00:47:20,945 --> 00:47:22,697
because even if you did,

638
00:47:22,697 --> 00:47:24,940
you wouldn't be able to
investigate further through Hack.

639
00:47:25,795 --> 00:47:29,274
You should focus on more likely leads.

640
00:48:03,281 --> 00:48:04,681
Where are you taking me?

641
00:48:05,414 --> 00:48:06,414
You'll see.

642
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:11,309
Come here.

643
00:48:27,661 --> 00:48:31,342
I think you should stay on this floor for now.
No one should follow you up here.

644
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:33,815
Can you stay here?

645
00:48:34,795 --> 00:48:36,606
Do you really want me to stay here?

646
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:44,979
If I don't transform tonight,
it means I'm safe.

647
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,593
Then I guess I can stay here.

648
00:48:51,347 --> 00:48:54,319
And you, hurry back downstairs now.

649
00:48:55,252 --> 00:48:57,681
And tomorrow,
knock on the emergency exit door.

650
00:48:58,979 --> 00:49:01,401
How will you know if it's me knocking?

651
00:49:03,428 --> 00:49:05,677
I guess you could knock
in a three-beat rhythm.

652
00:49:05,677 --> 00:49:07,169
You're still joking around.

653
00:49:07,169 --> 00:49:10,513
If I'm still okay tomorrow,
you can get me out of here.

654
00:49:10,513 --> 00:49:14,904
But if I turn into one of those rage people,
run away immediately, understand?

655
00:49:16,176 --> 00:49:17,313
Do you understand?

656
00:49:17,313 --> 00:49:18,939
Is that what you want?

657
00:49:18,939 --> 00:49:19,974
You can go now.

658
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:22,370
Okay.

659
00:49:37,390 --> 00:49:39,288
Where are you planning to go?

660
00:49:41,115 --> 00:49:42,757
To get closer to those people, of course.

661
00:49:49,741 --> 00:49:51,096
Can we not do this?

662
00:49:53,133 --> 00:49:56,725
Come on, Aim, help me out.
My camera can't zoom in on those people.

663
00:49:56,725 --> 00:49:58,189
We have to get closer.

664
00:49:59,234 --> 00:50:02,139
It will be fine, I promise.
I'm sure this video will be a hit.

665
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:46,840
Aim, it's gone.

666
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,411
I think that's enough.

667
00:50:49,411 --> 00:50:51,678
Just a little more.
The viewers want this.

668
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:55,601
Just a little bit more, it'll be fine.

669
00:51:20,851 --> 00:51:21,851
Shit!

670
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:32,270
Come on.

671
00:51:35,293 --> 00:51:36,293
Go stand over there.

672
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,460
Go on.

673
00:51:41,427 --> 00:51:42,427
Do it.

674
00:51:44,553 --> 00:51:50,693
Well… I normally work as a cashier
at the minimart in The Breathe Condo.

675
00:51:51,454 --> 00:51:52,541
And…

676
00:51:52,541 --> 00:51:53,848
Aim, hold on.

677
00:51:53,848 --> 00:51:55,044
That's not good.

678
00:51:55,044 --> 00:51:56,044
Move a little closer.

679
00:51:57,424 --> 00:51:58,067
Right there.
That's enough.

680
00:51:58,863 --> 00:51:59,863
Go further.

681
00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:02,310
Right there.

682
00:52:03,335 --> 00:52:04,335
Continue, continue.

683
00:52:05,066 --> 00:52:11,882
And… suddenly, a group of people came
and closed off the condo.

684
00:52:11,882 --> 00:52:15,878
At first, I wasn't sure…

685
00:52:16,581 --> 00:52:17,360
You have to move closer.
What?

686
00:52:18,189 --> 00:52:19,189
Move closer.

687
00:52:21,621 --> 00:52:22,688
Yeah,

688
00:52:22,688 --> 00:52:23,688
closer, closer.

689
00:52:29,301 --> 00:52:30,301
Closer.

690
00:52:33,281 --> 00:52:34,281
Keep talking.

691
00:52:39,174 --> 00:52:45,352
Until I saw a group of people. They…

692
00:52:45,352 --> 00:52:46,352
looked like…

693
00:52:48,825 --> 00:52:50,341
Jee, where are you going?

694
00:52:50,341 --> 00:52:51,341
Keep talking.

695
00:52:52,466 --> 00:52:53,466
Come on, Aim.

696
00:52:54,586 --> 00:52:57,758
I saw a group of people. They looked like…

697
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,875
like… those…

698
00:52:59,875 --> 00:53:01,578
Aim, the infected saw us.

699
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:11,377
Don't walk away! Stay there!

700
00:53:56,440 --> 00:53:57,712
[Next Episode]

701
00:53:57,712 --> 00:53:58,713
What is it?

702
00:53:58,713 --> 00:54:01,641
I saw Jeu and Fah being chased
and bitten by the infected.

703
00:54:08,188 --> 00:54:10,608
Why are you so focused on that condo?

704
00:54:10,608 --> 00:54:12,293
Because it's highly likely that

705
00:54:12,293 --> 00:54:13,995
the source of the drug distribution
is in that condo.

706
00:54:13,995 --> 00:54:16,287
Dr. Beam is a suspect.

707
00:54:16,287 --> 00:54:18,608
Because he's a doctor,
he must have knowledge of medicine.

708
00:54:18,608 --> 00:54:20,243
I'll go check on Prach.

709
00:54:20,243 --> 00:54:23,610
He could be the one distributing the drug,
and he might even be the one producing it.

710
00:54:24,855 --> 00:54:27,233
Then, increase the control measures
to the next level.
