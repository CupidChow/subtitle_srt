00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:12,368
[This series is a work of fiction.
All characters, locations, and events are entirely fabricated.]

2
00:00:12,368 --> 00:00:13,748
Tao!

3
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:15,579
Tao, wake up! Wake up right now!

4
00:00:15,579 --> 00:00:18,206
You two killed an innocent person, right?

5
00:00:18,206 --> 00:00:20,870
I assure you… that I didn't kill Uncle Tao.

6
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,178
And neither of us fired a single shot.

7
00:00:23,178 --> 00:00:26,681
You two are making us feel unsafe.

8
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:34,791
If you want to know anything or
have any questions, just ask.

9
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:36,002
Don't hesitate.

10
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:39,675
You have to get that old lady
to sign over everything to you.

11
00:00:39,675 --> 00:00:42,193
And we have to make So disappear.

12
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,939
If So dies because of the infected,

13
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:46,352
it'll seem perfectly normal.

14
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:49,681
Yoshi?

15
00:00:49,681 --> 00:00:50,231
Get out.

16
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:51,410
I said get out.

17
00:00:53,352 --> 00:00:54,352
Yoshi.

18
00:00:58,645 --> 00:01:00,618
No, please don't.

19
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:02,259
I'm the victim here.

20
00:01:04,268 --> 00:01:05,747
Just pay me.

21
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,091
Come in, quickly.

22
00:01:11,231 --> 00:01:12,233
It's my fault.

23
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:13,768
I shouldn't have helped you
destroy the evidence.

24
00:01:13,768 --> 00:01:16,108
Hey! What the hell are you talking about?

25
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:17,825
You evil bitch! You liar!

26
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:21,286
Then can you help me find him?

27
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:22,343
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:25,427 --> 00:01:27,378
Yoshi definitely didn't kill Hack.

29
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:30,229
I think Sophida is setting Yoshi up
to take the fall.

30
00:01:30,229 --> 00:01:32,838
But if he let Sophida out there
to be bitten by the infected,

31
00:01:32,838 --> 00:01:35,454
we can't rule him out as an accomplice.

32
00:01:36,573 --> 00:01:38,287
Did you think I was too stupid to notice?

33
00:01:39,885 --> 00:01:41,015
I can accept it

34
00:01:41,015 --> 00:01:42,674
if my Yoshi

35
00:01:42,674 --> 00:01:43,865
becomes a murderer.

36
00:01:45,284 --> 00:01:47,140
Yoshi, no.

37
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:55,977
Shoot her! I said shoot her!

38
00:01:55,977 --> 00:01:57,231
Damn it!

39
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:20,023
[Happiness]

40
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,560
You don't want to manage it?

41
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,160
You're expecting me to do it all alone?

42
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,760
You don't have to take on any cases.

43
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,200
Just the management side of things.

44
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,920
What research project are you working on?

45
00:03:50,256 --> 00:03:51,920
So you must need a lab?

46
00:03:53,806 --> 00:03:55,711
I'll set up a lab for you.

47
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:58,120
Where have you been the past few days?
Where are you now?

48
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,440
Can I come see you?

49
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:02,440
We don't have to put a label on it.

50
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,840
Please… don't be mad at me.

51
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,240
I just want to be near you and help you out.

52
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
That's all I want.

53
00:04:16,486 --> 00:04:20,120
I'll do anything for you. I was wrong, So.
I've made a mistake, So.

54
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,600
Don't beg her.

55
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,560
Lovers should be together, right?

56
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,600
So. So, I'll do anything to be with you.

57
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,480
Do you even know what
it means to "do anything"?

58
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,160
You have no idea what it means
to do anything for someone.

59
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,120
Why would you say that?

60
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,385
I just want to see your face.

61
00:04:42,385 --> 00:04:46,705
I just wish I could be near you
and help with everything.

62
00:04:57,895 --> 00:04:59,000
Thank you so much.

63
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,800
I can keep secrets, no matter what they are.

64
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:39,760
Especially if it's your dream,
I'll do anything to help you.

65
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Stop!

66
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Uncle Tao!

67
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Tao!

68
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,360
Tao!

69
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:02,693
[It just so happens that I filmed it. I won't tell anyone, if
you cover my medical expenses. Say, 200,000 or 300,000 baht.]

70
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,560
You two are making us feel unsafe.

71
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,880
That's right.

72
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:29,120
So. So, please let me go.

73
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,480
- So, I'll do anything for you.
- Stop pleading with her!

74
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,360
If you're not going to help, then shut up!

75
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,594
Just admit it! She's not going to let us go.

76
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,000
I told you to shut up!

77
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
What are you afraid of?

78
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,240
You're not dying alone.

79
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,560
If you want to die, then die alone!

80
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,507
Damn it!

81
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:53,680
So. So. So. So.

82
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,184
So. So.

83
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:58,680
Let go of me!

84
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
Inspector.

85
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,345
Can you hear me?

86
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:15,926
Inspector?

87
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,840
Hello? Yes?

88
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,520
Inspector?

89
00:08:36,718 --> 00:08:37,720
Run?

90
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,429
Yes?

91
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:41,115
I just heard someone in here.

92
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay.

93
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,200
This is Run.

94
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,915
Run… is the Inspector there?

95
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:53,192
He's not here. You can talk to me.

96
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:03,206
Or do you have something to say about me?

97
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,394
The research team…

98
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,091
I'll get back to you.

99
00:09:22,041 --> 00:09:24,720
Lock the door.
Don't open it for anyone except for me.

100
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,000
Okay.

101
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Run.

102
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
Stop!

103
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:09,443
Are you okay?

104
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:46,098
Run?

105
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
Are you alright?

106
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,840
You weren't bitten, right?

107
00:11:58,942 --> 00:11:59,942
No.

108
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:02,486
It's probably blood from that infected man.

109
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:50,276
Is this Grandma Jin's food?

110
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,840
Yes.

111
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,893
Jin always prepared it.

112
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,509
After what happened,

113
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:02,498
I realized

114
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:05,421
it wasn't easy for her to
prepare food for me and Jee,

115
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,120
and also take care
of the apartment.

116
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:10,591
It's not easy.

117
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:14,216
So I decided that
if there's anything I can do for her,

118
00:13:15,214 --> 00:13:17,007
I'll do my best…

119
00:13:18,163 --> 00:13:21,841
because I don't know how much time…

120
00:13:23,048 --> 00:13:24,605
we have left together.

121
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,194
I'm sorry…

122
00:13:30,551 --> 00:13:32,681
for separating you two that day.

123
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,951
Find a room and seal them inside.

124
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:40,976
- Alright?
- What?

125
00:13:40,976 --> 00:13:42,960
Before she transforms, hurry and restrain her.

126
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
No. Don't.
- No!
- No!

127
00:13:44,928 --> 00:13:46,480
- No!
- Quarantine her!

128
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,760
- Just take her. What are you waiting for?
- No!

129
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,497
It's in the past now.
Let's not bring it up again.

130
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:14,600
After Tao died,

131
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:21,596
I realized how much it hurts
to be apart from the one you love.

132
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,686
I shouldn't have said those things.

133
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:30,569
I'm really sorry, Chan. I'm truly sorry.

134
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,970
It's okay.

135
00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:48,189
You know,

136
00:14:51,501 --> 00:14:53,121
I have to give you credit

137
00:14:54,341 --> 00:14:55,808
for coming to see me today.

138
00:14:56,948 --> 00:15:00,000
You're doing a great job
as the condo manager.

139
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,215
This is what it means
to truly care for the residents.

140
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:20,797
I can feel it.

141
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,360
Thank you.

142
00:15:34,607 --> 00:15:37,013
Right. Where's Jee?

143
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:39,519
Is he playing games in his room?

144
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:42,107
That kid…

145
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:45,000
He's so stubborn.

146
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,463
Not sure why he's sulking,
but he ran off again.

147
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:53,760
He shouldn't be going out alone
right now, Grandpa Chan.

148
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,128
I know,

149
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,522
but I can't stop him. That kid…

150
00:17:14,052 --> 00:17:18,640
This is the evidence that proves
Sophida killed Hack and Uncle Tao.

151
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,409
There's more here
than what was in Hack's locker.

152
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,440
Yes,

153
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,678
but it's all the same drug,
just in different packaging.

154
00:17:51,678 --> 00:17:54,240
Both the drugs and
the deaths of Hack and Uncle Tao…

155
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,893
Sophida is definitely more than just
a drug distributor.

156
00:17:59,357 --> 00:18:03,558
And then there's the infected person we just
encountered, who's different from the others.

157
00:18:07,164 --> 00:18:08,960
What could be her motive?

158
00:18:09,886 --> 00:18:11,102
Sophida…

159
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,720
She must want something

160
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,710
more than just killing people.

161
00:18:18,111 --> 00:18:19,353
There has to be something else.

162
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:21,071
What else?

163
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:22,846
A cure.

164
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,000
There might be a cure. We have to look for it.

165
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,681
You think Sophida would keep it here?

166
00:18:40,808 --> 00:18:42,024
Financial documents.

167
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,503
The bullets used to kill Uncle Tao.

168
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,013
I feel so relieved.

169
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,662
Here you go. You want this, right?

170
00:19:13,662 --> 00:19:15,243
You want it. Take it, take it.

171
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:20,960
Here, smell it.

172
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,077
It smells so good.

173
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:26,480
This one is mine.

174
00:19:28,128 --> 00:19:29,256
This one's good too.

175
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:32,440
I wonder how Ohn is doing.

176
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:36,727
I hope he escaped safely
and wasn't bitten to death by the infected.

177
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,604
But it's okay. It used to be a
three-way split, but now it's just two.

178
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:49,741
Here, here.

179
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,400
- I… I'm starting to feel uneasy.
- It smells so good.

180
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,000
Should we… return these?

181
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What?

182
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,209
Now you want to be a good person?

183
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:05,080
- I only did it because we had to.
- Such a good person.

184
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,400
Right, it was necessary.

185
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,240
We really need these.

186
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:15,300
I meant food. In this situation,
food is what's necessary.

187
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:17,338
That's right.

188
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,255
Right now, we're like hungry little kids.

189
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:24,673
But I'm not hungry for an iPad.

190
00:20:24,673 --> 00:20:26,240
I'm not hungry for a laptop.

191
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:33,320
And what if Dr. Beam keeps
investigating and calls the cops on us?

192
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,171
I guess that's your problem then.

193
00:20:35,171 --> 00:20:37,813
I don't know. I think I'll return these.

194
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,760
Go ahead, return them.
This is your share… This is yours.

195
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,599
And this is all mine.

196
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,731
Return them, Miss Goody Two-shoes.

197
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,900
You're a good person who's poor… Very poor.

198
00:20:54,175 --> 00:20:57,240
Congrats on going broke again.

199
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,519
Grandma Jin, have you seen Jee?

200
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,195
He hasn't come to see me.

201
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,935
Maybe he's secretly filming the infected.

202
00:21:06,935 --> 00:21:08,012
I don't think so.

203
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,240
Jee doesn't usually go anywhere alone.

204
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,280
Chan?

205
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:19,294
Did you say something to Jee
that made him run away again?

206
00:21:19,294 --> 00:21:21,098
I didn't say anything to him.

207
00:21:21,612 --> 00:21:23,161
Don't worry about him.

208
00:21:23,161 --> 00:21:27,210
He can't go far.
He'll come back when he's hungry.

209
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,080
Oh my.

210
00:21:37,777 --> 00:21:38,967
Is something wrong?

211
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:42,447
I found this bag in the trash.

212
00:21:42,447 --> 00:21:46,888
I heard that your room was robbed,
so I brought it back.

213
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:49,535
I mean, I came to ask if this is yours.

214
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,723
- Thank you.
- Sure.

215
00:21:55,722 --> 00:21:57,480
These are actually mine.

216
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,050
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

217
00:22:00,397 --> 00:22:02,889
But there's still a lot missing.

218
00:22:04,814 --> 00:22:08,105
If I find anything else, I'll bring it to you.

219
00:22:08,907 --> 00:22:10,232
- Thank you.
- Of course.

220
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:12,895
Wait.

221
00:22:17,689 --> 00:22:19,906
Do you have enough food
in the janitor room?

222
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:21,200
You can get some from me.

223
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,522
It's… It's enough. We're okay.
I'll be going now.

224
00:22:27,185 --> 00:22:28,497
Do you want me to walk you down?

225
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,760
No need. I came alone, I can go back alone.

226
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,720
- I'm a grown-up. You don't have to walk me.
- I can walk you down.

227
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,840
No need. You should rest, Doctor.
Get plenty of rest.

228
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,200
- I'll be going now.
- Okay.

229
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,874
I'm going.

230
00:22:48,605 --> 00:22:50,886
You're looking for Sophida in this room?

231
00:22:53,923 --> 00:22:56,903
We have nothing to do with Sophida.

232
00:22:57,926 --> 00:22:59,494
We also have something to tell you.

233
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:02,194
Just say it.

234
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:11,070
We witnessed the murders of Rangrong and Yoshi,

235
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,101
and Sophida was involved.

236
00:23:15,747 --> 00:23:17,096
Rangrong is dead?

237
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:28,687
Sophida couldn't have killed them.

238
00:23:28,687 --> 00:23:31,692
Yoshi was very close to her.

239
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,506
You should be careful around Sophida.

240
00:23:37,575 --> 00:23:39,608
Thank you for letting us know.

241
00:23:53,719 --> 00:23:54,984
I'm sorry.

242
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,760
Even if I didn't want her here,

243
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,509
I don't want to see anyone die.

244
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,118
From now on,

245
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,486
don't go anywhere alone.

246
00:24:07,486 --> 00:24:09,704
If anything happens, tell me first.

247
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,806
You know how much I care about you.

248
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,978
You should worry about yourself
like you always do.

249
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:27,800
I'm fine now, and I'm relieved.

250
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,208
I'll be going now.

251
00:25:26,452 --> 00:25:28,928
What's going on? I heard gunshots.

252
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:31,599
Sophida killed Yoshi and Rangrong.

253
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,318
And it seems like she can control the infected.

254
00:25:35,318 --> 00:25:38,315
Those infected people
can barely control themselves.

255
00:25:38,315 --> 00:25:40,138
How can Sophida do that?

256
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:43,040
That's what we need to find out.

257
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,838
But we still haven't found her.

258
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:47,815
We don't know what else she's planning.

259
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,548
Inspector?

260
00:25:52,478 --> 00:25:53,480
Inspector?

261
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,480
I hear you.

262
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,482
Inspector…

263
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:56,693
Is Run with you?

264
00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:02,234
This is Run.

265
00:26:02,234 --> 00:26:04,396
You want to pick up where we left off, right?

266
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,398
Run,

267
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:08,136
I want you to come back
to the quarantine center right away.

268
00:26:08,136 --> 00:26:10,648
Our research team has discovered that

269
00:26:10,648 --> 00:26:14,329
your blood can create antibodies
for the infected and cure them.

270
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:15,604
Are you sure?

271
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,001
The research confirms it with 100% certainty.

272
00:26:26,764 --> 00:26:28,307
Okay, I'll be there right away…

273
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:30,560
but I have a condition.

274
00:26:31,391 --> 00:26:32,138
What do you want?

275
00:26:32,138 --> 00:26:33,518
I want you to turn on the water and electricity

276
00:26:33,518 --> 00:26:35,160
and restore the phone service.

277
00:26:36,275 --> 00:26:37,277
I can only give you

278
00:26:37,277 --> 00:26:39,121
water and electricity.

279
00:26:39,121 --> 00:26:40,968
Come to the quarantine center so we can handle

280
00:26:40,968 --> 00:26:42,706
the antibody situation first.

281
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,900
Are you ready?

282
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,900
Yeah.

283
00:27:39,196 --> 00:27:40,609
Let's go.

284
00:27:40,609 --> 00:27:41,609
Clear.

285
00:27:58,652 --> 00:28:00,579
Go away. Go!

286
00:28:01,216 --> 00:28:02,216
Let's go.

287
00:28:15,704 --> 00:28:16,704
Come on.

288
00:28:34,723 --> 00:28:35,723
Let's go.

289
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:42,208
Why didn't I ask them for help?

290
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,760
Hey!

291
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,495
Hey! Come back and help me!

292
00:28:47,361 --> 00:28:48,399
Hey!

293
00:28:55,015 --> 00:28:56,109
Hey!

294
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:49,821
Go, Run.

295
00:29:52,886 --> 00:29:54,000
Go.

296
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,173
Open the gate!

297
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:04,363
I made a deal with your boss that
when I arrived,

298
00:30:04,363 --> 00:30:07,148
you had to turn the water and electricity
back on for everyone in the condo.

299
00:30:07,148 --> 00:30:08,187
I understand,

300
00:30:08,187 --> 00:30:11,602
but the Director will only do that
once you're at the quarantine center.

301
00:30:15,415 --> 00:30:17,293
So many conditions?

302
00:30:17,293 --> 00:30:18,692
Then hurry up and take me there.

303
00:30:24,613 --> 00:30:25,613
Wait.

304
00:30:26,796 --> 00:30:28,292
We can only take Run.

305
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:31,904
As for you…

306
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
No way.

307
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,906
I won't let Run go alone.

308
00:30:37,906 --> 00:30:40,594
I have to go with her,
and we will come back together.

309
00:30:41,358 --> 00:30:42,780
Those are the director's orders.

310
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,521
But I don't trust you guys.

311
00:30:46,916 --> 00:30:48,389
Come on now.

312
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,901
You'll be more useful here.

313
00:30:51,901 --> 00:30:55,413
In the meantime, find Sophida
and protect the residents.

314
00:30:56,992 --> 00:30:58,003
Are you sure about this?

315
00:30:59,404 --> 00:31:00,675
Don't worry.

316
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:04,046
They won't do anything to me.

317
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:05,313
I'm still useful to them.

318
00:31:26,214 --> 00:31:27,214
Hey!

319
00:31:28,017 --> 00:31:29,017
Hey!

320
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,108
Hey!

321
00:31:33,108 --> 00:31:34,113
Help me!

322
00:31:34,113 --> 00:31:35,113
Hey!

323
00:31:40,838 --> 00:31:41,840
Come quickly.

324
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,840
Come out.

325
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:47,031
Go on! Quickly! Hurry up!

326
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
Go!

327
00:32:09,847 --> 00:32:11,136
Come on, help me.

328
00:32:12,008 --> 00:32:13,008
There.

329
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:26,392
Why were you there alone?
It's dangerous, you know.

330
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:29,311
I'm sorry. I didn't know
there would be so many of them.

331
00:32:33,196 --> 00:32:34,599
Who opened the door?

332
00:32:35,714 --> 00:32:38,704
I didn't open it. I closed it when I left.

333
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:51,553
Prach.

334
00:32:54,487 --> 00:32:57,214
Did you lock the door when Run and I left?

335
00:32:57,214 --> 00:33:00,009
Of course, I did. And I patrolled the area too.

336
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,136
Did something happen?

337
00:33:09,595 --> 00:33:11,029
I'm not sure yet.

338
00:33:11,797 --> 00:33:14,312
Let me check the area again,
and then I'll head up.

339
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:17,205
Okay.

340
00:33:19,896 --> 00:33:22,080
Can you take me to the fitness room?

341
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,080
Let's go.

342
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:44,207
Aim,

343
00:33:46,254 --> 00:33:47,714
I brought you some snacks.

344
00:33:49,553 --> 00:33:51,680
You bring me snacks so often. I feel bad.

345
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,547
It's okay. I'll bring some for the others too.

346
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:58,017
Jeu, I brought you some snacks.

347
00:33:58,983 --> 00:33:59,983
Okay.

348
00:34:02,703 --> 00:34:05,518
Jee, where have you been?

349
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:09,548
Jee was trapped in the car.

350
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,660
So I got him out.

351
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,289
What were you doing out there?

352
00:34:14,982 --> 00:34:17,805
Out filming another one of your videos again?

353
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,000
Do you have a death wish?

354
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,155
Calm down, sir.

355
00:34:21,076 --> 00:34:22,693
Let's talk about this calmly.

356
00:34:24,928 --> 00:34:29,624
For crying out loud, why are you so stubborn?

357
00:34:29,624 --> 00:34:32,002
You're always causing trouble for others.

358
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,810
When will you grow up?

359
00:34:44,107 --> 00:34:46,265
Let me see if you have any injuries.

360
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:51,633
Do you know how worried Grandma is about you?

361
00:34:55,868 --> 00:34:57,157
Were you bitten?

362
00:35:04,583 --> 00:35:05,800
Hello, everyone.

363
00:35:06,383 --> 00:35:08,120
Nothing much today.

364
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,289
Just wanted to say that
this world is so boring.

365
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,315
Who else is bored?

366
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:18,114
I'm super tired of my grandparents.

367
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:20,920
They keep doing the same things
over and over again.

368
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,945
And they always think other people
are better than their own family.

369
00:35:45,475 --> 00:35:46,764
Infected,

370
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:49,627
infected,

371
00:35:49,627 --> 00:35:50,640
infected.

372
00:35:51,263 --> 00:35:53,193
Is everyone in the world infected?

373
00:36:40,705 --> 00:36:41,705
What's wrong?

374
00:36:48,697 --> 00:36:50,092
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

375
00:36:51,315 --> 00:36:52,827
I'm sorry for everything.

376
00:37:08,007 --> 00:37:09,007
Alright.

377
00:37:19,724 --> 00:37:20,751
It's okay.

378
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:24,797
I'm glad you're safe.

379
00:37:28,303 --> 00:37:30,210
Let's go visit Grandma.

380
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,614
Where do I even start?
This place is such a mess.

381
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:51,692
I need to get a boyfriend to help me clean up.

382
00:38:03,763 --> 00:38:06,828
I'll just pile everything here
and throw it out later.

383
00:38:14,568 --> 00:38:16,311
Is this Jeu's stuff?

384
00:38:29,874 --> 00:38:32,040
I told you not to overwork yourself.

385
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,512
You know there isn't enough light
to write scripts at night, right?

386
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,120
You want me to stop writing? I can't do that.

387
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,044
The crew is rushing to start filming.

388
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,347
I've been writing for almost a year now,
and I've only finished one story.

389
00:38:44,706 --> 00:38:46,253
Must be a meticulous job.

390
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:56,589
I want a stable career…

391
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,063
because I want money.

392
00:39:32,145 --> 00:39:33,484
Jee?

393
00:39:34,553 --> 00:39:35,894
You're back?

394
00:39:35,894 --> 00:39:38,903
Where have you been? I was so worried.

395
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,991
I'm sorry for getting you stuck here, Grandma.

396
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:56,800
It's okay, dear. It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

397
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,110
Oh my, where have you been?

398
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,721
Have you eaten anything yet?

399
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:05,723
- Grandpa?
- Yes?

400
00:40:05,723 --> 00:40:07,160
Quick, fix something for our grandson to eat.

401
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,880
Okay.

402
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,080
You ran off.
I was so stressed I couldn't sleep.

403
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,832
Well, I'm back now.

404
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,094
I'll eat with you, Grandma.

405
00:40:17,936 --> 00:40:19,200
Grandpa, hurry up. I'm hungry.

406
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,320
- Grandpa, hurry up. Our grandson is hungry.
- Alright, alright.

407
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,600
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up, hurry up.

408
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,600
Okay.

409
00:40:39,806 --> 00:40:43,601
Your safety is our top priority
when extracting the antibodies.

410
00:40:45,351 --> 00:40:47,597
Each time we extract the antibodies,

411
00:40:47,597 --> 00:40:52,086
we need 450 milliliters of your blood.

412
00:40:52,086 --> 00:40:56,611
You'll need to recover for three months
to let your body replenish the blood

413
00:40:56,611 --> 00:40:59,103
before we can start the extraction again.

414
00:41:02,401 --> 00:41:04,803
How many vials of antibodies
can you get from this?

415
00:41:14,012 --> 00:41:15,012
You…

416
00:41:18,344 --> 00:41:20,453
Are you the one who just entered the condo?

417
00:41:21,783 --> 00:41:24,622
Well, yes, I intended to turn myself in

418
00:41:24,622 --> 00:41:27,122
because it's really scary out there.

419
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,498
Where have you been for the past few days?

420
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:34,852
I've been in and out of the janitor room.

421
00:41:38,501 --> 00:41:40,819
You're covered in blood. What happened to you?

422
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:44,067
It's nothing. I wasn't hurt. I'm fine.

423
00:41:54,007 --> 00:41:56,049
We were able to extract
two vials of antibodies.

424
00:41:57,311 --> 00:41:58,686
I'll give you one.

425
00:41:58,686 --> 00:42:01,606
You can use it to help whoever you want.

426
00:42:01,606 --> 00:42:05,400
But we want you to continue your mission
to find the drug distributor

427
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,650
because that's our main goal.

428
00:42:09,682 --> 00:42:10,812
And the other vial?

429
00:42:14,892 --> 00:42:17,533
We need to keep it for further research.

430
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,403
Leave me alone with Da.

431
00:44:02,753 --> 00:44:07,297
Shouldn't these antibodies… be used
for the public good?

432
00:44:07,297 --> 00:44:08,360
Why are you…

433
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,609
Just do your assigned work.

434
00:44:11,591 --> 00:44:12,591
Alright?

435
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,933
It's not safe here anymore.

436
00:44:27,675 --> 00:44:29,802
Someone is after you.

437
00:44:29,802 --> 00:44:35,400
Our medical capacity isn't enough
to make that many antibodies.

438
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,720
We need to send the officer with the antibodies

439
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,735
to continue research with our allies' advanced
labs for mass production.

440
00:44:42,735 --> 00:44:45,912
But… everything is nearly complete.

441
00:44:47,043 --> 00:44:49,494
And right now…

442
00:44:49,494 --> 00:44:51,663
many things are still in motion.

443
00:44:51,663 --> 00:44:56,096
Send her to us right now.
This is an order from the leader.

444
00:44:56,096 --> 00:44:57,703
I'm afraid I can't do that.

445
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,240
You dare defy the leader?

446
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,187
If you don't do it,
I'll have to handle it myself.

447
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,602
You have to go now.

448
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:17,214
Yutthasak, the infected have gotten into
the building.

449
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,720
We're in danger.

450
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,880
If you don't hurry, we'll all die here.

451
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,614
Send someone to help us now!

452
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:29,097
I'm coming now.

453
00:45:29,905 --> 00:45:30,905
Run,

454
00:45:31,606 --> 00:45:33,062
are you safe?

455
00:45:33,062 --> 00:45:35,274
What's wrong with your voice? What happened?

456
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:36,880
Prach?

457
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,618
Yutthasak… please take care of Run.

458
00:45:40,618 --> 00:45:42,240
Don't let her come back here.

459
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,240
Prach!

460
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:47,630
Prach?

461
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,300
Prach!

462
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,991
You are infected?

463
00:46:02,401 --> 00:46:04,160
You need to be quarantined in the fitness room.

464
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,160
No, I'm not infected, Officer.

465
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,263
- It might not be a bite mark, officer.
- Go.

466
00:46:13,235 --> 00:46:14,384
O-O-Officer…

467
00:46:19,802 --> 00:46:23,731
Those people on the upper floors
probably have everything they need.

468
00:46:23,731 --> 00:46:26,835
No one cares about poor people like us.

469
00:46:28,238 --> 00:46:29,623
What a waste of time.

470
00:47:44,707 --> 00:47:45,903
Here.

471
00:47:45,903 --> 00:47:47,880
A gift for the future Lieutenant.

472
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,876
Why? Are you worried about me?

473
00:47:49,876 --> 00:47:52,299
Yeah, right, to protect you from bullets.

474
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,513
Thanks a whole lot, then.

475
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,267
Where is she now?

476
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:51,709
She's not here anymore.

477
00:48:57,649 --> 00:48:59,591
You deliberately let her go, didn't you?

478
00:49:03,324 --> 00:49:04,825
You will be punished for that.

479
00:49:10,712 --> 00:49:12,211
I'm willing to accept punishment,

480
00:49:13,342 --> 00:49:15,722
but let me finish my mission first.

481
00:49:16,681 --> 00:49:19,600
We now know who the drug distributor is,

482
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:22,301
and we'll bring them to you, sir.

483
00:49:24,698 --> 00:49:30,186
They made the disease, so obviously,
they made the cure too. Right?

484
00:49:31,951 --> 00:49:34,032
If you can't deal with this problem…

485
00:49:34,795 --> 00:49:36,994
I'll take care of it myself.

486
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,350
Don't come out. The infected are on the loose.

487
00:50:00,349 --> 00:50:03,288
Don't come out. The infected are on the loose.

488
00:50:12,423 --> 00:50:15,105
Don't come out. The infected are on the loose.

489
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,134
Don't come out. The infected are on the loose.

490
00:50:30,863 --> 00:50:32,520
Don't come out.

491
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,726
Don't come out. The infected are on the loose.

492
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,393
Don't come out.

493
00:51:11,909 --> 00:51:19,898
[Next Episode]

494
00:51:22,201 --> 00:51:25,906
Where are you going, Prach?
Can I come with you?

495
00:51:27,191 --> 00:51:28,334
Arisara,

496
00:51:28,908 --> 00:51:32,582
have the Special Control Unit evacuate everyone
from Building B.

497
00:51:32,582 --> 00:51:34,513
What about the residents
in the other buildings…

498
00:51:34,513 --> 00:51:36,644
I only want the drug distributor.

499
00:51:36,644 --> 00:51:38,127
The rest is up to you.

500
00:51:38,897 --> 00:51:40,273
If you're not going to help me,

501
00:51:40,273 --> 00:51:42,163
I'll expose everything.

502
00:51:47,911 --> 00:51:50,098
Are you going to let other residents die?

503
00:51:51,905 --> 00:51:54,067
Get a hold of yourself, Prach. Stay with me!

504
00:51:54,067 --> 00:51:56,696
- Let go of me!
- I can't be on my own.

505
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:59,397
We still have the residents to take care of.

506
00:51:59,965 --> 00:52:02,593
I can't do it alone, Prach.
