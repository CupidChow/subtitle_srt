2
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:54,768
Dad?

3
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,520
Mom?

4
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,520
Mom!

5
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,960
Dad!

6
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,527
Dad!

7
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,605
Dad, what's wrong?

8
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,172
Mom! Mom!

9
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,887
Mom!

10
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,600
Mom!

11
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,120
Mom.

12
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,520
What's wrong with you, Mom?

13
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,880
Mom! Mom!

14
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,120
Mom!

15
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,803
Mom!

16
00:01:41,089 --> 00:01:42,948
Mom.

17
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,817
Thank you. Thank you very much.

18
00:01:53,817 --> 00:01:55,140
Thank you.

19
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,497
I'd like to request exclusive
Intellectual Property rights

20
00:01:58,497 --> 00:02:03,511
to this drug for Real & Roger.

21
00:03:23,004 --> 00:03:27,018
[Happiness]

22
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,400
Hurry up, hurry up!

23
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,622
Quickly!

24
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,041
Fah!

25
00:04:22,006 --> 00:04:23,006
Follow me.

26
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,543
Don't use your guns yet.

27
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:30,315
You'll just attract all the infected.

28
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,775
I can't take it anymore! It hurts!

29
00:05:22,775 --> 00:05:23,780
- Tattep?
- It hurts!

30
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,880
Run!

31
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,000
Go on ahead! I'll catch up.

32
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,901
Get up now!

33
00:05:28,901 --> 00:05:30,560
- Go ahead!
- Get up! Hurry!

34
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,923
It's coming! Go away! Help! Help us!

35
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,189
Everyone, get up! Quickly! Go!

36
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:47,440
- Go quickly!
- Go, quickly!

37
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,353
Hurry!

38
00:05:48,353 --> 00:05:50,896
Aunt Noi, come on. Let's go.

39
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
Go!

40
00:06:03,954 --> 00:06:04,954
Let's go,

41
00:06:06,204 --> 00:06:07,204
let's go.

42
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,115
Aunt Noi, move!

43
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:23,461
Aunt Noi!

44
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:45,666
Aunt Noi.

45
00:07:00,777 --> 00:07:01,777
Aunt Noi!

46
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,440
Help! Help! Please help!

47
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:28,619
Aunt Noi.

48
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:38,773
- Aunt Noi! Let's go!
- Come on. Let's go!

49
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:40,515
Everyone, go!

50
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:44,882
Hurry!

51
00:08:57,937 --> 00:08:58,994
Better?

52
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:12,280
Thank you.

53
00:09:17,207 --> 00:09:18,399
Thank you too.

54
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
Are you okay?

55
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:37,690
What happened to Aunt Noi?

56
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,306
I don't know either.

57
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,439
When I found Aunt Noi,
she was already like this.

58
00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:47,811
I didn't even get to ask her.

59
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,577
Can you get the injured treated first?

60
00:10:04,656 --> 00:10:06,307
We left Beam inside.

61
00:10:09,038 --> 00:10:12,103
We've evacuated almost everyone from the condo.

62
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:16,694
If someone is still inside, we'll have to
regroup and come back for them later.

63
00:10:19,804 --> 00:10:21,405
I'll go back in to help him.

64
00:10:25,804 --> 00:10:26,971
I'll go with you.

65
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:32,997
You two are going back in?

66
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:36,397
Are you sure you can handle it?

67
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:39,917
Yeah.

68
00:11:57,712 --> 00:12:01,498
Aunt Noi told me that
before Sophida was bitten,

69
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:02,804
she was talking to someone.

70
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,702
That person could be the other mastermind.

71
00:12:08,803 --> 00:12:10,898
So Sophida wasn't acting alone.

72
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,282
Right. There must be someone else behind this.

73
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:20,149
It's me.

74
00:12:20,895 --> 00:12:23,199
Beam? Are you safe?

75
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,767
I'm fine.

76
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,225
What happened?

77
00:12:32,862 --> 00:12:34,298
We got here too late.

78
00:12:35,113 --> 00:12:36,858
But the other residents made it out.

79
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:40,015
Let's go, Beam.

80
00:12:40,015 --> 00:12:42,224
Prach and I will protect you.

81
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,485
You lead the way. I'll watch your back.

82
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:46,485
Let's go.

83
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:48,809
Come on.

84
00:12:53,335 --> 00:12:57,209
Prach? What are you doing?
Prach, we have to help Beam.

85
00:12:57,893 --> 00:12:58,893
Put it down.

86
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:00,596
That's right.

87
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,020
Dr. Beam is the main one we're looking for.

88
00:13:05,003 --> 00:13:10,702
Dr. Beam, it's just me, you, and Run
left in the whole building.

89
00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:14,884
Just tell us the truth.
Don't waste any more time.

90
00:13:18,222 --> 00:13:19,564
Why don't you just say it?

91
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,383
Until now,

92
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:26,406
you still haven't told me

93
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:30,668
what kind of doctor you really are.

94
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,540
Is that Gorophen? This is a strong drug.
It requires a prescription.

95
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,820
Beam gave it to me.

96
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,725
Dr. Beam, which hospital do you work at?

97
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:50,300
I've stopped practicing.

98
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,260
So you're working at a public hospital now?

99
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,267
Yes.

100
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,214
A doctor friend invited me
to invest in a beauty clinic.

101
00:13:57,214 --> 00:14:00,608
I want everyone to have equal access
to healthcare.

102
00:14:00,608 --> 00:14:05,040
I like people who are serious
about helping others.

103
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,200
Would you like to work at my clinic?

104
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:13,595
It's strange a drug dealer would use
a garbage area for a drop.

105
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:15,214
- What are you doing?
- Alright.
Hey, who's there?

106
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:18,560
Come here. What are you doing?
What are you exchanging?

107
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,957
People come and go there all the time.

108
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:25,511
And I just happened to see it.

109
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:39,904
Dr. Beam, what's your specialty?

110
00:14:39,904 --> 00:14:43,480
Are you still suspicious of me?
I'm just a general practitioner.

111
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,738
A general practitioner…

112
00:14:45,738 --> 00:14:47,920
who also opened a cosmetic surgery clinic?

113
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,934
Yutthasak,

114
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,202
can you look someone up for me?

115
00:14:57,051 --> 00:14:58,051
Run,

116
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,960
is the Inspector there?

117
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,440
He's not here. You can talk to me.

118
00:15:07,154 --> 00:15:08,713
You're smarter than I thought.

119
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,147
I made up the whole story

120
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
because I wanted to be on your side.

121
00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:30,279
[Name: Rinrada Haoharn, 26,
Single Police Captain, Special Suppression Unit]

122
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,840
Actually, I just wanted to get to know
great cops like you two better.

123
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:41,440
And since you knew I was in charge of
the drug case, you wanted to stay close.

124
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,116
Because the most dangerous place is the safest.

125
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,680
Why would you think that?

126
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,715
Why would a top neurosurgeon
suddenly become a general practitioner?

127
00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:57,340
He graduated with first-class honors,

128
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,586
then specialized in neurosurgery,

129
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:02,793
and studied epidemiology for two more years.

130
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
And another thing…

131
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,187
You were a rural doctor,
then suddenly ended up at a beauty clinic.

132
00:16:10,187 --> 00:16:13,160
After graduating,
he volunteered in rural areas.

133
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,567
Then out of nowhere,
he started working at SB Clinic.

134
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:21,291
That wasn't just random.
You were planning something all along.

135
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,080
Prescribing medroxyprogesterone acetate
at a beauty clinic isn't unusual.

136
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,840
But your clinic's ordering
an unusually large amount.

137
00:16:34,408 --> 00:16:35,415
Inspector,

138
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:39,440
I looked into the medroxyprogesterone acetate
you asked about.

139
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,200
It's a hormone drug.

140
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,560
We found large amounts of
its chemical components in Next.

141
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,987
And the doctor who prescribed the drug…

142
00:17:09,497 --> 00:17:10,702
is you.

143
00:17:12,304 --> 00:17:14,031
[Dr. Peempat Pongpanich]

144
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,405
And Sophida's lab is
where you're producing Next.

145
00:17:25,616 --> 00:17:26,898
Can you keep a secret?

146
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,560
If it's your dream, I'll do anything to help.

147
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,365
Everyone who takes this drug will turn
into one of the infected.

148
00:17:49,476 --> 00:17:54,947
Next has to be seen as both
a treatment and a supplement.

149
00:17:54,947 --> 00:17:57,824
This condo will be the distribution center.

150
00:17:57,824 --> 00:18:00,760
It needs to reach the outbreak level

151
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,291
and trigger an international incident.

152
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,438
So… we have to live
in this room together, right?

153
00:18:10,192 --> 00:18:11,392
This is my room.

154
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,491
For now, let's pretend
we don't know each other.

155
00:18:16,491 --> 00:18:19,560
When I need you, I'll call you up.

156
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,101
And you used Hack's network to spread the drug.

157
00:18:31,803 --> 00:18:33,880
You're the mastermind behind all of this.

158
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,004
How many people have you infected and killed?

159
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,027
Why are you doing this, Beam?

160
00:18:42,027 --> 00:18:43,802
You're under arrest.

161
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:51,625
We are seeing things
from different perspectives, Prach.

162
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,807
I'm a doctor.

163
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,726
All I'm thinking about is how to save lives.

164
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
Run!

165
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,275
Are you okay?

166
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,880
Run away, Run!

167
00:21:18,218 --> 00:21:19,225
Run.

168
00:22:19,434 --> 00:22:20,434
Stop it!

169
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
Prach!

170
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,920
Why did you kill him?

171
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,628
I don't care.

172
00:22:48,504 --> 00:22:49,988
I still have plenty of test subjects.

173
00:22:50,794 --> 00:22:54,840
I had to run many experiments
because I want to save the world.

174
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
Save the world?

175
00:22:56,774 --> 00:22:59,911
You call this saving the world?
You're killing people.

176
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,407
That's murder.

177
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,405
What are you really after?

178
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,592
Yutthasak,

179
00:23:29,592 --> 00:23:31,000
are you there?

180
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,240
Inspector,

181
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,356
are you alright?

182
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,956
We found the mastermind.

183
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,199
He wants to talk to you in private.

184
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,666
What are you waiting for?

185
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,106
Why aren't you arresting him?

186
00:24:30,316 --> 00:24:31,700
What about my request?

187
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,887
If you delay, more people will die.

188
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,960
Are you bargaining with lives?

189
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,250
Don't say that.

190
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,760
I'm just using this epidemic
to stop other diseases.

191
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,720
It's to help everyone.

192
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,531
The people you killed had families too.

193
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,240
They have to understand.

194
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,200
Believe me… just like I believe.

195
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,960
Just like how I'm doing this for my parents.

196
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,440
Dad!

197
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,209
Dad! Dad!

198
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,040
We've spent almost ten years researching.

199
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,640
Now we have an anti-cancer drug
from herb extract.

200
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,680
It can significantly reduce
the cost of drug production.

201
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,080
Everyone in the world
should have access to medicine.

202
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,480
- It's a basic human right.
- Mom!

203
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,800
Mom!

204
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,410
Mom, what's wrong?

205
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,800
Mom! Mom!

206
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
So everyone can get equal treatment.

207
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,704
What's wrong, Mom? Mom!

208
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,882
Do you think your parents
would be proud if they were still alive?

209
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:50,000
They worked hard to save lives,

210
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,226
but you're using them
as an excuse to kill people.

211
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,702
You don't understand a thing
about treatment.

212
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,502
You're crazy.

213
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,760
Killing people to satisfy your own needs.

214
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,720
I don't care how many more have to die.

215
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,040
I just want everyone
to have equal access to medical care!

216
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:18,077
- Oh!
- Hey!

217
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:19,111
That's enough.

218
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,323
How dare you say that?

219
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,520
Take these two outside.

220
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,311
Let go!

221
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,802
Walk!

222
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,014
You're one of them, aren't you?

223
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,960
Take them away.

224
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:48,280
Go.

225
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,840
You're one of them, aren't you?

226
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,720
Get out!

227
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,365
Let go! Let go!

228
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,767
Get out!

229
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,240
The leader wants to speak with him privately.

230
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,760
This way, please.

231
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,209
I knew it.

232
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,817
The air here is terrible.

233
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,319
You're younger than I thought.

234
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,595
You don't seem like the type who wants money.

235
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,999
So, what do you want?

236
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,496
You got rich spreading the disease
and selling the cure.

237
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,240
Do you think everyone thinks like you?

238
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,408
The idealist himself.

239
00:28:45,508 --> 00:28:46,520
Well, well, well.

240
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,201
Say what you want.

241
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,796
I'm not going anywhere.

242
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:59,006
I want everyone to have equal access
to healthcare.

243
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:03,107
Equal?

244
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,013
Equality?

245
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,160
Planning to kill millions
in the name of equality.

246
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,440
Man, you've got some nerve.

247
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:19,320
If I didn't do this, would money-hungry people
like you even care?

248
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,289
This country is already under your control.

249
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,601
Whatever you say, goes.

250
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,910
So do the right thing for once.

251
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,596
You're still so young.

252
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,960
Full of ideals, not interested in money,

253
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,297
wanting to build a world of equality.

254
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,800
Looks like we're living in different worlds.

255
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,480
But you need me.

256
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,240
This world needs me.

257
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,760
I'm the only one who can cure this epidemic.

258
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
You know that.

259
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,408
And you,

260
00:30:04,892 --> 00:30:06,920
just make healthcare free.

261
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,908
Free?

262
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,634
If it's free, then the world is doomed.

263
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,480
Everyone will want everything for free.
Free this, free that, free everything.

264
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,621
And do you know what will happen?

265
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,240
They'll get used to begging.

266
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,240
They stop taking care of themselves,

267
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,280
and live without fear of death

268
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:46,960
because no matter what…
free medicine, free treatment.

269
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,166
If your doctor parents were alive,

270
00:30:51,166 --> 00:30:54,800
they would have to treat patients
until they die.

271
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,760
And don't be surprised.

272
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:04,401
People like your parents
were already on the list.

273
00:31:06,504 --> 00:31:07,866
Mom!

274
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,517
Mom!

275
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,240
Mom!

276
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,393
- Mom! What's wrong with you, Mom?
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

277
00:31:20,393 --> 00:31:23,003
- Thank you again.
- Mom!

278
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,480
Mom!

279
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,800
Five hundred.

280
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,160
Wait, no, no, no.

281
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,200
For something this groundbreaking,

282
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,399
I'll give you… a billion.

283
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,520
For the cure formula.

284
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,876
As for me, I just want a small profit.

285
00:31:57,636 --> 00:31:59,624
Still can't decide?

286
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,160
Then I'll give you a bonus.

287
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,514
This country's healthcare system…

288
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:15,840
If you have money and power,
you can do whatever you want.

289
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,590
Whatever your heart desires, do it.

290
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,726
Congratulations on a successful negotiation.

291
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:10,505
See our guest out.

292
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,099
Let go!

293
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,400
- Let go!
- Hey!

294
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,160
- Hey!
- What's this? Doctor!

295
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,640
What the hell? What the hell? No!

296
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,917
Open that door now!

297
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,813
Open that door right now!

298
00:33:47,116 --> 00:33:49,918
I'm telling you, open the goddamn door!

299
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,242
Leader!

300
00:33:52,242 --> 00:33:53,600
Let me out!

301
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,192
They have to pay.

302
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:07,520
With the method we've just discovered,

303
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,320
we can now extract unlimited antibodies
from Run's blood, right?

304
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,234
We can cure everyone completely.

305
00:34:14,234 --> 00:34:15,480
Reporting live from The Breathe Condo.

306
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:21,125
Authorities have raided a Next drug facility
and arrested the mastermind.

307
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:25,160
Following a clash between
the Special Control Unit and suspects,

308
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:29,680
there are reports of fatalities,
both normal people and infected.

309
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,920
Authorities have yet to confirm
the total death toll.

310
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,545
Mommy!

311
00:35:24,545 --> 00:35:25,594
Yayee.

312
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,237
I missed you so much.

313
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,138
I missed you too, sweetie.

314
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,705
Thank you, Run.

315
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,407
You're welcome.

316
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,480
How are you, sweetie?

317
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,352
Have you been giving Run a hard time?

318
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,915
I'm so relieved.

319
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,796
Come on. Let's go home.

320
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,400
Hey, I got you a watch so you can set an alarm
to remind yourself to eat.

321
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,303
Why don't you take care of your stuff?

322
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,760
I got good use out of it.

323
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,944
I even used it to fight off the infected.

324
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,354
To hit them over the head?

325
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,699
Do you like it?

326
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,389
The watch.

327
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,840
Run…

328
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,080
I was bitten by one of the infected.

329
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,617
If you're watching this,

330
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,060
I might have already turned.

331
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,605
I probably won't remember you.

332
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,817
If you see me when I'm infected,

333
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,724
please don't come near me.

334
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,710
There's something I want to tell you.

335
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,673
I was going to tell you someday.

336
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,625
I love you.

337
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,810
I've always loved you,

338
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,039
but I'm not good with words.

339
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,505
I was afraid you'd scold me.

340
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,325
Run…

341
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,118
Just pretending to be your lover

342
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,506
made me so happy.

343
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,995
Goodbye, Run.

344
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,080
What are you watching?

345
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,323
Your video.

346
00:39:17,602 --> 00:39:18,520
Where did you get that?

347
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,640
You sent it to me when there was no internet.

348
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,601
Now that it's back, it popped up.

349
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,282
What did you say just now?

350
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,840
You said a lot in that video.

351
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,809
I want to hear the short version.

352
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,160
Come on, tell me. Or should I share this?

353
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,760
No, Run. Run.

354
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,520
Don't, Run.
- Why not?
- Run.

355
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,675
- So people will know.
- No, Run. Don't do it.

356
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,001
Oh, Auntie…

357
00:40:43,587 --> 00:40:45,174
Jeu? What are you doing here?

358
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,840
I came to make merit for Por too.

359
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,604
I feel sorry for his child.

360
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,999
He's only five years old.

361
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,657
Perhaps Por just wanted to make
a lot of money for his family.

362
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,040
Everyone wants their loved ones to be happy.

363
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,452
That's true, Auntie.

364
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,209
But are you okay?

365
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,019
I'm better now.

366
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,014
Would you like to work in condo management
with me from now on?

367
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,605
You're asking me, Auntie?

368
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,720
Of course. Come work with me.

369
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,502
Let's take care of this condo together
and make it the best it can be.

370
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,248
Okay, Auntie. Thank you so much.

371
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,880
Push gently. Don't upset the baby.

372
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:59,000
My man is taking me, the baby, and you
on a date today.

373
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,480
Why are you taking me and the baby
on your date?

374
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:04,720
Well, you're my best friend,
and this is my precious child.

375
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:06,880
My man has to accept what I love.

376
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,200
Besides, we've been through so much together.

377
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,280
We won't stop being friends that easily.

378
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,760
But we'll have to part ways eventually, right?

379
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,762
That's true, but…

380
00:42:16,762 --> 00:42:20,360
You're happy when you're with me,
and I'm happy when I'm with you.

381
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,720
So that's that.

382
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,017
And don't worry, when you're old,

383
00:42:24,017 --> 00:42:27,160
I'll be the best friend
who visits you at the nursing home.

384
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,320
Oh my, you dare say that?

385
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:32,806
At the nursing home,
you'll be in the bed next to me.

386
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,720
I don't think I would be
in the bed next to you.

387
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,680
My man is here.

388
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,920
What a handsome and classy man.

389
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:39,880
Hello.

390
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,200
Hi!

391
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,800
Hi, how are you doing?

392
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,560
Yeah, I'm great.

393
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,480
Really?

394
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,920
Oh! Is that a cat?

395
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,200
- Oh, yes. It's a cat.
- That's right.

396
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,880
Wow, that's awesome. I have a surprise for you.

397
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,892
Oh my god. He has a surprise.

398
00:42:53,892 --> 00:42:56,360
He's so over the top, isn't he?

399
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,640
Oh, two bouquets?

400
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,280
This one is for you, Fah.

401
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,680
- Wow.
- Thank you. Oh, my.

402
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,186
- And this one is for your friend.
- It's Jeu.

403
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,600
And for you, my little friend.

404
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,693
There's one for the cat too?

405
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,230
- Is that okay, sweetie?
- How cute.

406
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,160
Who is he? I approve.

407
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,280
I'll remember this for my script.

408
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:23,200
- Male or female?
- Oh, great.

409
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,520
I think it's male.

410
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,160
That's good.

411
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,412
Too much.

412
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,401
Fah, let's take a picture.

413
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:35,201
Okay. Three, two, one.

414
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,640
Hello to all
my social media followers and fans.

415
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,053
Today, I'm going to introduce you to
Grandma Jintana,

416
00:43:45,053 --> 00:43:47,040
who makes delicious food in a flash.

417
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,680
What are you making for me and Grandpa?

418
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,405
Fried rice with canned fish.

419
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,091
Grandma…

420
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:55,240
Grandpa and I ate that so much
during quarantine, we're sick of it.

421
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,255
I made this for Aim to eat on her way home.

422
00:44:00,176 --> 00:44:02,240
And I thought it was for your grandson.

423
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,392
See you all tomorrow. Bye!

424
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:08,732
Aim,

425
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,600
take this to your parents.

426
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,680
Thank you, Grandpa.

427
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,720
You're welcome. It's nothing.

428
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,400
When will you be back, Aim?

429
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,920
It shouldn't be long.

430
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,240
I'm planning to use some of my savings
to bring my parents here for a visit.

431
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,831
Look at you, pretty and smart with money.

432
00:44:28,473 --> 00:44:32,400
You're complimenting me?
You make a lot too.

433
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,392
Thirty to forty thousand a month, right?

434
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:35,988
What?

435
00:44:35,988 --> 00:44:39,645
Jee, you're making
thirty to forty thousand a month already?

436
00:44:39,645 --> 00:44:41,160
What kind of work do you do?

437
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,398
It's from the content
I've been filming, Grandpa.

438
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,040
That silly content?

439
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,511
I'm Jee, not a loser now.
I'm making thirty to forty thousand a month.

440
00:44:51,511 --> 00:44:53,240
- Whoa.
- Of course, Grandpa.

441
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,682
Jee has lots of followers,
so he gets a lot of sponsors.

442
00:44:59,227 --> 00:45:00,240
That's good.

443
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,829
With this kind of income,
Grandma and I won't have to worry so much.

444
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,801
Are you really worried about me?
You're always scolding me.

445
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,080
Haven't you ever heard this saying?

446
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,492
I scold you because I love you.

447
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,800
Do you really love me?

448
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,830
Of course.

449
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,520
I love you.

450
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,501
Aim, take this to eat on your way home, dear.

451
00:45:26,501 --> 00:45:28,000
Is this my favorite?

452
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,113
Of course, it is.

453
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,710
Thank you.

454
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,274
See? Someone likes it.

455
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:38,280
He complains that we eat it too often.

456
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,280
- Aim likes it, right?
- It's delicious.

457
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,840
Then make some for me too, Grandma.

458
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:43,800
What? Now you're not sick of it?

459
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,416
I've changed my mind.

460
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,315
Thank you.

461
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,480
Net…

462
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:13,682
I'm sorry for everything in the past.

463
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,600
Okay.

464
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,798
Can I walk you out?

465
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,122
My ride should be waiting downstairs.

466
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,200
If…

467
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,093
If you ever need any legal advice,

468
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,480
you can always ask me.

469
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,694
From now on, I think I'd rather
do things on my own.

470
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:54,891
Is there… still a chance for us
to get back together?

471
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,906
I'm packing up to go back to headquarters.

472
00:48:31,273 --> 00:48:33,898
How many times has
the little one kicked you today?

473
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,398
Really? Do you have any cravings?

474
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,240
Okay.

475
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,500
I'll see you tonight. Okay.

476
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,516
Is something urgent?

477
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,511
You can talk to me about anything.

478
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,864
I'm here to resign.

479
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:21,400
But I'd like to know
why you used the antibody on your wife?

480
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,513
I did it for myself.

481
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,222
We're trained…

482
00:49:37,406 --> 00:49:40,647
to always put our country first.

483
00:49:42,211 --> 00:49:43,830
We're trained…

484
00:49:44,976 --> 00:49:47,155
to work for the greater good.

485
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:54,492
What's the point if we can't do it
for the ones we love most?

486
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,297
Principles and reality always clash like this.

487
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:07,385
I've seen so many innocent people die
because of this incident.

488
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:14,120
It makes me wonder if what we're doing
really benefits the country.

489
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:18,998
In the end, we're just protecting
the interests of a certain group.

490
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,594
I'm not cut out for this job.

491
00:50:21,594 --> 00:50:27,066
I was trained to work for the greater good,
not for personal gain.

492
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,995
I know that I've made many mistakes,

493
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,872
but… that's life.

494
00:50:40,224 --> 00:50:41,714
It goes on.

495
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,736
From now on,

496
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:07,098
I hope you'll do everything… from your heart.

497
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:15,029
And don't forget to learn
how to cope with sadness

498
00:51:15,029 --> 00:51:19,096
and learn to move on from it.

499
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:34,158
It was an honor working with you.

500
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,798
Best of luck to you.

501
00:52:10,404 --> 00:52:12,120
Dad, walk slowly.

502
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:15,308
Okay, two more steps, right here.

503
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,708
Now take the blindfold off.

504
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,720
Wow, everything's blurry.

505
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,840
You forgot your glasses.

506
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:27,890
Now crystal clear. Wow.

507
00:52:31,352 --> 00:52:32,352
Hey!

508
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,125
- Isn't it beautiful, Dad?
- Is it the same as before?

509
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,240
What do you mean "the same"?

510
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,720
Look at the TV. It's much bigger.

511
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:41,280
Wow, a new sofa.

512
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,800
Have a seat.

513
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,160
New things… They're good, but…

514
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,202
But what, Dad?

515
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:54,680
New or old… I feel like it's still our home.

516
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,000
It's a waste of money…

517
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,160
buying all these new things.

518
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:00,800
You can always make more money, Dad.

519
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,795
But your happiness is worth
much more than that.

520
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,880
I don't care about money.

521
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,520
I just want my daughter to come back
and live with me here.

522
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:14,520
That's all I need to be happy.

523
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,880
- Hey.
- Hmm?

524
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,280
What about your condo? That condo.

525
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:26,104
I'm renting it out now.
Consider it some extra income.

526
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:28,920
Really?

527
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,640
That's good. Whatever you want.

528
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,982
It's your life, live it the way you want.

529
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,790
Thank you.

530
00:53:48,579 --> 00:53:49,643
Thank you.

531
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:09,040
You two just keep staring
and smiling at each other.

532
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,520
The food is getting flavorless.

533
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,640
Dad!

534
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,600
Alright. Don't be shy, don't be embarrassed.

535
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,082
Especially you, Prach.

536
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,600
Yes, sir.

537
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,203
If you have something to say, say it now.
I want to hear it too.

538
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,305
How about this?

539
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:28,009
If you have anything to confess, do it now.

540
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:33,000
I'll reduce your sentence by half.

541
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,416
- Prach.
- Hmm?

542
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,720
Please take care of my daughter.

543
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:51,840
She's a bit of a handful,
but she's a good person.

544
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,004
And…

545
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:56,027
I'm happy about one more thing.

546
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:03,234
You know, we'll finally be together for real.

547
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,315
Yes, Dad.

548
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,160
Come on.

549
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:14,206
Here.

550
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,200
What is it?

551
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,402
A watch.

552
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,549
Why did you buy a new one?

553
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,336
The old one still works just fine.

554
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:53,034
It was falling apart,
so I bought you a new one.

555
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:59,102
You have any idea how many times
this watch saved me?

556
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,983
Do you want it or not?

557
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,647
I'll take it.

558
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,632
Let me help you.

559
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,538
Is it on the wrong side?

560
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,570
There.

561
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:36,975
I'm glad that you're happy.

562
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,411
I used to think happiness meant having a home.

563
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:50,720
But it's not.

564
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,600
It's being with the people I love.

565
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,977
Being with Dad,

566
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,654
being with you…

567
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,685
That's… my home all right.

568
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,680
What? I can't do that?

569
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:20,360
You're getting fresh.

570
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,943
Just a little.

571
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:32,411
This is much better.

572
00:57:40,808 --> 00:57:41,895
I'm tired.

573
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:45,360
I need your shoulder for a bit.

574
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,360
Sure.

575
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:22,405
[Happiness]

576
00:59:45,054 --> 00:59:47,410
I was going to the doctor at first.

577
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,882
My throat hurts. I'm not sure why.

578
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,320
Here's a health tonic.

579
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:55,200
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

580
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,708
Take it morning and night. You'll be cured.

581
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,400
- Hello, Auntie. Stay healthy, all right?
- Hello.

582
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,489
Okay.

583
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:08,764
Here you go.

584
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,066
- Take this tonic.
- Thank you.

585
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,760
So you can be healthy.

586
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,080
Be strong and healthy, everyone.

587
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:16,600
Doctor, do you have any fever medicine?

588
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,720
- Here it is.
- Yes, here you go.

589
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,919
What's your name, Doctor?
