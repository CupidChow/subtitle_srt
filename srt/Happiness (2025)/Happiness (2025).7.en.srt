00:00:05,656 --> 00:00:12,315
[This series is a work of fiction.
All characters, locations, and events are entirely fabricated.]

2
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:13,851
Aim!

3
00:00:13,851 --> 00:00:16,929
[Previously]

4
00:00:16,929 --> 00:00:18,897
He has no clue
what's the appropriate thing to do.

5
00:00:22,038 --> 00:00:23,516
Thank you, Beam.

6
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:27,384
Why did you do that?
Why would you do it?

7
00:00:27,384 --> 00:00:28,225
Dear, calm down.

8
00:00:28,225 --> 00:00:30,888
I saw Jeu and Fah being chased
and bitten by the infected.

9
00:00:32,139 --> 00:00:33,844
Take him to the fitness room.

10
00:00:33,844 --> 00:00:35,050
Hack was a drug dealer.

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,094
So it means Hack was killed because

12
00:00:37,094 --> 00:00:38,300
I think it was to silence him.

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,646
Besides you, did anyone else
buy drugs from Hack?

14
00:00:41,646 --> 00:00:43,251
There were a lot of people.

15
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,905
Go.

16
00:00:49,725 --> 00:00:50,861
It's really gone. It's sacred.

17
00:00:50,861 --> 00:00:52,149
Oh my, it worked.

18
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:54,076
- It's sacred.
- This is the real deal!

19
00:00:54,076 --> 00:00:55,454
Wait!

20
00:00:55,454 --> 00:00:56,652
What's in that bag?

21
00:00:56,652 --> 00:00:57,659
It's nothing important.

22
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:00,975
I want to assure you that

23
00:01:00,975 --> 00:01:03,281
we're close to finding
the source of the drug distribution.

24
00:01:03,281 --> 00:01:05,348
You've been saying that for months.

25
00:01:05,348 --> 00:01:07,744
Please act accordingly.

26
00:01:07,744 --> 00:01:08,863
So

27
00:01:08,863 --> 00:01:10,604
the situation is not good right now.

28
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:13,643
I might have to escalate the operation
to the next level.

29
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,745
Hello, Dad.

30
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:52,866
Oh, Run? How are you?

31
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:57,416
I saw a video of people going crazy
and acting violently.

32
00:01:57,416 --> 00:01:59,853
You have to be careful, Run.

33
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:02,596
Don't worry.
No one would dare mess with me.

34
00:02:02,596 --> 00:02:04,361
Don't be stubborn, kiddo.

35
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:05,560
Listen to me.

36
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:11,474
I'm trying to be a good daughter
and report to you.

37
00:02:11,474 --> 00:02:14,590
You're so sweet. Okay.

38
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,281
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

39
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:17,700
Now go find something

40
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,700
to eat…

41
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,630
Dad?

42
00:02:23,153 --> 00:02:24,504
Why did the call drop?

43
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,230
We're sorry, the number you are trying
to reach is not available.

44
00:03:03,636 --> 00:03:06,791
We have cut off the electricity,
phone signal, and Wi-Fi.

45
00:05:00,499 --> 00:05:04,227
[Happiness]

46
00:05:14,964 --> 00:05:16,811
Run.

47
00:05:17,803 --> 00:05:20,591
Run. The lights are out
and the air conditioning is off.

48
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,984
What's happening?

49
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,710
I don't know either, Yayee.

50
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,790
Run.

51
00:05:32,685 --> 00:05:33,735
The water is not running.

52
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:37,940
I paid the water bill.

53
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,910
They should have given us notice
before the power cut.

54
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,030
How are the residents supposed to
live like this?

55
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,270
There's nothing here. Nothing.

56
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,070
Ju!

57
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,190
You scared me!

58
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,510
Ju! What are you doing here so late?

59
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:15,870
I had to put my cleaning supplies away.

60
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,710
I was just about to go back down.

61
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,244
How about this?
Let's walk Mrs. Noi back to her room.

62
00:06:20,244 --> 00:06:21,190
Then we can go back down together.

63
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,466
Okay, okay.
Hurry up and collect your things.

64
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,030
I'm scared too. Let's go.

65
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,590
You're so brave.

66
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,030
I'm scared too.

67
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:30,150
Come on, quickly.

68
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,710
Close the door.

69
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:32,470
- Close it.
- Close the door properly.

70
00:06:37,618 --> 00:06:40,030
Oh my! Naitan!

71
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,390
What are you doing here in the dark?
You scared me!

72
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,190
What am I doing here?
I'm here to see the fireflies.

73
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:49,390
- Huh?!
- Huh? Are there fireflies?

74
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:55,190
Is this appropriate? The Special Control Unit
warned us not to go out at night.

75
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:59,115
They warned us not to go out at night.

76
00:06:59,115 --> 00:07:00,910
Then why are you out here?

77
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:03,710
They told us already.

78
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,235
I came to warn residents like you.

79
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,510
Did we just get scolded back?

80
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,007
He's not cooperating at all.

81
00:07:13,007 --> 00:07:14,270
Come on. Hurry up.

82
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,366
- It's so scary in the dark.
- Shine the light properly.

83
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,950
Come on. Let's go see what's going on.

84
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,323
Yayee, can you stay here alone?

85
00:07:33,323 --> 00:07:36,830
Yes, I can. I'll count the stars.

86
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,830
I'll be back soon.

87
00:07:40,246 --> 00:07:41,246
Let's go.

88
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,510
The whole floor is dark.

89
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,510
Yeah.

90
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,270
I know why the power is out in every building.

91
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,270
Look at that.

92
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,230
Why is Yutthasak doing this?

93
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:43,670
Maybe it's his way of forcing
the drug distributors to show themselves.

94
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,030
But the people in this condo will also suffer.

95
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,997
There are elderly people and children here.

96
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:50,819
Let's patrol the area.

97
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:53,304
It's dark, and the infected might get in.

98
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:44,837
Lights off.

99
00:09:54,908 --> 00:09:57,110
What's going on? The lights just went out.

100
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,640
It's completely dark.

101
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,550
Calm down. Let's get dressed first.

102
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,510
When will we see each other again?

103
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,488
I'll call you later.

104
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,120
Let's hurry back to our rooms.

105
00:10:14,561 --> 00:10:15,921
But I'm still…

106
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,390
The lights shouldn't have gone out.

107
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,150
So, what's going on between them?

108
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,990
It's a good thing we have candles for praying.

109
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,379
Why are there so many candles?
I thought this was a temple.

110
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:45,412
Can we open the door a little?
I can't breathe.

111
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,248
Let's not do that.
What if someone hears us talking?

112
00:10:51,248 --> 00:10:52,597
Then just talk less.

113
00:10:52,597 --> 00:10:56,230
Hey. Are you saying I talk too much?
Just you wait.

114
00:10:56,230 --> 00:11:00,670
Hold on. That's enough, both of you.
Stop arguing.

115
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,510
Don't open the door.

116
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:07,790
We're running out of air because
you two won't stop breathing and talking.

117
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,500
The air is almost gone.

118
00:11:16,013 --> 00:11:19,518
Those people on the upper floors
probably have everything they need.

119
00:11:19,518 --> 00:11:20,084
Yeah.

120
00:11:20,084 --> 00:11:24,548
Backup power, power banks,
and their rooms even have windows.

121
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,230
And those on the higher floors,

122
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:32,910
they probably get to sleep with a cool breeze
and enjoy the beautiful view.

123
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,110
Why don't we have the same as them?

124
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:41,509
Shouldn't there be similar benefits
for everyone?

125
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:45,400
No one cares about poor people like us.

126
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,270
Hey, I think there is someone.

127
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:58,089
That… What's his name?

128
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:00,270
The one who robs the rich
to give to the poor.

129
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,453
Robin Hood?

130
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:03,750
That's right, Robin Hood.

131
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,270
He will definitely think of us.

132
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:10,430
But before he comes to save us,
we have to help ourselves by sleeping.

133
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,750
Lie still so we don't get hungry.

134
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,670
Sleep! Go to sleep.

135
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,297
Just lie still so you don't get hungry.

136
00:12:17,297 --> 00:12:19,106
- Hurry up.
- Fine. I'll sleep then.

137
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:20,110
I'm hungry.

138
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:23,724
Will we survive this?

139
00:12:50,566 --> 00:12:52,095
Where have you been?

140
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:58,990
I… I went for a walk.

141
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,270
A walk? Then why do you look like this?

142
00:13:16,476 --> 00:13:17,476
I…

143
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,430
I'm going to take a shower.

144
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,477
Why isn't the water running?

145
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:28,390
The power is out.
The water isn't running either.

146
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:30,990
Use bottled water for now.

147
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:35,419
Okay.

148
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,110
Where have you been for so long?

149
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,270
You come back and
immediately go to the bathroom.

150
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,790
Well… I went out for a walk
to get some fresh air.

151
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,550
Then the power went out,
and the elevator stopped working.

152
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:57,990
I had to run up the stairs, so I was sweaty.
I was going to wash my face first.

153
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,990
I was afraid you'd be scared of the dark,
so I ran up here.

154
00:15:07,895 --> 00:15:09,692
Wait for me in the room.

155
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:12,750
I'll wash my face and join you soon.

156
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:28,870
I want to be with you all the time.

157
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:31,510
People who love each other should be together,

158
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,881
no matter what happens.

159
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:36,790
No matter what the person we love
is really like.

160
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,150
Do you understand?

161
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,390
Of course, I understand.

162
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:51,007
People who love each other
should always be together.

163
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,550
Did you turn off the AC last night?
It's so hot.

164
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,270
The power went out.

165
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:24,325
And now the water isn't running either.
Now I can't cook.

166
00:16:26,356 --> 00:16:28,212
It's time to take my medicine, too.

167
00:16:28,212 --> 00:16:33,150
This condo is terrible. They don't
even have backup water or electricity.

168
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,630
The management is awful.

169
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,310
Honey, go see who is here
so early in the morning.

170
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,230
Okay.

171
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,550
Oh, it's you from the management.

172
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,790
We'll have a meeting
at the co-working space at 9 a.m.

173
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,790
Okay.

174
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,350
From now on, if there's anything,

175
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,270
we'll discuss it on this floor
because it's centrally located.

176
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:15,670
As you all know, we currently have no water,
power, Wi-Fi, or phone signal.

177
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,270
Basically, everything is cut off.

178
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,350
And I'm too tired to go around
knocking on everyone's doors--

179
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,404
I know that already.

180
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,334
Can you please get to the point?

181
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:31,510
I want everyone to save their phone batteries
for when needed.

182
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,243
For now…

183
00:17:33,243 --> 00:17:36,550
If you have a signal, you can use your phone,
but if you don't, turn it off.

184
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:40,510
As for water, there's a reserve tank,
but it's not much.

185
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:43,790
If you want to use it,
bring your own containers.

186
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,870
And please use it sparingly. Okay?

187
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,670
Hey, Auntie.
Why hasn't management dealt with this?

188
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,510
There are two elderly
and a woman in my room.

189
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,070
I can't carry everything by myself.

190
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,950
Excuse me.

191
00:17:59,515 --> 00:18:01,864
Well… About drinking water.

192
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:04,315
Where can we get drinking water?

193
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,860
Does anyone have any to share?

194
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,310
Please share some.

195
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:23,590
Of course. At this point,
no one is going to share.

196
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,870
They'll keep it for themselves.

197
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:26,950
That's right.

198
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:30,230
Don't say things like that.

199
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:34,620
I'm about to explain to everyone
about sharing

200
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,550
water and food.

201
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,706
I have a better idea.

202
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:48,190
Right now, whoever has food and water.
It's very simple.

203
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,270
Let's pool it all together.

204
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:50,190
Good idea.

205
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:53,750
And then we can divide it equally
among everyone.

206
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,110
That way, we can all survive together.

207
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,110
Hey!

208
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,990
That's not fair.

209
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,750
I planned ahead.

210
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:05,180
Those who didn't,

211
00:19:05,697 --> 00:19:06,870
deal with it.

212
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,470
Mr. Lawyer, why are you being so selfish?

213
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,344
You're accusing me?

214
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:13,927
I can sue you for that.

215
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:15,564
Hey, hold on. Hold on.

216
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:18,811
Right. You two.

217
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:21,206
You were the ones who handled
the relief bags last time.

218
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,750
Haven't they contacted you about getting more?

219
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,310
Not yet.

220
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,710
You handled it last time.
Aren't you helping this time?

221
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:43,350
I think it's better to wait for them
to contact us.

222
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,136
We all need to stay calm for now.

223
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:56,374
For now, everyone,
please eat your own food sparingly.

224
00:19:56,374 --> 00:20:00,950
and wait for the people outside to contact us.
Then we'll see what to do.

225
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,750
I'll share some.

226
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,590
Hold on. What did you say?

227
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,830
I might not have much,
but I'll share with those who have none.

228
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,644
By the way,

229
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:34,270
Does anyone have any fever medicine
they could share?

230
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:38,510
I have some medicine.
I'll bring it to your room later.

231
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:40,074
Thank you so much.

232
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,646
It's that easy. Just share.

233
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,832
Are you splitting your share with others?

234
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,030
Is there a better way?

235
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,550
But I can see that it's not enough.

236
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:03,270
You're setting yourself up for trouble.

237
00:21:09,474 --> 00:21:10,750
It's enough for Yayee.

238
00:21:11,451 --> 00:21:13,771
We'll just eat less. That's all.

239
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:15,684
Now you're just saying things.

240
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,470
Think before you speak.

241
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,510
I've thought about it carefully.

242
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,870
You say you've thought about it,

243
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,070
but you haven't really.

244
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,230
I have.

245
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,270
If you think you've thought it through,
you probably haven't.

246
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,270
Hey…

247
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,830
I brought some food to share.

248
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,470
Thank you, Beam.

249
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,670
Thank you very much.

250
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,990
I'll combine yours with my wife's,

251
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:55,430
and then we'll see how much we can divide it.

252
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,550
Okay. But if it's not enough, let me know.

253
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,830
I have a lot stocked up.

254
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,870
That would be great, Beam.

255
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:04,829
Do you want to come in
and help organize things?

256
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:05,830
Sure.

257
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,793
Okay. Come in.

258
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,790
Oh, right.

259
00:22:30,672 --> 00:22:31,673
- Thank you.
- Oh, no need.

260
00:22:31,673 --> 00:22:33,270
No need, Grandma.

261
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,790
Here's some fever medicine, too.

262
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:35,990
Thank you.

263
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,725
Food delivery.

264
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,129
Thank you.

265
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,550
Supplies.

266
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,790
Thank you.

267
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,550
Let's go.

268
00:23:28,892 --> 00:23:31,214
[Janitor Room]

269
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:38,607
Hello. You're so late. I'm starving.

270
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,310
Are you here alone?

271
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:47,110
Por is probably out for a walk around here.

272
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:51,750
And… And Ohn probably went to find
a quiet place to read.

273
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,990
They shouldn't go out alone
at a time like this.

274
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,470
Please tell the others.

275
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,350
Well, how am I going to stop them?

276
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,990
Here's some food.

277
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:12,803
There's food and drinks,
and some basic medicine.

278
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:16,190
If anyone's not feeling well, let me know.

279
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,419
I'll come and check on you.

280
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:20,270
Plan your meals carefully.

281
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:21,434
- Okay.
- We'll be going then.

282
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,070
Don't get me wrong, but…

283
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,550
The things you gave us might not be enough.

284
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:36,350
Well, there are a lot of people in this room,

285
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,790
and…

286
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:43,230
They're not like the other residents
who have food stocked up.

287
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,287
This room is full of people
who live hand to mouth.

288
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,904
Can we have a little more, please?

289
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:58,230
Food is limited right now.
If we get more, I'll bring it to you.

290
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,950
Please be patient.

291
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:04,297
All right then.

292
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,070
Let's go.

293
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,750
I feel bad.

294
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,790
You really didn't have to share your food
with us, Beam.

295
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,310
It's no problem.
You gave all your food away to others.

296
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,564
What are you going to eat?

297
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,710
What? The door is open.

298
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,246
Why is your room such a mess, Beam?

299
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,354
It looks like someone broke in.

300
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:55,030
But in this situation,
it can't be anyone but the residents.

301
00:25:57,879 --> 00:26:00,790
They didn't just take food.
They took valuables, too.

302
00:26:03,837 --> 00:26:07,310
We should call another meeting and investigate.

303
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,310
It's okay.

304
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,990
Everyone must be struggling.
No one wants to starve to death.

305
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,990
I understand.

306
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,790
But they could have just taken the food.

307
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,310
It's really okay.

308
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,990
But it seems like they left me some food.

309
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,950
You're so optimistic, Beam.

310
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:32,270
It's my fault.

311
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,510
If… If I hadn't asked for your help…

312
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,030
It's not your fault.

313
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:44,070
So now you're another one
running low on food, Dr. Beam?

314
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,670
That's true.

315
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:50,287
Aren't those Jeu's supplies?

316
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,837
Please take this to him.

317
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,030
I'll take this to Jeu myself.

318
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,863
After I walk you back.

319
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,030
Let's go, Yayee is waiting.

320
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:13,705
- Go.
- Thank you, Beam.

321
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,470
Here you go.

322
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:22,670
- Wow.
- Let me see, let me see.

323
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,790
Hey, Ohn, you're quite something.

324
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:30,790
You can even break into
a resident's room without a key card.

325
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:34,790
It's a skill I picked up to help residents
when there's a problem in the building,

326
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,270
like a power outage or a system malfunction.

327
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:39,470
- You're so talented.
- But it's not for helping right now.

328
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,430
Stop it. Just stop talking.

329
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,190
I'm not proud of having to be a thief
and steal like today.

330
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:48,710
You said "thief."
That's not the right word.

331
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,550
You should say "Robin Hood."

332
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:55,190
Come on. In times like these,
we have to look out for ourselves.

333
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:59,030
Right. But we're not just going to
fill our stomachs.

334
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,990
We're going to fill our wallets too!

335
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,270
How did you get that?

336
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:07,190
Smell this… And this!

337
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,790
Wow!

338
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:10,790
Hold this. It's a stack of cash!

339
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,840
See?

340
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,510
A brand-name wallet!

341
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,950
I've always wanted one.

342
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,590
Hey! A laptop!

343
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,790
A laptop.

344
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,070
Rich! Say it.

345
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,200
- Rich!
- Rich!

346
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,830
Let's celebrate!

347
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,842
Cheers!

348
00:28:39,422 --> 00:28:40,422
Fah?

349
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,750
What are you doing here?

350
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,030
You should be in your room.

351
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:51,731
I was worried about Jeu,
so I came down to check on him.

352
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,980
But please be careful.

353
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,060
I brought you some food.

354
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:02,734
Thank you.

355
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:07,950
Right. Jeu didn't transform.

356
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,350
Can we let him out now?

357
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,670
That's right.

358
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,750
I've been here for a long time now.
Let me out.

359
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:18,550
Not showing symptoms doesn't mean
you're not infected.

360
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,959
But you can see
that I'm not showing any symptoms.

361
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:29,750
Normally, suspected cases would be taken to
the lab for testing,

362
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,790
but here…

363
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,790
We don't have the equipment
to confirm anything.

364
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,710
All right.

365
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:53,152
So I have to stay quarantined here
for everyone's safety?

366
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:01,550
It's okay. You can still eat while quarantined.

367
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,270
Here… Eat up.

368
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:04,790
Fah.

369
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,670
You don't have to be so close to me.

370
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,350
What?

371
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,790
What if I suddenly bite you?

372
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,950
Hey. You're still joking around
at a time like this?

373
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:17,350
Eat up, quickly.

374
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,790
Here, let me feed you.

375
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,070
Eat a lot.

376
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,600
Here's a croissant.

377
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,870
Here's some water, Yayee.

378
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:54,990
Thank you.

379
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,917
We need to find the drug distributor
as soon as possible

380
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:00,790
before things get any worse.

381
00:31:09,609 --> 00:31:11,491
Shouldn't we focus on the food situation first?

382
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:20,790
Look, if we find the drug distributor,

383
00:31:21,430 --> 00:31:23,030
the situation will go back to normal.

384
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,151
I think we should deal with
the current problem first.

385
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,670
We can't.

386
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,310
We can't contact anyone.

387
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:33,510
The water and electricity have been cut off.
They're not sending us any food.

388
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,070
If they're not going to bring it to us,

389
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,310
we'll have to go get it ourselves.

390
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:43,270
Go through the infected?

391
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:45,270
Yeah.

392
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,270
Or are you scared?

393
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,350
Beam and I can go.

394
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:56,030
Fine.

395
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,030
I'll go,

396
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,550
but only because you asked me to.

397
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:07,830
And… If you want to invite Beam, you can.

398
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,994
Tell him to bring a broom or a mop
as a weapon.

399
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,950
You really don't want me to go with you?

400
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,870
It's better if you wait here, Beam.

401
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:21,964
Just open the door for us when we get back.

402
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,110
Run!

403
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,230
Run, go!

404
00:33:24,007 --> 00:33:25,007
Come on, Run!

405
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,510
Open the door now!

406
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,750
Open the door! Open the damn door!

407
00:34:00,469 --> 00:34:01,470
Open it!

408
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:02,470
Open the door!

409
00:34:06,363 --> 00:34:08,630
Open the door! Open the damn door!

410
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:15,990
Open it!

411
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:46,070
You should be the ones bringing the food,
not making us come out there.

412
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:49,070
You guys are fully armed.

413
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,350
You can easily fight off the infected.
What are you thinking?

414
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:54,470
We don't want to lose any more personnel
fighting the infected.

415
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:57,310
And we apologize for the current situation.

416
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:58,690
We did this

417
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:02,190
to force the drug distributor
to reveal themselves as soon as possible.

418
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,990
But the people inside… They're starving.

419
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,070
What's wrong with you?

420
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:15,070
Providing those relief packages
is delaying our mission.

421
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:16,990
People's lives come first.

422
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,990
Your duty is to protect the people.

423
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,117
Director asked me to give this to you.

424
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,859
We'll distract the infected.

425
00:35:29,622 --> 00:35:30,790
Hurry up and go inside.

426
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,950
Yutthasak, I understand your measures.

427
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:46,270
But you're making things harder
for people in this condo.

428
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:48,590
And it's hindering my job.

429
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:52,790
I'm not sure if your methods

430
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:56,910
are speeding up our mission
or slowing it down.

431
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:59,230
I'm doing what's necessary.

432
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,190
You just focus on doing your job.

433
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,956
You're ordering me around
like I'm your subordinate.

434
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:06,190
Then let me order you around, too.

435
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,172
Did you find the information

436
00:36:08,172 --> 00:36:10,870
I asked for about Hack?

437
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:14,085
We managed to retrieve part of the footage
from the CCTV hard drive.

438
00:36:14,085 --> 00:36:16,390
We have some information now.

439
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:19,188
But we've found another suspect,

440
00:36:19,188 --> 00:36:21,226
a middle-aged security guard.

441
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:24,131
He was acting suspiciously with Hack

442
00:36:24,131 --> 00:36:25,773
the day before the condo was locked down.

443
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:28,713
Are you saying there's another security guard
in this building?

444
00:36:28,713 --> 00:36:32,213
And he's involved with Hack's network?

445
00:36:32,213 --> 00:36:34,190
I can't say for sure yet.

446
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,590
I need more time to investigate.

447
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,150
How will you send the information?

448
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,350
I'll send it through the walkie-talkie.

449
00:36:42,496 --> 00:36:44,996
You can contact me anytime.

450
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,483
They're here, they're here.

451
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:01,470
- Can I have some?
- Me too.

452
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:03,039
Thank you very much.

453
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:04,132
Thank you.

454
00:37:06,470 --> 00:37:08,270
Has anyone seen the other security guard?

455
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:10,350
I haven't.

456
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:12,750
The head of security?

457
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:16,520
He went off duty the night before
the building was locked down.

458
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:23,990
Security Guard Ohn, where's your coworker?

459
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,750
You're acting like you're interrogating us.

460
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,750
Who are you?

461
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,590
Are you a cop?

462
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,270
Yes, we are cops.

463
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:37,902
What?

464
00:37:37,902 --> 00:37:39,270
Are you serious?

465
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,390
Both of them?

466
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:46,159
Why didn't you say so earlier?

467
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,750
Where is your coworker?

468
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:01,870
I haven't seen him.

469
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:04,790
But…

470
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,110
Before the building was locked down,

471
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:09,430
I saw Hack and my boss having a huge fight.

472
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,057
Has anyone else seen them fighting?

473
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:15,440
I have. I saw it before.

474
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,230
Do you know
what they were fighting about?

475
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:24,710
Well… I couldn't hear them.

476
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:29,270
When they saw me, they closed the door,
like they didn't want me to hear.

477
00:38:30,229 --> 00:38:31,230
Why say it at all?

478
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,990
Well, I saw them fighting.

479
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,790
That's all I know too.

480
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,590
I know who that security guard is now.

481
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,390
He's the head of security.

482
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,190
But he's gone missing.

483
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,230
Check the other camera angles.

484
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,550
Are you sure he's still in this condo?

485
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:02,070
I checked. He hasn't left the condo.

486
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:09,448
Then according to the CCTV footage,
where was he last seen?

487
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:14,830
I saw him go down
to the parking lot on floor G,

488
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,230
and he hasn't come out yet.

489
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,590
Hello, Director.

490
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,590
Is my dad okay?

491
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,310
Don't worry. Your father is fine.

492
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,870
What about Tarn and Joy?

493
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,262
Joy has completely

494
00:39:37,262 --> 00:39:38,563
turned into one of the infected.

495
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,350
But don't worry,

496
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:47,070
we'll take care of her as best as we can.

497
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:52,270
We're just waiting for you to find the culprit.

498
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,227
Maybe they have something

499
00:39:54,227 --> 00:39:56,950
that can cure your friend and
that child's mother.

500
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,833
So what we need to do now…

501
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,700
is to find the head of security.

502
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:10,310
Is this the head of security?

503
00:42:43,945 --> 00:42:45,952
The wound looks like
he was bitten by the infected.

504
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:56,950
I don't think so.

505
00:42:57,590 --> 00:42:58,910
This is a cover-up.

506
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:01,590
Why?

507
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:05,298
Look at the wound here.

508
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,150
Look at this.

509
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,910
The killer stabbed him right in a vital spot.

510
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:14,950
The infected… wouldn't use a weapon.

511
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,790
Look closer.

512
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,184
The bite marks were made…

513
00:43:25,414 --> 00:43:26,710
after the stab wound.

514
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,630
So the person who could have done this…

515
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:36,550
Yes?

516
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:38,550
Did you find the head of security?

517
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:42,310
We found him.

518
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,350
And he's dead.

519
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,076
And I found evidence that

520
00:43:48,076 --> 00:43:51,630
the head of security was involved in
the Next drug distribution network.

521
00:43:52,150 --> 00:43:54,910
He was killed to be silenced,
just like the trainer, Hack.

522
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:56,470
We're back to square one.

523
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,310
What is this?

524
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:42,590
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

525
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,310
What happened?

526
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:58,255
What was the situation?

527
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:06,710
I-I-I was just taking out the trash. And…

528
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,430
And then I saw him lying dead here.

529
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:14,234
A-A-And then Miss Fah c-c-came out

530
00:45:14,234 --> 00:45:15,710
when I screamed and…

531
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:29,994
Judging by the body, he was bitten recently.

532
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:33,790
You let Jeu out, didn't you?

533
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:36,110
Hey! Don't talk nonsense.

534
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:37,477
Why would I do that?

535
00:45:46,830 --> 00:45:48,990
Everyone, please go back to your rooms.

536
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,350
If you want to check on
the fitness room, follow me.

537
00:45:53,269 --> 00:45:54,270
Hey, Rangrong.

538
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:55,608
- Please go ahead.
- Rangrong,

539
00:45:56,137 --> 00:45:57,350
let's go back to our room.

540
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:59,535
Let them handle it. Let's go.

541
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:04,390
I've totally lost my appetite.

542
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:16,070
Jeu is still in the fitness room.
He hasn't escaped.

543
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,790
But from the looks of Naitan's body,

544
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:25,990
the wounds clearly show that he was killed
by one of the infected.

545
00:46:27,430 --> 00:46:31,550
That means there's another infected person
in this condo.

546
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:36,603
And we still haven't found the person
who killed the head of security.

547
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:40,310
Do you think these two cases are related?

548
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:43,590
I'm not sure how they're connected.

549
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,390
Yayee.

550
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:59,750
Don't go anywhere alone.

551
00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:04,910
And don't open the door for anyone
except us three.

552
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:09,550
Can I include Mommy too?

553
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:14,550
Yes, you can.

554
00:47:20,150 --> 00:47:21,900
Is it possible that…

555
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:26,004
there's an infected person… among us?

556
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:32,270
Why are we having so many meetings?

557
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:34,110
I'm tired of going up and down the stairs.

558
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:37,110
Have some sympathy for us old people.

559
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:39,550
I must apologize for this,

560
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:41,910
but an hour ago,

561
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:45,147
someone was just bitten to death
by one of the infected

562
00:47:45,147 --> 00:47:47,790
in the hallway on your floor,
Miss Sophida and Mr. Lawyer.

563
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:49,070
- What?
- Huh?

564
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:50,270
Hey.

565
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:52,670
Why are you mentioning my room?

566
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,830
Are you saying there's an infected person
in my room?

567
00:47:55,630 --> 00:47:58,270
That's right.
My room has nothing to do with it either.

568
00:47:58,270 --> 00:48:00,150
Rangrong just happened to witness it.

569
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:03,990
So there's an infected person in this condo?

570
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:04,990
Yes.

571
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:08,630
I need to find out who's infected.

572
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:13,350
Since someone was bitten to death,

573
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:15,914
it means, among the residents,

574
00:48:16,594 --> 00:48:17,750
there's an infected person.

575
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:23,190
It's Jeu.

576
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:26,190
He must have turned and bitten that resident.

577
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:29,150
Hey, Yoshi, don't talk nonsense.

578
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,910
I just brought Jeu some food.

579
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:32,910
He's not showing any symptoms like you said.

580
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:34,310
Then you should be careful.

581
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:39,070
You know the infected aren't like us
normal people, right?

582
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:41,710
You can't tell who's who.

583
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,331
If you're not careful,

584
00:48:43,331 --> 00:48:45,390
you might get bitten by Jeu
without realizing it.

585
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:50,310
Officer,

586
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:55,750
the people who went out to fight the infected
are the most likely to be infected.

587
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:59,177
And the ones who encountered them the most
are you and your wife.

588
00:48:59,177 --> 00:49:02,670
Especially you,
since you went out to fight them.

589
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:05,032
Yeah, that's right.

590
00:49:05,032 --> 00:49:09,070
You might have turned into one of those
rage people and bitten him,

591
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:11,110
and then pretended to investigate us,

592
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:14,270
just like… that foreigner before.

593
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:17,390
Stop talking nonsense.

594
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:20,350
You went out and encountered
the infected too, didn't you?

595
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:23,190
I don't know.
The public needs to know the truth.

596
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,504
- Ouch!
- Hey! Officer,

597
00:49:26,504 --> 00:49:29,070
using force against civilians like this
is illegal.

598
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:31,590
This isn't right.

599
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:34,990
Let go of me!

600
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:41,270
I know what I have to do.

601
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:42,470
Then do it.

602
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:50,830
Okay.

603
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,950
Let's finish this investigation.

604
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:05,677
Now we just have to wait for the results of
the repeated experiment.

605
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:09,870
We only tested it once.
We can't be sure if it worked.

606
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:16,580
But we can now confirm that Run's blood
can control the animals' rage.

607
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:31,270
Water usually triggers
a gradual transformation in the infected,

608
00:50:32,950 --> 00:50:36,070
but blood will cause an immediate reaction.

609
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:41,930
When they smell or see it,
they can't resist and will transform instantly.

610
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:45,670
This is the fastest way
to find out who's infected.

611
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:17,590
- Boo!
- Ah!

612
00:51:19,950 --> 00:51:20,990
It's your turn.

613
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:22,870
Go ahead.

614
00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:44,590
Your turn.

615
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:55,870
You… Go first.

616
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:58,150
Let's go together.

617
00:51:58,150 --> 00:51:59,150
Don't shift the blame.

618
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:00,590
Maybe you're infected but don't know it.

619
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:01,630
That's right.

620
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:04,503
You went out and met the infected,
and then you came back and told everyone.

621
00:52:04,503 --> 00:52:05,590
You must be infected.

622
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:06,910
Stop arguing.

623
00:52:07,643 --> 00:52:09,310
I'll check first.

624
00:52:13,985 --> 00:52:15,519
- Hey!
- Hey.

625
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:16,550
What are you doing?

626
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,630
Just in case she's infected, so I can hit her.

627
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,750
Do whatever you want.

628
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:22,790
I'm sure I'm not infected.

629
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:53,750
I'm not infected.

630
00:52:56,229 --> 00:52:57,230
Yes!

631
00:52:57,230 --> 00:52:59,070
Oh! I'm not infected.

632
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:01,430
Your turn. Go ahead, Por.

633
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:30,830
I'm not infected, right?

634
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:39,790
Go ahead.

635
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:41,750
You first.

636
00:53:42,324 --> 00:53:43,324
Go.

637
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:14,150
You're definitely infected.

638
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:19,710
Hey, calm down.

639
00:54:52,997 --> 00:54:53,998
Grandma Jin.

640
00:54:53,998 --> 00:54:55,235
- What?
- Grandma Jin?

641
00:54:55,235 --> 00:54:56,528
Grandma Jin has been close to Aim, right?

642
00:54:56,528 --> 00:54:58,398
If Aim is infected,
then you're at risk, Grandma.

643
00:54:58,398 --> 00:54:59,825
You have to quarantine yourself.

644
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:01,969
I don't know anything about any Next drug.

645
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,823
I didn't buy it. So how am I supposed to
have taken it?

646
00:55:03,823 --> 00:55:04,633
I don't know it.

647
00:55:04,633 --> 00:55:06,858
At the residents' meeting
to find the infected person...

648
00:55:06,858 --> 00:55:08,881
I told you Uncle Tao is sick.

649
00:55:08,881 --> 00:55:10,324
Uncle Tao wasn't there.

650
00:55:12,049 --> 00:55:14,321
Only you and I have access to that room!

651
00:55:14,321 --> 00:55:17,232
I told you, I didn't take it!

652
00:55:17,232 --> 00:55:18,827
Damn it!

653
00:55:23,843 --> 00:55:25,653
I'll give you three more days.

654
00:55:25,653 --> 00:55:29,198
And if we can't find a cure
for the infected, I'll have to…

655
00:55:32,852 --> 00:55:35,001
I'll have to eliminate all the infected.
