[This series is a work of fiction.
All characters, locations, and events are entirely fabricated.]

2
00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:14,187
This is the basic information
we have on the drug Next.

3
00:00:14,187 --> 00:00:15,768
Besides this drug,

4
00:00:15,768 --> 00:00:18,307
the disease can also be transmitted
through blood.

5
00:00:18,307 --> 00:00:21,749
He was selling supplements
at my workplace.

6
00:00:21,749 --> 00:00:23,467
Any bite or scratch
that comes into contact

7
00:00:23,467 --> 00:00:25,820
with infected blood

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,137
can also cause infection.

9
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:29,188
Is there a cure?

10
00:00:29,188 --> 00:00:30,438
Still nothing.

11
00:00:30,438 --> 00:00:31,915
You mean we can't control
this disease at all?

12
00:00:31,915 --> 00:00:33,212
Exactly!

13
00:00:33,212 --> 00:00:35,789
That's why I need your help.

14
00:00:37,086 --> 00:00:41,140
I really want you to move to a better place.

15
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,720
So, you've accepted the mission?

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,728
In exchange for a condo.

17
00:00:47,144 --> 00:00:49,051
I'll take this one.

18
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:53,311
It's beautiful, like a dream, isn't it?

19
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:55,280
On the CCTV footage,

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,934
that man went into The Breathe Condo.

21
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:01,215
That day, when I was fighting with Tarn, I…

22
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,400
Have you had any symptoms since then?

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,005
No.

24
00:01:09,298 --> 00:01:11,387
Please be strong, Mom.

25
00:01:11,387 --> 00:01:13,327
You have to get better.

26
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:32,113
The government hasn't released
any information about this.

27
00:01:36,658 --> 00:01:37,865
Top!

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,160
I said open the door!

29
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,623
Top!

30
00:01:47,239 --> 00:01:48,156
Top!

31
00:01:48,156 --> 00:01:49,868
Run!

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,920
Who are you to take away
other people's happiness?

33
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,920
To everyone watching this livestream,
please share this as much as possible.

34
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:26,751
I'm currently at a location
in the heart of Bangkok.

35
00:02:28,286 --> 00:02:30,446
This isn't a hospital,

36
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,200
but there's a morgue here,

37
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,479
filled with the bodies of infected people.

38
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,666
And there are many infected patients
waiting to be treated.

39
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,795
There's been no information released
from the government at all.

40
00:02:57,795 --> 00:03:00,639
But if this disease escapes,

41
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,440
your family and the people you love,

42
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,120
will get infected and die.

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,621
And you won't be able to
do anything about it.

44
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,479
You'll be the one
left with the most pain.

45
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:22,665
Let's expose this together
until we get answers.

46
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:41,263
[Contact the morning news.]

47
00:03:41,263 --> 00:03:42,521
[Contact a psychic too.]

48
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:43,866
[Top, where is it?]

49
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:45,094
[Better get Ghostbusters.]

50
00:03:45,094 --> 00:03:46,431

[Happiness]

[Shocking footage, zombies attack!]

54
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,760
Take care of it.

55
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:07,818
Yes, Director.

56
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:22,298
[Shocking footage, zombies attack!]

57
00:06:33,174 --> 00:06:36,068
In a situation like this,
aren't you going to do anything?

58
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,180
It's too risky.

59
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:40,135
We've already lost a lot of people.

60
00:06:40,665 --> 00:06:42,232
We can't risk any more.

61
00:06:42,232 --> 00:06:44,327
You won't risk your personnel?

62
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,440
If this reaches the higher-ups,
you could be dismissed.

63
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,240
Given the current situation,
I have to let it be for now.

64
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,560
Suit yourself.

65
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,976
But you know what you're doing, right?

66
00:07:27,365 --> 00:07:28,430
Those people…

67
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,521
Why…

68
00:07:33,592 --> 00:07:35,912
Do you still have something else
you haven't told us?

69
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,248
Tell me!

70
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,180
Those people you saw are the infected.

71
00:07:53,713 --> 00:07:58,870
That room is for detaining those
who have been infected for more than 21 days.

72
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,574
We have to keep them on life support,
feeding them, preserving their bodies.

73
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,155
Then why did you put them
in that kind of room?

74
00:08:17,154 --> 00:08:18,391
It's like a morgue.

75
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,280
Technically, those people are already dead.

76
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,680
But this is a new situation for us
and our society,

77
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:37,470
so we decided to preserve their bodies.

78
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,840
That's all we can do for now.

79
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,810
Does that mean they can't return to normal?

80
00:08:55,833 --> 00:08:59,754
This is the infection report
based on our research and data.

81
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,080
There are hundreds of them.

82
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:18,320
From the data we've analyzed so far,
this disease has a duration of about 21 days.

83
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,440
The infected will undergo physical changes.

84
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,080
Part of their brain is destroyed,
making them appear less human.

85
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,480
They start to lose consciousness
and their sense of self.

86
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:32,213
The symptoms are divided into three stages.

87
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,320
First stage, 1-7 days.

88
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,972
The infected don't show
significant physical changes yet.

89
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,840
They experience dry and flaky lips,
and their skin becomes paler.

90
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,440
During this stage, those infected through blood
show symptoms faster and more clearly

91
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,720
than those infected by the Next drug,
who show almost no symptoms.

92
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,320
However, even without symptoms,
they can still transmit the disease.

93
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,320
Second stage, 8-14 days.

94
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:03,689
Bite and scratch marks turn black,
and the necrosis spreads.

95
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:05,719
If infected by ingesting the drug,

96
00:10:05,719 --> 00:10:07,948
the veins in the arms, legs,
and neck will turn black.

97
00:10:09,387 --> 00:10:12,927
In this stage,
we found that Next can suppress the rage,

98
00:10:12,927 --> 00:10:14,887
but it can't cure the infected.

99
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,360
Third stage, 15-21 days.

100
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:23,605
If infected by ingesting the drug,

101
00:10:23,605 --> 00:10:26,352
the veins in the arms, legs,
and neck will also turn black.

102
00:10:26,352 --> 00:10:30,040
The entire body turns gray,
and the pupils turn red.

103
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,080
Complete loss of self-control.

104
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,484
In this stage, we haven't seen anyone recover.

105
00:10:35,484 --> 00:10:39,200
All officers handling the infected
must wear PPE suits

106
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,865
and must not have any open wounds
when caring for the infected.

107
00:10:44,492 --> 00:10:45,692
Top has a wound.

108
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:58,720
Your friend entered the morgue
with an open wound and blood on him.

109
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,320
The smell of blood
from the wound make them…

110
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,080
The blood triggered them,
causing them to wake up.

111
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,724
If it becomes necessary to stop the infected,

112
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,815
we have to use flashbangs
to disrupt their vision.

113
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,313
We try to avoid this method

114
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:25,197
because it can seriously harm the infected
and speed up their death.

115
00:12:12,693 --> 00:12:13,907
Are you okay, Run?

116
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:25,619
Top must be in a lot of pain.

117
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:33,947
No matter what,

118
00:12:36,462 --> 00:12:41,680
what he did… he truly believed
it was the right thing to do.

119
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:57,265
Let's keep moving forward.

120
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,619
I'm going home now.

121
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:04,658
I'll take you.

122
00:13:09,094 --> 00:13:10,387
I can go back on my own.

123
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:12,157
I'm okay.

124
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,953
Don't worry about me.

125
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,844
But…

126
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,614
Thank you,

127
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,822
but I can go back alone.

128
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:52,850
[Day 7]

129
00:13:58,228 --> 00:14:01,228
There's nothing but
folk singing shows these days.

130
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,146
This pork is delicious.

131
00:14:11,616 --> 00:14:12,994
My happiness?

132
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,731
Run! Run!

133
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:20,759
I want my mom to be comfortable.

134
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,200
She's been through a lot.

135
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,440
- Open the door!
- Just this much makes me happy.

136
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,920
Top!

137
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Yes?

138
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,560
Okay.

139
00:14:58,341 --> 00:14:59,489
I'll be right there.

140
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,603
Yes, okay. Bye.

141
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,320
Dad, I got things to do.

142
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
What about this? Finish it first.

143
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:12,304
I'm not very hungry.

144
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,022
Eat a lot, Dad.

145
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,680
Here you go.

146
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,108
This is your keycard for the room.
Take good care of it.

147
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,203
- Okay.
- Make yourself at home.

148
00:16:00,221 --> 00:16:01,701
I've taken care of everything.

149
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:49,571
Your wound is almost healed.

150
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Yeah…

151
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,320
Hey, Prach.

152
00:17:03,402 --> 00:17:05,442
If I become one of those rage things one day,

153
00:17:10,771 --> 00:17:12,306
please kill me.

154
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,506
You won't get infected,

155
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,080
and nothing will hurt you.

156
00:17:28,485 --> 00:17:30,165
I won't let you fight alone.

157
00:17:33,657 --> 00:17:37,897
But what we need to do now
is finding the person distributing the drug.

158
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Come on.

159
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:44,715
We have a lot to do.

160
00:17:51,363 --> 00:17:56,760
The Breathe Condo has three phases:
Building A, Building B, and Building C.

161
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,720
Each building has about 300-450 residents,

162
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,480
except for Building B, where we are,

163
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,878
which has about 50-80 residents
because not everyone has moved in yet.

164
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,791
There are two entrances and exits,

165
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,728
the front entrance
and the underground parking lot entrance.

166
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,400
There's a minimart in the common area.

167
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,942
Let's start with the building we're in.

168
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:23,320
Our building has 15 floors.

169
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,640
Only the 13th floor is unoccupied
because it's under renovation.

170
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,755
Let's get to know our neighbors.

171
00:18:30,447 --> 00:18:31,447
Uncle Tao,

172
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,329
Aunt Noi.

173
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,560
They've been living in this condo
from the beginning.

174
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,560
Aunt Noi, his wife, is the one
who manages everything in this condo.

175
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,920
Did you just move in?

176
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:44,160
Yes.

177
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:51,040
Maybe Uncle Tao lets Aunt Noi handle everything
like this because he's hiding something.

178
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:52,040
Yoshi.

179
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:53,685
Sophida.

180
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,684
Yoshi is Sophida's younger boyfriend.

181
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,466
He doesn't seem to have much money himself.

182
00:18:59,466 --> 00:19:02,720
Most of the money he uses is Sophida's.

183
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,166
Sophida is a health-conscious doctor.

184
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:10,058
She owns a small beauty clinic
near this condo.

185
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,142
Tattep.

186
00:19:12,142 --> 00:19:13,144
Net.

187
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,080
Tattep is a lawyer who
would do anything for money.

188
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,040
But it seems strange for a lawyer
to be selling drugs.

189
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:24,185
Anyway, we should keep him
on the suspect list.

190
00:19:24,185 --> 00:19:27,340
We have very little information on Net.

191
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,000
She's Tattep's wife.

192
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,539
If she's involved with the drugs,
then this couple might be working together.

193
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,667
And here's Jeu and Fah.

194
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:40,920
These two seem strange
because they don't have stable jobs.

195
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,268
I don't know where they get their money from.

196
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:43,531
Where's mine?

197
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,840
Go get it yourself.

198
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,372
And here's Grandpa Chan and Grandma Jin.

199
00:19:48,372 --> 00:19:50,320
They're retired civil servants.

200
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,080
Their grandson, Jee, is a content creator.

201
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,840
Do you suspect anyone in particular?

202
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,235
Everyone seems suspicious.

203
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,007
There are still many people
that we don't have information on.

204
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,600
I'll have Kai help look into it.

205
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,727
Director,

206
00:20:36,573 --> 00:20:37,893
we have a new case.

207
00:20:42,129 --> 00:20:43,337
You can handle it.

208
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Yes, sir.

209
00:21:05,835 --> 00:21:11,234
Hard to believe someone would do
something so awful in a place like this.

210
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,731
Hey…

211
00:21:17,731 --> 00:21:22,864
Do you think everyone will believe
that we're actually married?

212
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,404
Should we do something
to make it look more convincing?

213
00:21:33,123 --> 00:21:38,920
Like, right now,
we have no proof that we're actually married.

214
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,335
Plus, we're both cops.

215
00:21:41,335 --> 00:21:44,125
If we slip up, we could be exposed.

216
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,400
I think we need some proof.

217
00:21:55,505 --> 00:21:57,785
We should have engagement rings.

218
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,765
- I got it.
- Okay.

219
00:22:26,654 --> 00:22:27,775
A flower ring?

220
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,040
But if we want to make it look real…

221
00:22:33,795 --> 00:22:35,155
We should use real rings, right?

222
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,840
Come on… Give me your hand.

223
00:23:03,524 --> 00:23:04,743
Wow, it looks…

224
00:23:06,305 --> 00:23:07,800
Look at this.

225
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,120
And this is my ring.

226
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,880
Put it on me, will you?

227
00:23:22,954 --> 00:23:23,954
Here.

228
00:23:26,818 --> 00:23:27,818
Thanks.

229
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,690
Now we're undercover.
We can continue investigating.

230
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,280
273 baht.

231
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,800
Okay, I'll scan.

232
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,560
All done.

233
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,561
Okay.

234
00:23:49,957 --> 00:23:51,896
Dr. Beam… You forgot something.

235
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:54,102
Oh… Thank you.

236
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,840
I'll take these two bottles.

237
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,841
Beam?

238
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,645
- Yes?
- Is that you, Beam?

239
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,115
Yes.

240
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:09,395
I'm Run.

241
00:24:11,932 --> 00:24:13,841
I was a year younger than you
in high school.

242
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,840
Run? Ah…

243
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,040
You live here?

244
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:23,400
Yes, I live here.

245
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,202
I'm in Building B.
Which building are you in?

246
00:24:26,202 --> 00:24:27,362
I'm in Building B too.

247
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,920
I never thought you'd be staying here too.

248
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,320
By the way… You're a doctor now?

249
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,240
Yes.

250
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,240
You know each other?

251
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,280
Yes.

252
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,160
This is my senior from high school.

253
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:57,600
Beam, this is Prach. He's my--

254
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,880
I'm Run's husband.

255
00:25:00,174 --> 00:25:01,774
Oh, I see.

256
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,560
That's great. It's good to have someone
Run knows in the condo.

257
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,560
We can help each other out
if anything comes up.

258
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,760
My name is Prach.

259
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,094
I'm Beam.

260
00:25:10,094 --> 00:25:11,134
Nice to meet you.

261
00:25:13,516 --> 00:25:15,480
Well then, I'll get going.

262
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,484
Alright.

263
00:25:28,647 --> 00:25:31,360
[Dr. Beam]

264
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,560
Suspect.

265
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,922
Nonsense.

266
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,080
No,

267
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,560
Dr. Beam is the most suspicious.

268
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,640
Well, whatever you say.

269
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,320
And next time, don't say you're my husband
in front of Beam again.

270
00:25:52,188 --> 00:25:53,946
I have to make everything
look convincing, right?

271
00:25:53,946 --> 00:25:55,626
We're trying to catch the drug dealer.

272
00:25:56,442 --> 00:25:58,322
But he's my senior.

273
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,240
How am I supposed to know who he is?

274
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,840
Everyone is a potential suspect.

275
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,240
We're on a mission here.

276
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,044
Yeah, yeah, I know.

277
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,844
But he's so cute.

278
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,080
It's a shame.

279
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,988
Had I known he'd grow up this fine,
I'd have shot my shot.

280
00:26:27,988 --> 00:26:30,115
[Dr. Beam]

281
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,439
I totally forgot.

282
00:26:55,124 --> 00:26:56,284
How are we going to sleep?

283
00:26:58,088 --> 00:26:59,194
This bed is so small.

284
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:07,051
Yeah, that's true.

285
00:27:08,388 --> 00:27:09,646
I'll sleep outside.

286
00:27:10,775 --> 00:27:13,015
Hey, hey, no way…

287
00:27:14,161 --> 00:27:16,234
We'll just sleep together.
Don't overthink it.

288
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,882
I can sleep on the couch.

289
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,154
I don't want to take advantage of you.

290
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,847
Here…

291
00:27:29,505 --> 00:27:30,519
Sleep on this side.

292
00:27:31,957 --> 00:27:32,963
Come on…

293
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,327
Sleep here. I'll give you the left side.

294
00:27:39,994 --> 00:27:41,794
I said come here.

295
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:54,915
This side is yours,

296
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,320
this side is mine.

297
00:28:00,749 --> 00:28:01,749
But…

298
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:05,769
if you touch me,

299
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,760
I'll beat you up.

300
00:28:13,512 --> 00:28:14,972
Let's use a pillow as a divider.

301
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,743
Are you asleep yet?

302
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,320

[Day 8]

304
00:31:43,507 --> 00:31:44,545
What's that?

305
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,613
Breakfast.

306
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:52,271
Sit down. Let's eat.

307
00:31:52,271 --> 00:31:53,840
Did you make all this yourself?

308
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,040
Yeah, of course.

309
00:31:55,728 --> 00:31:57,295
Come on, sit down now.

310
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,000
Come on, you can eat it.

311
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,408
Strange.
It's not strange.

312
00:32:07,098 --> 00:32:08,893
Do you want me to cut it up for you?

313
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,173
Here…

314
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:13,371
Try it.

315
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:17,151
How was it?

316
00:32:19,531 --> 00:32:21,084
You should open a restaurant.

317
00:32:21,084 --> 00:32:22,085
Of course.

318
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:24,063
That sausage…

319
00:32:25,364 --> 00:32:26,379
I bought it.

320
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:31,487
I bought it, but I cooked it.

321
00:32:40,538 --> 00:32:41,538
Coming.

322
00:32:48,745 --> 00:32:49,745
I'm here.

323
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,138
Hello.

324
00:32:55,138 --> 00:32:59,884
We're having a special residents' meeting
in the co-working space today.

325
00:32:59,884 --> 00:33:01,724
There's something important to announce.

326
00:33:03,037 --> 00:33:04,517
Oh… You're having breakfast.

327
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,840
Okay. My wife and I will be there soon.

328
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,216
- Oh.
- Thank you.

329
00:33:13,008 --> 00:33:14,729
Has everyone seen that video?

330
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:16,658
Have you?
Have you seen it?

331
00:33:16,658 --> 00:33:18,640
I'm currently at a location
in the city center.

332
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,000
This isn't a hospital,
but there's a morgue here,

333
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,286
filled with the bodies of infected people.

334
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:24,480
What do you think about it?

335
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,401
If this disease escapes, your family,

336
00:33:28,401 --> 00:33:31,167
the people you love,
will get infected and die.

337
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:33,802
Let's expose this together
until we get answers.

338
00:33:40,178 --> 00:33:41,840
I thought this meeting was important.

339
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,862
Jee. You're such…

340
00:33:45,284 --> 00:33:46,287
Excuse me,

341
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,700
what's the point of this meeting?

342
00:33:51,582 --> 00:33:53,988
Well, shouldn't we find a way
to protect ourselves from them?

343
00:33:59,682 --> 00:34:01,680
Well, we should find a way
to protect ourselves from them, right?

344
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,120
I'm asking you, please answer me.

345
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,480
What should we do?

346
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:08,760
This is like a movie I saw.

347
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:12,440
Yes, we have to find a way
to protect ourselves from them.

348
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,320
If they invade, what should we do?

349
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,640
Stock up on food?
Or should we close… close this place down?

350
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,973
No outsiders get through?

351
00:34:23,606 --> 00:34:24,609
Auntie,

352
00:34:26,018 --> 00:34:28,088
can you please take care of your grandson?

353
00:34:28,088 --> 00:34:30,920
Other people are trying to have
a serious conversation here.

354
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,924
I'm sorry.

355
00:34:32,512 --> 00:34:35,371
Jee! Have some manners!

356
00:34:35,371 --> 00:34:36,376
Grandma!

357
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:40,173
I can have manners.

358
00:34:40,173 --> 00:34:43,280
I just wanted to know
what the adults were talking about.

359
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,320
If I had to guess, you're probably believing
those rumors in the Line group chat,

360
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:53,600
and then imagining that
there are zombies in this world.

361
00:34:55,742 --> 00:34:56,862
What do you mean?

362
00:34:58,231 --> 00:34:59,749
It's fake news, Grandma.

363
00:34:59,749 --> 00:35:01,400
Zombies only exist in movies.

364
00:35:02,898 --> 00:35:03,898
If you don't believe me,

365
00:35:05,235 --> 00:35:06,389
watch the end of the video.

366
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,000
Coming soon to all theaters.

367
00:35:19,648 --> 00:35:21,728
See? See? See?

368
00:35:24,154 --> 00:35:25,360
He posted it himself!

369
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,705
But… When I watched it,
it didn't have this ending.

370
00:35:28,705 --> 00:35:31,400
If you don't believe me,
go watch the full video again, Auntie.

371
00:35:34,858 --> 00:35:37,474
I've been putting up with this to see
how far you'd take it.

372
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,880
Happy Horror.
Coming soon to all theaters.

373
00:36:03,176 --> 00:36:04,976
If Jee is the drug dealer,

374
00:36:05,889 --> 00:36:08,580
he's probably one who doesn't know anything
about the drug's effects.

375
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,820
Let's rule Jee out for now.

376
00:36:12,164 --> 00:36:14,164
What about Tattep?
What do you think?

377
00:36:18,526 --> 00:36:19,931
We can't rule Tattep out.

378
00:36:31,093 --> 00:36:32,093
Mr. Lawyer.

379
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:36,283
I'd like to ask for your help.

380
00:36:36,283 --> 00:36:37,285
What is it?

381
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Here it is.

382
00:36:51,741 --> 00:36:54,581
You can win against this debt, you know.

383
00:36:55,303 --> 00:36:58,091
The creditor is charging an interest rate
higher than what's legally allowed.

384
00:36:58,091 --> 00:37:00,651
Not only do you not have to pay
the excess interest,

385
00:37:01,165 --> 00:37:02,925
you can even put them in jail.

386
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:06,620
So what do I have to do?

387
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,395
Are you going to hire me as your lawyer?

388
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,051
Or if you want to continue this conversation,
pay me 2,000 baht for a consultation.

389
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,628
I don't have any money.

390
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:20,166
What a waste of time.

391
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,200
Tattep is someone
who would do anything for money.

392
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,040
He might be involved in this.

393
00:37:43,667 --> 00:37:45,307
Do you think we've missed anyone?

394
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Good.

395
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,040
You're working your back muscles.

396
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,400
Got it.

397
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,009
Do three sets of this.

398
00:38:02,009 --> 00:38:03,009
The trainer.

399
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,000
I saw the trainer with Yoshi.

400
00:38:17,418 --> 00:38:19,261
Last night, when I went down
to get some stuff,

401
00:38:20,357 --> 00:38:21,658
I saw him with Fah.

402
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,610
See you the day after tomorrow.

403
00:38:47,481 --> 00:38:49,702
What did that man look like?

404
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,889
Did he have any distinguishing features?

405
00:38:51,889 --> 00:38:53,805
I don't remember his face…

406
00:38:55,253 --> 00:38:57,885
but I remember that day,

407
00:38:57,885 --> 00:39:01,905
he was wearing a black tracksuit
with some kind of logo.

408
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,120
Is this how you normally
position your legs?

409
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,400
Yes. When you kick, breathe out.

410
00:39:13,362 --> 00:39:14,786
When you lower your legs, breathe in.

411
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:15,245
Okay.

412
00:39:15,245 --> 00:39:17,924
This works all your leg muscles.

413
00:39:19,971 --> 00:39:21,690
Do you also live here?

414
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,320
No, I come and go.

415
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,129
- Oh…
- Yeah.

416
00:39:26,129 --> 00:39:27,411
It's tiring, isn't it?

417
00:39:27,411 --> 00:39:28,611
It is a little tiring,

418
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,160
but… it's for the money.

419
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,760
Stretch it out.

420
00:39:38,514 --> 00:39:40,331
- Good.
- Okay.

421
00:39:40,331 --> 00:39:44,480
Okay, let's move on to your upper body.

422
00:39:44,994 --> 00:39:45,994
Breathe in,

423
00:39:46,547 --> 00:39:49,267
breathe out like this.

424
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,127
15 reps, 3 sets.

425
00:39:51,127 --> 00:39:52,320
Okay.

426
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,680
Okay. Up.

427
00:39:54,249 --> 00:39:56,449
1, breathe out…

428
00:39:58,331 --> 00:39:59,791
Breathe out, hold it.

429
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:00,880
Good. Keep focusing.

430
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,550
Let's say I want to build muscle.

431
00:40:08,051 --> 00:40:12,320
Should I take any supplements or…
any other drugs?

432
00:40:19,637 --> 00:40:22,175
I think, at first,
you don't need supplements.

433
00:40:22,694 --> 00:40:27,040
Just eat regular food.
Protein and a balanced diet are enough.

434
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,430
- Okay, that's easy.
- It is.

435
00:40:32,707 --> 00:40:33,707
Good.

436
00:40:35,298 --> 00:40:36,378
I'll be back.

437
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,133
Thank you.

438
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,412
Hello.

439
00:40:41,412 --> 00:40:43,412
Let's work on your chest muscles,
the middle chest.

440
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,960
Hold it like this. Heave-ho.

441
00:40:50,328 --> 00:40:51,335
Good.

442
00:40:56,702 --> 00:40:58,062
Hello, Run.

443
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:00,126
Hello, Yayee.

444
00:41:00,677 --> 00:41:01,749
Are you tired?

445
00:41:01,749 --> 00:41:02,749
No.

446
00:41:03,789 --> 00:41:04,727
Oh, hello.

447
00:41:04,727 --> 00:41:05,734
Hello.

448
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:09,352
How old is Yayee?

449
00:41:09,352 --> 00:41:10,592
She's 8 years old.

450
00:41:11,842 --> 00:41:13,242
Such a lovely age.

451
00:41:15,263 --> 00:41:16,783
I don't really have time.

452
00:41:17,437 --> 00:41:18,997
Sometimes I feel sorry for her.

453
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,800
There are no other children in this condo
for her to play with.

454
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,740
She can play with me.

455
00:41:32,749 --> 00:41:33,803
Are you sure?

456
00:41:34,307 --> 00:41:36,040
Will it bother you?

457
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,786
But thank you for being kind to her.

458
00:41:38,786 --> 00:41:40,466
So she could have a friend to play with.

459
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:46,688
Then let me be Yayee's friend.

460
00:41:49,714 --> 00:41:50,819
Her childhood friend.

461
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:52,804
Thank you.

462
00:41:55,507 --> 00:41:57,282
Are you having fun, Yayee?

463
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:58,360
Yes.

464
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,720
Make it to the sky, alright?

465
00:42:04,609 --> 00:42:05,586
Kai…

466
00:42:05,586 --> 00:42:08,182
please check the information
on the trainer named Hack.

467
00:42:08,182 --> 00:42:10,342
I think he has access to many people
in this condo.

468
00:42:10,898 --> 00:42:13,738
Yes, sir. I'll look into it right away.

469
00:42:14,529 --> 00:42:16,889
I'll have something for you
by tonight, Inspector.

470
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:23,498
[Commander: Dead bodies at Get Hi pub.
You and Kai go check it out.]

471
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,211
Kai, we have a situation.

472
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,081
Get to the Get Hi pub right away.

473
00:42:29,081 --> 00:42:30,960
What about the trainer, Hack?

474
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,210
This takes priority.
We'll deal with Hack tomorrow.

475
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:34,215
Okay.

476
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,281
Run, come on!

477
00:42:37,837 --> 00:42:38,837
Coming!

478
00:42:44,723 --> 00:42:46,480
2, good.

479
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,640
Bring it up. 5, 4, good.

480
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:52,000
4, okay.

481
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:57,199
One more time. Hold it.

482
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,320
Good.

483
00:43:09,736 --> 00:43:11,613
Children can't play in this zone.

484
00:43:21,032 --> 00:43:24,167
I mean, this machine is difficult to use.

485
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:25,437
Not suitable for children.

486
00:43:26,054 --> 00:43:27,621
It could be dangerous to her.

487
00:43:31,507 --> 00:43:35,818
Yayee… Should we move to a different zone?

488
00:43:35,818 --> 00:43:37,235
Okay, Run.

489
00:43:37,235 --> 00:43:39,338
Which zone should we go to?

490
00:43:39,338 --> 00:43:40,882
How about that one?

491
00:43:40,882 --> 00:43:43,858
Can children play over there?

492
00:43:46,218 --> 00:43:47,642
Yes, they can.

493
00:43:47,642 --> 00:43:49,176
Oh, really?

494
00:43:49,176 --> 00:43:50,440
Thank him, quick.

495
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,034
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

496
00:43:55,921 --> 00:43:59,135
Inspector, we've checked it out,
and it seems to be a party.

497
00:43:59,135 --> 00:44:02,554
A private party. And importantly,
there's screaming coming from inside.

498
00:44:18,143 --> 00:44:20,830
Kai, go check upstairs.

499
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:22,676
Okay.

500
00:44:22,676 --> 00:44:23,682
Sing, come on…

501
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,280
Everyone, be careful.

502
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,287
Yes, sir.

503
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,400
I'm at the Get Hi pub.
Send your men over here now.

504
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,869
How do you use that machine?

505
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:26,849
I'll show you.

506
00:45:27,528 --> 00:45:28,528
Thank you.

507
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,201
Here, let me help you with that.

508
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,520
I can do it myself.

509
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,521
Okay.

510
00:46:07,105 --> 00:46:08,112
Ouch!

511
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,800
Yayee!

512
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,000
Are you okay, Yayee?

513
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,200
Are you hurt?

514
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,508
Does it hurt?

515
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,680
Here. Let me see.

516
00:46:29,675 --> 00:46:32,720
Stop! This is the police!
Put your hands up!

517
00:46:33,755 --> 00:46:34,760
Put your hands up!

518
00:46:35,852 --> 00:46:36,917
Hands up high!

519
00:46:36,917 --> 00:46:38,920
I… I don't know what's happening.

520
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:39,923
This is the police!

521
00:46:41,041 --> 00:46:42,048
Hands up!

522
00:46:44,473 --> 00:46:45,680
There's blood everywhere!

523
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,527
Watch out!

524
00:47:02,493 --> 00:47:03,813
Stop! Hands up!

525
00:47:25,961 --> 00:47:26,968
Stop!

526
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:53,476
What do we do, Inspector?

527
00:47:55,087 --> 00:47:56,141
There are so many of them!

528
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,048
Everyone, be careful.

529
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,589
They're not normal.

530
00:48:02,388 --> 00:48:04,978
Everyone, get out of the building
and seal it off!

531
00:48:04,978 --> 00:48:05,985
Retreat. Quick!

532
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,671
Does it hurt?

533
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,579
Boo-boo goes away!

534
00:48:53,118 --> 00:48:54,118
Run!

535
00:49:18,194 --> 00:49:19,314
Lock the door!

536
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:23,280
Quickly! Go!

537
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:24,280
Okay, it's done.

538
00:49:30,196 --> 00:49:31,203
Is everyone safe?

539
00:49:58,226 --> 00:49:59,226
Close your eyes.

540
00:50:30,631 --> 00:50:31,631
Hey!

541
00:50:35,844 --> 00:50:36,844
Are you okay, Run?

542
00:50:37,676 --> 00:50:38,676
Take it easy.

543
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:43,416
What about the back?

544
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:45,686
The back is secured.

545
00:50:50,557 --> 00:50:51,564
Where's Kai?

546
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:28,191
Kai…

547
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,343
Kai…

548
00:52:28,171 --> 00:52:30,258
So she's still alive?

549
00:52:31,015 --> 00:52:32,908
She's alive for now.

550
00:52:32,908 --> 00:52:34,272
And we need your help.

551
00:52:41,499 --> 00:52:44,520
We have to quarantine ourselves for seven days.

552
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,032
- Who said we have to quarantine?
- How are we supposed to work?

553
00:52:46,032 --> 00:52:47,147
Where are we supposed to quarantine?

554
00:52:47,147 --> 00:52:49,123
You can stay in the maid's room
downstairs for now.

555
00:52:50,592 --> 00:52:52,091
What the heck is that?

556
00:52:52,091 --> 00:52:55,318
The infected are now spread
throughout the entire condo complex.

557
00:52:56,082 --> 00:52:58,714
We need to find out who's behind this.

558
00:52:59,273 --> 00:53:00,984
Some of the officers we sent

559
00:53:00,984 --> 00:53:02,085
have become infected.

560
00:53:04,734 --> 00:53:06,718
Initiate the emergency response plan.

561
00:53:07,241 --> 00:53:08,358
Yes, sir.
