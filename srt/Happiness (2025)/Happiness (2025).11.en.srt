[This series is a work of fiction.
All characters, locations, and events are entirely fabricated.]

2
00:00:14,988 --> 00:00:17,460
I thought we would
graduate high school together.

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,905
Why did my dad have to move now?

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,790
Do you think if we go our separate ways,
we'll still be as close?

5
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,095
Of course. You're going to end our friendship
just like that?

6
00:00:33,435 --> 00:00:36,516
How would I know?
What if you get tired of me?

7
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,203
I know I have a sharp tongue.

8
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,703
Yeah, that's true.

9
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,340
But if you move away,
there's no one better than me, right?

10
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,775
Always joking. Never serious.

11
00:00:54,775 --> 00:00:58,012
Hey, I'm serious now.

12
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,526
What if… I was dying?

13
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:08,195
Would you leave me?

14
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,198
Here's a gift for the future Lieutenant.

15
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,099
Yeah, right, to protect you from bullets.

16
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,588
Thanks a whole lot, then.

[Happiness]

18
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,905
Don't come out. The infected are on the loose.

19
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:32,900
Don't come out. The infected are on the loose.

20
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:44,601
Don't come out. The infected are on the loose.

21
00:03:55,005 --> 00:03:57,704
Don't come out. The infected are on the loose.

22
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,713
Don't come out…

23
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,905
Everyone.

24
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,740
This is the only series script
Jeu has managed to write after all this time.

25
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,553
We've fought for our lives, fought the disease,
fought each other for too long.

26
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:47,940
If it's just a disease,
we have to learn to live with it,

27
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,180
just like we're living with Jeu and Aim.

28
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,408
Let's be happy from now on.

29
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:06,180
My happiness is just being with the one I love.

30
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,501
Will we really get through this?

31
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,940
Yes,

32
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,961
we'll get through this together.

33
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,211
I'll protect you.

34
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,500
Don't come out.

35
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,805
But now, that happiness… is slipping away.

36
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,269
The infected are on the loose.

37
00:05:40,146 --> 00:05:41,740
Don't come out.

38
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:46,100

[Happiness
Screenplay by Mouthy Jeu]

40
00:05:57,698 --> 00:05:58,714
Take one.

41
00:06:00,136 --> 00:06:01,175
Action!

42
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,820
If life were a movie,

43
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,801
this movie would be about a group of people

44
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:08,500
searching for happiness
in the midst of survival.

45
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,060
Look, who's here?

46
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:13,500
Everyone thinks they're a good person,

47
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,820
but in times of conflict,

48
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,094
when there's barely enough water to drink,

49
00:06:19,094 --> 00:06:21,994
it's no surprise people put themselves first.

50
00:06:23,815 --> 00:06:27,260
We're not taking advantage of each other.
We're just trying to survive.

51
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:30,498
What are we surviving for? Happiness?

52
00:06:30,498 --> 00:06:31,777
You're too close, Auntie.

53
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:33,500
Step back just a little.

54
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,500
But you have to marry her, no matter what.

55
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,643
Would anyone be happy if they were
the only one left in the world?

56
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:50,159
In movies where the protagonist is
the last one alive, they're always so lonely.

57
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:55,506
Wouldn't it be better to have someone,
or many people, to be with?

58
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,380
Hate doesn't really exist. It comes and goes.

59
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,860
But happiness never goes away,
as long as we feel it for each other.

60
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,860
If you don't marry her, I will.

61
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,406
We've been hating each other too much,
and it's pointless.

62
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,006
If life were a movie,
it should be called Happiness.

63
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,860
Do you know what's going on out there?

64
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,820
It's full of infected people.

65
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,500
How do you know
there are infected people outside?

66
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:50,159
There are some inside too.
This one, this one, and this one.

67
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,002
Epilogue from the movie Happiness,
original screenplay by Mouthy Jeu.

68
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,209
Prach?

69
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:23,580
I set an alarm. Don't get so caught up reading
that you forget to eat.

70
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,058
Are you worried about me?
You could have just called.

71
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,180
What's up?

72
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,940
- Let's meet at our usual place.
- Are you free?

73
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,507
You know me so well.

74
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,540
I told you so much,
but you didn't tell me anything.

75
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,191
Why can't I reach you?
Do you know what's happening?

76
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,140
Run…

77
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,208
I was bitten. I'm infected now.

78
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,807
If you're watching this,

79
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,035
I might have already turned.

80
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,820
I probably won't remember you.

81
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,060
Run,

82
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,280
if you see me when I'm infected,

83
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,411
please… don't come near me.

84
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,995
Right. Don't forget about
the water and electricity.

85
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,700
I'm scared.

86
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,214
I'm scared. I'm scared, I'm really scared.

87
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,702
That's enough. Please stop.
Please. Please stop.

91
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,469
I wish for us to get through this together.

92
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:29,780
- Power is back!
- Power is back! The lights are back on!

93
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,660
The power is back.

94
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,399
The water must be back too.
We can finally take a shower.

95
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,820
That's great! So great!

96
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,540
This is a beautiful moment.

97
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,580
This will make a great story.

98
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,220
What? What is it, dear?

99
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:48,420
- The water and electricity are back!
- The water and electricity are back!

100
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,536
- The water and electricity are back.
- Hey, everyone,

101
00:12:50,536 --> 00:12:52,705
You're so happy
you forgot to rehearse my script.

102
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:58,483
Hey, I think we should gather everyone

103
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:01,020
and plan what to do next.

104
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:04,580
Even if the water and power are back,
we still can't go outside.

105
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,420
I'll go get the others.
Let's meet at the co-working space. Okay?

106
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,180
- Oh, okay.
- Let's do that.

107
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,460
Okay?

108
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,220
Aim and Jeu.

109
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,801
Hang in there. It'll get better.

110
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,660
I can wait just fine.

111
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,211
Okay.

112
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,900
Where are you going, Prach?
Can I come with you?

113
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,301
N-N-No, Yayee!

114
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,306
Well…

115
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,303
I think it's better if you stay in the room.

116
00:14:05,134 --> 00:14:09,340
It's very dangerous outside right now.

117
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,808
You have to stay inside
and wait for Run to come back.

118
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:21,820
And don't open the door for anyone…
not even for me.

119
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,399
Okay, Yayee?

120
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,908
Good girl.

121
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:10,715
Put the gun down. It's me, Por.
Please, put it down.

122
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,220
Officer, there's a residents' meeting
at the co-working space.

123
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,313
Are you coming?

124
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,300
Yes.

125
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,793
Let's go then. Oh my, you scared me.

126
00:15:59,184 --> 00:16:01,270
Is anyone else coming?

127
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,421
Por should be here soon.

128
00:16:02,421 --> 00:16:03,520
Okay.

129
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,486
And Mr. Tattep?

130
00:16:07,428 --> 00:16:08,428
That…

131
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,723
What are you doing here?

132
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,300
I'm very hungry.

133
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,308
Don't be afraid.

134
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,999
I came here to turn myself in.

135
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,400
There's nothing to eat outside.

136
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,420
Were you bitten?

137
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,180
No, I wasn't.

138
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,940
Don't worry.

139
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,580
Please give me something to eat.

140
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,580
Don't come any closer!

141
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,820
Don't be afraid of me.

142
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,820
- Stay back. Don't come any closer.
- I just want something to eat.

143
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,540
- Please.
- Stop!

144
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,940
Please give me something to eat. Anything.
I'm really hungry.

145
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,300
I don't trust him.

146
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,201
Please.

147
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,912
Stop! Back off!

148
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,999
I said stop!

149
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,024
Back off!

150
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:09,796
Watch out.

151
00:17:34,993 --> 00:17:35,993
Be careful.

152
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,824
Yayee! Yayee!

153
00:18:16,714 --> 00:18:19,180
- Yayee, get out of the way!
- Watch out!

154
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:25,099
Yayee, run!

155
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,580
Yayee!

156
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:32,376
Yayee!

157
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,940
Yayee!

158
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,460
Yayee!

159
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,900
He's not moving.

160
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,093
I think he's dead.

161
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,194
He must be dead. He's completely still.

162
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,834
His neck is broken.

163
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,597
I don't dare go near him.

164
00:20:04,205 --> 00:20:06,000
Come on. Yayee, get inside.

165
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,780
Yayee?

166
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,584
Yayee?

167
00:20:16,786 --> 00:20:18,293
Watch out!

168
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,905
Did one of the infected scratch her?

169
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,192
Why did you let her out?

170
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,091
Come on. Yayee, get inside.

171
00:20:34,706 --> 00:20:35,713
Come on.

172
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,187
Prach…

173
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,290
Is that infected blood?

174
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,180
Let me see.

175
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,609
Run.

176
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:02,872
Run? Run!

177
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,384
Yes…

178
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,633
I was bitten by one of the infected.

179
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,740
R-R-Run!

180
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:17,660
Why didn't you tell me?

181
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,030
Is this why you didn't want me to come back?

182
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,197
I just wanted you to remember…

183
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:29,180
Prach?

184
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,331
Let go, Run!

185
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,740
You have the antibodies?

186
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,860
Yes. Come here.

187
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,420
Run!

188
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,802
Run, it stings.

189
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,627
Stop, Run.

190
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:00,009
If you use that on me,
Yayee won't have a chance.

191
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:04,947
Go!

192
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,155
Damn it.

193
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,629
It'll sting a little, Yayee.

194
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,907
Prach!

195
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,743
Prach?

196
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,460
Prach.

197
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:46,980
Prach. Get a hold of yourself, Prach.

198
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,402
Take a deep breath, Prach.

199
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,660
Prach. I'll fight alongside you,

200
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:55,246
just like you told me you would, Prach.

201
00:22:55,246 --> 00:22:57,340
Let go of me! Go away!

202
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,940
- I won't go!
- I said go!

203
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,612
- I won't!
- Go!

204
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,894
I can't leave you!

205
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,808
You've never left me!

206
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,582
I don't want to hurt anyone, especially you.

207
00:23:12,312 --> 00:23:13,319
Prach,

208
00:23:13,837 --> 00:23:15,496
you're going to be okay.

209
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:16,740
Prach.

210
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,221
Get a hold of yourself, Prach!

211
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,996
Prach! Please!

212
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,940
I can't be on my own.

213
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,380
We still have the residents to take care of.

214
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,387
Go!

215
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,504
I can't do it alone, Prach.

216
00:23:48,907 --> 00:23:50,420
Prach?

217
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,700
Get a hold of yourself, Prach. Stay with me.

218
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,596
Look at me, Prach!

219
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,458
Look at me! Prach!

220
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,070
Bite me.

221
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,235
Bite me.

222
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,107
Eat.

223
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,029
Eat!

224
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,140
Go! I said get out!

225
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,180
No!

226
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,780
Prach, please look at me.

227
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,788
Prach!

228
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:45,610
What if… I was dying? Would you leave me?

229
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,811
Crazy? How could I leave you?

230
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,021
Did you have to do this?

231
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,940
I panicked. It all happened so fast.

232
00:26:01,118 --> 00:26:02,609
Can you get up?

233
00:26:02,609 --> 00:26:03,716
Yes.

234
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,307
I'll go check on Yayee.

235
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,802
We're almost there, Yayee.

236
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,020
Hey, make sure it's safe!

237
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,220
- Yayee.
- Excuse me.

238
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,592
What happened to you, sweetie?

239
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,706
Please take care of Yayee.
She's running a slight fever.

240
00:26:53,706 --> 00:26:56,420
Okay. I'll take care of her.

241
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:59,420
You two be careful.

242
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:04,045
The situation is so bad.
Why haven't the authorities found a cure yet?

243
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:06,709
And when are they going to let us out?

244
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,020
I don't have an answer yet.

245
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,076
But I promise I'll keep everyone safe.

246
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,812
Officer, you don't look well. Are you okay?

247
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,601
Prach is fine. He's just a little tired.

248
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,216
He'll protect everyone, like always.

249
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,587
Yes.

250
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,603
What was that sound?

251
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,420
That sound… It must be the infected.

252
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:57,020
- Oh my god!
- Sounds like there are a lot of them.

253
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,860
What are we going to do?

254
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,798
- What are we going to do?
- Calm down.

255
00:28:01,798 --> 00:28:05,621
If they can't see or hear us, they won't come.

256
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,587
Quiet.

257
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,699
What should we do then?

258
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,799
I've wasted too much time with you.

259
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,580
Money, manpower, resources.

260
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,940
You have no idea what I've lost.

261
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,103
If my family gets infected,
how will you take responsibility?

262
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:57,109
The child's heart rate is very slow.
If it drops any lower, he could die.

263
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,589
I'll resolve this as quickly as possible.

264
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,098
You know we didn't release the disease
this time, right?

265
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,923
Yes, I know.

266
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,620
Many people close to the leader are infected.

267
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:23,660
But what's more important is that the economy
we're controlling could collapse at any moment.

268
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,420
I've already told you,
we know who the drug distributor is.

269
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:30,340
And we're working on catching them.

270
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,700
If we do, you'll get the cure you want.

271
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:40,260
So, you're still looking for the person
with the antibodies, right?

272
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,163
If you get the cure you want,

273
00:29:43,163 --> 00:29:45,253
the person with antibodies
won't matter anymore.

274
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,406
Good. Then I should hear good news soon, right?

275
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,401
Arisara, have the Special Control Unit
evacuate everyone from Building B.

276
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,940
What about the residents
in the other buildings?

277
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,371
How do you want us to handle them?

278
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:19,352
I only want the drug distributor.
The rest is up to you.

279
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:45,020
We'll split up.

280
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,860
Team A, help the residents quarantined
in the fitness room.

281
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:50,987
Team B, come with me through the parking lot.

282
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,834
Team C…

283
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,700
spread out and help the residents
in the other buildings.

284
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:01,140
Use rubber bullets
to stop the infected. Got it?

285
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,145
Yes, ma'am!

286
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,519
Go! Quickly! Go!

287
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,140
There's been a change of plans.

288
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,592
The Special Control Unit is heading up
to evacuate everyone from Building B.

289
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,580
What about the people quarantined
in the fitness room?

290
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,492
Don't worry. They're going there too.

291
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,780
What about the people in the other buildings?

292
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,218
Are you going to help them too?

293
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,922
Are you going to let the other residents die?

294
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,100
I'll deal with the other buildings later.

295
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,384
What should we do now?

296
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,940
The authorities will be here to help us soon.

297
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:02,802
For now, let's look around and find something
we can use as a weapon.

298
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,107
Take your pick.

299
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,989
Shouldn't we wait for them to come get us?

300
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,700
The situation isn't looking so good right now.

301
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,494
The number of infected is rising.

302
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,819
If we wait for them to come,
it might be too late.

303
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,909
But if we push through,
we might have a better chance of survival.

304
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:44,900
Run and I will clear the way.

305
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,860
Everyone, follow us.

306
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,380
Okay. That's the plan.

307
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:52,268
Don't worry, Grandpa Chan.
We'll help each other.

308
00:32:52,268 --> 00:32:53,787
We'll look out for each other.

309
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:56,966
Hold on.

310
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:02,502
The lawyer, Tattep, and Net are probably
still in their room.

311
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,606
Beam too.

312
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,980
Then… I'll go get them.

313
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,087
No, Run.

314
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,726
It's too risky.

315
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,027
Run…

316
00:33:19,425 --> 00:33:21,162
I'm turning into one of the infected.

317
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,740
Everyone will be in danger because of me.

318
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,505
You have to stay and protect them.

319
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,928
Trust me.

320
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,190
It's… better this way.

321
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,520
No way.

322
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,660
Here's the plan, everyone.

323
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,940
Prach.

324
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,860
Everyone, follow Run.

325
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,020
She'll lead you to the authorities.

326
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:52,014
And I… will go find the others.

327
00:34:05,182 --> 00:34:06,608
I'll go with you.

328
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,180
No, you can't.

329
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:09,660
It's--

330
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,140
I know what's happening to you.

331
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,500
I have nothing left to lose.

332
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,580
It's better to go together than alone.

333
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,909
Trust me. I'm ready.

334
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,780
Okay.

335
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:31,740
As soon as the unit enters the building,
we'll leave.

336
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,834
Okay. Got it.

337
00:34:45,274 --> 00:34:46,274
Go!

338
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,293
What was that sound?

339
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,488
What's happening outside?

340
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:01,027
Sounds like there are infected outside.

341
00:36:13,819 --> 00:36:15,119
Is everyone ready?

342
00:36:16,196 --> 00:36:18,890
Jee, lead the way. I'll be at the back.

343
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,180
See you outside.

344
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,987
You too.

345
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,351
Don't die.

346
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,700
See you downstairs.

347
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,380
I'm ready.

348
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:50,403
Let's go.

349
00:37:13,802 --> 00:37:15,619
Did you see the zombies?

350
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:19,867
What?

351
00:37:30,096 --> 00:37:31,104
What is it?

352
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,220
What's that sound?

353
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,380
When was the last time you took a deep breath?

354
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,580
This condo is like a breath of fresh air.

355
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:33,180
It's a powerhouse
that will help propel your life forward.

356
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,102
Grandma Jin will be safe, right?

357
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,900
That's right. I'm also worried about Jeu.

358
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,180
Should we go back for them?

359
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,980
Imagine how good it would be
to recharge your life…

360
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,366
Don't worry.

361
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,575
Just trust me.

362
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,700
Okay.

363
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,780
A home that's more than just a place to live.

364
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:55,800
The Breathe, the breath of life and family.

365
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:02,300
When was the last time you took a deep breath?

366
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,740
This condo is like a breath of fresh air.

367
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,233
It's a powerhouse
that will help propel your life…

368
00:39:09,233 --> 00:39:10,921
Please mind the gap…

369
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,186
Wait.

370
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,807
Okay, okay.

371
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,124
Be careful, be careful.

372
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,734
Be careful.

373
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,300
Close it! Close it! Close it!

374
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,798
- Are you okay?
- Will we make it?

375
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,900
We might have to regroup on another floor.

376
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,780
Let's go. I can't take it.

377
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,323
Any floor but this one.
I can't take it anymore.

378
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,340
When was the last time you took a deep breath?

379
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,620
This condo is like a breath of fresh air.

380
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,820
Let's go now.

381
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,394
Wait. Not yet.

382
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,740
Run, Por is not here.

383
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,300
Don't tell me he got dragged off
and eaten by the infected.

384
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:04,540
What? Has anyone seen Por?

385
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,300
No.

386
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,780
Never mind him.

387
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,417
Grandpa, help me.

388
00:42:08,417 --> 00:42:09,417
Wait.

389
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,229
Don't come any closer!

390
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,115
Help!

391
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:32,500
Take that!

392
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,519
Back off!

393
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:35,180
Go now! Go!

394
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,307
Grandpa!

395
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,220
Let's leave this place! Quick!

396
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,500
Come on! Let's go!

397
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,726
Go, quickly!

398
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:17,366
Run!

399
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,738
Protect everyone!

400
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,020
Is everyone alright?

401
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,700
No one got bitten, right?

402
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,500
There are still infected people
in the fitness room.

403
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,020
Did you send anyone to get them?

404
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,060
We've already sent a team to retrieve them.

405
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,860
Then split up. You, come with me.

406
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,820
Escort everyone out of the condo.

407
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:07,094
Capture all the infected,
but don't kill anyone.

408
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,404
Why are there so many of them?

409
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,831
It's a miracle I survived.

410
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:52,917
Wide open? Jackpot.

411
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,905
What are you waiting for? Take it all. Come on.

412
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:33,206
Aunt Noi, go ahead!

413
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:45,514
Don't come any closer! Don't come closer!

414
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,507
Auntie!

415
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,217
I'm okay. I'm fine.

416
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:53,827
Prach!

417
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,740
I'm fine. It's nothing. It's like exercising.

418
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,988
It's good that you're safe.

419
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,100
- Let's regroup.
- Let's go.

420
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,700
- Let's go.
- Come on. I'll lead the way.

421
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:27,406
Let's go, Run!

422
00:46:28,103 --> 00:46:28,780
Come on.

423
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,780
Go! Go ahead!

424
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,205
Quickly! Quickly! Quickly!

425
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,712
Please don't leave me!

426
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,260
Open the door!

427
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,262
Open the door.

428
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:53,300
Tattep!

429
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,900
Open the door!

430
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,340
Are there any infected with you?

431
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,660
Can you please open the door?
The infected are coming!

432
00:46:58,660 --> 00:46:59,900
Go to another room!

433
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,305
Why are you coming here?

434
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,300
- Go!
- Go quickly! Go!

435
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:06,660
Keep watch from outside.

436
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:07,667
Yes, ma'am!

437
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,318
The building is full of infected.
We're here to get you out.

438
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:17,205
Then… Let me get my valuables.

439
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,719
Just bring the divorce papers.

440
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:23,961
Let's go.

441
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,071
Let's go.

442
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:29,900
Hey, Por disappeared.

443
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:31,700
He suddenly left the group,

444
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,492
but I'm sure the infected didn't kill him.

445
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:36,927
I'll go look for them.

446
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,700
Please get everyone out of here.

447
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,660
Okay.

448
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:42,116
You have to help everyone.

449
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,610
Okay. Let's go.

450
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:47,144
You go ahead.

451
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,301
- Let's go.
- Let's go, let's go.

452
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,820
Lead the way.

453
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:55,820
Follow me.

454
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:08,620
Get in the elevator.

455
00:48:09,196 --> 00:48:10,205
Get in.

456
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,715
You two go first.

457
00:48:13,629 --> 00:48:14,918
Go on, quickly. Let's go.

458
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:17,100
Por?

459
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,460
What are you doing here?

460
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,063
- I-I-I just…
- Put those things down.

461
00:48:21,063 --> 00:48:22,260
Let's go.

462
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:26,060
- Go, quickly. Go!
- My stuff!

463
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,340
Get in there! Quickly!

464
00:48:31,918 --> 00:48:33,460
Officer?

465
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:34,717
- Come back!
- Come back!

466
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:49,907
Guess I'm doing this solo.

467
00:48:49,907 --> 00:48:51,340
Ma'am, where are you going?

468
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,780
Por!

469
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,100
So you're not going to help me at all?

470
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,302
Ungrateful.

471
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:40,980
I risked my life for you,
I did everything you asked.

472
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,007
I handled the accounts. I delivered the drugs.

473
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:49,220
I did all the dirty work.
I had to kill Hack and Uncle Tao,

474
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,860
to shut them up
so nothing would lead back to you.

475
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,580
I did all of it for you.

476
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:56,903
If this isn't ungrateful, what is?

477
00:49:58,140 --> 00:49:59,140
Fine…

478
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:03,201
If you're not helping me,
I'll let the police arrest me.

479
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,210
And I'll expose everything.

480
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,490
You were the one who killed Tao!

481
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:19,500
So what? Your husband blackmailed me first.

482
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,286
He's not as good as you think.

483
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:29,180
And another thing, Uncle Tao…
was already infected.

484
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:32,900
I just helped him die faster
so he wouldn't bite anyone else.

485
00:50:34,673 --> 00:50:35,906
You're evil!

486
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:40,780
I'll turn you in!

487
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,060
Go ahead and try.

488
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:45,529
I'll avenge Tao.

489
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:59,500
You're a nosy condo manager
to the very end, huh?

490
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,340
Just wait.

491
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:06,517
With all this blood, L1 will come
and take you to join your husband soon.

492
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,337
- Aunt Noi!
- Officer.

493
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,140
Aunt Noi, are you okay?
Why are you covered in blood?

494
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:08,620
The 13th floor.

495
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:11,180
There's an infected person there.
It's terrifying.

496
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,700
It bit Sophida to death.

497
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:18,700
Before she died,
I heard Sophida talking to a man.

498
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:22,180
The voice… It sounded like…

499
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,505
Aunt Noi? Aunt Noi?

500
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:37,790
We left Beam inside.

501
00:53:38,513 --> 00:53:41,498
We've evacuated almost everyone from the condo.

502
00:53:42,438 --> 00:53:45,908
If someone is still inside, we'll have to
regroup and come back for them later.

503
00:53:48,505 --> 00:53:50,114
I'll go back in to help him.

504
00:53:54,519 --> 00:53:56,169
So this means…

505
00:53:56,169 --> 00:53:58,229
You're the mastermind behind all of this.

506
00:53:58,229 --> 00:54:00,985
How many people have you infected and killed?

507
00:54:07,395 --> 00:54:09,019
You're one of them, aren't you?

508
00:54:11,111 --> 00:54:12,641
What are you really after?

509
00:54:12,641 --> 00:54:13,642
For free?

510
00:54:13,642 --> 00:54:17,595
If you're giving it away for free,
the world is doomed.
