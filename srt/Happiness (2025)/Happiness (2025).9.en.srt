00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:12,400
[This series is a work of fiction.
All characters, locations, and events are entirely fabricated.]

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,939
[Previously]

3
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:22,190
Stop! Don't hurt him!

4
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,815
When I examined Uncle Tao,
I didn't see any bite or scratch marks.

5
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:28,056
Did you give Uncle Tao any medicine?

6
00:00:28,056 --> 00:00:29,235
Just regular medicine.

7
00:00:29,235 --> 00:00:31,172
And some supplements.

8
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:35,023
The Next drug is
being distributed in many forms.

9
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:36,059
And more importantly,

10
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,517
none of the buyers seem to know
the effects of Next.

11
00:00:38,517 --> 00:00:40,291
Is it possible that Hack was killed

12
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,487
because he knew this drug turns people
into the infected?

13
00:00:42,487 --> 00:00:46,189
Maybe because he knew
the true identity of the culprit.

14
00:00:46,189 --> 00:00:48,998
The lab reported that
the rat that received Run's blood

15
00:00:48,998 --> 00:00:50,911
had become infected again and died.

16
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:54,423
Run's blood can't be used to develop a vaccine
at this time.

17
00:00:54,423 --> 00:00:56,940
The drug distributor must be
in The Breathe Condo.

18
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,184
If they created this disease,
they must have a cure.

19
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:04,409
Yes, sir. I have received it.

20
00:01:09,665 --> 00:01:10,800
Dinner is ready.

21
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:13,536
Da…

22
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:16,411
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

23
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:18,393
I'll give you three more days.

24
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:22,100
What's wrong with you?

25
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:24,750
You look like you've seen a ghost.

26
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:33,674
Go!

27
00:01:33,674 --> 00:01:37,240
Run away now! Run! Go!

28
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,161
- Where should I go?
- Just go! Run! Run!

29
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,400
- Where should I go?
- Just go!

30
00:01:58,728 --> 00:01:59,728
Don't!

31
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
Run away!

32
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,560
Uncle Tao!

33
00:03:21,962 --> 00:03:22,962
Stop!

34
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:53,511
[Happiness]

35
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:04,543
Uncle Tao!

36
00:05:04,543 --> 00:05:05,543
Run?

37
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:08,011
Uncle Tao!

38
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:09,538
Run!

39
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:12,276
Uncle Tao has been shot!

40
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:15,921
Who killed Uncle Tao?

41
00:05:17,714 --> 00:05:20,080
Tao!

42
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,698
Uncle Tao is dead.

43
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:22,698
Tao!

44
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,491
Tao!

45
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,505
Tao? Tao?

46
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
Tao?

47
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:38,272
Tao, wake up. Tao.

48
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:42,848
Wake up, Tao! Wake up, Tao!

49
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,021
Tao, wake up! Wake up right now!

50
00:05:47,686 --> 00:05:48,686
You guys!

51
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,520
Why did you kill him?

52
00:05:52,818 --> 00:05:54,120
No, we didn't shoot him.

53
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,317
Don't lie to me.

54
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,440
These two didn't shoot Uncle Tao.

55
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,560
If not these two, then who did?

56
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,840
They're clearly holding guns.

57
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:10,566
You said it was just a quarantine.
Just a quarantine.

58
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:12,200
Just a quarantine!

59
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,557
Ma'am, please calm down.

60
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,829
Why did you kill him?

61
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,369
Why did you kill him?

62
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
Tao.

63
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,008
Tao…

64
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:31,760
Wake up. Wake up.

65
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,799
Please wake up, Tao.

66
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,880
These two cops killed Tao.
They said it was just a disease.

67
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,520
That means he was just sick.

68
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,289
Why did you have to kill him?

69
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:49,840
Another one dead?
Poor Uncle Tao.

70
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,880
He didn't deserve this.

71
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:57,120
Those two cops only
tried to restrain Uncle Tao.

72
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,290
He was one of the infected
who broke out of the gym.

73
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:02,580
That's ridiculous. He was tied up.

74
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,598
How could he have escaped on his own?

75
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:09,730
The body count in this
place just keeps going up.

76
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,435
So, you two killed an innocent person, right?

77
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,200
I assure you… that I didn't kill Uncle Tao.

78
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,268
And neither of us fired a single shot.

79
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,993
That's right. I'm a witness.

80
00:07:32,155 --> 00:07:34,559
He didn't do it, but you did.

81
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,560
Right.

82
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,080
Who else here has a gun?

83
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,280
Who else has a gun?

84
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,400
You two are making us feel unsafe.

85
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,712
That's right.

86
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,960
Everyone…

87
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:51,287
the two of us will find the person
who killed Uncle Tao.

88
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,080
And ma'am...

89
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
Run?

90
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,880
I know you're grieving and don't trust us yet,

91
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,622
but I assure you that I didn't kill Uncle Tao.

92
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,673
If we can get out of here,
we will prove ourselves.

93
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,689
And we promise… that we'll find the killer.

94
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:25,602
Uncle Tao won't die in vain.

95
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:38,521
That's another death connected to the drug,

96
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,014
even though Uncle Tao
was a victim of that drug himself.

97
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,123
We only have three days left.

98
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,560
Uncle Tao's killer must be connected
to the drug.

99
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,920
If we find the killer,

100
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,813
maybe we can find the mastermind.

101
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,320
Okay.

102
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,600
Why are they still keeping the infected
in the condo?

103
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,937
Why don't they just kick them out
and let the authorities handle them?

104
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:19,686
And you stay away from that cop couple.

105
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,160
They're the most suspicious ones right now.

106
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,480
They might have killed Uncle Tao.

107
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,840
So, does this mean I can't trust anyone now?

108
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,285
Whether they're normal or infected?

109
00:09:39,081 --> 00:09:40,893
You can't trust anyone.

110
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,360
What's the matter?

111
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,251
Are you suspicious of something?

112
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,080
Nothing.

113
00:09:54,055 --> 00:09:57,920
I was just wondering, if I became
one of the infected,

114
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,539
would you still love me?

115
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,970
Oh, So.

116
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,680
Of course.

117
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,165
And love is unconditional, right?

118
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,226
Don't think that. Okay?

119
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,001
Then what's this?

120
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,440
It's…

121
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,840
Babe, what did you tell her?

122
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,680
I just made something up.
I said it was So's lipstick.

123
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,960
I mistook it for a lip balm and used it.

124
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,360
And that hag believed you?

125
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,360
If I act cute and change the subject,
she won't care anymore.

126
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,560
Oh my. You're such a good liar.

127
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,080
Have you ever lied to me like that?

128
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,563
Babe, you know I would never lie to you.

129
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Trust me.

130
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,176
I want to get out of here
with you so badly, Babe.

131
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,601
Okay, Babe?

132
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,840
This is a bullet casing from the scene.

133
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,621
It's the same type used to kill Uncle Tao,

134
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,440
but the police don't normally use
this type of bullet.

135
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,358
I can confirm that I did not kill Uncle Tao.

136
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,680
Then who did it?

137
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,033
And why would they kill Tao?

138
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:37,582
We're investigating.

139
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,560
If you cooperate with the investigation,

140
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,794
we might find the killer sooner.

141
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,479
Ask me anything you want.

142
00:11:52,176 --> 00:11:53,839
Can you confirm that…

143
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:58,248
you didn't untie or release Uncle Tao?

144
00:12:01,646 --> 00:12:04,706
Even though I wasn't happy
that Tao was treated like that,

145
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,240
I wouldn't dare let him out.

146
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,840
Did Uncle Tao have any conflicts with anyone?

147
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,840
No.

148
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,792
People would come to him…
to talk about Buddhism and meditation.

149
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,022
Tao is so pitiful, you know?

150
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,700
He did everything for me.

151
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,920
He took on any job he could find.

152
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,492
I was so lucky that this condo hired me

153
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,444
and let me live in this room
for the rest of my working life.

154
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,902
It's like winning the lottery.

155
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,708
So I let him stay with me.

156
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,240
I really have no one else… except for him.

157
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,002
Is there anything else
you can tell us, Aunt Noi?

158
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,080
Here. H-H-He showed me a video once,
but I don't remember what it was.

159
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,560
He said it would help me with something.

160
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,080
I didn't… I didn't understand
because he liked to joke around.

161
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,480
So I didn't pay attention to it.

162
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,150
Take a look, maybe it'll be useful.

163
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Why do you think she did it?

164
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,960
Maybe Sophida knew about Hack's drug dealing
and killed him to silence him.

165
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:55,246
If Uncle Tao was infected
from using the Next drug,

166
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,560
he probably thought Next could actually
cure his heart disease.

167
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,200
When he ran out, he went to buy more from Hack,

168
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,635
but he happened to see Sophida killing him.

169
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,440
But the question is,
why didn't Uncle Tao tell anyone about this?

170
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
Prach.

171
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:24,440
It just so happens that
I filmed it. I won't tell anyone,

172
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,410
if you cover my medical expenses.
Say, 200,000 or 300,000 baht.

173
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,542
So Uncle Tao used this video
to blackmail Sophida.

174
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:40,846
What if Sophida killed Uncle Tao...

175
00:15:43,038 --> 00:15:44,960
If this theory is right,

176
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,415
Sophida must be trying to
get rid of all the evidence,

177
00:15:47,415 --> 00:15:50,200
and that includes this phone Aunt Noi had.

178
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,440
We have to intercept her.

179
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,480
- We're almost…
- Almost done.

180
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,591
I'm almost done with the puzzle. Almost there.

181
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,200
I'm so sorry for your loss.

182
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,672
Let me know if there's anything
I can do to help.

183
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,480
What did Sophida want?

184
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,528
She came to offer her condolences
and ask about Tao.

185
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,960
But before we could finish talking,
she saw you two and left quickly.

186
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
Is something wrong?

187
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:00,160
Just a small update.
We found some information on the phone.

188
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,360
But we might need to find more evidence.

189
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,800
Please be careful, Aunt Noi,

190
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,364
especially around Sophida.

191
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:10,672
What does Sophida have to do with this?

192
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:18,440
Trust me. Don't let anyone into your room,
and don't go anywhere alone.

193
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,400
I'll find the person who killed Uncle Tao.

194
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,939
Sophida killed Hack.

195
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:41,777
Are you saying that

196
00:17:41,777 --> 00:17:45,720
if the drug trail in the condo leads to Hack,

197
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,294
and Hack was killed by Sophida, that means

198
00:17:48,294 --> 00:17:51,280
Sophida is the one behind this whole thing?

199
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,377
Is that right?

200
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,394
Sophida is the mastermind behind all of this.

201
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:02,640
How can you be sure
those two didn't have other conflicts?

202
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,481
Wait until you have proof for that.

203
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
Hey,

204
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,600
Sophida went to see Aunt Noi.
We have to take care of this now.

205
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,760
Do you have a plan?

206
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,120
Sophida probably knows something's up.

207
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,007
We should think carefully
before we do anything.

208
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,440
We can't arrest Sophida yet.

209
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:35,704
We need to find evidence that links her
to the Next drug first.

210
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,960
Ownership of land…

211
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,240
- Mr. Tattep?
- Hmm?

212
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,971
Under the law, how can a resident acquire

213
00:19:08,971 --> 00:19:13,200
ownership of another person's land or building?

214
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,280
There are a few ways.

215
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,760
Inheritance, which is when someone dies
and their property is passed on to their heirs.

216
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,088
Then there's adverse possession,

217
00:19:22,088 --> 00:19:24,720
which is when you openly occupy
the property for ten years.

218
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,440
And lastly, the easiest way is
when someone simply gives it to you.

219
00:19:30,981 --> 00:19:34,600
So the best way is to give it as a gift?

220
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,960
But there has to be proof,
like a document, right?

221
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,040
Of course. You can't just say it.

222
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,076
But what case is this about?

223
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,360
Oh, I was just reading the legal code
and got a little confused.

224
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,460
It's nothing.

225
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
That's good.

226
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,376
If you want to know anything or
have any questions, just ask.

227
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,610
Don't hesitate.

228
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Thank you.

229
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,880
You have to get that old lady
to sign over everything to you.

230
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,440
All her assets.

231
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,400
No way.

232
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,680
No matter how much So is infatuated with me,

233
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,880
she would never sign anything over to me.

234
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,040
Then there's nothing we can do legally.

235
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,720
You're not married to her.

236
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,731
It's okay.

237
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,892
I'll just get as much
money from Tattep as I can.

238
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:42,389
And we have to make…

239
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,433
So disappear.

240
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,192
Are you going to kill her, Babe?

241
00:21:14,094 --> 00:21:17,910
If So dies because of the infected,

242
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,230
it'll seem perfectly normal.

243
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,760
And I'll inherit all of So's properties,

244
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,183
the condo, her things, and her credit cards.

245
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,902
And when things die down,

246
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,400
we'll run away to another country.

247
00:21:35,747 --> 00:21:39,440
B-B-But that's murder, Babe.

248
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,522
That's murder.

249
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,480
We're not the ones killing her.

250
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,422
The infected will be the ones doing it.

251
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,120
Remember that.

252
00:22:12,505 --> 00:22:13,576
What are you doing?

253
00:22:15,497 --> 00:22:17,077
You seem stressed lately.

254
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,993
How about a massage to help you relax?

255
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,489
Relax and unwind with a Yoshi massage.

256
00:22:46,818 --> 00:22:49,026
How about a hand massage now?

257
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,440
Wait a moment, So.

258
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,637
I'll go get some oil.

259
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,240
How is it?

260
00:23:34,743 --> 00:23:35,743
Relaxing?

261
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,240
What happened?

262
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,702
Why are your hands so red?

263
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,240
You're right. Maybe I'm allergic to this oil.

264
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,480
I've never used this one before.

265
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,527
Were you doing something before this?

266
00:23:58,527 --> 00:24:00,200
I'm not sure.

267
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,321
But it's starting to sting and itch.

268
00:24:04,357 --> 00:24:05,768
I'll go get some medicine.

269
00:24:06,404 --> 00:24:07,404
It's okay.

270
00:24:08,651 --> 00:24:09,960
I'm allergic to most medicines.

271
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,390
I can only take my usual one.

272
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:15,398
But… I left it in the car.

273
00:24:16,504 --> 00:24:17,504
In the car?

274
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:22,057
That's mean you have to
go down to the parking lot.

275
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,572
It's very dangerous.

276
00:24:24,572 --> 00:24:26,400
You can wait here.

277
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,280
I'll go get it myself.

278
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,520
I'll go with you.

279
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,988
It's safer to go together.

280
00:24:36,923 --> 00:24:37,923
Okay,

281
00:24:38,573 --> 00:24:40,310
but you have to wait inside.

282
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:01,691
What's wrong with your neck?

283
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:05,360
Mr. Tattep, can you take a look at it for me?

284
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,736
I don't know what kind of insect bit me.

285
00:25:08,736 --> 00:25:09,966
It really hurts.

286
00:25:14,587 --> 00:25:16,191
- Let me see.
- It's really itchy.

287
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Well…

288
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,960
It's nothing.

289
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,108
Maybe you're just allergic to dust.

290
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,920
But it's so itchy.

291
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,114
Can you take a closer look?

292
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,486
If I get any closer…

293
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,360
No, please don't.

294
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,018
You never respected me.

295
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,920
You said there was nothing going on with her.

296
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,120
You lied to me!

297
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,602
Calm down. It's a misunderstanding.

298
00:26:06,602 --> 00:26:08,642
The evidence is right in front of me.

299
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,112
And yet you still dare to say that?

300
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,815
May I have a word with you, Mrs. Net?

301
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,092
Well… I just feel like
we should have an honest conversation.

302
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,066
Mr. Tattep has tried to harass me many times.

303
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:10,097
But… I noticed that
you never said anything about it.

304
00:27:10,097 --> 00:27:13,912
So I thought you were… complicit.

305
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:15,161
What makes you so sure?

306
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,688
I'm the victim here.

307
00:27:25,326 --> 00:27:26,680
No, please don't.

308
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:29,440
You said there was nothing going on with her.

309
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,120
You lied to me.

310
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,200
Calm down. It's a misunderstanding.

311
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,360
The evidence is right in front of me.

312
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,889
And yet you still dare to say that?

313
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,965
This is what's been happening
all along, Mrs. Net.

314
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:52,680
No, please don't.

315
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,360
Let me be frank.

316
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,136
The evidence is clear.

317
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,582
Just pay me,

318
00:28:00,561 --> 00:28:04,012
and I'll disappear from your lives.

319
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,280
Fine.

320
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,640
As soon as the cell service is back,

321
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,361
I'll transfer the money to you immediately.

322
00:28:23,606 --> 00:28:24,717
Transfer what money?

323
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,300
Excuse me, Mrs. Net.

324
00:28:29,115 --> 00:28:30,115
Where are you going?

325
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,920
You're not allowed in this room anymore.

326
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,911
And get ready to sign the divorce papers.

327
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:37,321
You're divorcing me…

328
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,920
over something so trivial?

329
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,920
How can you say it's trivial?

330
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,280
Look what you've done.

331
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,920
I have all the evidence. If you don't sign,

332
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,720
I'll file for divorce…

333
00:29:10,262 --> 00:29:11,707
Maybe she already ran away?

334
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,817
I'll be back soon.

335
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,624
Be careful.

336
00:29:35,624 --> 00:29:36,624
Okay.

337
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,120
Go on.

338
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
I'm sorry.

339
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Yoshi?

340
00:29:56,126 --> 00:29:57,126
Get out.

341
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,952
What are you doing?

342
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,532
- This is not funny.
- I'm not joking.

343
00:30:01,532 --> 00:30:02,533
I said get out.

344
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:04,240
Yoshi, put the gun down.

345
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,480
We can talk about this.

346
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,805
I told you to get out. Get out!

347
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,680
Yoshi, open the door for me right now.

348
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,680
Never!

349
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
Open it now!

350
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
Open the door!

351
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,739
Open it! Open it!

352
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,828
Put the gun down now.

353
00:30:34,029 --> 00:30:36,040
- Come in, quickly.
- Hurry up.

354
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:39,610
Hurry inside!

355
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:40,610
Come in, quickly.

356
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
Run!

357
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,960
What are you two doing?

358
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,268
- Well, So was…
- You're right.

359
00:30:57,071 --> 00:30:58,680
I was secretly dating Hack.

360
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,801
I know I shouldn't have cheated on you.

361
00:31:00,801 --> 00:31:02,600
- I'm sorry.
- What are you talking about?

362
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,593
But you shouldn't have killed him.

363
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,720
Hack didn't do anything wrong.

364
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,280
I was the one who got involved with him.

365
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,600
If you're going to kill someone, kill me.

366
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,385
Why kill others?

367
00:31:12,385 --> 00:31:16,158
Yoshi killed Hack,
and then he tried to kill me.

368
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,120
And he's the one who killed Uncle Tao too.

369
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,720
Why would I kill Uncle Tao?

370
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,200
Because Uncle Tao knew you killed Hack.

371
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,000
So you were going to kill him to silence him.

372
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,720
It's my fault.

373
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,920
I shouldn't have helped you
destroy the evidence.

374
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,046
Otherwise, Uncle Tao wouldn't be dead.

375
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,975
If you don't believe me,

376
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,275
you can check his gun.

377
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,076
Just admit it.

378
00:31:40,076 --> 00:31:43,060
Hey! What the hell are you talking about?

379
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,646
What are you saying?

380
00:31:44,646 --> 00:31:45,788
Stop it.

381
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,880
You evil bitch! You liar!

382
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,595
- Watch your back or I'm going to kill you!
- Calm down.

383
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,280
Yoshi.

384
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,200
It's me.

385
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,882
Since when were you two dating?

386
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,363
Women like you…

387
00:32:32,782 --> 00:32:34,883
Do you really think anyone
would be serious with you?

388
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,052
You're just a toy.

389
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,960
Let me tell you something.

390
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,520
You made a mistake…

391
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:48,071
getting involved with someone like Yoshi.

392
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,131
But then again…

393
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,440
You two seem perfect for each other.

394
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,903
Both are greedy for money.

395
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,720
Why did you let Sophida run towards
the infected like that?

396
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:20,200
I didn't mean to. I just wanted So's assets.

397
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,881
But I haven't killed anyone.

398
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,865
Is this your gun?

399
00:33:26,898 --> 00:33:30,952
No, it's Sophida's gun.
I took it from a drawer in her room.

400
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:35,880
How many times do I have to say
I didn't kill anyone?

401
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,895
Even if So was sleeping with Hack,
or if they were together,

402
00:33:37,895 --> 00:33:39,400
I wouldn't be jealous.

403
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,240
I just wanted her money.

404
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,536
What about Uncle Tao?

405
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,666
I had nothing to do with that.
And I know nothing about it.

406
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,600
But we found a bullet casing near
Uncle Tao's body that matches your gun.

407
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,160
I told you, that gun belongs to So.

408
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,720
I just brought it to threaten her.

409
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,920
Why is everyone accusing me of killing people?

410
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,240
I haven't killed anyone.

411
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,799
How could someone like me kill anyone?
Seriously.

412
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,594
Alright, alright.

413
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,759
If you want us to believe you,

414
00:34:14,759 --> 00:34:17,293
tell us everything you know about Sophida.

415
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,982
How long have you known her?

416
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,272
I've been with So for three months.

417
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,000
While you were with Sophida,

418
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,660
you were also dating Rangrong, right?

419
00:34:30,071 --> 00:34:34,800
My relationship with Rangrong… is personal.

420
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,760
But with So, it's my job.

421
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,240
She provides for me,
and I take care of her, that's all.

422
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,308
Do you know what Sophida does for a living?

423
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:47,068
She runs a beauty clinic

424
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:52,280
and sells creams, serums, and high-end drugs.

425
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,560
That's all I know.

426
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,596
Does she have any of those things in her room?

427
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,954
There are some,

428
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:03,800
but there's one room
she uses for personal storage.

429
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,977
She probably keeps valuables in there
because she never lets me in that room.

430
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,400
Here you go.

431
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,503
Please sign this.

432
00:35:37,104 --> 00:35:38,104
Net…

433
00:35:40,017 --> 00:35:41,496
you've got it all wrong.

434
00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:43,747
I love you very much.

435
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,305
Everything is clear now.

436
00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:49,680
And this isn't the first time either.

437
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,400
You've had so many other women before.

438
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,160
Did you think I didn't know?

439
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,663
But from now on, I know what I want.

440
00:35:58,506 --> 00:36:00,498
[Divorce Certificate]

441
00:36:00,498 --> 00:36:03,449
Net, if you divorce me, how will you survive?

442
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,720
Yes, I lived with you

443
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,462
and let you insult me for not working
and relying on you for support.

444
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:14,054
To be honest, it was emotionally draining.

445
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,054
But from now on,

446
00:36:18,482 --> 00:36:20,320
I don't need to depend on you anymore.

447
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,940
What do you mean?

448
00:36:24,107 --> 00:36:25,867
I finished law school.

449
00:36:28,668 --> 00:36:30,061
I'm going to take the bar exam.

450
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:32,241
When did you study?

451
00:36:33,382 --> 00:36:34,775
How come I didn't know about this?

452
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,640
I wanted to help you.

453
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,196
I didn't want to be a burden on you.

454
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,008
I always forgave you, Tattep,

455
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,073
but you never appreciated it.

456
00:37:01,555 --> 00:37:02,953
I'm sorry for…

457
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:14,276
I'll stay with you here… as an acquaintance.

458
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:19,282
And when they let us out of this condo,
I'll leave immediately.

459
00:37:29,884 --> 00:37:31,645
Where did you go, Yoshi?

460
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,312
Are you looking for someone?

461
00:37:42,704 --> 00:37:44,485
Do you know where Yoshi is?

462
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,399
No, I don't.

463
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:53,073
Then can you help me find him?

464
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,831
I can't. I'm sorry.

465
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,093
I'm hungry, Grandpa.
Is there anything to eat?

466
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,484
If you're hungry, go make something yourself.

467
00:38:14,308 --> 00:38:17,080
I have to prepare this for Grandma
for tomorrow.

468
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,220
What about me?

469
00:38:18,947 --> 00:38:20,640
You don't like my cooking.

470
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,335
When you were a kid, I made you something
to eat, and what happened?

471
00:38:24,384 --> 00:38:26,193
- I threw up, Grandpa.
- Exactly.

472
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:28,990
The only person
who can cook for you is Grandma.

473
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,636
And you got her put away.

474
00:38:31,636 --> 00:38:33,600
Don't you have a conscience, Jee?

475
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,522
I was just doing the right thing.

476
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:37,600
What if Grandma was infected and bit you?
What would you do?

477
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,240
You weren't worried about me.

478
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,880
You were only worried about yourself.

479
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,600
You're so selfish, Jee.

480
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,775
Don't say that.

481
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,880
I will say it.

482
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,219
So what?

483
00:38:47,219 --> 00:38:49,040
You're not even working.

484
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,204
You're just leeching off Grandma and me
till you suck us dry.

485
00:38:53,204 --> 00:38:56,180
Have you ever thought about
getting a job to help us out?

486
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,680
Look at Aim.

487
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,600
She works hard, saves up,
and supports her parents.

488
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,057
You're always praising Aim.

489
00:39:04,057 --> 00:39:05,539
What do you mean I don't work?

490
00:39:05,539 --> 00:39:06,946
I make content.

491
00:39:06,946 --> 00:39:09,265
I pay for the water and electricity we use.

492
00:39:09,265 --> 00:39:12,579
That stupid content of yours
got Grandma locked up.

493
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:14,040
That's not related at all.

494
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,612
- How is it not related?
- I'm not talking to you anymore.

495
00:39:15,612 --> 00:39:17,395
This place is so boring.

496
00:39:17,395 --> 00:39:18,395
Jee?

497
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,160
Jee!

[DNA Plus Fitness]

499
00:39:31,126 --> 00:39:32,266
Hey, So--

500
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,920
I'm sorry, Yoshi,
for putting on that act earlier.

501
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,680
But right now, let me help you first.

502
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,760
What are you planning to do?

503
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,411
I'm serious, Yoshi.

504
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,800
I'll explain later.

505
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,402
Just go now. Get up, quickly.

506
00:40:02,284 --> 00:40:06,634
Just be nice to me and follow me

507
00:40:07,637 --> 00:40:09,202
if you want everything.

508
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:57,840
Hello, everyone… Nothing much today.

509
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,920
Just wanted to say that
this world is so boring.

510
00:42:02,483 --> 00:42:03,683
Who else is bored?

511
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,652
I'm super tired of my grandparents.

512
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,720
They keep doing the same things
over and over again.

513
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,600
And they always think other people
are better than their own family.

514
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,248
You're crazy for talking to yourself, Jee.

515
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,240
So this is life offline?

516
00:42:40,034 --> 00:42:41,388
It's not so bad.

517
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,880
Yoshi definitely didn't kill Hack.

518
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,840
I think Sophida is setting Yoshi up
to take the fall.

519
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,840
But if he let Sophida out there
to be bitten by the infected,

520
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,400
we can't rule him out as an accomplice.

521
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,345
Based on the information Yoshi gave us,

522
00:43:06,345 --> 00:43:10,465
I think we should go to Sophida's room…
to look for evidence.

523
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,360
I agree… She's smart.

524
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,720
She can always twist things
to make herself look innocent.

525
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:19,200
We need to find as much evidence
as possible to incriminate Sophida.

526
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,406
But it won't be easy to get into her room.

527
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,147
I think we might need Yoshi's help…

528
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,603
Maybe Rangrong came to help him.

529
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,120
Rangrong isn't here.

530
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,605
And she won't be in this room anymore.

531
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,199
Actually, we're not here for Rangrong.

532
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,880
We came to see Yoshi.

533
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,200
Shouldn't Yoshi be in Sophida's room?

534
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,557
How is he involved with Rangrong?
I'm so confused.

535
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,048
We heard that Yoshi and Rangrong are together…

536
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:16,399
so we came to find Rangrong.

537
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,840
Well, neither of them are here.

538
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:26,497
If I or Tattep happen to see them,
we'll let you know.

539
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:40,889
Did you think I was too stupid to notice?

540
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,224
I don't own this shade of lipstick!

541
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:55,980
Just tell me the truth.

542
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:01,267
Or if you want to be together,
all three of us, just say so.

543
00:45:02,657 --> 00:45:04,570
Oh… I forgot, Rangrong.

544
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,558
You're already Tattep's mistress.

545
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,248
You're having an affair with everyone.

546
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,292
You must like the excitement.

547
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,022
If you like that sort of thing,
I have a fun little game for you to play.

548
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,007
I changed my mind.

549
00:45:40,495 --> 00:45:41,945
What do you want me to do, So?

550
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,190
I can accept it…

551
00:45:45,241 --> 00:45:49,040
if my dearest Yoshi becomes a corpse.

552
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,960
I'll still love your corpse, Yoshi.

553
00:45:52,498 --> 00:45:53,640
What do you mean?

554
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,084
And I can accept it…

555
00:45:56,157 --> 00:45:58,053
if my Yoshi…

556
00:45:59,491 --> 00:46:01,088
becomes a murderer.

557
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,478
Yoshi, no.

558
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,932
You choose.

559
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:18,816
Yes, ma'am.

560
00:46:34,414 --> 00:46:35,487
Shoot her.

561
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:37,759
Shoot her, Yoshi!

562
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,880
Shoot her!

563
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,291
Shoot her! Shoot!

564
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:42,346
I said shoot her! Do it!

565
00:46:42,346 --> 00:46:43,499
Damn it!

566
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:47,080
What are you doing?

567
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,972
No, please, Babe. Babe?

568
00:46:54,097 --> 00:46:55,860
You're not going to kill me, are you?

569
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,040
Calling each other "Babe"?

570
00:47:01,608 --> 00:47:02,760
How cute.

571
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,200
Babe?

572
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:09,880
I'm sorry,

573
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,840
- but I have to choose what I don't have.
- Yoshi!

574
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,054
- I still need her money.
- No!

575
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,217
Babe...

576
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:34,733
You bastard!

577
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:40,517
I did everything for you!

578
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:45,851
You bastard.

579
00:47:46,537 --> 00:47:47,971
You bastard!

580
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:56,422
Thank you so much…

581
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,916
for not shooting me.

582
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,647
For your kindness, I have a small gift for you.

583
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,402
So. So, please let me go.

584
00:48:23,999 --> 00:48:25,000
Please, So.

585
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,258
Please let me go.

586
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:41,400
And if you want more, just let me know.
I have more.

587
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,800
I'll bring you more.

588
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,138
Why are you so quiet?

589
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,280
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

590
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,306
Enough!

591
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,083
Just do whatever you want.

592
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,809
Speaking of which,
why are you giving up so easily?

593
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,800
Actually, I'm not a cruel person.

594
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,120
If you want to be together,

595
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,480
I'll let you.

596
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:17,040
I'll let you be together…

597
00:49:25,615 --> 00:49:26,615
in hell.

598
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,426
Then kill me!

599
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:34,840
So. So. Please let me go.

600
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,200
I'll give you everything, I promise.
I was wrong, So.

601
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,701
I made a mistake, So.

602
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:44,120
Lovers should be together, right?

603
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:46,640
Come here. No need to beg her.

604
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,703
Stop pulling me.

605
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,978
So. So, I'll do anything to be with you.

606
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,080
But I have to thank you, Yoshi.

607
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:01,159
I would have been in trouble
without you this whole time.

608
00:50:05,308 --> 00:50:06,640
Pull yourself together!

609
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,417
Stop pulling on me! Come here!

610
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:14,720
So… So, I was wrong. I'll do anything, So.

611
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,760
So, just let me go. I'll do anything.

612
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,840
Stop pleading with her!

613
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:21,350
If you're not going to help, then shut up!

614
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,200
Just admit it.

615
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,662
I told you to shut up!

616
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,657
Damn it!

617
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:28,734
What are you afraid of?

618
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,040
You're not dying alone.

619
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,515
If you want to die, then die alone!

620
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,640
So. So. So.

621
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,112
So. So, please listen to me first. So.

622
00:51:30,832 --> 00:51:33,373
Go away! Go away!

623
00:51:59,212 --> 00:52:01,318
It seems like she can control the infected.

624
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:01,910
Stop!

625
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,530
How can Sophida do that?

626
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:09,407
I won't let Run go alone.

627
00:52:09,407 --> 00:52:12,063
I have to go with her,
and we'll come back together.

628
00:52:16,517 --> 00:52:17,846
Where is she now?

629
00:52:17,846 --> 00:52:19,163
She's not here anymore.

630
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,623
Why were you there alone?

631
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:40,702
Well, I didn't know
there would be so many of them.

632
00:52:43,449 --> 00:52:45,991
Don't come out. The infected are on the loose.
