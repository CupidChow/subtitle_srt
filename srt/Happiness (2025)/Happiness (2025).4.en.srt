00:00:12,026 --> 00:00:13,468
[Previously]

3
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:14,787
Besides this drug,

4
00:00:14,787 --> 00:00:17,298
the disease can also be transmitted
through blood.

5
00:00:19,965 --> 00:00:22,424
Technically, those people are already dead.

6
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:30,875
If I become one of those rage things one day,

7
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,019
please kill me.

8
00:00:36,891 --> 00:00:39,071
Let's get to know our neighbors.

9
00:00:40,527 --> 00:00:42,075
Do you suspect anyone in particular?

10
00:00:43,182 --> 00:00:44,425
Everyone seems suspicious.

11
00:00:45,272 --> 00:00:47,184
What's the point of this meeting?

12
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:49,975
Shouldn't we find a way
to protect ourselves from them?

13
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:52,171
Can you please take care of your grandson?

14
00:00:52,793 --> 00:00:55,063
You're probably believing
those rumors in the group chat.

15
00:00:55,063 --> 00:00:57,026
Zombies only exist in movies.

16
00:00:57,026 --> 00:00:58,598
He posted it himself!

17
00:00:58,598 --> 00:01:00,686
See? See? See?

18
00:01:02,415 --> 00:01:03,636
Beam?

19
00:01:05,037 --> 00:01:06,532
It's me, Run.

20
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:08,906
This is my senior from high school.

21
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:11,602
This is Prach. He's my--

22
00:01:11,602 --> 00:01:13,108
I'm Run's husband.

23
00:01:16,715 --> 00:01:18,150
Get to the Get Hi pub right away.

24
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,067
Yayee!

25
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,321
Da, I'm home.

26
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:56,323
Okay.

27
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,120
The Next drug is spreading in a new form.

28
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:35,598
Traces of Next have been found
in supplements and vitamins.

29
00:02:39,935 --> 00:02:41,720
We've also discovered that

30
00:02:43,274 --> 00:02:45,575
the new version of Next,
when mixed with water,

31
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:48,840
changes from red to clear,
like plain water.

00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:56,682
[Psytaline]

33
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,127
Yes, sir.

34
00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:05,629
Ah, I've received it.

35
00:04:07,524 --> 00:04:08,676
Just a moment, sir.

36
00:04:45,524 --> 00:04:46,531
Kai…

37
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,467
Kai…

38
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:43,001
Don't shoot Kai! If you shoot him,
he'll really die for real!

39
00:05:43,001 --> 00:05:44,434
This isn't Kai, Inspector.

40
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:46,086
He's already dead.

41
00:05:46,086 --> 00:05:47,335
He can recover.

42
00:05:47,335 --> 00:05:48,560
Kai has to recover.

43
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:52,064
Kai! Get a hold of yourself!

44
00:05:52,064 --> 00:05:54,386
Kai! Get a hold of yourself, Kai!

45
00:05:55,912 --> 00:05:56,912
Kai!

46
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:40,908
[Happiness]

47
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,760
You're awake?

48
00:08:12,337 --> 00:08:14,195
Why did you tie me up? Let me go!

49
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:19,496
Do you even realize what you've done?

50
00:08:19,496 --> 00:08:20,931
What did I do?

51
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:22,970
I didn't do anything! Let me go!

52
00:08:30,902 --> 00:08:32,150
How did you get infected?

53
00:08:36,045 --> 00:08:37,105
Infected with what?

54
00:08:38,325 --> 00:08:40,832
Were you bitten or did you take the drug?

55
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:54,477
I'll be right back.

56
00:09:56,877 --> 00:09:58,797
It must be chaotic downstairs.

57
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,699
But don't worry, Beam.

58
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:03,392
The Special Control Unit will take care of it.

59
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:09,522
You said he was infected from
being bitten or from that drug.

60
00:10:10,134 --> 00:10:11,192
What do you mean by that?

61
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:15,811
To be honest, I don't know much either.

62
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:20,612
I only know that…
this drug can cause people to become violent.

63
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:23,263
I see.

64
00:10:23,263 --> 00:10:25,589
I wonder who else is infected down there.

65
00:10:31,712 --> 00:10:32,915
That's what I'm wondering too.

66
00:10:39,545 --> 00:10:41,349
You need to get checked
along with the others.

67
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,802
This way, please.

68
00:10:58,601 --> 00:11:00,619
Run called to report another case
at The Breathe Condo.

69
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:03,179
I've sent a backup team.
You can return to the center now.

70
00:11:18,917 --> 00:11:21,508
Chief, please come this way.

71
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:29,759
The infected has escaped.

72
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,058
Spread out and search. Be careful.

73
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:33,600
Try not to alarm the residents.

74
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:36,360
Captain, collect this evidence.

75
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:52,217
[Prach]

76
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,616
Thank you so much, Beam.

77
00:12:08,966 --> 00:12:10,739
No, I should be thanking you.

78
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,910
Thank me?

79
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:14,543
For what?

80
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:18,216
Well…

81
00:12:18,216 --> 00:12:22,799
That was the first meal in six years
that I've had with someone.

82
00:12:28,641 --> 00:12:30,098
You live alone like this.

83
00:12:30,615 --> 00:12:32,255
If you ever need help, let me know.

84
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Thank you.

85
00:12:41,992 --> 00:12:46,246
[Where are you now?
Are you coming home yet?]

86
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:55,006
[Prach]

87
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,940
Yayee…

88
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,377
Yayee, we're here.

89
00:13:25,109 --> 00:13:26,988
Okay, you're awake. Carefully now.

90
00:13:29,638 --> 00:13:30,638
Okay.

91
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,532
Okay…

92
00:13:32,532 --> 00:13:34,184
Thank you for walking us.

93
00:13:34,184 --> 00:13:36,188
You should go inside now, Run.
I'll be leaving now.

94
00:13:36,854 --> 00:13:39,920
Yayee, you're sleeping with me tonight.

95
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,162
Your mom probably won't be back yet.

96
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:45,516
Thank you, Dr. Beam.

97
00:13:45,516 --> 00:13:46,521
Sure.

98
00:13:47,606 --> 00:13:48,613
Come on.

99
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,540
Stop!

100
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,204
Found him!

101
00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:24,003
Please let me go!

102
00:15:24,003 --> 00:15:26,026
I didn't do it! I didn't do it!

103
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:46,325
There's an emergency at The Breathe Condo.

104
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:48,332
We've found a large number of
infected individuals.

105
00:15:53,694 --> 00:15:57,441
The officers we sent have become infected

106
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:59,560
along with a number of residents.

107
00:16:03,268 --> 00:16:06,007
Hey, you two! Don't fight!

108
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:09,732
Stop!

109
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:15,325
Initiate the emergency response plan.

110
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:17,394
Yes, sir.

111
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,123
- So what now?
- Now what?

112
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,560
- How do we get home now?
- We need to go to work.

113
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,400
- Yeah, we have to go home.
- We still have to go to work.

114
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,742
- You're responsible for this.
- We're already late.

115
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:39,360
- You can't do this to us.
- Yeah, this is a waste of time.

116
00:16:54,874 --> 00:16:55,874
Excuse me,

117
00:16:57,535 --> 00:16:59,520
I don't live here. Can I leave?

118
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,000
No, you can't.
We can't let anyone through.

119
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,925
We have to quarantine everyone
in this condo.

120
00:17:03,925 --> 00:17:04,927
What?

121
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,417
Attention, residents of The Breathe Condo.

122
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:31,400
I am Yutthasak Suwannasiri,
Director of the Special Control Unit.

123
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,972
I regret to inform you that, at this moment,

124
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:39,920
there is an outbreak of a new disease
in The Breathe Condo.

125
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,459
Relevant agencies do not yet have
definitive information on this disease.

126
00:17:45,459 --> 00:17:48,025
Therefore, for your own safety

127
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:51,555
and to prevent the spread of the disease,

128
00:17:51,555 --> 00:17:54,610
we ask for your cooperation

129
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:58,157
in remaining in your residences.

130
00:17:58,157 --> 00:18:02,812
And without absolutely necessary,

131
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:07,172
please do not leave your condo phase

132
00:18:07,172 --> 00:18:08,665
for at least

133
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:09,734
7 days.

134
00:18:09,734 --> 00:18:11,365
This is to avoid contracting

135
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:12,744
the infection.

136
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:17,235
If there is any further information or changes,

137
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:21,286
the Special Control Unit
will promptly inform you.

138
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:23,153
We hereby ask

139
00:18:23,153 --> 00:18:25,314
for your cooperation at this time.

140
00:18:28,627 --> 00:18:32,003
[Lockdown]

141
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
Run…

142
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,203
I couldn't reach Yayee's mom,

143
00:19:11,203 --> 00:19:14,502
so I left a note on her door
so she knows Yayee is with me.

144
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:18,640
Where have you been?

145
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,086
Let's talk inside. Come on.

146
00:19:30,005 --> 00:19:31,940
You know, I almost died last night.

147
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,215
Luckily, Beam saved me just in time.

148
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,731
Well… Are you alright?

149
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:42,550
I'm fine. I wasn't bitten by the infected.

150
00:19:43,659 --> 00:19:45,771
But Beam and I captured him.

151
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,920
In the fitness room.

152
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,400
Don't you dare… disappear like that again.

153
00:19:57,441 --> 00:20:00,201
Run, is my mom back yet?

154
00:20:07,168 --> 00:20:08,637
How about this, Yayee?

155
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:12,285
I'll go check if your mom is back,

156
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:14,920
but for now, stay with Run, okay?

157
00:20:16,105 --> 00:20:17,105
Good girl.

158
00:20:18,574 --> 00:20:20,080
Are you hungry?

159
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:21,893
You must be hungry.

160
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:30,626
Hello. Welcome.

161
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,243
Please change your clothes first.

162
00:20:35,243 --> 00:20:36,143
Do you have any water?

163
00:20:36,143 --> 00:20:37,920
Yes, the water is over there.

164
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:03,360
Help! Help! Somebody help me!

165
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,597
Please, help!

166
00:21:08,387 --> 00:21:09,524
What's going on here?

167
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:13,900
I found the dealer.

168
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:17,793
If you catch him, this is over, right?

169
00:21:17,793 --> 00:21:18,793
It's too late.

170
00:21:19,527 --> 00:21:22,578
The infected are now spread
throughout the entire condo complex.

171
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:34,155
We tried to send in forces
to control the situation,

172
00:21:37,277 --> 00:21:39,997
but the number of infected here is
increasing rapidly,

173
00:21:43,131 --> 00:21:46,320
and it's more than our personnel can handle.

174
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:51,413
All we can do is seal off the phases
with the most infected.

175
00:21:53,955 --> 00:21:57,760
Fortunately, we know that
light can disrupt their perception.

176
00:21:59,121 --> 00:22:01,710
I need you to warn the residents

177
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:05,563
not to leave their rooms at night.

178
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:38,991
Leave a team here to monitor the situation

179
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:41,909
in case there are infected hiding in the condo.

180
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:43,950
Report any updates.

181
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,770
If you find any infected,

182
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:47,588
we emphasize that
you must capture them alive.

183
00:22:48,293 --> 00:22:50,460
Do not kill them.

184
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,466
Yes, ma'am.

185
00:22:52,242 --> 00:22:54,652
The rest of the team, stand by at the unit.

186
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:14,920
And we still haven't found the trainer.

187
00:23:20,962 --> 00:23:22,720
You have to help us deal with this.

188
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,725
But we only agreed to find
the drug dealer, didn't we?

189
00:23:24,725 --> 00:23:26,866
The infected are spreading
throughout the building.

190
00:23:26,866 --> 00:23:28,630
That's not even including the people
who took the drug,

191
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,775
and we don't even know
where they got it from.

192
00:23:31,775 --> 00:23:33,911
Soon, all these people will turn
into rage monsters.

193
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:35,341
But isn't that your job?

194
00:23:35,341 --> 00:23:39,904
That trainer often comes to this condo
before going out to sell the drugs.

195
00:23:39,904 --> 00:23:43,720
I believe that if he can do this,
he's not working alone.

196
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:49,216
Either way, I have to
seal off this entire condo.

197
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,180
If you disagree,
you can leave this area right now.

198
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:59,030
But if you're willing to help,
we need to find out who's behind this.

199
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,670
And we might even find a cure
for this disease.

200
00:24:12,403 --> 00:24:14,764
Hello, residents of The Breathe Condo.

201
00:24:15,377 --> 00:24:17,307
I am Arisara Kaewrod.

202
00:24:17,911 --> 00:24:22,724
I have been assigned to oversee and
coordinate the quarantine within this condo

203
00:24:22,724 --> 00:24:24,203
to ensure it runs smoothly.

204
00:24:24,821 --> 00:24:28,567
The man who was restrained
that you all saw earlier

205
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:31,332
is a suspected infected individual.

206
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:33,923
This disease is called Rage Disease.

207
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,780
It is not transmitted through touch,
saliva, or any bodily fluids.

208
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:42,185
Therefore, everyone can continue their lives
in the condo as usual.

209
00:24:42,185 --> 00:24:46,573
The initial symptoms of this disease
include dizziness,

210
00:24:46,573 --> 00:24:49,487
rapid breathing, abnormal sweating,

211
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:52,840
dry throat, coughing, intense thirst,

212
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,984
rapid heartbeat, tremors, and seizures,
leading to a loss of self-control.

213
00:24:58,509 --> 00:25:00,205
If you experience any of these symptoms,

214
00:25:00,205 --> 00:25:01,698
please contact the staff

215
00:25:01,698 --> 00:25:03,669
using the contact information on the card
you are about to receive.

216
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:09,376
And to prevent the spread of the disease,
please quarantine yourselves in your own units.

217
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:13,596
As for food and other management,
we will take care of it.

218
00:25:16,757 --> 00:25:17,585
There you go.

219
00:25:17,585 --> 00:25:21,560
Well… If anyone has any problems,
contact them.

220
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:24,255
That's for all three of you.

221
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:25,784
How are we supposed to work?

222
00:25:25,784 --> 00:25:27,273
Yeah, right.

223
00:25:27,273 --> 00:25:31,294
Did you hear the announcement?
They will take care of everything.

224
00:25:31,294 --> 00:25:34,815
All we have to do is stay calm
and quarantine ourselves.

225
00:25:34,815 --> 00:25:37,827
Who said we had to?
They just asked us to cooperate.

226
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,461
I'm telling you to quarantine.

227
00:25:39,461 --> 00:25:42,858
Hey, excuse me,
but where are we supposed to quarantine?

228
00:25:42,858 --> 00:25:46,660
You can stay in the maid's room
downstairs for now.

229
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,660
What?

230
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:54,134
Oh, about the garbage, please take it to…

231
00:25:54,134 --> 00:25:55,314
the common area floors.

232
00:25:55,314 --> 00:25:57,705
That way, there won't be any odor problems
in the residential floors.

233
00:25:57,705 --> 00:26:03,171
Stock up on food and supplies.
The minimart in our condo is still open.

234
00:26:03,171 --> 00:26:05,671
It will probably stay open
at least until the supplies run out.

235
00:26:05,671 --> 00:26:07,623
Just go stock up.

236
00:26:19,762 --> 00:26:22,082
Then who will be the representative
to go pick up the food?

237
00:26:29,438 --> 00:26:30,438
I will.

238
00:26:31,528 --> 00:26:32,528
Is that a good idea?

239
00:26:33,163 --> 00:26:34,183
Sending a woman?

240
00:26:36,665 --> 00:26:39,320
I can handle it myself. Is that okay?

241
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,059
I'll go too.

242
00:26:48,177 --> 00:26:50,835
Then we have enough volunteers.

243
00:26:50,835 --> 00:26:51,840
Thank you.

244
00:27:01,508 --> 00:27:03,257
Actually, you don't have to come.

245
00:27:04,438 --> 00:27:05,438
Hey…

246
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:10,179
I'm worried. I'm afraid you'll get tired.

247
00:27:11,449 --> 00:27:12,833
I'll be fine.

248
00:27:12,833 --> 00:27:14,840
We can help each other
if anything happens.

249
00:27:15,364 --> 00:27:16,599
Okay.

250
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:20,200
Thank you very much
for helping Run the other day.

251
00:27:22,146 --> 00:27:26,520
But from now on,
you don't have to worry about her.

252
00:27:27,349 --> 00:27:28,749
I'll take care of Run myself.

253
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:31,218
It's no problem.

254
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:32,600
I'm happy to help.

255
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,604
Okay.

256
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:43,905
Which building?

257
00:27:43,905 --> 00:27:44,945
- Building C.
- Building C.

258
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,000
Please give us a lot.
It won't be enough. Please give us more.

259
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,329
I'm afraid it won't be enough.

260
00:27:55,158 --> 00:27:56,560
Bring us a lot!

261
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,572
Hurry up!

262
00:27:57,572 --> 00:28:00,984
Divide into groups and as periods of time,
instead of turns.

263
00:28:00,984 --> 00:28:04,160
In case someone wants to escape from here.

264
00:28:07,582 --> 00:28:08,582
Which building?

265
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,830
Building B.

266
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,674
Move closer.

267
00:28:11,674 --> 00:28:12,688
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

268
00:28:19,994 --> 00:28:20,994
Quickly, quickly.

269
00:28:22,153 --> 00:28:23,158
Hurry up.

270
00:28:32,338 --> 00:28:34,384
We need to gather more information
on the residents.

271
00:28:37,137 --> 00:28:38,437
I brought you some food.

272
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,560
Supplies delivery.

273
00:28:43,886 --> 00:28:45,120
Hello, Doctor.

274
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,571
Hello. Just the two of you?

275
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:47,840
Yes.

276
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,560
Here you go.

277
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,600
Thank you.

278
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,605
Jeu and Fah…

279
00:28:54,877 --> 00:28:56,976
I saw Fah getting out of the trainer's car.

280
00:29:00,026 --> 00:29:01,026
The trainer.

281
00:29:01,734 --> 00:29:04,746
Don't forget that I saw the trainer
being close with Yoshi.

282
00:29:04,746 --> 00:29:06,320
Sophida might be involved too.

283
00:29:17,595 --> 00:29:18,800
Hey, Run.

284
00:29:19,323 --> 00:29:22,113
Are you interested in becoming
a member of the condo committee?

285
00:29:22,936 --> 00:29:25,640
It's not really my thing.
I'm more of an action person.

286
00:29:26,535 --> 00:29:28,722
Alright. Thank you.

287
00:29:28,722 --> 00:29:29,726
Sure.

288
00:29:30,788 --> 00:29:32,953
These two are obsessed with their positions
in the condo management.

289
00:29:32,953 --> 00:29:35,720
They might be taking advantage of it.

290
00:29:57,803 --> 00:30:01,195
There're instant noodles, canned fish,
and paracetamol.

291
00:30:01,195 --> 00:30:02,669
- Rice…
- Rice?

292
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:05,047
- We all have the same things.
- That's all?

293
00:30:05,047 --> 00:30:07,396
To eat for so many days?
I'll be bored to death.

294
00:30:08,219 --> 00:30:10,416
We have free food for many days.

295
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:12,184
We'll save so much money.

296
00:30:12,184 --> 00:30:15,176
I could stay quarantined
for a whole month like this.

297
00:30:15,176 --> 00:30:16,415
Oh, Grandpa…

298
00:30:16,415 --> 00:30:19,713
If we have to eat like this for a whole month,
I can't take it.

299
00:30:19,713 --> 00:30:23,172
I can only make 2-3 content videos
before it gets boring.

300
00:30:23,172 --> 00:30:26,385
Jee… Don't complain so much.

301
00:30:26,385 --> 00:30:28,069
It's better to have food to eat.

302
00:30:30,068 --> 00:30:31,075
This kid…

303
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,240
I can't handle him.

304
00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:45,699
Just this much? How is this enough
for three people?

305
00:30:48,106 --> 00:30:51,546
Come on, honey.
We have other things stored away.

306
00:30:53,293 --> 00:30:55,458
And I have to cook for your secretary too?

307
00:31:00,504 --> 00:31:02,854
Rangrong helped me
with urgent work all night.

308
00:31:02,854 --> 00:31:05,760
She's stuck here because of me.

309
00:31:06,334 --> 00:31:07,500
Have some sympathy for her.

310
00:31:12,482 --> 00:31:17,139
Does she really need to eat, sleep,
and work in her boss's room all day?

311
00:31:22,736 --> 00:31:23,736
Honey,

312
00:31:25,143 --> 00:31:26,471
don't overthink it.

313
00:31:27,349 --> 00:31:29,000
You're the only one for me.

314
00:31:29,675 --> 00:31:31,280
Everyone else is just an employee.

315
00:31:31,869 --> 00:31:35,647
I don't see them as anything more than that.

316
00:31:40,828 --> 00:31:41,894
Babe…

317
00:31:48,522 --> 00:31:49,840
I miss you so much.

318
00:31:50,928 --> 00:31:54,649
If you miss me so much,
why don't you just leave that Auntie already?

319
00:31:54,649 --> 00:31:58,032
How long do you want me to wait? Huh?

320
00:31:58,032 --> 00:32:01,120
Babe, you know that I still need her money.

321
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,377
I don't care.

322
00:32:03,226 --> 00:32:05,600
Just break up with her.
Even if we starve, I won't care.

323
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,226
I'll break up with her,

324
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:11,506
but please wait a little longer.

325
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:15,320
Trust me, okay?

326
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,310
Okay.

327
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:22,018
But you must break up with that Auntie
for real.

328
00:32:34,497 --> 00:32:35,497
Where have you been?

329
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,795
I went out for some fresh air.

330
00:32:46,862 --> 00:32:49,262
You don't tell me
where you're going anymore.

331
00:32:55,937 --> 00:32:58,560
I won't go anywhere.

332
00:33:01,717 --> 00:33:04,310
Don't be mad at me, okay?

333
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:19,899
Here you go.

334
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,630
Thank you.

335
00:33:31,466 --> 00:33:33,600
These are all of Miss Run's test results.

336
00:33:34,123 --> 00:33:35,995
There's nothing unusual.

337
00:33:49,055 --> 00:33:50,266
Here we go…

338
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:53,406
Wow…

339
00:33:53,993 --> 00:33:55,243
Whoa,

340
00:33:56,223 --> 00:33:57,885
how long will this take to finish, Yayee?

341
00:34:00,156 --> 00:34:01,671
Help me put these together.

342
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:02,673
Okay.

343
00:34:16,428 --> 00:34:19,043
Yayee… Your mom is calling.

344
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:22,655
Mommy!

345
00:34:22,655 --> 00:34:27,039
Yayee, I heard the news about the condo.
It must be very chaotic, right?

346
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,519
Come back soon, Mommy.

347
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:31,416
Stay with Run for now, sweetie.
Don't be naughty, okay?

348
00:34:32,788 --> 00:34:34,120
Where are you, Mommy?

349
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:37,487
They've closed off the condo.
No one can enter or leave.

350
00:34:38,062 --> 00:34:41,160
If I could get in,
I would go to you right away, sweetie.

351
00:34:44,801 --> 00:34:46,051
Mommy…

352
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,613
Mommy loves you, Yayee.

353
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:15,207
I miss Mommy.
Please bring her back to me.

354
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,840
I'll bring her back to you.

355
00:35:34,912 --> 00:35:36,397
Come on. Keep playing.

356
00:35:52,476 --> 00:35:53,883
It's okay. I'll take care of it.

357
00:36:08,754 --> 00:36:10,471
You and our child will get better.

358
00:36:11,992 --> 00:36:13,459
I'm close to finding the solution.

359
00:36:20,464 --> 00:36:22,502
You and our child will be okay.

360
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,591
Run, did my mom call again?

361
00:36:48,683 --> 00:36:50,234
Let me check.

362
00:36:54,536 --> 00:36:56,689
Yayee, your mom hasn't called yet.

363
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:59,266
She's probably trying to find a way to get in.

364
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:15,240
Should I try calling her again?

365
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,284
Okay.

366
00:37:30,394 --> 00:37:31,394
Hello?

367
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,550
Hi, Dad.

368
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:36,149
Oh, Run? How are you?

369
00:37:36,149 --> 00:37:38,400
I'm going on an official trip
to another province.

370
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:40,492
You might not see me for a while.

371
00:37:42,569 --> 00:37:43,441
Well,

372
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:45,524
you always make your own decisions

373
00:37:45,524 --> 00:37:48,076
about where you want to go
and what you want to do.

374
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:55,520
And if you need anything, just call me.

375
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,845
If I can't answer, I'll call you back.

376
00:37:57,845 --> 00:37:59,280
Okay.

377
00:38:39,875 --> 00:38:40,875
Hey.

378
00:38:42,098 --> 00:38:43,098
Are you asleep yet?

379
00:38:46,713 --> 00:38:47,713
Hey.

380
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:57,459
Hey.

381
00:39:09,736 --> 00:39:11,028
What?

382
00:39:11,028 --> 00:39:12,032
You can't sleep?

383
00:39:20,642 --> 00:39:21,642
Yeah.

384
00:39:27,642 --> 00:39:28,731
You see,

385
00:39:28,731 --> 00:39:33,600
the dream home I imagined
now seems to be out of reach.

386
00:39:35,411 --> 00:39:40,090
How about this?
Just think of it as a scout camp.

387
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,286
With mentors guarding outside.

388
00:39:51,226 --> 00:39:52,798
That's not helping at all.

389
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,600
Come on, we will get through it.

390
00:40:00,114 --> 00:40:02,508
Will we really get through this?

391
00:40:06,816 --> 00:40:10,696
Yeah, we'll get through this together.

392
00:40:13,927 --> 00:40:15,292
I'll protect you.

393
00:40:24,507 --> 00:40:27,712
That gave me goosebumps.
Go back to sleep.

394
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:55,103
Miss Run's blood test results are back.

395
00:40:56,754 --> 00:40:59,806
Her blood only temporarily inhibits
the disease's progression.

396
00:40:59,806 --> 00:41:03,230
The lab needs more blood samples
to repeat the test and confirm.

397
00:41:05,973 --> 00:41:07,838
If you need it, then go get her.

398
00:41:08,993 --> 00:41:09,996
Yes, sir.

399
00:41:36,372 --> 00:41:38,614
Here it is.

400
00:41:38,614 --> 00:41:41,927
I've prepared the most delicious breakfast
in the world for you.

401
00:41:41,927 --> 00:41:43,720
The egg isn't burnt, I promise.

402
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:46,644
Come on, Yayee…

403
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,880
Yayee?

404
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:55,828
Yayee, what's wrong?

405
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:57,975
Yayee!

406
00:42:05,486 --> 00:42:07,078
My inhaler is out.

407
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,906
You have asthma?

408
00:42:32,569 --> 00:42:34,761
We need to do another blood test.

409
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,901
We've changed to new equipment,
which will give us more accurate results.

410
00:42:40,985 --> 00:42:43,037
Okay, I can do the test, but I can't be there.

411
00:42:43,037 --> 00:42:45,445
If you want to do the test,
you have to come here.

412
00:42:45,445 --> 00:42:49,924
Oh, and if you do come,
please bring 3-4 Ventolin inhalers.

413
00:42:49,924 --> 00:42:51,271
There's someone here with asthma.

414
00:42:53,026 --> 00:42:55,320
If my blood is so important,
then come right now.

415
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:02,960
And another thing, find someone for me.

416
00:43:27,604 --> 00:43:28,604
Da…

417
00:43:30,486 --> 00:43:33,522
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

418
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,727
Come in.

419
00:44:02,537 --> 00:44:06,700
Director, the lab team reported
on Miss Run's blood test.

420
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:10,708
She might have antibodies in her blood.
There's a 10% chance.

421
00:44:18,942 --> 00:44:20,438
I'll take it, even with a 1% chance.

422
00:44:21,517 --> 00:44:22,669
Go get her here.

423
00:44:24,683 --> 00:44:26,122
She refused to come.

424
00:44:40,014 --> 00:44:41,704
Hello? Yeah…

425
00:44:42,422 --> 00:44:43,548
Yayee has asthma.

426
00:44:43,548 --> 00:44:44,414
What?

427
00:44:44,414 --> 00:44:45,803
But don't worry.

428
00:44:45,803 --> 00:44:47,340
I've already given her first aid.

429
00:44:47,887 --> 00:44:50,311
But I need you to look after her for a bit.

430
00:44:50,311 --> 00:44:51,471
I'll be back soon.

431
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,053
Where are you now?

432
00:44:54,053 --> 00:44:55,591
I'm waiting for Joy.

433
00:44:55,591 --> 00:44:57,996
Joy? Who brought her in?

434
00:45:00,453 --> 00:45:01,641
I have to go.

435
00:45:01,641 --> 00:45:02,726
Yutthasak is here.

436
00:45:03,252 --> 00:45:04,402
Hey, Run. Wait--

437
00:45:11,012 --> 00:45:12,412
How are you doing, Yayee?

438
00:45:16,132 --> 00:45:18,473
Where did Run go?

439
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:22,056
Run is doing a security check.

440
00:45:22,056 --> 00:45:24,360
Be strong, okay?
You'll feel better soon.

441
00:45:28,939 --> 00:45:29,995
Where is Joy?

442
00:45:32,432 --> 00:45:33,678
She's with us now.

443
00:45:34,205 --> 00:45:36,550
She's been with us
since before you asked for our help.

444
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:38,797
What do you mean?

445
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,360
Why are you doing this to me?

446
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:50,320
How can I go back to my daughter now?

447
00:45:51,794 --> 00:45:53,398
Stay with Run for now, sweetie.

448
00:45:54,352 --> 00:45:57,019
Don't be naughty, okay?
Mommy loves you, Yayee.

449
00:45:57,019 --> 00:45:59,256
Yayee, you're my only happiness.

450
00:46:02,915 --> 00:46:04,491
So she's still alive?

451
00:46:05,617 --> 00:46:07,238
She's alive for now.

452
00:46:07,835 --> 00:46:10,880
And because of that, we need your help.

453
00:46:14,075 --> 00:46:15,762
We need you to give us more blood samples.

454
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,289
[Prach]

455
00:46:22,604 --> 00:46:24,520
Alright. Now rest well.

456
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:30,817
Run?

457
00:46:35,784 --> 00:46:37,023
We need you to give us more blood samples.

458
00:46:37,023 --> 00:46:38,842
But I said I needed two days, didn't I?

459
00:46:38,842 --> 00:46:41,700
But we don't have time.
You have to come with me now. Let's go.

460
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:43,561
- Then let me call Prach first.
- Run…

461
00:46:43,561 --> 00:46:44,567
Okay.

462
00:46:45,095 --> 00:46:46,095
Hey!

463
00:46:47,327 --> 00:46:48,327
Run?

464
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:53,050
Run!

465
00:47:27,668 --> 00:47:28,668
Run!

466
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,527
We need you to give us more blood samples.

467
00:47:46,379 --> 00:47:47,880
Then let me call Prach first.

468
00:47:48,526 --> 00:47:49,527
Okay.

469
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:39,519
Open the gate.

470
00:50:57,598 --> 00:50:58,777
Thank you.

471
00:51:54,693 --> 00:51:55,954
Hey!

472
00:51:55,954 --> 00:51:56,790
Just now…

473
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:59,158
I found something covered in blood.

474
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:01,435
Calm down and tell us.
What did you find in the condo?

475
00:52:01,435 --> 00:52:02,722
Is it a movie promotion?

476
00:52:03,301 --> 00:52:04,762
Open up!

477
00:52:04,762 --> 00:52:07,704
Just open the door for him.
He's making a big fuss right now.

478
00:52:07,704 --> 00:52:08,787
Help me! Help me!

479
00:52:08,787 --> 00:52:09,904
Back away!

480
00:52:09,904 --> 00:52:10,812
Just like what I saw.
Monster!

481
00:52:11,504 --> 00:52:13,680
Even if they bring food tomorrow,

482
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,435
who would dare go out and get it?

483
00:52:16,435 --> 00:52:17,804
I'll go.

484
00:52:17,804 --> 00:52:20,021
How much per person would be appropriate?

485
00:52:20,021 --> 00:52:21,421
Someone's desperate for money.

486
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,344
We have to do something.

487
00:52:25,344 --> 00:52:26,346
They probably…

488
00:52:27,014 --> 00:52:29,491
have their own reasons for not announcing it.

489
00:52:29,491 --> 00:52:31,691
If they won't say anything, we have to.

490
00:52:38,002 --> 00:52:39,002
Clear everything out.

491
00:52:40,056 --> 00:52:41,131
Director,

492
00:52:41,131 --> 00:52:43,830
we found the trainer
who is suspected to be infected.

493
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:44,837
He's dead.

494
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:47,810
So you lied to us?

495
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:49,402
I did not lie.

496
00:52:49,402 --> 00:52:52,145
I just didn't think you needed to know

497
00:52:52,145 --> 00:52:52,906
because even if you did,

498
00:52:52,906 --> 00:52:54,355
it won't be of any use.
