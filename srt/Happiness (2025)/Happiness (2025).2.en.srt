00:00:05,712 --> 00:00:12,025
[This series is a work of fiction. All characters,
locations, and events are entirely fabricated.]

2
00:00:14,329 --> 00:00:15,821
And when I woke up,

3
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:19,094
he was dead.

4
00:00:19,094 --> 00:00:20,251
Did you use any drugs?

5
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:27,079
Pol. Maj. Prach,
the youngest detective inspector,

6
00:00:27,825 --> 00:00:29,642
Are you interested in working with me?

7
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,398
This isn't a normal situation.

8
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,535
I need someone with your skills
to help us solve the problems.

9
00:00:43,207 --> 00:00:44,832
Run, don't get involved with them.

10
00:00:47,646 --> 00:00:49,515
- Beating your wife again!
- Don't mess!

11
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:50,789
Why not?

12
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,268
Let's go, Dad.

13
00:00:53,268 --> 00:00:54,807
Let's get out of this flat.

14
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,370
That wound, you were scratched, right?

15
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:12,935
We need to take you to the center.

16
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:15,245
And if you're infected,
you'll have to undergo treatment.

17
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:35,910
Hi…

18
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:39,324
This way, please.

19
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:16,349
Clean, Room 48.

20
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,165
Hey! Hey!

21
00:02:21,165 --> 00:02:23,684
Hey! What are you doing?

22
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:25,725
Open up!

23
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,810
Open the door! The key? Give me the key.!

24
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,333
Tarn…

25
00:02:44,326 --> 00:02:45,966
Run, I need water. Water…

26
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,068
Tarn, are you better now?

27
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:50,724
Run, I'm thirsty.
I need water. Water…

28
00:02:52,054 --> 00:02:55,008
Open the door!
Why did you go in there?

29
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,380
I said, 'Open up the door
and come out!' Come out!

30
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,886
I need water…

31
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:01,557
Open the door!

32
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,380
There's no more water, Tarn.

33
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,100
I need water… water… water…

34
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,451
There's no more water.
Tarn, pull yourself together.

35
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:10,912
The key! Quick!

36
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:13,607
The drug… drug…

37
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:15,716
- What drug, Tarn?
- The drug, Run, drug…

38
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:18,926
- Open!
- The drug… The drug!

39
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:21,486
- Open the door!
- Someone brought the drugs.

40
00:03:21,486 --> 00:03:22,692
Who?

41
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:24,191
- Miss Run.
- Tell me where the drugs are.

42
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:25,777
- Open up!
- Who did you buy it from, Tarn?

43
00:03:25,777 --> 00:03:27,035
- Answer me, Tarn.
- That day…

44
00:03:27,035 --> 00:03:29,512
- Who was it that day? Answer me, Tarn.
- Come out!

45
00:03:29,512 --> 00:03:32,135
It's dangerous in there.

46
00:03:32,135 --> 00:03:33,205
Miss Run!

47
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,605
Code Red!

48
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:09,884
What's going on?

49
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,401
Miss Run!

50
00:05:25,403 --> 00:05:29,162
[Happiness]

51
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,426
- Miss Run!
- Hey, what's going on?

52
00:06:22,031 --> 00:06:23,031
Run?

53
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,410
Run!

54
00:06:29,076 --> 00:06:30,076
Run!

55
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:39,740
- Run!
- Hey, hey! Calm down.

56
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,826
Let go of me!

57
00:06:42,473 --> 00:06:43,506
Let me go!

58
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,631
Get up right now! I said get up!

59
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,232
Don't shoot!

60
00:07:00,413 --> 00:07:01,521
Don't shoot!

61
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,328
You can't shoot her!

62
00:07:31,947 --> 00:07:33,026
Don't shoot!

63
00:07:36,397 --> 00:07:38,424
Don't! Tarn is sick.

64
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:42,323
- Don't shoot!
- Restrain her!

65
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,090
Run?

66
00:07:50,885 --> 00:07:51,887
Run?

67
00:07:52,698 --> 00:07:54,917
Are you alright? Are you hurt?

68
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:56,744
I'm fine.

69
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:18,753
What actually happened?

70
00:08:21,326 --> 00:08:22,710
What's wrong with that woman?

71
00:08:33,941 --> 00:08:35,699
We call it "Rage Disease."

72
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:38,110
Rage Disease?

73
00:08:40,981 --> 00:08:42,876
We've discovered that
the infected individuals

74
00:08:42,876 --> 00:08:45,410
are living among
the general population.

75
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:51,640
Our unit was established to control
and resolve this situation.

76
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,599
So this is where you're keeping
all the infected people?

77
00:09:04,271 --> 00:09:05,286
Restrain him!

78
00:09:13,408 --> 00:09:14,681
Restrain him now!

79
00:09:25,102 --> 00:09:26,915
And all we can do is quarantine them?

80
00:09:28,846 --> 00:09:31,916
It's the best we can do right now.

81
00:09:34,845 --> 00:09:36,408
How do we stop it?

82
00:09:50,606 --> 00:09:52,824
This is the basic information
we have on the drug NEXT.

83
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:02,204
What we know so far is that
it contains chemicals

84
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:05,251
that affect the nervous system,
the brain, and hormones.

85
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:07,696
NEXT comes in various forms and colors,

86
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:09,550
with different claimed benefits,

87
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,722
treating kidney disease, cancer,
boosting energy, or slowing aging.

88
00:10:13,722 --> 00:10:16,829
But no one knows about the side effect
that turns people into rage monsters.

89
00:10:19,501 --> 00:10:22,612
So what I asked you before about the drugs,

90
00:10:22,612 --> 00:10:24,182
it really is connected to this disease.

91
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,532
So Tarn is like this
because she took this drug?

92
00:10:31,542 --> 00:10:34,258
But I didn't take it,
so why am I being quarantined?

93
00:10:35,049 --> 00:10:36,653
Besides this drug,

94
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:39,916
the disease can also be transmitted
through blood.

95
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:43,114
So any bite or scratch that comes into contact

96
00:10:43,114 --> 00:10:47,137
with infected blood
can also cause infection.

97
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:49,497
Is there a cure?

98
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,426
For now, nothing.

99
00:10:55,205 --> 00:10:58,922
The only way to solve this is
to find the source and stop the spreading.

100
00:11:00,143 --> 00:11:03,473
So, I was right to think of Ple as a victim.

101
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:06,580
This drug is becoming
increasingly accessible.

102
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,292
It's easier for people
to get their hands on it,

103
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,220
so it's spreading faster.

104
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:12,605
You mean we can't control
this disease at all?

105
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,881
Exactly!

106
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:18,949
That's why I need your help to stop it.

107
00:11:24,845 --> 00:11:29,017
I'm certain this task
is beyond your usual duties,

108
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:35,369
but we're willing to do
whatever it takes to help you succeed.

109
00:11:35,369 --> 00:11:39,009
But please, keep this confidential.

110
00:12:02,191 --> 00:12:03,753
The incident involved
the use of a firearm against a youth

111
00:12:03,753 --> 00:12:06,391
in a well-known
and often crowded shopping mall.

112
00:12:06,391 --> 00:12:07,737
The target was indiscriminate,

113
00:12:07,737 --> 00:12:10,792
and the context differs
from previous violent incidents,

114
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:13,201
presenting a situation
that requires…

115
00:12:13,201 --> 00:12:15,172
You're back, my dear.

116
00:12:16,357 --> 00:12:17,551
It's quite late this time.

117
00:12:17,551 --> 00:12:20,443
I'm an adult now, Dad.
I can stay out late.

118
00:12:20,443 --> 00:12:25,431
Oh, Run, did you know that
Sing and Tarn moved out?

119
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:27,632
They also didn't tell anyone.

120
00:12:31,924 --> 00:12:32,929
Really?

121
00:12:33,895 --> 00:12:34,900
Yeah.

122
00:12:36,231 --> 00:12:37,239
Yeah.

123
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:54,535
This disease can also be
transmitted through blood.

124
00:12:55,873 --> 00:12:58,821
This drug is becoming
increasingly accessible.

125
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:00,842
It's easier for people
to get their hands on it.

126
00:13:00,842 --> 00:13:02,623
You wouldn't want to end up like her,

127
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:05,849
hurting the people you love unaware,
would you?

128
00:13:24,438 --> 00:13:25,590
Dad.

129
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,711
Hmm?

130
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:30,336
What is it?

131
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:37,598
What's wrong?

132
00:13:38,953 --> 00:13:40,175
What's the matter?

133
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,033
Tell me honestly, what's the matter?

134
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,651
I just…

135
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:11,236
I just want you to move to a better place.

136
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,314
At least better than here, Dad.

137
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:16,772
So you can be happy.

138
00:14:18,814 --> 00:14:23,189
You see, I'm already happy
just being here.

139
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:27,017
Sing and Tarn have moved out,
so no one is bothering me anymore.

140
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:29,709
It's just lonely, you know?

141
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:32,931
No one is shouting
and making a fuss like before.

142
00:14:35,283 --> 00:14:38,024
Dad, I'm serious.

143
00:14:38,674 --> 00:14:42,322
I really want you to move
to a better place.

144
00:14:44,127 --> 00:14:47,420
So we can be happy, Dad.

145
00:14:59,109 --> 00:15:02,234
- Alright, alright.
- Dad.

146
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,711
Okay, okay. I'm okay with that.

147
00:15:04,711 --> 00:15:07,907
If you're happy, then I'm happy too.

148
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:11,546
Why the tears?

149
00:15:11,546 --> 00:15:16,208
We'll move if you want to move.
If you're happy, I'm happy too.

150
00:15:16,828 --> 00:15:19,186
It's settled.
So, where are we moving to?

151
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,600
- Really?
- Yeah.

152
00:15:37,964 --> 00:15:40,168
[Day 4]

153
00:15:51,031 --> 00:15:52,031
Top!

154
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:56,437
You little punk!
I could smack you with my gun!

155
00:15:56,437 --> 00:15:59,125
- Calm down.
- Sneaking up on me like that.

156
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,406
Where have you been
these past few days?

157
00:16:03,868 --> 00:16:04,868
Do you want to know?

158
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:07,680
Oh, playing coy, huh?

159
00:16:08,854 --> 00:16:10,782
Well, then, I'm not going easy on you today.

160
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:28,060
Cover.

161
00:16:28,717 --> 00:16:29,724
Move.

162
00:16:37,452 --> 00:16:38,452
Move.

163
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:52,690
Director.

164
00:16:53,707 --> 00:16:56,318
The results of the infection test
after 48 hours

165
00:16:56,318 --> 00:16:58,863
show no changes in her body.

166
00:16:58,863 --> 00:17:00,955
However, the lab reports that

167
00:17:00,955 --> 00:17:04,923
her blood is showing signs of
self-repair at the cellular level.

168
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:16,206
But the percentage is still low.
We can't be sure yet.

169
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:18,185
Because it might be like
other cases, where…

170
00:17:18,185 --> 00:17:21,109
the initial test after the wounded
shows nothing,

171
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:23,132
but the second test
comes back positive.

172
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:30,170
We need to keep her close to us.

173
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:33,220
She might actually have
what we're looking for.

174
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:39,429
In any case, keep monitoring her
and report to me regularly.

175
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:48,029
I thought something was up.

176
00:17:49,189 --> 00:17:50,360
There is.

177
00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:52,632
What are we going to do next?

178
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:55,332
Do what next? About what?

179
00:17:56,093 --> 00:17:57,412
The mission, of course.

180
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,039
Where should we start?

181
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:06,114
So, you've accepted the mission?

182
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:08,511
And you're not going to?

183
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,414
I don't quite trust him yet.

184
00:18:12,822 --> 00:18:15,529
But we're already involved in this.

185
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,233
Are we really not going to help him?

186
00:18:20,405 --> 00:18:23,607
If you don't help him,
then consider it helping me.

187
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:26,654
You mean…

188
00:18:30,325 --> 00:18:33,443
For now, the disease seems contained,

189
00:18:33,443 --> 00:18:35,575
but if people are still
distributing NEXT,

190
00:18:35,575 --> 00:18:38,070
the number of infected
will keep rising.

191
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,700
Still, we don't know who they are.

192
00:18:40,482 --> 00:18:43,630
I need you to investigate
who's involved in this operation

193
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,214
to stop the spread…

194
00:18:46,114 --> 00:18:48,307
and find out what they want.

195
00:18:52,022 --> 00:18:53,121
In exchange for…

196
00:18:57,426 --> 00:18:59,693
anything you ask for.

197
00:18:59,693 --> 00:19:01,121
In exchange for a condo.

198
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:13,746
So where will you start?

199
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:26,912
He was selling supplements
at my workplace.

200
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:32,127
He said if you take them,

201
00:19:32,127 --> 00:19:34,327
you won't get tired easily.

202
00:19:34,327 --> 00:19:37,141
You can work hard,
and still have energy.

203
00:19:39,999 --> 00:19:43,101
I took them for a few days
and felt fine,

204
00:19:43,101 --> 00:19:47,061
but that day,
I really don't remember anything.

205
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:48,780
Tarn, do you have 500 baht?

206
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,335
And what were you doing
before it happened?

207
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:54,602
It's just 500 baht,

208
00:19:54,602 --> 00:19:57,797
why are you being so stingy?
Are you giving it to me or not?

209
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,731
- Uncle! Uncle!
- You wench!

210
00:20:00,731 --> 00:20:02,106
After that,

211
00:20:02,829 --> 00:20:04,873
I don't remember anything.

212
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:13,131
What did that man look like?

213
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:15,420
Or did he have
any distinguishing features?

214
00:20:17,203 --> 00:20:19,226
I can't remember his face,

215
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,312
but I remember the day we met,

216
00:20:24,484 --> 00:20:28,419
he was wearing a black tracksuit
with a logo on it.

217
00:20:29,251 --> 00:20:31,540
The information Tarn gave us
is enough for today.

218
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:34,840
But we still need to find that man.

219
00:20:36,116 --> 00:20:39,427
Okay, I'll help you find him.

220
00:20:44,928 --> 00:20:48,760
Aha! You said you'd help me.

221
00:20:50,278 --> 00:20:51,861
I said I would help, so I will.

222
00:20:51,861 --> 00:20:53,974
Go on. You should get some rest.

223
00:20:56,238 --> 00:20:57,357
- Okay.
- Yeah.

224
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,357
I'm going then.

225
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:16,116
Hello, Kai.

226
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:20,011
[Day 5]

227
00:21:20,702 --> 00:21:22,931
So, you're going to be coming
and going like this now?

228
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:26,815
Yeah, I just told
Commander this morning.

229
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:29,951
Whoa, that's unusual.

230
00:21:30,483 --> 00:21:32,983
I didn't think Commander
would let you take time off like this.

231
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:36,023
Our unit is going to feel
awfully quiet without you.

232
00:21:39,326 --> 00:21:40,982
Are you saying I talk too much?

233
00:21:40,982 --> 00:21:42,462
No.

234
00:21:42,462 --> 00:21:45,820
I'm just complimenting
your advanced speaking skills.

235
00:21:47,751 --> 00:21:48,516
Okay.

236
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:52,045
But my ears might get lonely, too.

237
00:21:54,995 --> 00:21:56,226
Oh, and Top,

238
00:21:58,836 --> 00:22:01,991
thank you so much
for saving me that day.

239
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:04,431
If it weren't for you,
I would have been Spicy raw meat salad.

240
00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:07,982
Oh, it's nothing. We're even.

241
00:22:07,982 --> 00:22:09,984
You saved my life once too, remember?

242
00:22:09,984 --> 00:22:11,430
I almost died that time.

243
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:14,238
Wow. Do you still remember that
after all this time?

244
00:22:17,645 --> 00:22:21,181
All these images are from the CCTV
around the woman named Tarn's workplace.

245
00:22:23,006 --> 00:22:24,681
Most of them weren't very helpful,

246
00:22:25,751 --> 00:22:28,482
until I found this CCTV footage…

247
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:44,020
From this image,
I think this could be our most likely lead.

248
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:48,340
Freeze this image here.

249
00:22:51,964 --> 00:22:53,019
That drug…

250
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:01,000
I can't remember his face,

251
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,569
but I remember he was wearing
a black tracksuit.

252
00:23:06,702 --> 00:23:10,081
Oh, and… how's that woman
we rescued doing?

253
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,428
Well, I guess she's almost recovered.

254
00:23:14,428 --> 00:23:17,530
Almost recovered?
She was in pretty bad shape.

255
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,941
Well, the doctors are treating her symptoms.

256
00:23:19,941 --> 00:23:21,620
They're good at their jobs.

257
00:23:23,507 --> 00:23:24,726
What about you?

258
00:23:25,517 --> 00:23:27,038
Did the doctors treat you?

259
00:23:27,925 --> 00:23:29,487
Did they give you any drugs?

260
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,265
What drugs? I'm tough.

261
00:23:33,265 --> 00:23:36,632
This is… nothing to me.

262
00:23:38,991 --> 00:23:42,140
I'm fine, see? I can walk.

263
00:23:44,285 --> 00:23:46,030
I'm going now. See you later.

264
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,413
Who is that man?

265
00:23:55,612 --> 00:23:57,225
Try zooming in on the shoulder.

266
00:24:07,311 --> 00:24:08,488
[Run]

267
00:24:10,238 --> 00:24:11,310
What's up?

268
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,225
Hey, are you free today?

269
00:24:13,225 --> 00:24:14,421
Where are you taking me this time?

270
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:16,733
Yeah, to our favorite spot.
Are you coming?

271
00:24:16,733 --> 00:24:18,210
That Northeastern restaurant again?

272
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:21,828
Hey, if I tell you to come, just come,
I'll share the location with you.

273
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:22,830
Run?

274
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,014
A girl?

275
00:24:29,694 --> 00:24:33,110
Find more camera angles,
I need ten more.

276
00:24:34,381 --> 00:24:36,031
Whoa, ten more angles?

277
00:24:36,031 --> 00:24:38,389
- Yeah.
- Damn!

278
00:24:38,389 --> 00:24:40,100
By this evening.

279
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,390
This evening? How am I going to
find them in time, Inspector?

280
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:45,205
My god.

281
00:24:45,205 --> 00:24:47,086
Which restaurant?

282
00:24:47,086 --> 00:24:48,218
Can I come?

283
00:24:49,684 --> 00:24:50,734
Yes, sir.

284
00:25:08,246 --> 00:25:09,798
You didn't bring me here to eat?

285
00:25:10,652 --> 00:25:11,652
Huh?

286
00:25:12,316 --> 00:25:14,170
Who said I brought you here to eat?

287
00:25:22,301 --> 00:25:24,189
It's beautiful, like a dream, isn't it?

288
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,731
So why did you bring me here?

289
00:25:28,189 --> 00:25:30,678
And what's with
all the stopping and walking?

290
00:25:30,678 --> 00:25:32,215
Gee! What's with you?

291
00:25:34,926 --> 00:25:37,901
You're so cute! What's your name?

292
00:25:37,901 --> 00:25:39,294
My name is Yayee.

293
00:25:39,294 --> 00:25:41,629
What's your name?

294
00:25:41,629 --> 00:25:43,605
My name is Run.

295
00:25:43,605 --> 00:25:45,790
And what's your boyfriend's name?

296
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:52,129
My name is Prach.

297
00:25:52,129 --> 00:25:54,183
Did you just move in?

298
00:25:54,183 --> 00:25:58,308
Yes, we're looking for the sales office.

299
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,020
I know where it is! I'll take you there.

300
00:26:04,652 --> 00:26:05,902
Follow me.

301
00:26:05,902 --> 00:26:07,754
Thank you.

302
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,921
Here it is. Let's take a look together.

303
00:26:13,644 --> 00:26:17,511
Over here is
the common area of our project.

304
00:26:17,511 --> 00:26:22,951
In our common area,
we have a swimming pool downstairs.

305
00:26:22,951 --> 00:26:25,191
And this is our fitness center.

306
00:26:25,191 --> 00:26:28,707
We have standard treadmills,

307
00:26:28,707 --> 00:26:32,519
a yoga room, and exercise machines.

308
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:34,912
I would say it's fully equipped.

309
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:40,858
In addition, we also hire trainers
to take care of all our residents.

310
00:26:41,397 --> 00:26:46,029
And over here is our co-working space.

311
00:26:46,029 --> 00:26:49,616
This room is stocked with
carefully selected books.

312
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:54,356
There's also wi-fi and drinks available.

313
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:56,471
Are there any vacant units left?

314
00:26:56,471 --> 00:27:02,904
As for vacant units,
we currently have these three left.

315
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:06,918
Take a look
and see if you'd like to secure it first.

316
00:27:08,525 --> 00:27:10,001
I'll take this one.

317
00:27:10,001 --> 00:27:15,134
Excellent choice, Miss! This unit is perfect
for a couple like you two.

318
00:27:19,677 --> 00:27:23,032
So, shall we go ahead and secure the room?

319
00:27:26,691 --> 00:27:29,220
Mister, please sign as the witness.

320
00:27:33,436 --> 00:27:34,924
All done!

321
00:27:37,692 --> 00:27:39,502
[7-ELEVEN]

322
00:27:39,502 --> 00:27:40,763
I'll take this bowl.

323
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,582
Isn't that too big?

324
00:27:42,582 --> 00:27:44,102
I'm worried you won't have enough.

325
00:27:44,102 --> 00:27:45,718
Did you get everything?

326
00:27:46,648 --> 00:27:47,671
- Dear.
- Hmm?

327
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:49,319
Did you bring any money?

328
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,559
- I forget to bring my wallet here.
- Oh dear.

329
00:27:53,702 --> 00:27:55,804
Did you forget your money, ma'am?

330
00:27:55,804 --> 00:27:57,179
Yes, dear.

331
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,214
Would you like to pay by scanning?

332
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,392
I don't know how to do that, dear.

333
00:28:02,991 --> 00:28:06,247
You can take the items with you, ma'am.
I'll pay for them first.

334
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:11,312
Oh, thank you so much, dear.
You're the sweetest.

335
00:28:11,312 --> 00:28:13,846
You can return the money
next time you come down.

336
00:28:13,846 --> 00:28:15,319
Thank you, dear.

337
00:28:16,286 --> 00:28:17,608
Thank you, dear.

338
00:28:19,124 --> 00:28:20,827
So this might be what they call happiness.

339
00:28:23,842 --> 00:28:25,687
Hey, your bowl is huge too!

340
00:28:25,687 --> 00:28:27,514
This is pretty good.

341
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,217
Give me that.

342
00:28:36,565 --> 00:28:38,006
What is it, Kai?

343
00:28:38,006 --> 00:28:39,302
Inspector,

344
00:28:39,302 --> 00:28:41,529
could you take a look at the image
I just sent you?

345
00:28:53,197 --> 00:28:54,232
Something wrong?

346
00:28:58,661 --> 00:28:59,817
It's about work.

347
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,622
It's different, isn't it?

348
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:10,627
Yeah…

349
00:29:17,013 --> 00:29:19,070
- Hey!
- Hmm?

350
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,408
What's wrong?

351
00:29:23,525 --> 00:29:26,269
Do you remember the man
Tarn told us about?

352
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:27,627
The one who sold the drugs?

353
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:32,627
Yeah, I remember. Why?

354
00:29:35,431 --> 00:29:38,947
Well, on the CCTV footage,
I saw this man…

355
00:29:38,947 --> 00:29:42,032
Inspector, could you take a look
at the image I just sent you?

356
00:30:02,654 --> 00:30:06,036
On the CCTV footage, that man
went into The Breathe Condo.

357
00:30:06,893 --> 00:30:08,731
That man…

358
00:30:08,731 --> 00:30:11,724
Hey! I just signed the contract today!

359
00:30:11,724 --> 00:30:14,550
What am I supposed to do now?
And what about my dad?

360
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,802
Look, calm down.

361
00:30:19,205 --> 00:30:20,946
Don't move your dad in yet.

362
00:30:21,521 --> 00:30:24,739
And I'll help you find that man.

363
00:30:26,541 --> 00:30:27,599
Okay?

364
00:30:42,501 --> 00:30:46,236
So that means we have to
live together in that condo, right?

365
00:30:46,236 --> 00:30:48,543
But if the people there find out we're cops,

366
00:30:48,543 --> 00:30:50,804
we won't be able to find that man.

367
00:30:50,804 --> 00:30:53,510
So we have to make it look real.

368
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:56,954
Let's get married.

369
00:30:59,463 --> 00:31:00,514
Married?

370
00:31:01,407 --> 00:31:02,492
Yes.

371
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:06,133
The salesperson already thinks
we're a couple anyway.

372
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:08,451
Let's make it real.

373
00:31:10,412 --> 00:31:11,521
Are you serious?

374
00:31:12,758 --> 00:31:13,982
I'm serious.

375
00:31:14,766 --> 00:31:19,870
But it won't be for long.
Just until we find that man.

376
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:22,401
You don't have a girlfriend anyway.

377
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:27,026
Or are you going to tell everyone
we're cops investigating a case?

378
00:31:27,644 --> 00:31:29,914
- What do you say?
- How serious are you?

379
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:33,906
Very serious.

380
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:38,238
Okay? And do your part in the mission.

381
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,485
So we're married now.

382
00:31:51,485 --> 00:31:53,206
We're married now.

383
00:32:14,622 --> 00:32:15,636
Yeah.

384
00:32:17,925 --> 00:32:19,612
Yeah, we're married.

385
00:32:22,334 --> 00:32:24,018
This lamppost is our witness.

386
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:33,379
I'm going then.

387
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:56,820
Are there more infected people here?

388
00:32:57,333 --> 00:33:01,718
I'm just checking to make sure
there are no other infected people.

389
00:33:03,685 --> 00:33:05,210
Everything is fine.

390
00:33:13,436 --> 00:33:14,913
Is there anything else?

391
00:33:16,742 --> 00:33:19,531
We'd like to get a tissue sample
from your wound.

392
00:33:21,428 --> 00:33:23,750
Okay, I'll come by tomorrow.

393
00:33:36,187 --> 00:33:40,039
[Day 6]

394
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:56,670
So, where did that agency take you?

395
00:33:58,814 --> 00:34:00,413
Why do you want to know?

396
00:34:06,989 --> 00:34:12,227
Well, I want to know
how to take care of myself.

397
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:17,934
Top, you mean…

398
00:34:20,332 --> 00:34:24,926
That day,
when I was fighting with Tarn, I…

399
00:34:28,043 --> 00:34:30,208
But that was days ago.

400
00:34:31,181 --> 00:34:33,028
Are there any other symptoms?

401
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:35,935
Like what?

402
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:41,131
Like being thirsty and losing control,
that kind of thing.

403
00:34:55,781 --> 00:34:57,818
I have information that
he's connected to NEXT.

404
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:07,717
So, what is really your mission?

405
00:35:15,702 --> 00:35:16,936
As you know,

406
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:21,261
we need to find out
who's behind all this

407
00:35:21,261 --> 00:35:23,519
to stop the spread of the infection.

408
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:31,459
I know you want me to tell the public
the truth about this disease.

409
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:36,005
But if we can solve this problem
before the news gets out,

410
00:35:36,005 --> 00:35:38,314
we can avoid causing panic.

411
00:35:49,198 --> 00:35:50,760
I'm counting on you, Inspector.

412
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,560
If everyone is safe,
the people you love will be safe too.

413
00:36:02,822 --> 00:36:04,192
How old is this wound?

414
00:36:09,908 --> 00:36:11,567
From the day I arrested Tarn.

415
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,738
Have you had any symptoms since then?

416
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:19,333
Not at all.

417
00:36:25,405 --> 00:36:26,646
What now, Run?

418
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:28,925
Don't worry.

419
00:36:45,037 --> 00:36:48,241
Please come this way, Miss Run.
We need to do another blood test.

420
00:36:51,132 --> 00:36:52,286
You can't leave yet.

421
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:55,243
You have to wait
for a thorough examination first.

422
00:36:58,888 --> 00:36:59,888
Let's go.

423
00:37:00,412 --> 00:37:01,261
Run.

424
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,659
Wait here, Top. I'll be back soon.

425
00:37:30,053 --> 00:37:31,622
Why did you bring him here now?

426
00:37:32,436 --> 00:37:34,018
It's very dangerous, you know.

427
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,052
And he's had that wound for over 24 hours
since he's infected.

428
00:37:39,052 --> 00:37:41,804
What if he transforms in a crowded place?

429
00:37:45,685 --> 00:37:47,054
Can I ask you something?

430
00:37:51,221 --> 00:37:55,095
Are there any infected people
who don't show symptoms?

431
00:38:13,214 --> 00:38:14,909
There are you and your friend.

432
00:38:59,557 --> 00:39:01,413
Then where have all the other infected people…

433
00:39:05,286 --> 00:39:06,371
disappeared to?

434
00:39:09,118 --> 00:39:10,217
Let's get your blood drawn.

435
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,492
How is the woman you brought here?

436
00:40:36,492 --> 00:40:37,631
Which case?

437
00:40:37,631 --> 00:40:38,638
The one named Ple.

438
00:40:41,791 --> 00:40:44,271
Ah, she's being treated.

439
00:40:46,622 --> 00:40:51,103
And what happens
if the infected don't recover?

440
00:43:24,669 --> 00:43:26,562
So, where did that agency take you?

441
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,138
Why do you want to know?

442
00:43:43,429 --> 00:43:44,429
Mom.

443
00:43:49,483 --> 00:43:50,827
Hang in there, Mom.

444
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:53,906
You have to get better.

445
00:43:56,974 --> 00:43:59,540
I promise I'll find a cure for you.

446
00:44:00,701 --> 00:44:03,330
Quickly take care of the infected
and the body.

447
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,810
That day,
when I was fighting with Tarn…

448
00:44:32,948 --> 00:44:34,989
Go get checked
to make sure you're okay.

449
00:45:01,285 --> 00:45:03,793
To everyone watching this livestream,

450
00:45:03,793 --> 00:45:06,358
I'm currently at a location
in the heart of Bangkok.

451
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,019
This place is not a hospital,

452
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:18,123
but there's a morgue here…
filled with dead bodies.

453
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:22,438
And there are many patients

454
00:45:22,438 --> 00:45:23,935
waiting to be treated…

455
00:45:24,833 --> 00:45:26,791
for this strange disease.

456
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:30,364
My mother is one of them,
unable to receive treatment.

457
00:45:32,588 --> 00:45:36,283
The government hasn't released
any information about this.

458
00:45:36,283 --> 00:45:39,415
If this disease escapes, your family,

459
00:45:40,467 --> 00:45:41,829
the people you love,

460
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:45,712
- could get infected and die.
- Hey, look at this.

461
00:45:45,712 --> 00:45:47,376
And the one left with the most pain…

462
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:50,117
Ridiculous.
It must be just for content.

463
00:45:50,117 --> 00:45:51,322
Is you.

464
00:45:52,331 --> 00:45:55,017
Let's expose this until we get answers.

465
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:28,264
Hey, what the hell is this?

466
00:46:28,264 --> 00:46:29,329
Oh my!

467
00:46:51,049 --> 00:46:52,056
Top!

468
00:46:57,351 --> 00:46:58,659
- You can't enter.
- Open the door!

469
00:46:58,659 --> 00:47:00,014
You can't go in, miss.

470
00:47:00,014 --> 00:47:01,334
No entry.

471
00:47:01,334 --> 00:47:02,544
Stop!

472
00:47:02,544 --> 00:47:05,886
If we open this door
and the infection spreads,

473
00:47:05,886 --> 00:47:08,339
killing everyone,
will you take responsibility for it?

474
00:47:10,738 --> 00:47:12,476
- Open it!
- I can't, miss. No entry.

475
00:47:12,476 --> 00:47:13,545
Damn it!

476
00:47:14,795 --> 00:47:16,194
Top!

477
00:47:16,194 --> 00:47:17,960
- Top!
- Run…

478
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,608
I said open the door!

479
00:47:19,608 --> 00:47:21,271
He's still alive!

480
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:22,631
- Let me go!
- Run!

481
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,482
- He's still alive!
- Run…

482
00:47:24,482 --> 00:47:25,643
Let go!

483
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:27,573
Top!

484
00:47:28,576 --> 00:47:30,003
- Top!
- Run.

485
00:47:30,003 --> 00:47:32,294
- Top! Open the door!
- You can't go in there.

486
00:47:33,277 --> 00:47:35,201
- You can't enter.
- You can't enter.

487
00:47:35,201 --> 00:47:37,818
- Top!
- Run… I…

488
00:47:39,766 --> 00:47:40,769
Top!

489
00:47:42,005 --> 00:47:43,925
I'm… I'm counting on you--

490
00:47:43,925 --> 00:47:45,807
Top!

491
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:57,388
Top!

492
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:59,901
Top!

493
00:47:59,901 --> 00:48:01,119
Open the door!

494
00:48:03,253 --> 00:48:04,294
Top…

495
00:48:04,294 --> 00:48:06,114
- Are you okay?
- Contain the situation!

496
00:48:38,694 --> 00:48:41,908
You have to recover,
and get back to normal.

497
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,826
Because your happiness
is also my happiness.

498
00:50:15,493 --> 00:50:18,017
I don't care how much more
we have to lose.

499
00:50:22,555 --> 00:50:26,103
I'll make them pay
more than the pain we've suffered.

500
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,595
[Next Episode]

501
00:51:39,595 --> 00:51:41,025
Those people you saw…

502
00:51:42,509 --> 00:51:43,923
are the infected.

503
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:50,111
There are hundreds of them!

504
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,595
Let's keep moving forward.

505
00:52:02,884 --> 00:52:04,810
We should find a way
to protect ourselves from them.

506
00:52:04,810 --> 00:52:07,236
I'm asking you, please answer me.

507
00:52:07,236 --> 00:52:08,716
If I had to guess,

508
00:52:08,716 --> 00:52:11,486
they're probably believing
those rumors in the Line group chat,

509
00:52:11,486 --> 00:52:14,408
and then imagining that
there are zombies in this world.

510
00:52:18,338 --> 00:52:19,340
Run!
