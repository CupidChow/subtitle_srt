[This series is a work of fiction.
All characters, locations, and events are entirely fabricated.]

2
00:00:12,007 --> 00:00:12,825
[Previously]

3
00:00:12,825 --> 00:00:14,114
So you lied to us?

4
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:17,412
You should focus on more likely leads.

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,764
Will we survive this?

6
00:00:19,764 --> 00:00:21,782
They said everything would be fine.

7
00:00:21,782 --> 00:00:25,019
If I'm still okay tomorrow,
you can get me out of here.

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:28,112
But if I turn into one of those rage people,
run away immediately, understand?

9
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,334
Have you seen
what's going on down there?

10
00:00:30,334 --> 00:00:32,633
Even if they bring food tomorrow,

11
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,427
who would dare go out and get it?

12
00:00:35,427 --> 00:00:36,775
Who's willing to go out?

13
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:37,775
I'll go.

14
00:00:46,174 --> 00:00:47,549
If you don't come out, I'll shoot!

15
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:49,958
Get everyone back.

16
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:51,011
I'll handle this.

17
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:52,011
Prach!

18
00:00:56,407 --> 00:00:58,469
- Open the door! Open it! Now!
- Open up.

19
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:01,079
You guys, leave the stuff there,
and go wherever you want.

20
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,079
Yeah, get out of here.

21
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:08,710
You guys are so selfish.

22
00:01:10,873 --> 00:01:12,128
- So what?
- Stop! Wait!

23
00:01:12,128 --> 00:01:14,157
We risked our lives to get it for you.

24
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,622
So we can share it however we want.

25
00:01:16,622 --> 00:01:18,740
If you're not happy with that, go ahead!

26
00:01:19,316 --> 00:01:21,393
Aim, weren't you scared
being out there alone?

27
00:01:21,393 --> 00:01:22,757
The world needs to know this.

28
00:01:22,757 --> 00:01:24,690
If they won't say anything, then we have to.

29
00:01:25,236 --> 00:01:27,003
Let's make some content about it.

30
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:31,304
Move closer, Aim.

31
00:01:33,332 --> 00:01:34,350
Yeah, closer.

32
00:01:35,515 --> 00:01:36,515
Yeah, right there.

33
00:01:37,717 --> 00:01:39,163
Keep talking. Say anything.

34
00:01:45,603 --> 00:01:50,149
I normally work as a cashier
at the minimart

35
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:52,083
in The Breathe Condo.

36
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,290
Aim, hold on.

37
00:01:54,844 --> 00:01:55,873
That's not good.

38
00:01:55,873 --> 00:01:57,320
Move a little closer. Right there.

39
00:01:58,141 --> 00:01:59,377
Keep talking. Continue.

40
00:02:03,711 --> 00:02:06,200
And… suddenly…

41
00:02:07,434 --> 00:02:09,353
At first, I…

42
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:10,804
Aim, hold on.

43
00:02:10,804 --> 00:02:11,903
Can you move closer?

44
00:02:15,379 --> 00:02:16,379
Move closer.

45
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:18,264
Go on, Aim. Don't be afraid.

46
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,041
Jee, I think it's close enough.

47
00:02:20,662 --> 00:02:21,982
Move closer. Just a bit more.

48
00:02:21,982 --> 00:02:23,263
The view count is going up, Aim.

49
00:02:25,724 --> 00:02:26,724
Closer.

50
00:02:30,496 --> 00:02:32,136
Move closer. Just a little bit more, Aim.

51
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:34,217
Yeah, right there.

52
00:02:35,603 --> 00:02:36,603
Keep talking.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
They looked like...

54
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:43,757
Jee, where are you going?

55
00:02:43,757 --> 00:02:45,421
Don't be afraid. Stay right there.

56
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:46,421
Keep talking, Aim.

57
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:53,800
I saw a group of people.
They looked like...

58
00:02:54,663 --> 00:02:56,467
- like… those…
- Aim, the infected noticed us.

59
00:04:27,538 --> 00:04:31,217
[Happiness]

60
00:04:31,782 --> 00:04:32,782
The infected noticed us.

61
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:40,542
What did he think he was doing? Huh?

62
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:44,904
He was trying to broadcast
images of the infected.

63
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:52,585
He has no clue
what's the appropriate thing to do.

64
00:05:00,052 --> 00:05:01,412
You know what to do, right?

65
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:04,850
Yes, sir.

66
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,497
Aim, the infected saw us.

67
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,730
Yutthasak said that
the infected would be more aggressive at night.

68
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,894
Actually, he should have
announced it like that.

69
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,505
He should have said
it's dangerous all the time.

70
00:05:30,382 --> 00:05:31,382
Right.

71
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,646
Perhaps he thinks it's safer during the day.

72
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:40,892
Something happened downstairs.

73
00:05:58,007 --> 00:05:59,427
Is anyone in there? Please open up.

74
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,402
Please, open up!

75
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,696
Is anyone in there? Please open up.
Open the door!

76
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:07,810
Is anyone in there? Open up!

77
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,201
Hey, open up! Open it!

78
00:06:11,201 --> 00:06:12,808
Anyone in there? Open up for me!

79
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,412
Aim... Open it for me.

80
00:06:26,095 --> 00:06:27,860
Aim, please open the door for me. I'm sorry.

81
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:32,098
Aim... Aim, I'm sorry.
Please open up for me!

82
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,142
Aim! Aim, open the door!

83
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,225
Aim, Aim, I'm sorry! I still have to
take care of my grandparents!

84
00:06:39,225 --> 00:06:41,556
I have parents to take care of, too.

85
00:06:41,556 --> 00:06:43,535
Aim, I'm sorry.
Please open up for me, Aim.

86
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,180
Aim! Open up for me, Aim.

87
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,730
Aim. Wait, Aim!

88
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,635
Aim, open the door for me. Aim!

89
00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:51,635
Aim!

90
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,530
Aim... Aim!

91
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,610
Aim, come back
and open the door for me. Aim!

92
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:09,170
Aim... Aim...

93
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:11,970
I'm sorry!

94
00:07:29,202 --> 00:07:30,202
Aim...

95
00:07:31,622 --> 00:07:32,622
Thank you.

96
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:36,636
Thank you, Aim.

97
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:37,636
No need to thank me.

98
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,122
I just don't want to be a bad person like you.

99
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,296
I'm sorry.

100
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:45,095
I'm truly sorry.

101
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:46,095
That's enough.

102
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:49,935
I won't do this again, Aim.

103
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:54,791
Jee, what have you been doing?

104
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,333
Oh my!

105
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,544
Don't be afraid. It can't get in here.

106
00:07:59,544 --> 00:08:01,981
- Let's talk somewhere else.
- Why did you call us again?

107
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,009
What is it this time?

108
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:18,163
What happened?

109
00:08:18,885 --> 00:08:21,235
Someone posted a video of the infected online.

110
00:08:22,316 --> 00:08:23,410
What?

111
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,770
And that person is...

112
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:26,770
you.

113
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:29,262
What is this? What does this mean?

114
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:31,290
Keep talking. Say anything.

115
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:34,895
He really went out there.

116
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:43,675
Is that one of the infected?

117
00:08:43,675 --> 00:08:45,930
Oh my! That's true!

118
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,552
Why did he go out there?

119
00:08:50,535 --> 00:08:51,535
The infected!

120
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,417
Jee, did you leave Aim with the infected?

121
00:09:21,476 --> 00:09:22,514
Aim, this way!

122
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:33,429
This way, Aim.

123
00:10:04,489 --> 00:10:05,489
Okay.

124
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,614
Thank you, Beam.

125
00:10:14,158 --> 00:10:16,573
It's a good thing I followed you guys.

126
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:18,829
Otherwise, this would have ended badly.

127
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,886
You're okay now, Aim.

128
00:10:38,422 --> 00:10:39,422
It's over.

129
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:05,533
Why did you do that? Why would you do it?

130
00:11:05,533 --> 00:11:07,174
- Dear, calm down.
- Didn't I teach you better than this?

131
00:11:07,174 --> 00:11:10,130
- That's enough. That's enough.
- Calm down. Calm down.

132
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,410
He learned his lesson.

133
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,104
Calm down.

134
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:14,225
- That's enough.
- Calm down.

135
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,215
Calm down.

136
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:21,246
Thank you so much, Aim.

137
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:24,050
Thank you for forgiving my grandson.

138
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:27,278
Let's go up to our room.

139
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,971
What room are you talking about?

140
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:36,064
My wife and I... promised Run that...

141
00:11:37,035 --> 00:11:38,560
we'd let you stay with us.

142
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,671
Just for now, you stay with them, okay?

143
00:11:41,474 --> 00:11:42,474
Can you do that?

144
00:11:47,722 --> 00:11:49,570
Hey, what if someone gets bitten?

145
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,690
What should we do?

146
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,170
We don't know
who might have been bitten already.

147
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,170
Right.

148
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:58,890
Uh...

149
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,290
What is it? What's wrong?

150
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,450
I saw Jeu and Fah being chased
and bitten by the infected.

151
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:04,450
Hey!

152
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:07,628
Hold on, Ju. This is a serious matter.

153
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:09,232
You can't just joke about it.

154
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:10,207
I'm telling the truth.

155
00:12:10,207 --> 00:12:12,410
Hey, don't go around accusing others, Ju.

156
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,930
I wasn't bitten, and neither was Jeu.

157
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,606
Look, are there any marks? See?

158
00:12:16,606 --> 00:12:17,460
Don't come any closer.

159
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:20,170
You weren't bitten,
but what about Jeu?

160
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,690
Where is Jeu now?

161
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:22,786
Where is he?

162
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,247
Well, he's... He's...

163
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:28,215
He's writing a script in his room.

164
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:29,813
Don't lie to us.

165
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:34,199
If that's the case, let us go up to your room
to see if Jeu is really there.

166
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,074
But I can assure you that Jeu is fine.

167
00:13:04,741 --> 00:13:05,742
- Ah!
- Hey!

168
00:13:05,742 --> 00:13:06,826
My goodness,

169
00:13:06,826 --> 00:13:07,969
you scared me!

170
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,546
I thought you had transformed.

171
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:13,173
Transform, my ass. I'm just hungry.

172
00:13:14,798 --> 00:13:18,051
Hey, I heard something
but I don't know what it was.

173
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,410
Oh, really?

174
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,210
When I was secretly checking on you,

175
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,810
you were snoring so loudly
everyone could hear you.

176
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:26,960
Snoring? I'm just hungry.
I told you I was hungry.

177
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,220
Here, tie yourself up first.

178
00:13:32,362 --> 00:13:34,331
How am I supposed to eat if I'm tied up?

179
00:13:34,331 --> 00:13:37,479
Oh, right... Then I'll tie you up
and you can eat.

180
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:39,550
I still won't be able to eat, will I?

181
00:13:41,074 --> 00:13:42,906
Or I'll eat, and you tie yourself up.

182
00:13:43,844 --> 00:13:44,844
Give it to me.

183
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:48,412
I'll eat and then tie myself up.

184
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:57,718
It looks delicious.

185
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,448
This is mine.

186
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,455
You're not sharing?

187
00:14:09,311 --> 00:14:10,543
Fine, you eat first.

188
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,743
Thank you, Fah.

189
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,506
I'm saved.

190
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:27,410
You're saved,
but do you have any symptoms?

191
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,530
How about this?

192
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:33,010
I'll eat. Then I'll tie myself up
when I'm done.

193
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:35,450
That way, you can be sure that I'm safe.

194
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,450
Okay?

195
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,278
Let's do that.

196
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:40,278
Okay.

197
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:52,133
He seemed normal. He didn't look like
one of the infected at all.

198
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:54,819
There! So he really was scratched.

199
00:14:54,819 --> 00:14:56,367
Because I saw it with my own eyes.

200
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:58,327
Saw what?

201
00:14:58,327 --> 00:14:59,327
You saw what?

202
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,360
Hey, I got the stuff.

203
00:15:06,414 --> 00:15:07,614
Yeah.

204
00:15:07,614 --> 00:15:08,614
Hurry!

205
00:15:09,396 --> 00:15:10,396
I have to go.

206
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,720
Wait, let me catch my breath.

207
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,692
See? I told you to stay in the room.

208
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:20,417
You almost got bitten to death, didn't you?

209
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:23,200
What happened to your back?
Why is it bleeding?

210
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:26,328
Let me see.

211
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:30,574
You've been scratched.

212
00:15:30,574 --> 00:15:32,503
Am I going to turn into
one of those rage people?

213
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,788
Calm down. Stay calm.

214
00:15:35,788 --> 00:15:39,280
I have an idea. Get up.
Follow me. Quickly!

215
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:41,103
Hurry up!

216
00:15:44,384 --> 00:15:45,384
Go upstairs.

217
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:51,701
What were you doing there, Ju?

218
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,470
I was just throwing out the trash.

219
00:15:59,071 --> 00:16:02,474
Hold on, why are you suddenly suspicious of me?

220
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:06,200
Was Jeu really scratched?

221
00:16:07,847 --> 00:16:09,466
I've been keeping an eye on Jeu,

222
00:16:09,466 --> 00:16:12,329
but he hasn't shown
any signs of being infected.

223
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:14,560
But we can't be sure.

224
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:18,113
If he's really infected,
we have to get him out of the condo.

225
00:16:18,113 --> 00:16:19,480
- But Jeu--
- No!

226
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:22,588
I'm not risking it.

227
00:16:22,588 --> 00:16:24,438
Didn't you see the video?

228
00:16:24,438 --> 00:16:26,639
You're going to get us all killed.

229
00:16:27,296 --> 00:16:29,607
Everyone, let's calm down.

230
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:31,395
Take a deep breath.

231
00:16:31,395 --> 00:16:33,003
Get it together.

232
00:16:33,003 --> 00:16:35,839
No one has died or been hurt yet. Right?

233
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,705
You, stay out of this.

234
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,822
Anyway, Jeu can't stay here.
He has to leave.

235
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:43,370
Right? He can't stay.

236
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,371
- Right.
- That's right.

237
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:45,531
Right?

238
00:16:45,531 --> 00:16:46,531
Wait.

239
00:16:47,311 --> 00:16:48,787
Fah, just tell the truth.

240
00:16:48,787 --> 00:16:51,775
Because if it's true, we can quarantine him
in the fitness room.

241
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:54,920
But if it's not, that means
we're sending him out to die.

242
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:57,103
I'm telling the truth.

243
00:16:57,103 --> 00:16:59,549
Jeu isn't showing any signs of being infected.

244
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:04,919
How about this?

245
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,939
Let's take Jeu and quarantine him
in the fitness room first.

246
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,025
Is everyone okay with that?

247
00:17:12,803 --> 00:17:13,923
But...

248
00:17:15,643 --> 00:17:17,590
who's going to get Jeu there?

249
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,760
I will.

250
00:17:22,297 --> 00:17:23,297
I'll go too.

251
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:27,760
In case you try to trick us
and not take him to quarantine,

252
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:31,540
there are handcuffs from the old security guard
in the management office.

253
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,941
I'll bring them with me.

254
00:17:37,176 --> 00:17:38,194
This way.

255
00:17:46,526 --> 00:17:47,895
This place looks unfinished.

256
00:17:48,596 --> 00:17:51,812
Someone bought it
but never finished renovating it.

257
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:54,013
It's been so long that
the bank probably repossessed it.

258
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,480
Jeu is this way.

259
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:04,742
Wait...

260
00:18:05,504 --> 00:18:06,504
Hey...

261
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:09,653
Where did Jeu go?

262
00:18:10,164 --> 00:18:11,164
What?

263
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:13,320
Oh, no. Oh, no!

264
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:15,434
What do we do?

265
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:17,123
Was Jeu really here?

266
00:18:17,683 --> 00:18:20,597
He really was. I tied him up with the string.

267
00:18:21,918 --> 00:18:22,919
Goodness.

268
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:24,085
What are we going to do?

269
00:18:27,664 --> 00:18:29,505
Do you think that string would hold him?

270
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:32,402
Oh no, what are we going to do?

271
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,606
Everyone, be careful.

272
00:18:49,803 --> 00:18:50,803
Jeu.

273
00:18:53,502 --> 00:18:54,394
Jeu!
Fah!

274
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,800
What are you doing in there?

275
00:18:59,174 --> 00:19:01,835
I'm hiding here. I'm scared.

276
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,396
Take him to the fitness room.

277
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:19,002
Do I really have to stay here?

278
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:21,858
Yes, you do. Stay here.

279
00:19:23,012 --> 00:19:26,120
Don't be afraid. It's only for a few days.

280
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,898
But... But I'm not really infected.

281
00:19:31,898 --> 00:19:34,280
It's for the safety of everyone in the condo.

282
00:19:39,073 --> 00:19:40,386
Don't worry.

283
00:19:40,386 --> 00:19:43,423
I'll stay with you.
It's only for a few days.

284
00:19:46,382 --> 00:19:47,560
I'm sorry,

285
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,909
but we can't take any risks.

286
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:54,070
Can I just quarantine myself in my room?

287
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,404
I won't come out at all.

288
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:58,067
But you have a wound. It's still risky.

289
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:00,465
Fah, tell them.

290
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:02,555
Tell them I've been isolating myself all day.

291
00:20:02,555 --> 00:20:05,300
I don't have any symptoms
and nothing is going on with me.

292
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,840
Tell them.

293
00:20:09,161 --> 00:20:13,676
Let's say, if you are infected,
and you bite Fah,

294
00:20:13,676 --> 00:20:15,160
it will become a much bigger problem.

295
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,947
Fah... Are you afraid of me?

296
00:20:26,909 --> 00:20:28,568
I'm not afraid of you,

297
00:20:28,568 --> 00:20:31,815
but I think it's better if we keep our distance
and care for each other from afar.

298
00:20:33,244 --> 00:20:34,921
You won't leave me, right?

299
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:37,973
I won't leave you. I promise.

300
00:20:37,973 --> 00:20:38,973
Promise?

301
00:20:43,315 --> 00:20:46,706
Don't worry. He'll be safe here.

302
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:50,222
I know, I just can't help but worry about Jeu.

303
00:20:50,222 --> 00:20:51,782
I think you should get some rest.

304
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,520
Stay strong.

305
00:20:59,664 --> 00:21:00,664
Run.

306
00:21:01,841 --> 00:21:03,481
I have to talk to you about the infected.

307
00:21:09,091 --> 00:21:10,091
Hack is dead.

308
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,280
Since when?

309
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:16,010
The night you almost died because of him.

310
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:19,730
Who told you this?

311
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:22,805
I talked to Yutthasak.

312
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:30,155
I think whoever killed Hack is connected
to the drug distributor.

313
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:32,970
We need to find out who killed Hack.

314
00:21:34,468 --> 00:21:35,908
Where will you start?

315
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,815
You know how to pick locks?

316
00:22:14,461 --> 00:22:15,621
Top taught me.

317
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,907
Let's see what's inside.

318
00:22:26,962 --> 00:22:27,962
Take a look at this.

319
00:22:55,681 --> 00:22:57,086
This is a lot.

320
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,970
It's true, like Yutthasak said,

321
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:01,970
Hack was a drug dealer.

322
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:08,690
So it means Hack was killed
because of conflicting interests.

323
00:23:10,229 --> 00:23:11,432
I think it was to silence him.

324
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:15,490
The drugs and money were in Hack's locker.

325
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,845
The killer probably just wanted Hack dead.

326
00:23:31,886 --> 00:23:32,886
A notebook.

327
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,655
We need to see who Hack was in contact with.

328
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,974
There are a lot of people from this building.

329
00:23:48,578 --> 00:23:49,886
Look at the names on the list.

330
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,090
Most of the vitamins are for beauty purposes.

331
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:56,090
They help with skin whitening and brightening.

332
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:59,650
But this one is for detox.
It works wonders.

333
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,533
You can go to the bathroom
without any pain.

334
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,650
Where did you get these vitamins?

335
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,621
Oh, I got them from the trainer, Hack.

336
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,370
Do you know
what the effects of this drug are?

337
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:28,090
Of course. This one is for skin care.

338
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,610
It was selling really well before the lockdown.
I had so many orders.

339
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:34,303
Do you know where Hack got this drug from?

340
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,170
I don't know where Hack got it from.

341
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,170
I only got it from him.

342
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,090
Besides you, did anyone else
buy drugs from Hack?

343
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:44,650
There were a lot of people.

344
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,210
I often saw delivery drivers
picking up from him.

345
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:49,137
Sometimes he'd have
the housekeeper deliver them.

346
00:24:52,251 --> 00:24:54,489
Fah really doesn't seem to know anything

347
00:24:54,489 --> 00:24:56,509
about the drug causing people
to become infected.

348
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,948
What should we do now?

349
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,045
Here's your coffee.

350
00:25:15,978 --> 00:25:17,898
How much longer do we have to stay like this?

351
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:19,850
I can't even conduct a case online.

352
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:24,570
Then why don't you try offering consultations
to the people in the condo?

353
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:25,890
Maybe you can get some income that way.

354
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:30,790
Uh, but I don't think anyone would want
a consultation in this situation.

355
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,252
I don't think that's a good idea.

356
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:37,207
Then what would be a good idea?

357
00:25:39,365 --> 00:25:40,437
Don't worry, honey.

358
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:44,415
I have enough money for you to spend.

359
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:52,906
Then you guys keep working.
I'll go make some food.

360
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:58,690
Where were we?

361
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,799
Oh, right here.

362
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,950
Hey, what I said about the money earlier,

363
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,130
I meant it.

364
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:12,260
But I decide who gets it.

365
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,066
I have more information on Hack.

366
00:26:31,785 --> 00:26:34,840
It seems he's connected to
several residents,

367
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:38,730
both selling directly and through
a network outside the condo.

368
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,733
Are you sure this is the only place
where the drug is being distributed?

369
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,004
Our information is reliable.

370
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:47,259
I'll investigate further.

371
00:26:47,888 --> 00:26:49,971
You should send someone to help
as soon as possible.

372
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:54,330
Hey, you don't have much time left.

373
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,410
The number of infected people
in the condo is increasing.

374
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,380
I've managed to control the outbreak

375
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,090
outside the condo,

376
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,246
but if you don't find the source
and it spreads further,

377
00:27:04,246 --> 00:27:05,363
we'll have more trouble.

378
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,027
Or did we miss something?

379
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,410
Is the quarantine almost over?

380
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,890
Yeah, I've lost a lot of income
with no work.

381
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,170
Right.

382
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,770
But it's a good thing, isn't it?

383
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,170
We have food to eat and a place to sleep,

384
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,395
and we get to stay in a nice,
air-conditioned room. So refreshing.

385
00:27:40,395 --> 00:27:43,650
I could live like this forever, you know.

386
00:27:43,650 --> 00:27:46,130
No one to bother us.

387
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,449
Do you really think so?

388
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:52,930
Think about it. On a normal day,
I'm out there delivering food in the hot sun.

389
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:53,930
- Yeah?
- It's so hot.

390
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:57,402
Now, you're a security guard
at the front gate.

391
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,090
You have to endure the rain and the sun.

392
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,970
You have to greet everyone
who comes in and out.

393
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,850
And now, you get to stay in this cool,
air-conditioned place.

394
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:11,330
This is the best vacation
for people like us.

395
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:14,954
If people like us just do nothing,
how will we make any money?

396
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,574
Well, if we could choose how we were born,

397
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:20,496
I wouldn't have chosen
to be born poor like this.

398
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:23,756
Come now, we were already born this way.

399
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:28,993
Hey, is working as a delivery driver
enough to live off?

400
00:28:28,993 --> 00:28:29,993
Yeah.

401
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:35,106
Let me tell you, it's not enough.

402
00:28:35,996 --> 00:28:38,610
- What?
- Well, I do some side jobs.

403
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,100
I deliver packages for people in the building.
It pays well.

404
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,469
- Oh.
- Like queuing up,

405
00:28:43,469 --> 00:28:46,530
making restaurant reservations, or
buying concert tickets, that kind of thing.

406
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,339
Oh.

407
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:49,770
And the tips are… solid.

408
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,332
- Whoa.
- Nice. That sounds interesting.

409
00:28:52,332 --> 00:28:54,067
But there's one person in this condo,

410
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,130
Yeah?

411
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,130
This guy never gave me a single tip.

412
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,706
- Who?
- Who?

413
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:00,610
Tattep.

414
00:29:01,581 --> 00:29:02,690
- The lawyer guy.
- I knew it.

415
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,804
Hey, but there's another one.
This one is even stingier.

416
00:29:05,804 --> 00:29:08,014
This one bosses people around
and insults them too.

417
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:10,650
Aunt Noi.

418
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,529
I knew it.
Time to buy a lottery ticket.

419
00:29:13,529 --> 00:29:16,786
Speaking of insults, my boss is also like that.

420
00:29:16,786 --> 00:29:19,620
He gets along really well
with Aunt Noi, too.

421
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,850
They both insult and belittle people.

422
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,490
Yeah, the people here aren't good.

423
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,548
I've been here since the beginning, I know.

424
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:28,987
But if you know how to survive,
you can tolerate it.

425
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:31,181
Come on, let's not overthink it.

426
00:29:31,181 --> 00:29:32,295
- Eat up.
- Let's eat.

427
00:29:32,295 --> 00:29:33,330
Go ahead and eat.

428
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,410
If you're not full, take mine.

429
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,890
I think you're too calm, Director.

430
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:59,518
This situation is a
threat to national security.

431
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,130
I understand,

432
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,691
but I want to assure you that

433
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:10,890
we're close to finding
the source of the drug distribution.

434
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:12,782
You've been saying that for months.

435
00:30:12,782 --> 00:30:14,610
But we haven't been refrained from action.

436
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,930
While we're investigating
the drug distribution,

437
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:22,556
we're also developing a cure for this disease
with our own research team.

438
00:30:22,556 --> 00:30:25,010
You have more power than any other leader.

439
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,690
You practically control
the entire national security apparatus.

440
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,730
Please act accordingly.

441
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,170
Yes, sir.

442
00:30:42,948 --> 00:30:44,948
We weren't the ones who released this drug.

443
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:50,250
Even the people who did,
we don't know who they are.

444
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,930
And we're not in control of the situation
like we used to be.

445
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:56,690
That's why I said we can handle it.

446
00:31:00,012 --> 00:31:02,930
Then why are you so focused on that condo?

447
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:06,609
Because it's highly likely that

448
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:09,370
the source of the drug distribution
is in that condo.

449
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,610
But I just need a little more time.

450
00:31:16,473 --> 00:31:20,410
You know that he's not as kind as I am.

451
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:34,410
So the situation is not good right now.

452
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:37,112
I might have to escalate the operation

453
00:31:37,112 --> 00:31:39,232
to the next level

454
00:31:39,232 --> 00:31:40,690
to get to the source.

455
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,850
I've sent you a communication device.

456
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,410
You can contact me directly.

457
00:31:51,914 --> 00:31:53,210
Did he call?

458
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,690
He called to rush on us,

459
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:56,859
and he said he'd send us
a direct communication device.

460
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,428
Let's get back to work.

461
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,130
We can rule out Jeu and Fah.

462
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,650
I agree.

463
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,060
Look at the names on the list.

464
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:22,930
They don't live here,
but they come and go like they do.

465
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,668
The people who work in the condo must know

466
00:32:30,668 --> 00:32:33,690
every part of it, and every room in it.

467
00:32:35,457 --> 00:32:37,454
Are you saying that

468
00:32:37,454 --> 00:32:39,657
there's a room in this condo
where they're hiding drugs?

469
00:32:40,245 --> 00:32:41,245
Yes.

470
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,570
Security Guard Ohn.

471
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,749
If anyone knows the blind spots of the cameras
and the quietest times,

472
00:32:50,808 --> 00:32:51,857
it's the security guard.

473
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,214
I'd like to ask for your help.

474
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,690
You can win against this debt, you know.

475
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,998
He's got legal problems

476
00:33:03,998 --> 00:33:05,130
and needs a lot of money.

477
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,690
Are you going to hire me
as your lawyer?

478
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:10,830
Or, if you want to continue this conversation,
pay me 2,000 baht for a consultation.

479
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:12,675
I don't have any money.

480
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:15,690
What a waste of time.

481
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,570
And Por,

482
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:22,309
he is a delivery driver
who regularly comes and goes here.

483
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,976
No one would think twice

484
00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:27,512
about his movements or his delivery.

485
00:33:27,512 --> 00:33:30,130
He's a single parent with one son.

486
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,450
Who's willing to go out?

487
00:33:32,392 --> 00:33:33,392
I'll go.

488
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,450
As for your money, keep it.

489
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:38,801
Wait a minute!

490
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:41,198
Leave the money.

491
00:33:41,198 --> 00:33:42,570
I want the money too.

492
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:44,135
Someone is desperate for money.

493
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:48,690
And this one,

494
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:51,370
Ju.

495
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,850
She is a housekeeper.

496
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:57,286
And the housekeeper knows
every nook and cranny of this condo.

497
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:04,250
Hey, I got the stuff.

498
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,570
- Ju has been here for a long time.
- What were you doing there, Ju?

499
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:10,601
The residents know that
she also does private cleaning

500
00:34:10,601 --> 00:34:12,570
and other odd jobs.

501
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:15,192
She has easy access
to everyone's private spaces.

502
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:20,879
You're quite the analyst.

503
00:34:21,944 --> 00:34:24,113
Of course, I studied this.

504
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:29,554
Are you implying I didn't study?

505
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,952
And we can rule out Beam.

506
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:38,650
Why?

507
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:42,850
Why not?

508
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,873
What's your problem with him?

509
00:34:44,873 --> 00:34:46,193
Let's keep him for now.

510
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:55,890
Just rule him out.

511
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:57,402
Let's keep him for now.

512
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,690
What are they doing?

513
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:04,850
Well, Uncle Tao said
this method could stop the Rage Disease.

514
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,888
I can feel it and I can feel it.

515
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,845
How does it stop them?

516
00:36:11,845 --> 00:36:14,650
Well... You see the singing bowl?

517
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:17,130
Some monks use it to meditate.

518
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:20,252
When you meditate,
you can contemplate your body.

519
00:36:20,252 --> 00:36:24,170
When you contemplate your body, you find peace.
When you're at peace, you're not stressed.

520
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:25,855
And when you're not stressed,

521
00:36:25,855 --> 00:36:29,650
medical science says it helps reduce
the risk of many diseases.

522
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:34,482
And those stones... They're sacred stones.

523
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,924
So how does this method stop the Rage Disease?

524
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,330
It doesn't.

525
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:45,561
I think he's just following his blind faith.

526
00:36:48,057 --> 00:36:49,482
You don't believe me?

527
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,370
Watch.

528
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:54,330
Por.

529
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,890
Me?

530
00:37:00,007 --> 00:37:01,211
What do you want me to do?

531
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,530
Open it.

532
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:08,090
I-I-I can't do that.

533
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:10,655
Open it. Don't be afraid.

534
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:19,229
- I'm opening it now.
- Okay.

535
00:37:29,992 --> 00:37:30,992
Watch!

536
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:48,530
Go.

537
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,690
See? It's gone.
It's really gone. It's sacred.

538
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,130
Oh my, it worked.

539
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,892
It's really gone!
This is the real deal!

540
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:02,970
Master, you're amazing!

541
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:04,890
Would you like to take this bowl
for worship?

542
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,250
Yes, please. I'll take it.

543
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,530
I'll also prepare some holy water for you.

544
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,233
- Oh, that's even better.
- Okay.

545
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,170
Do you want some?

546
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:18,184
Here, a sacred stone.
It will dance as if it's alive.

547
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,050
It actually dances! It's dancing!

548
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,170
It's true! It's truly sacred!
This is so blessed!

549
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,793
It's so sacred. What a miracle, right?

550
00:38:27,793 --> 00:38:30,505
Por and Ju don't seem suspicious now.

551
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,125
We can't rule them out yet.

552
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,261
He's acting so secretive and suspicious.

553
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,174
Or maybe...

554
00:38:56,644 --> 00:38:58,330
they didn't throw it away.

555
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:01,250
Hey, I got the stuff.

556
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,827
But they hid it somewhere instead.

557
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,170
Should we follow him?

558
00:39:14,288 --> 00:39:16,010
- Totally blessed.
- Right. We're saved.

559
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:17,090
Give it to everyone.

560
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:17,970
Of course.

561
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,893
- Keep it with you.
- It's sacred.

562
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:01,059
Wait!

563
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,529
What's in that bag? Let me see it.

564
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,566
You can't. It's nothing important.

565
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,450
If it's nothing,
then why can't I see it?

566
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,106
There's nothing in there.
Don't worry about it.

567
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,610
Let go.

568
00:40:29,754 --> 00:40:33,075
I told you, it's a dead rat. It stinks.

569
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,899
Then why didn't you say so?

570
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:42,770
I was afraid you two would report me
to Aunt Noi.

571
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:45,530
Actually, I'm supposed to toss these
outside the building

572
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,970
but we can't go out now. So

573
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:50,638
please don't report me to Aunt Noi
or the condo management.

574
00:40:50,638 --> 00:40:52,822
Okay, I understand. I won't tell.

575
00:40:54,423 --> 00:40:56,690
I'm sorry for startling you.

576
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:58,611
Okay. Thank you.

577
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,290
What are you doing?

578
00:41:23,461 --> 00:41:25,033
Just popping a pill for my headache.

579
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,377
Is that Gorophen?

580
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:33,970
This is a strong drug.
It requires a prescription.

581
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:36,286
Did you go to a doctor?

582
00:41:37,269 --> 00:41:39,529
Oh, Beam gave it to me.

583
00:41:40,651 --> 00:41:41,844
That's unethical.

584
00:41:44,231 --> 00:41:45,922
Beam is a doctor.

585
00:41:47,488 --> 00:41:48,970
Don't overdo it.

586
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:52,029
Beam's name isn't even on the list
in Hack's notebook.

587
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:56,319
Oops... I'm sorry.

588
00:41:58,170 --> 00:41:59,227
That's clear enough.

589
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,500
Clear about what?
You're making baseless connections.

590
00:42:04,182 --> 00:42:06,502
Dr. Beam is a suspect.

591
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,490
Because he's a doctor,
he must have knowledge of medicine.

592
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:13,770
He could be distributing it.
Maybe even producing it.

593
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:17,209
And most importantly, he lives here.

594
00:42:17,209 --> 00:42:19,650
Therefore, he is a suspect.

595
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,891
What suspect?

596
00:42:29,667 --> 00:42:31,052
I'll find out.

597
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,690
Go ahead.

598
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,801
Beam is definitely not the one
distributing the drug.

599
00:42:44,757 --> 00:42:45,757
Prove it.

600
00:42:46,891 --> 00:42:49,239
Fine. How do you want me to prove it?

601
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,570
Sorry for the wait.

602
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,650
Sorry for bothering you too.

603
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:01,650
No problem at all.

604
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,690
Please, dig in. Don't be considerate.

605
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:08,050
Of course, I'm considerate.
Especially in this situation.

606
00:43:08,050 --> 00:43:09,090
It's totally fine.

607
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:12,730
I like steak,
so I store a lot in the freezer.

608
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,591
Same here.
I like eating spicy raw beef salad.

609
00:43:15,257 --> 00:43:16,497
Oh, I see.

610
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:20,019
How is that the same?

611
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:25,650
Spicy raw beef salad is a Thai dish,
steak is a Western dish.

612
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:27,413
They're both meat.

613
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,209
Here's some water, Prach.

614
00:43:34,490 --> 00:43:37,189
Where's Yayee?

615
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:39,130
There she is.

616
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:43,580
Yayee, come eat your food.

617
00:43:44,290 --> 00:43:46,790
Dr. Beam's room has a swimming pool

618
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,591
and many other rooms.

619
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:50,490
Yes.

620
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:51,370
Yayee!

621
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:52,510
Careful not to slip.

622
00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:57,370
Yayee, you can't just go
into his room like that. Yayee!

623
00:43:57,370 --> 00:43:58,370
It's okay.

624
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,531
No way, Yayee.

625
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:05,212
Come on, let's eat first, Yayee.

626
00:44:05,212 --> 00:44:06,672
Come here quickly.

627
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,499
Yayee.

628
00:44:10,285 --> 00:44:12,706
I'm sorry. Kids will be kids.

629
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,250
It's okay.

630
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:19,570
Yayee, don't be naughty.

631
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,675
You might break his things.

632
00:44:23,032 --> 00:44:26,610
Come on. I think we should go eat, Yayee.

633
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:27,610
Let's go.

634
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:37,847
Let's go, Yayee.
Dr. Beam made steak for us.

635
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:41,038
Good girl.

636
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:44,050
Oh, I almost forgot.

637
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:47,690
I haven't washed my hands yet.
I'll go wash them first.

638
00:44:48,205 --> 00:44:50,970
Sure, go ahead.
The bathroom is downstairs.

639
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:51,970
Thank you.

640
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:51,060
Prach is taking quite a while
in the bathroom.

641
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,288
Is he okay?

642
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:06,040
Prach always takes a long time
in the bathroom.

643
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:07,927
He likes to be clean.

644
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:09,670
I see.

645
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:28,149
But I think it's been a bit too long.

646
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:35,090
More water?

647
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:36,175
Oh, thank you.

648
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:49,210
Isn't Prach going to eat?

649
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:51,290
The food is getting cold.

650
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:53,469
Prach likes to eat his food cold.

651
00:46:54,050 --> 00:46:55,930
Do you want to eat Prach's?

652
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:00,585
Run, I haven't finished mine yet.

653
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:05,810
Eat up so you'll grow big and strong. Alright?

654
00:47:05,810 --> 00:47:07,414
I'll go check on Prach.

655
00:47:47,892 --> 00:47:48,892
Prach?

656
00:47:54,834 --> 00:47:55,834
Prach?

657
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,136
Oh, are you okay?

658
00:48:05,878 --> 00:48:08,170
I have a bit of a diarrhea.

659
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:10,690
And those apples look delicious.

660
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:11,831
Can I have one?

661
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:15,050
Sure, go ahead.

662
00:48:15,050 --> 00:48:16,050
Thank you.

663
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:27,970
Dr. Beam, which hospital do you work at?

664
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,120
Oh, I've stopped practicing.

665
00:48:30,970 --> 00:48:34,724
If you don't work, how do you buy food?

666
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:39,196
Mommy says you have to work
to have food to eat.

667
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:44,850
I don't know if you can call it work,

668
00:48:44,850 --> 00:48:45,874
but I invest in stocks.

669
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:49,905
She doesn't understand it yet.

670
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:53,197
Why did you stop practicing medicine?

671
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,485
It's nothing, really.

672
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:01,450
At first, I opened a clinic
for general practice.

673
00:49:01,450 --> 00:49:03,490
And then, after I saved up some money,

674
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:07,661
a doctor friend invited me
to invest in a beauty clinic.

675
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:12,770
So I invested,
and the business has been doing very well.

676
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:14,585
Now I have a steady income every month.

677
00:49:16,459 --> 00:49:17,530
Passive income.

678
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:24,113
Does your clinic sell any vitamins
or supplements?

679
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:27,450
As I said, I closed my clinic.

680
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,338
I meant the clinic you invested in.

681
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:32,810
Oh, I don't know about that.

682
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:34,685
I'm not involved in the management.

683
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:40,428
Dr. Beam, I have something to confess.

684
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:42,798
What is it, Yayee?

685
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:47,829
I was playing darts
and hit your picture directly.

686
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:54,130
You have a picture of me in your room?

687
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:56,656
Well... Do you have any dessert?

688
00:49:57,202 --> 00:50:00,005
Oh, I'll go check.

689
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:01,666
Thank you.

690
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,974
Aim, the infected saw us.

691
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:20,650
Director,

692
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:25,690
we can't control the video
that was leaked from The Breathe Condo.

693
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:27,780
We tried to take it down,

694
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,010
but someone kept reuploading it.

695
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:32,689
The IP address that uploaded it
belongs to Jee,

696
00:50:32,689 --> 00:50:34,374
a boy who lives at The Breathe Condo.

697
00:50:45,090 --> 00:50:47,926
Then increase the control measures
to the next level.

698
00:51:16,014 --> 00:51:18,170
What? This is it?

699
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:20,471
It's all I have. Just take it.

700
00:51:22,090 --> 00:51:23,210
Here.

701
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:23,980
Don't let this happen again.

702
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,250
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Alright.

703
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:28,417
Don't run. Come here. What are you doing?
What are you exchanging?

704
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,066
- Let go of me!
- Stop!

705
00:51:31,066 --> 00:51:32,066
I said let go!

706
00:51:33,348 --> 00:51:34,348
I said let go!

707
00:51:35,146 --> 00:51:36,146
Prach!

708
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,130
Are you okay?

709
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:52,110
It's just a scratch, thankfully.

710
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:55,730
Yeah, luckily I dodged it.

711
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:57,110
But it still hurts.

712
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:00,770
Okay, I'll be gentle.

713
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:03,170
Here.

714
00:52:04,471 --> 00:52:05,471
Let me do it.

715
00:52:21,944 --> 00:52:22,944
Does it hurt?

716
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:25,170
Sorry.

717
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:29,512
Anyway, thank you for helping me.

718
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:32,958
What were you doing, by the way?

719
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:36,704
I was taking out the trash,

720
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:40,836
and I happened to see those two people
exchanging something.

721
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:42,770
Two people?

722
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:44,738
That's right.

723
00:52:44,738 --> 00:52:46,610
They were acting suspiciously.

724
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:49,249
I tried to follow them,
but one of them stabbed me.

725
00:52:51,814 --> 00:52:56,197
Those two must be residents of the condo
because it's sealed off.

726
00:52:56,197 --> 00:52:57,834
Or someone let them in.

727
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:04,893
Do you know what this drug is?

728
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:12,082
This is the drug that turns people
into those rage monsters.

729
00:53:12,082 --> 00:53:13,550
It's spreading in our condo.

730
00:53:14,933 --> 00:53:18,296
Our condo is one of the
biggest distribution points.

731
00:53:19,325 --> 00:53:22,420
I knew it wasn't anything good,

732
00:53:23,193 --> 00:53:24,842
but I didn't think it was this serious.

733
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:27,375
How did you know about the drug, Beam?

734
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:30,978
I've been following this for a while now.

735
00:53:37,394 --> 00:53:39,594
Have you ever analyzed
the motive of the perpetrator?

736
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:43,784
I wonder why they are doing this.

737
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,173
If we think about it like a business,

738
00:53:49,170 --> 00:53:50,810
when I was running my clinic,

739
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:53,102
I wanted to have a steady income, right?

740
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:55,353
But in this case,

741
00:53:55,353 --> 00:53:58,853
this drug is making people get infected
really fast.

742
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:01,692
That means this drug is costing them customers.

743
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:03,810
What do you mean?

744
00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:07,690
If all the customers get infected
and become rage monsters,

745
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:09,342
who's going to come back
to buy this drug?

746
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:11,614
It doesn't make sense.

747
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:16,191
We don't know the motive yet,

748
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:20,227
but what we do know is that
the drug distributor is here.

749
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:22,242
The drug distributor?

750
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:27,065
Those people might just be small-time dealers.

751
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,506
Are you saying that
the person behind this...

752
00:54:33,612 --> 00:54:35,119
might not be in this condo?

753
00:54:36,530 --> 00:54:37,802
It's possible.

754
00:55:16,933 --> 00:55:18,290
Hello, Dad.

755
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:20,450
Oh, Run? How are you?

756
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:24,894
I saw a video of people going crazy
and acting violently.

757
00:55:24,894 --> 00:55:27,377
You have to be careful, Run.

758
00:55:27,377 --> 00:55:30,139
Don't worry.
No one would dare do anything to me.

759
00:55:30,139 --> 00:55:31,415
Don't be stubborn, kiddo.

760
00:55:32,016 --> 00:55:33,150
Listen to me.

761
00:55:35,810 --> 00:55:39,170
I'm trying to be a good daughter
and report to you.

762
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:42,130
You're so sweet. Okay.

763
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:43,885
Okay, okay.

764
00:55:43,885 --> 00:55:45,232
Now go find

765
00:55:45,232 --> 00:55:46,232
something to eat.

766
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,170
Dad?

767
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:52,017
Why did the call drop?

768
00:56:48,117 --> 00:56:49,529
It means there's an infected person

769
00:56:50,571 --> 00:56:51,611
among the residents.

770
00:56:52,864 --> 00:56:54,005
Where have you been?

771
00:56:58,457 --> 00:57:00,081
- You let Jeu out, didn't you?
- Hey!

772
00:57:00,081 --> 00:57:01,519
Don't talk nonsense.

773
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:03,559
The people who went out
to fight the infected

774
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:05,430
are the most likely to be infected.

775
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:08,557
And the ones who fought them the most
are you and your wife.

776
00:57:08,557 --> 00:57:09,558
Don't shift the blame.

777
00:57:09,558 --> 00:57:10,640
Maybe you're infected but don't know it.

778
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,401
You encountered the infected outside.
Then you came back and told everyone.

779
00:57:13,401 --> 00:57:14,488
You must be infected.

780
00:57:14,488 --> 00:57:16,445
Let's finish this investigation.
