Hi, how are you doing?

25
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:53,660
It’s been a long time.

26
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:54,860
Hi there.

27
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,380
In a few months,

28
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,260
you’ve become more gorgeous.

29
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,300
Qiyi,

30
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,580
this year I started a new club,

31
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,860
the Diet and Health Club.

32
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,020
So,

33
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,700
are you interested
in the welcoming dinner?

34
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:09,980
You changed its name?

35
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,260
It’s a good thing people move on.

36
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,925
So, are you interested?

37
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,220
No.

38
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,340
Qiyi,

39
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,700
what’s more important

40
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,500
than society activity?

41
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,700
Stop!

42
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,260
Are you

43
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,020
one of the legendary

44
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,220
SUA celebrities,

45
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:43,940
the chief of Little Target Drama Club?

46
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,860
It’s a pleasure.

47
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,500
So,

48
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,060
you also know Qiyi?

49
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,660
Is there anything else?

50
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,780
I just want to ask you

51
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,620
and her out for dinner.

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,180
Lu Qiyi can only share a meal with me.

53
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,500
Bye.

The peach blossom charm.

55
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,020
It’s working.

56
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,580
The Society of Changes and Life

57
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,140
cannot disband.

58
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,260
How did you get to know

59
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,620
so many weirdos?

60
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,300
Don’t be so mean.

61
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,140
He gave us the key to the basement

62
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,340
which becomes Little Target Drama Club.

63
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,300
Well...

64
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,620
That’s not an excuse.

65
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,460
Then I’ll give the key back.

66
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,525
What are you doing?

67
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,500
What if I won’t let go

68
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,020
of the key and the girl?

69
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:54,940
Put me down now.

70
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:55,820
No.

71
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,340
There are so many people.

72
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,500
Fang Yan.

73
00:04:06,775 --> 00:04:07,425
Mm-hmm.

74
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,660
Do you think

75
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,140
I should go to the U.S.?

76
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,220
We discussed it

77
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,580
so many times, didn’t we?

78
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:20,540
But when I thought
that I’d be away for 2 years

79
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,740
when we couldn’t meet,

80
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,140
and maybe I would

81
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,180
stay there forever...

82
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,660
If that’s why you don’t want to go,

83
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,500
then I’ll have to break up with you.

84
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,925
Huh?

85
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,140
If it’s just because
we can’t see each other,

86
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,820
then I want to tell you.

87
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,260
Emails, WeChat, video chat,

88
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,140
as long as we want to see each other,

89
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,180
we can see each other anytime.

90
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:47,950
But,

91
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,660
if you miss this opportunity,

92
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,900
there won’t be any more.

93
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:56,700
But...

94
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,380
Qiyi,

95
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,020
I don’t want to be
a stumbling block for you.

96
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,075
Mm-hmm.

97
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,860
Well, nothing is for sure now.

98
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,500
Maybe I won’t be selected.

99
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,380
You’ll be selected.

100
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,780
The bandages can be removed tomorrow.

101
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,340
The wounds are basically healed.

102
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,260
But the scar...

103
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,660
As you know,

104
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,300
she might get keloid scar...

105
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,860
It’s hard for the scar to go away.

106
00:05:58,175 --> 00:05:58,940
So,

107
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:00,580
pay attention to her mental status

108
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,425
and talk to her.

109
00:06:01,475 --> 00:06:02,340
OK.

110
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,220

111
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,220

112
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,260

00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,100
be able to see you on TV?

172
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,340
Perhaps I will

173
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:14,300
have to see you in an American TV show?

174
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,540
Grandpa,

175
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,180
you can see me

176
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,580
whenever you wish.

177
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,180
That’s great.

178
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,220
I hope you come back often to see me.

179
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,100
I will, Grandpa.

180
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,860
In the darkness of the night,

181
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:46,740
we write for the dawn in the lamp light.

182
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,020
In the cold wind,

183
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,260
we wake up the sun by our warmth.

184
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,780
Time flies.

185
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,140
Let’s build a garden of knowledge.

186
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,940
The hours are fleeting.

187
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,980
Let’s make our paradise of dreams.

188
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,140
Why did you choose such a remote place?

189
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,820
After you.

190
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,620
Their terms are demanding,

191
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,660
however,

192
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,740
this is the best chance I can get.

193
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:30,875
What’s more,

194
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:32,675
(SJ Company Artist-Agency Agreement)
it’s the only program this year.

195
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:33,975
(SJ Company Artist-Agency Agreement)

196
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,460
They accepted the terms

197
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,020
I proposed?

198
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,260
You leave this year.

199
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,620
The agency is in L.A..

200
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,780
All as you requested.

201
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,180
Except, however, for the duration.

202
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,420
Five years minimum.

203
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,500
Five years?

204
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,380
Yeah.

205
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,260
Look,

206
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,940
this agreement

207
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,180
is different from that between SUA

208
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,300
and Modern Acting Company.

209
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,540
Theirs is for further education.

210
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,380
They come back home upon completion.

211
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,420
The purpose of this program is to train

212
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,820
new stars in Asia
for the American agency.

213
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,380
You study in the U.S.

214
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,700
and will debut in the U.S. too.

215
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,420
It’s a long-term program.

216
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,740
Most people sign for 10 years.

217
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,660
So, think about it.

218
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:23,540
In recent years,

219
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,580
domestic cultural
and entertainment industry is promising.

220
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,620
You can do well at home.

221
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,660
There’s no need to go to the U.S.

222
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,420
Besides,

223
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,180
as a performing arts student,

224
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,100
you should stick to this path.

225
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,180
Pop stars

226
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,940
don’t really suit you.

227
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,820
Don’t worry about that.

228
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,620
OK.

229
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,100
Hey,

230
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,140
check it out here.

231
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,380
Once you sign it,

232
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,860
there’s no going back.

233
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,180
Think before you sign it.

234
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,640
By the way,

235
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,220
you’re really not going
to tell your father?

236
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,020
It’s my own business.

237
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,340
I can make my own decisions.

238
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,200
Honey,

239
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,860
why don’t we go out for kebabs?

240
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,340
This place sucks.

241
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,220
I just want to eat steaks.

242
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,460
OK, OK.

243
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,800
Let’s eat steaks.

244
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:40,750
(Nancheng City Development Bank: Mr. Du Ang,
your tuition is overdue. Please pay in time.)

245
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,260
Waiter!

246
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:48,500
Waiter!

247
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:51,875
Sir,

248
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,300
what can I help you?

249
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,380
I can see blood

250
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,980
in the steak.

251
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,700
It’s undercooked.
And it’s such a large piece.

252
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,620
How am I gonna eat it?

253
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,325
Sir,

254
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,420
it’s not undercooked.

255
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,420
You ordered it medium-well.

256
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,620
Cut the nonsense out.

257
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,220
Look,

258
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,940
I can’t even cut it up.

259
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,340
You tell me if it’s cooked.

260
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,660
How can I eat this?

261
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,020
Sir,

262
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,140
you’re using the knife and fork wrong.

263
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:14,950
Let me show you.

264
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,780
Back off!

265
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,380
Don’t preach to me.

266
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,700
You’re just a waiter.

267
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,140
Help yourself then.

268
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,950
Manager! Stop!

269
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:38,825
- Hello!
- Manager.

270
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:39,780
Sir, I’m the manager.

271
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,700
Is everything alright?

272
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,340
Your steak is undercooked.

273
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:42,900
And listen,

274
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,900
the waiter here

275
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,620
slapped my cutlery on the table.

276
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:45,860
I’m so sorry.

277
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,540
Get this gentleman a fully cooked steak.

278
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,500
I want it well-done.

279
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,050
More cumin, less pepper.

280
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,660
Sure.

281
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,250
Go on.

282
00:13:52,425 --> 00:13:53,075
Hey,

283
00:13:53,425 --> 00:13:54,075
not so fast.

284
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:57,620
You slapped the cutlery at the table.

285
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,325
That’s not over.

286
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,350
Apologize to me.

287
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,180
Yeah, apologize.

288
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,075
Manager,

289
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,450
it’s not my fault.

290
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,620
If he doesn’t know
how to use knife and fork,

291
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,800
he shouldn’t have come here.

292
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,220
Steak with more cumin and less pepper?

293
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,300
He thinks we sell kebabs.

294
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,420
What’s this attitude?

295
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,425
I’m telling you.

296
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,260
This is how I’ve ordered my steaks

297
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,460
since I was a boy.

298
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,380
Is there a problem?

299
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,100
You saw that guy just now.

300
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,420
It wasn’t my fault.

301
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,100
He’s obviously here to pick a fight.

302
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,940
He wants his steak...

303
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,400
My fault. My fault.

304
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,780
We’re a small shop.

305
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,620
There’s no room for you.

306
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,500
Ma’am,

307
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,820
I know I’m wrong.

308
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,860
Please give me one more chance.

309
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,580
I promise I won’t argue
with customers again.

310
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,100
The customer is God.

311
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,180
If you keep offending customers,

312
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,660
we’ll go bankrupt.

313
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,580
I know, I know.

314
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,420
I know I’m wrong.

315
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,340
I won’t do it again.

316
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,820
Ma’am.

317
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,940
Stop, sir.

318
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,020
Can you leave, please?

319
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,340
Hey, ma’am.

320
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,620
What’s wrong now?

321
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,660
My salary?

322
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,660
Salary?

323
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:58,300
Yes.

324
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,500
How many customers have you offended?

325
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,060
Count yourself lucky I don’t
ask for compensation.

326
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,100
And you’re asking for a salary?

327
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,260
Get out of here ASAP!

328
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,660
You’re all sick!

329
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,700
I don’t want to work

330
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,420
in this cheap diner anyway.

331
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,060
The man will find a better place.

332
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:16,940
Bye.

333
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:18,940
Hello?

334
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,580
What kind of agent are you?

335
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,580
It’s been quite a while.

336
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,620
Where are the good jobs

337
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,500
you promised to recommend?

338
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,340
Listen,

339
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,940
refund my 1,000 commission.

340

680
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,740
I’ll support you.

681
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:57,800
I’ve been praying for 500 years.

682
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,100
Have you ever been in love?

683
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:01,820
Sir,

684
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,540
dating is not allowed in my high school.

685
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:04,925
Oh.

686
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,980
No wonder you couldn’t find the feeling.

687
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,740
Qiyi,

688
00:39:08,075 --> 00:39:08,900
what are you playing?

689
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,580
A big tree.

690
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,075
To me, it’s like a sapling.

691
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,820
Have you forgotten how to speak?

692
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,740
Are you stupid?

693
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:20,940
Then go back.

694
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,200
You’re not cut out for acting.

695
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,180
Dad!

696
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,020
After we were imprisoned here,

697
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,820
everything became different.

698
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,300
Everyone wore a mask.

699
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,500
OK.

700
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,420
Cut!

701
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,180
Nicely done, Qiyi.

703

Are you sure?

704
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,020
If you miss this chance,

705
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,400
there won’t be more in the future.

706
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,060
Yes, I’m sure.

707
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,740
Good luck.

708

Thank you, sir.

709
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,580
