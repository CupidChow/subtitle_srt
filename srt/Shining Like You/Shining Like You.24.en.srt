I didn’t get a chance to tell you later.

00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,700
Kaixin!

344
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,100
I knew it.

345
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,820
You missed me.

346
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,460
Mine.

347
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,300
They flew away.

348
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,420
I bought these snacks for you.

349
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,689
This is from Fang Yan.

350
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,281
This is from Zimo.

351
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,700
And this is from Du Ang.

352
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,860
They left in advance.

353
00:21:35,142 --> 00:21:35,900
We also have gifts for you.

354
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,380
This is mine.

355
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,860
Thank you all.

356
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,300
It’s been a long time.

357
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,200
Mm-hmm.

358
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,940
Are you available tonight?

359
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,460
(Du Ang: Come to the garden. Urgent.)
I have class tonight.

360
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,337
(Du Ang: Come to the garden. Urgent.)

361
00:22:03,225 --> 00:22:03,850
Uh.

362
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,500
I’ll call you after class.

363
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,700
Kaixin,

364
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,460
I have to go.

365
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,660
Take good care of yourself.

366
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,740
I’ll come to see you some other time.

367
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,340
Bye.

368
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,074
Bye.

369
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,220
Bye.

370
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,420
Fang Yan?

371
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,660
What are you doing here?

372
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,180
Du Ang asked me to come.

373
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,640
Stay low. I can’t see it.

374
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,300
Keep quiet.

375
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,380
Du Ang

376
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,380
is always monkeying around.

377
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,420
Fang Yan!

378
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,740
Are you going to avoid me all the time?

379
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,700
Fang Yan,

380
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,060
I’m sorry.

381
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,820
I didn’t tell you in time

382
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,300
that I’m not going to the U.S.

383
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,060
Fang Yan,

384
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,540
let’s make up.

385
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,860
OK?

386
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,860
It’s only five years.

387
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,020
No big deal. I can wait for you.

388
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,300
To be with you,

389
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,460
I tried everything to go to the U.S.

390
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,940
But you quit just like that.

391
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:33,580
So what’s the point

392
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,700
of such commitment?

393
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,980
Step one.

394
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,180
The Open Mouth Movement.

395
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,300
Go.

396
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,580
One, two, three, four.

397
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:32,580
Five, six, seven, eight.

398
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,460
Two, two, three, four.

399
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,260
Five, six, seven, eight.

400
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,060
Three, two, three, four.

401
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,500
Class begins.

402
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,066
Today

403
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,540
we’re going to talk about
the body movement method.

404
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,260
Body movement method

405
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,780
helps an actor

406
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,340
present a role’s emotion and feelings

407
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,380
through body movements.

408
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,460
Qiyi,

409
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,700

Mm-hmm.

424
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:57,020
Actually, I can sleep by myself.

425
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,860
It’s a big dorm.

426
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:02,260
You’d be afraid

427
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,860
to sleep alone.

428
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,100
By the way,

429
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,100
do you know the men’s dormitory was...?

430
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:11,660
Stop.

431
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,073
Let’s sleep.

432
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:16,740
Scared?

433
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:17,620
Sanshang,

434
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,700
you scared?

435
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,100
Are you scared?

436
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,383
Alright,

437
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,140
when will Kaixin

438
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:26,380
be discharged from the hospital?

439
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,820
Maybe next week.

440
00:26:30,178 --> 00:26:30,815
Oh.

441
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,660
Zhang Yang left.

442
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,300
Fang Yan is about to.

443
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,820
The last man whom I can talk to

444
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,820
is you.

445
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,860
It’s so depressing to think about it.

446
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,820
Don’t we still have Uzhda and Xiuwen?

447
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,980
One is too sensitive,

448
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:56,660
and the other one is too rough.

449
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,780
You’re the best.

450
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:02,442
Come here.

451
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:03,728
Come here.

452
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:05,858
I’m cold.

453
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:07,460
I’m hot.

454
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,060
I’m cold.

455
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:08,820
I’m hot.

456
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:09,260
I’m cold.

457
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:09,860
I’m hot.

458
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:12,678
Gross.

459
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:14,950
By the way,

460
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,780
Fang Yan hasn’t come to class
for a week.

461
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,620
Do you know when he’s leaving?

462
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:21,114
No.

463
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,900
But before he leaves,

464
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,900
I think he’d spend more time
with his family.

465
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,340
Poor Qiyi.

466
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,620
Alright,

467
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:31,700
what are you whining about?

468
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:32,900
You should be gloating.

469
00:27:33,346 --> 00:27:34,060
Shut up.

470
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,300
I don’t know why.

471
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,020
But I’m not happy at all.

472
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,380
Instead, I feel upset.

473
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,970
Let me tell you a secret.

474
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,820
Don’t tell anyone else.

475
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,380
What secret?

476
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,431
Lately,

477
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:01,025
I’ve been thinking
about this other girl.

478
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,340
She’s kind of blurry.

479
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,740
Do you think that’s strange?

480
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,100
Who is it?

481
00:28:07,912 --> 00:28:09,271
I can’t tell you that.

482
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,900
You like her, huh?

483
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,660
Cut it out.

484
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,380
I’m loyal in love.

485
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,609
The unpredictable women

486
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,980
are the type I dislike most.

487
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,460
Did you hear something strange?

488
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,260
What? Are you trying to scare me?

489
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,460
Do you think I’m as cowardly as you are?

490
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,325
Don’t come over!

491
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,540
Ghost!

492
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,420
You wimps.

493
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,325
Don’t come over.

494
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:13,780
Get up.

495
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,740
I brought beer and braised food.

496
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,620
There’s your favorite pig face.

497
00:29:18,438 --> 00:29:19,675
You should have told us
you were coming back.

498
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,020
I’m coming.

499
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,180
Let’s eat.

500
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,540
You’re leaving tomorrow afternoon?

501
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,260
That’s too soon.

502
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,340
Are you still my buddy?

503
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,005
Couldn’t you tell us earlier?

504
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,140
Does Qiyi know?

505
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:44,469
I’m going to tell her now.

506
00:29:44,469 --> 00:29:45,033
Hey!

507
00:29:46,355 --> 00:29:47,100
Don’t tell her.

508
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,020
I don’t want her to know.

509
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,873
You’re still mad at her?

510
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,628
We’re not meant to be together.

511
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,900
Why bother?

512
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,460
Fang Yan,

513
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,100
I can’t agree with you.

514
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,007
What do you mean not meant to be?

515
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,540
You’re going abroad

516
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,100
for five years, right?

517
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,180
It’s not like you’re not coming back.

518
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,420
You can cancel the contract.

519
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,075
It’s not that simple.

520
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,140
After I leave,

521
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,575
the three of us can hardly meet again.

522
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,900
Enough. Talk about something else.

523
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,425
What should we talk about?

524
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,260
There’s nothing to say.

525
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,060
I... I don’t want to say anything.

526
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,140
I’m pissed off.

527
00:30:46,535 --> 00:30:47,368
- Drink.
- What?

528
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,060
Let’s drink.

529
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,340
Alright, alright, alright.

530
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,306
This is me, a kind-hearted man.

531
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,367
I’ll say goodbye to you, bro.

532
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:57,077
Hey!

533
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,632
Stop it.

534
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,380
It’s not like I’m not coming back.

535
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,060
What are you talking about?

536
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,028
Who cares if you come back or not?

537
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,740
Let’s drink.

538
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:11,832
One more.

539
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:13,791
Bottoms up.

540
00:31:24,431 --> 00:31:25,380
I still remember

541
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,088
my first day at SUA.

542
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,260
Sanshang

543
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,660
put on my underwear by mistake.

544
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,540
Do you know what I was thinking?

545
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,879
I was thinking,

546
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,100
how could anyone be so silly?

547
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:43,820
And I’d never

548
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,380
be friends with men like him.

549
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,580
And you.

550
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:57,020
You drove a sports car on the first day.

551
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,180
What a showboat!

552
00:31:59,180 --> 00:31:59,890
Swag.

553
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,980
Don’t you think it’s stupid?

554
00:32:13,125 --> 00:32:13,740
Dude,

555
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,334
do you know how we commented you

556
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,020
in the first days?

557
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,109
Sanshang.

558
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,607
Hypocrite.

559
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,620
Well,

560
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:29,980
what about now?

561
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,020
Sanshang.

562
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,860
Even worse.

563
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,202
Come on.

564
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,634
I remember we started
the Little Target Drama Club,

565
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,780
played basketball at SFSU together,

566
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,700
and worked in the bar
to gather experience.

567
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,420
Alright, enough. Stop it.

568
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:17,555
I hate to get emotional.

569
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,180
Fang Yan started it.

570
00:33:20,775 --> 00:33:21,820
My fault.

571
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:22,740
Let’s drink.

572
00:33:22,975 --> 00:33:23,500
Come on.

573
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,225
Fang,

574
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,252
you hid it well

575
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,620
that your father is a celebrity.

576
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,215
There’s nothing to brag about.

577
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,815
In the last two years,

578
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,220
so many things have happened.

579
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,380
Fang Yan turns out to be Su Wen’s son.

580
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,660
I become a fatherless...

581
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,260
a fatherless child.

582
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,580
Really, I’m not sad.

583
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,980
I’m just so grateful to you both.

584
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,740
I’m really grateful.

585
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,300
Alright, let’s drop it.

586
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,780
Without your help,

I’ve never blamed her for it.

So I dare not ask her to wait for me.

To be honest,

635
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,580
I fell in love with her
the first time we met

636

during the admission exam.

637

I really don’t...

639
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:43,860
don’t know how

640
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,780
to express my feelings for a girl.

641
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,060
So she was annoyed every time.

642
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,500
Whenever I saw someone bullying her,

643
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,150
I wanted to help.

644
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,125
Whenever I saw her

645
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,500
trying so hard

646
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,700
to be accepted,

647
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,460
it broke my heart.

648
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,060
I really wanted to do something for her.

649
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,060
Whenever she was in danger,

650
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,100
I wanted to rush over and help her.

651
00:38:22,575 --> 00:38:27,260
When I found out
she had a man she liked,

652
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,420
I was jealous and upset.

You know what?

654
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,380
I really...

655
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,340
I really want her to know

656
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,860
how I feel right now.

657
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,820
But I just can’t say it.

658
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,100
Then you should give it to me.

659
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,260
Give it back.

660
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:14,700
No.
