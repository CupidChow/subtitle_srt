1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:03,370
What are you doing here?

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,470
As a customer, I expect
some proper service.

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,210
Oh, really?

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,390
Service hours are over.

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,580
Get out.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,550
Ugh, come on.

7
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,540
You gonna keep this up?

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,300
Show up whenever you feel like it,
leave whenever you want, without a word?

9
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,480
Is that all we are?

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,630
What...

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,560
What even are we?

12
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,310
Just...

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:39,860
We’re just...

14
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:41,230
Look.

15
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,400
We’re nothing.

16
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,470
So don’t come here.

17
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,210
It bugs me.

18
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,100
Me too.

19
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,860
It bugs me too.

20
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,970
So I come here.

21
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,470
Next time I’ll order twenty drinks.

22
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,980
Just so you know.
