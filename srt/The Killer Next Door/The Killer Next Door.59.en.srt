00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,700
Who are you?

2
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:27,910
Can I stay here for a while?

3
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:32,980
Sure.

4
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,870
I’m gonna head in.

5
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:49,139
This is your first start in years,

6
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,540
you gonna drag your feet like this?

7
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:51,900
I’ve been waiting for you.

8
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,430
I had a feeling you’d show up,

9
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,420
but on a day like today,
you should’ve left earlier.

10
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,090
It’s not just today.

11
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,450
I’ve been waiting for you every day.

12
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:13,890
Thank you.

13
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,670
Thanks for waiting.

14
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,700
But you know what?

15
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:24,070
Looks like there’s
another killer besides me,

16
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,510
same MO, only killing bad
guys, exactly like me...

17
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:33,440
Yoon-je.

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,940
There’s so much to do...

19
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,050
’cause there are way too
many bad people in the world.
