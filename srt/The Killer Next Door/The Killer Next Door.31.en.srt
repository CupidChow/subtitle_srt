1
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:10,950
Why's he working out so hard?

2
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,790
Gonna start playing baseball again?

3
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,200
For sure,

4
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,580
he's more cheerful than
when we first met, right?

5
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,460
What's the reason?

6
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,330
Oh, that's…

7
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,620
What?

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,280
Because of me?

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:38,310
My very existence gives Mr. Han strength.

10
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,339
Kinda like how meeting you, Jin-young,

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,590
made me feel reborn.

12
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:45,710
Though you're a bit old
for a “rebirth,” huh?

13
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,380
What's up? Didn't sleep well last night?

14
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:58,880
No, it's just… Mr. Han snores like crazy.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,420
Like a tank.

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:01,590
No way.

17
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,450
When he sleeps with me, he never snores.

18
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,640
Really?
