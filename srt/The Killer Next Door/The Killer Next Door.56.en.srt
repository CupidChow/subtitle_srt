1
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:07,850
Go on ahead.

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,299
It's fine, nothing's gonna happen to us.

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,620
He's a cop.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,416
-=Police=-.
Someone's gotta take responsibility.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,639
Secure the scene, keep people back.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,940
-Got it -Chief, over there.

7
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,100
Head straight to the scene.

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,210
What about the bad guys?

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,740
Are they handling them?

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,840
We'll be fine.

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,330
He knows you're the killer.

12
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,960
Aren't you curious

13
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:31,100
how I got

14
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,316
the surveillance footage, the suspect info?

15
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,540
Crazy things happen to us too,

16
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,250
like magic.

17
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,890
So don't worry.

18
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:01,870
