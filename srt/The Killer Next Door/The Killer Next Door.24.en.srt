1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,660
How'd you get this wound?

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:03,850
Did someone hit you?

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,610
'Cause

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,150
I saw your parents went traveling.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,300
So frustrating.

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,120
I thought you didn't remember,
so I was using honorifics with you.

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,210
I told you,

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,826
if you're not cool with
it, use casual speech too.

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:28,850
I was just about to.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:31,980
When did you figure it out?

11
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,570
Didn't at first.

12
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,640
Then I saw the signature and it clicked.

13
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,080
Back in high school, you were the
first one who asked me for an autograph.

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,600
I remember asking you back then too,

15
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,530
why you lived here,

16
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,860
why you fought those thugs every day,

17
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:51,320
why you were broke, why you quit baseball…

18
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:53,060
and why

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,300
you came looking for me.

20
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,360
How'd I answer before?

21
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:02,770
You joked my way out of it.

22
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,030
- That's your thing. You gonna do it again…
- My dad.

23
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,820
It's all ‘cause of my dad.

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,920
Back then,

25
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:17,539
up to now,

26
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,130
it's all the same.
