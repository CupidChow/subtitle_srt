1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,630
What happens if I can't answer?

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:04,019
You just said it,

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,500
drink this.

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,660
There is.

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,990
It's me.

6
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,840
What do I do?

7
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,340
Thanks for the kimbap.

8
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:47,340
Oh.

9
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,590
I just wanted some after a long time.

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,160
There's sincerity in it.

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,610
All this time, I had no idea

12
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,230
you liked Jin-young.

13
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,650
That's not it.

14
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,700
Didn't you say so during the truth game?

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,880
That you like Jin-young?

16
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,340
I never said that.

17
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,490
Then you lied.

18
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:33,660
You said there's someone you like.

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,060
I do.

20
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,060
Among the people there,
there's someone I like.
