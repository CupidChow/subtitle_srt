1
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:24,650
Among all the stars in this world,

2
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,529
I’ll be the light that’s just for you.

3
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,980
The love I’ve waited for so long,

4
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,190
like your clear gaze.

5
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:42,619
My heart for you will never change,

6
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:46,119
like the sun up in the sky.

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,919
You, wrapped in warmth,

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,049
I’ll always be your light.

9
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:58,239
You and me. Love you tonight.

10
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,089
This day with you,

11
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,319
I’ve waited so long, my heart’s racing.

12
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,399
I love you, my love.

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,060
I’ll always protect you.

14
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,330
For you.

15
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,550
We enjoyed your singing.

16
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,940
You’re still here?

17
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:33,450
Wanna take a photo together?

18
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,670
It’s my honor.

19
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,830
One, two, three.

20
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,050
Yeah, nice.

21
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:40,530
But c’mon,

22
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,020
you’re Jo Jung-suk, aren’t you?

23
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,379
I’m gonna kill you today.

24
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,788
Told you it’s not me. Said it’s not!

25
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:46,579
Clearly you are, from Sunny,

26
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,879
the one who married the ant.

27
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,586
Not Sunny, it’s Nadale! (from
the movie Architecture 101).

28
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,779
Not an ant, a spider! (Gummy).

29
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,409
-I’m right, you're Jo Jung-suk. -Stop it.

30
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:53,070
Cut it out.

31
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,239
-Told you I'm not Jo Jung-suk! -Stop, stop.

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,469
Your strength’s really weak.

33
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,649
Stop.

34
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,788
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

35
00:01:57,789 --> 00:01:59,239
-Did you really kiss... -This is insane.

36
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,719
Is that really how you kiss?

37
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,689
- You know anything about kissing? Do you?
- Wait, stop.

38
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,590
Stop, stop. Shut up.

39
00:02:03,591 --> 00:02:05,619
Is the mask too big, or
your shoulders too narrow?

40
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,549
Take off the mask. Take it off.

41
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,800
There’s a whole worldview here,

42
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,419
stuff you don’t know about.

43
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,550
What worldview?
