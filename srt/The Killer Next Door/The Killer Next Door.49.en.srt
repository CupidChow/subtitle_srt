1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Earlier,

2
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:13,930
you asked what we are.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,760
I’ve been thinking about
it, even when I’m here.

4
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,570
But turns out I knew all along.

5
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,630
What

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,700
we are?

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,410
We’re Nam Yoon-je and Han Jin-hyuk.

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,820
When you can’t see, you get curious.

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,350
You want to know what the other likes,

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,210
someone who hopes the other will
be honest about their feelings.

11
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,880
To Han Jin-hyuk, what kind
of person is Nam Yoon-je?

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,800
Answer me.

13
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:09,850
I really can’t help

14
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,760
crossing the line.

15
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,440
That’s my answer.
