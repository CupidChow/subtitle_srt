1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,959
Wait, wait. Jin-hyuk, relax.

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,960
Right now it's a bit...

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,270
This is the relaxed state.

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:07,569
Cut. This take works.

5
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,770
Alright, that's a wrap.

6
00:00:08,771 --> 00:00:16,771
-=Behind the Scenes=-

7
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:09,950
Cut.
Okay.

8
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:12,800
What's up? What's wrong?

9
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,980
What are you doing?
Let's do it again.

10
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,129
It was good.

11
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,190
Whoa!

12
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,536
Scene 10, Take 1.
- =Neighborhood Killer=-

13
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,560
Scene 1, Take 1.

14
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,069
-Sorry. -Sorry.

15
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,750
-Let's try again. -Was that okay just now?

16
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,290
Rolling.

17
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,540
Sorry.
No!

18
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,940
-No! -That was good earlier,

19
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,860
really good.

20
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,790
But why was your expression so happy?

21
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,910
Sorry.

22
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,390
Maybe we'll say it once we get here.

23
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:47,790
-When we're close. -Alright.

24
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,599
Let's do it again. Sorry.

25
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,739
Sorry, sorry.

26
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,260
Sorry. Let's try again.
Check the room.

27
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,730
Ah, come on.

28
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,370
Sorry.

29
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,110
You okay?

30
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,079
Sorry, you alright?

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,230
Ugh, come on.

32
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,820
-=Cha Hak-yeon, Kang Yi-han=-
Alright, this take works.

33
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,650
But it's only fair that my scenes are doubled, right?
- =Kim Hae-jun, Im Yu-bin=-

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,930
It passed!

35
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,039
That's a wrap.

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,050
Cut. Okay.

37
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,710
Ah, come on.

38
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,959
-That's a wrap. -Done.

39
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,989
You laughed.

40
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,179
It was prepared by Senior Yoon-je.

41
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,260
I said it wasn't necessary.

42
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,160
Let's start over.

43
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,430
Sorry.

44
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,890
Why do you get to decide?

45
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:39,400
- Sorry.
- Why are you making calls like that?

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,620
The actress playing the
supporting role did great.

47
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,150
Sorry.

48
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,150
I'm gonna be crazy!

49
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:54,090
I swear I'll kill you.

50
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,950
Alright, that's a wrap.

51
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,499
After thinking it was impossible there.

52
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,220
That bastard.

53
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:04,450
Throw in some swear words.

54
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,349
Ugh, come on!

55
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:10,529
-Sorry. -That was good just now.

56
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,189
- Up to here, anyway, up to here.
- That was good.

57
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,969
What are you laughing at? Come on!

58
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,210
Stop there.

59
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,260
Cut.

60
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,140
Sorry.
So awkward.

61
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:24,370
Great work.

62
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,150
Good!

63
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,550
Good!
