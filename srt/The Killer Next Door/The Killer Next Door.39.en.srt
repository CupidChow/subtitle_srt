1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:02,610
Then who?

2
00:00:02,611 --> 00:00:04,200
Cafe owner Choi Joon?

3
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,070
And Mr. Sunshine.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:06,770
Mr. Sunshine.

5
00:00:06,771 --> 00:00:08,700
Then Dongdaemun Cool Guy.

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,240
Cool Guy.

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,120
Could all these be the same person?

8
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:20,450
Yoo Ho-jin.

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,180
You're really something.

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,720
Does that mean I'm unusual?

11
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,550
No, everyone has a side like this.

12
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,050
I get it now,

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,380
why Yoon-je likes you.

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,230
After the car accident,
he was in so much pain.

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:45,210
But

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,040
his expression changed.

17
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,560
Ever since he met you.

18
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,470
He's sincere.

19
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,540
What about you?

20
00:01:04,989 --> 00:01:06,160
What should I do?

21
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,750
Didn't Yoon-je tell you?

22
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,050
To be honest with your feelings.

23
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,150
What was it he liked again?

24
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,180
Blue roses.

25
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,080
He said those are your favorite flowers.
