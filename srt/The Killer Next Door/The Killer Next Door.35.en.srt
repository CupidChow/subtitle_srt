1
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,640
I used to love magic too.

2
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,590
What about now?

3
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,020
But…

4
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,770
It's all just tricks anyway.

5
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,470
Why do you still believe
in the romance of magic?

6
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,400
‘Cause life's too tough.

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,329
I hope something magical happens to me,

8
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,180
to the people around me,

9
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,150
even if it's just a trick.

10
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,379
A home run, scoring just by making it home…

11
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:54,040
That's the romance of baseball.

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,300
For Yoon-je, your baseball's

13
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,830
probably more than romance, it's magic.

14
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,530
I'm planning a surprise
for Jin-young tomorrow.

15
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,449
Help nudge things along, okay?

16
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,970
I already talked it over with Yoon-je.

17
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,520
Am I just your go-to guy
for nudging people now?

18
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,630
What?

19
00:01:14,631 --> 00:01:15,850
Has someone else asked you?

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,370
I'll help, no questions.

21
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:20,970
But…

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,740
Why don't you go home?

23
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:24,710
What?

24
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,549
No, I mean, you're done
with your part-time shift.

25
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,709
Why do you wait an hour every day

26
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:29,620
to walk back with Yoon-je?

27
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:30,420
Oh, that…

28
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,990
'Cause I'm scared.

29
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
Hey, Yoon-je!

30
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,520
This is coffee, right?

31
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,490
These are peanuts.

32
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,520
Ah. They're here.
