1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:04,570
So he likes honest people, huh?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,580
Anything else?

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,430
He said he likes people who can say

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,940
when they're tired, when they miss someone.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,550
I think the senior likes me.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,640
You feel it too, right?

7
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,870
He was talking about me.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,640
Today,

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,525
I'm gonna figure out Senior
Yoon Je's true feelings.

10
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,549
How?

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,510
A truth game.

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,100
You gotta help set the mood, okay?

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,710
But...

14
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,560
What've you been up to this whole time?

15
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,930
You can't even cook.

16
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,490
Oh, this?

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,580
Just dinner.

18
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,710
Senior, you're back!

19
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:57,950
Yeah.

20
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:01,940
I'm super tired today.

21
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,489
Maybe that's why… I missed you a lot.

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,459
Really?

23
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:06,470
I missed you too.

24
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,630
Jin-young, didn't you miss me?

25
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,166
All I could think about
on the way back was you.

26
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,010
Damn it, was that not right?

27
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:18,870
What's this?

28
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,940
Kimbap.

29
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,499
Perfect, I'm starving.

30
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,780
It must be good.
Can I have some?

31
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,149
This is totally homemade kimbap.

32
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,150
Who made it?

33
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,270
Brother Jin-hyuk.

34
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:37,529
He insisted on making it

35
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,170
even though we could've just bought some.

36
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,300
It's amazing.

37
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,259
This is really good.

38
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,349
The saltiness is just right.

39
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,350
Tasty?

40
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,250
It's so good.

41
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,240
Stop eating, stop.

42
00:01:51,789 --> 00:01:52,789
I only had two pieces.

43
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:54,130
Yoon-je, you try some.

44
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,288
Can I have more?

45
00:01:55,289 --> 00:01:56,289
It's good.

46
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,970
Wow, the rice is cooked perfectly.

47
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:01,410
Good, right?

48
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:02,440
It's all mixed up.
