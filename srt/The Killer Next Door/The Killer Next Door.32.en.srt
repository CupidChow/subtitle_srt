1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,640
Listen to what I'm about to say.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,860
All this time, Senior
Yoon-je's favorite was me.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,220
But

4
00:00:09,221 --> 00:00:11,810
ever since you showed up,
his favorite switched to you.

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,430
You admit that?
Jin-young.

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,309
-Well… -Do you or don't you?

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,050
I keep talking about Senior Yoon-je,

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,130
but he only talks about you.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,060
What else could that mean?

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:32,840
I'm not really sure.

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,110
Senior Yoon-je,

12
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,390
he's ready to listen to you.

13
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,690
So?

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:42,670
Help me.

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,850
Help me get closer with him.

16
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,270
What?

17
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,479
Exactly what I said.

18
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,190
I want to get serious with him.

19
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,310
You push him a little,

20
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,520
since he's

21
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,070
your good friend, right?

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,560
You'll help me, right?

23
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,990
Are you sure?

24
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:10,900
What?

25
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,599
Yoon-je's

26
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,530
just a good friend to me?

27
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,550
I'll take that as a yes.

28
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,740
Report to me every night.

29
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,390
You really gonna take this part-time job?

30
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,399
Nice to have someone to chat with.

31
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,100
Didn't you tell me to pay rent?

32
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,650
Hey, hey!

33
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,700
Do you even know what time it is?

34
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,460
Jin-hyuk, Happy Birthday.

35
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,870
You okay?
