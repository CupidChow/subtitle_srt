00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:09,050
Senior.

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,630
I like tomato flavor,

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,100
but this is spicy cream pasta...

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,180
I'll enjoy it though.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:17,470
Thank you.

6
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,730
Where's Ho-jin?

7
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:27,610
What's today's dish?

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,440
Where'd you get this outfit?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,319
I think the doneness of the
noodles is really important.

10
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,010
Let me check

11
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,320
if it's just right.

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,560
It passed!

13
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,720
What does our Han think?

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,240
Mm, you're really enjoying it.

15
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,790
This counts as passing, right?

16
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,780
The roasting of the
coffee beans is crucial.

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,670
Let me taste.

18
00:01:08,789 --> 00:01:09,560
Senior.

19
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:10,730
I told you not to add syrup.

20
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,890
You forgot again.

21
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,120
Oh, right!

22
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:14,390
Sorry, sorry.

23
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,460
Oh, it's jujube tea.

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,490
That's my favorite.
