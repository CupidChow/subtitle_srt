1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,500
What do you like?

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,600
Food-wise.

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,140
I don't care much about food.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,370
I just eat to live.

5
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:19,490
There must be something you like.

6
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,350
What is it?

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:27,170
Kimbap.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,540
The kind I roll at home.

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:32,360
Store-bought's better, isn't it?

10
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:34,240
Then why'd you ask?

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,030
‘Cause I gotta report back.

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,140
So,

13
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,530
when you're in a relationship,

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,510
what type do you like?

15
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,750
It's been so long since I dated, I forget.

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,840
Have you even dated?

17
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,750
I have.

18
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,990
What about you, those rumors
with that actress were fake, right?

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,040
No. I'm popular.

20
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,360
Yeah, right, like that's possible.

21
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:10,990
I am popular.

22
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,039
Oh.

23
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,260
Here's one,

24
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:20,670
someone honest.

25
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,539
Someone who's there when you're happy,

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,480
and there when you're sad.

27
00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:30,600
Does that even exist?

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Why wouldn't it?

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,616
Just say you're sad when you're sad,

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,120
say you miss them when you miss them.

31
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:38,789
One little line is all it takes.

32
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,510
Guess that one little
line's harder than it sounds.

33
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:45,810
You haven't tried, right?

34
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,410
Dating.

35
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,659
I said I have.

36
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,039
Fine, fine.

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,830
I have!

38
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,320
What are you two doing?

39
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,490
Be quiet. Shh.

40
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
You've never dated, huh?
