00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,380
-=Han Jin-hyuk I don’t want to see you=-

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,490
-=Bastard It’s totally hopeless=-

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,380
Is Senior really okay?

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,130
No idea.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:16,780
It’s been like this for a month.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,310
Honestly, why’s he acting like this?

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,930
Once someone gets hooked on
something they just get weird, y’know?

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,450
Oh, right,

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,250
I saw Brother Jin-hyuk.

12
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,720
Working at a café.

13
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,830
He told me not to say anything.

14
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,690
Oppa, do you have a girlfriend?

15
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:51,740
Got plans after work today?

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,700
You’re not an actor, by any chance?

17
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,700
Or an idol?

18
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,420
Oh, you really look familiar.

19
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:01,910
Enjoy your meal.

20
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:05,629
Sir, one more iced Americano over here.

21
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,430
Sir, some more napkins, please.

22
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,710
Also, I’d like a glass of hot water...

23
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,680
What are you doing?
