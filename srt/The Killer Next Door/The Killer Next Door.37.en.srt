1
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:05,170
C'mon, I'm spinning it.

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,400
If you can't answer,

3
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,510
drink this.

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,710
Can't we just drink when we feel like it?

5
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,530
Question.

6
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,870
Among the people here,
is there someone you like?

7
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,110
Yeah, there is.

8
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,749
If you give me something like a ring
or necklace, any precious metal stuff,

9
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,750
you're dead.

10
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,490
Why is it so itchy here?

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
So itchy.

12
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,580
-I gotta drink this. -Go ahead.

13
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,290
You can hold your liquor anyway.

14
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,000
My turn to spin.

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,760
Same question.

16
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,530
Do you have someone you like?

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,936
You forgot to say “among the people here.”

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,940
Among the people here,
is there someone you like?

19
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,010
Yeah, among the people here.

20
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,540
Among the people here,
is there someone you like?
