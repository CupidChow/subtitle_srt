1
00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:07,200
I'm so heartbroken I can barely go on.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,920
True.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,660
I'm so jealous.

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:12,340
Are you talking about me?

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,820
Hey, be quiet.

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,120
Isn't that right?

7
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,440
Who eats old-fashioned cake these days?

8
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:19,770
Me.

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,860
I like tomato pasta, but
you made spicy cream pasta.

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:26,750
And jujube tea,

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,680
all of it's totally
tailored for Brother Jin-hyuk!

12
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,406
What are you saying?
It's just a coincidence.

13
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,689
A coincidence?

14
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,789
Didn't you say all this was in.

15
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,260
Mr. Han's magazine interview?

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:41,950
Try it.

17
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:43,190
Birthday present.

18
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,360
So jealous.

19
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:52,521
Let's have some drinks today.

20
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,750
C'mon, cheers, cheers.

21
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,300
Here, drink up.

22
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,480
Want two pieces?

23
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:01,960
Who eats old-fashioned cake these days?

24
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,270
I do.

25
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,650
Yoon-je.

26
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:08,140
Can I start over?

27
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,590
As long as I'm with you,

28
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,896
whether it's baseball or anything else.
- Eat quickly.

29
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,260
It feels like I can start over.

30
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,530
So…

31
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,960
I'm a little scared too.
