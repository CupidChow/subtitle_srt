00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,450
-=The Killer Next Door=-

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,480
Nice to meet you, Mr. Han.

3
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:05,730
I’m top graduate of the Police University

4
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:08,506
and the youngest team leader in the Major
Crimes Unit of the Wide-Area Investigation Team,

5
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,530
Yoo Ho-jin.

6
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,870
Time’s tight, so no business cards.

7
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,580
It really is Choi
Hyun-woo (Korean magician).

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,339
How did those cops...

9
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,050
Don’t worry.

10
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,360
Among the cops,

11
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,770
some want to catch them,

12
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,070
and of course,

13
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,840
some want to protect them,

14
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,440
I’ll handle the scene.

15
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:28,970
You need to go, Yoon-je.

16
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,430
What do you mean?

17
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,350
Yoon-je, where are you going?

18
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,770
The cops heading here
know Yoon-je's the killer,

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,360
they'll definitely try to grab him at the
scene. So we need to lay low for a while.

20
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,670
Come with me.

21
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,080
Then that's fine.

22
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:49,830
Don't worry.

23
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,190
I'll be back on time.

24
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,710
What am I supposed to
do if you leave like this?

25
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,470
Live well,

26
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,310
ace those tests.

27
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,670
Go, quickly.

28
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,080
Don't show up for a while.

29
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:18,539
Yoon-je!

30
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,510
Nam Yoonji!
