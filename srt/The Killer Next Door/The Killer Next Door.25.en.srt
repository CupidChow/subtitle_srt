1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,440
Because... your dad?

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,970
Ever since I was a kid, I did
everything my dad told me to.

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:11,970
At first, everything was fine,

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,750
I was good at baseball,

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,500
and my family was happy.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,730
Then at some point,

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,140
he got hooked on drinking and gambling.

8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:25,970
Thugs came looking for
money, at the field, at home.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:28,490
I could handle that.

10
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:30,860
But

11
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,280
my dad hitting my mom.

12
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,020
That I couldn't take.

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,120
Oh...

14
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,399
I didn't want to cause trouble
for the team or my teammates,

15
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,140
so I quit baseball.

16
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:51,690
And around then, I couldn't
throw a good pitch anymore.

17
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,150
Kinda perfect timing, huh?

18
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,920
You must be exhausted,

19
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:05,319
carrying all this alone.

20
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,279
I'm sorry, I had no idea it was this bad.

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,260
You said you miss your
dad every day, right?

22
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,230
But me? I pray every
day that my dad would die.

23
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,370
‘Cause as long as he's
alive, it's hell for me.

24
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:30,960
Can you do it for me?

25
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:38,840
Help me kill him, can you?
