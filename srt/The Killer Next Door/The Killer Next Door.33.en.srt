1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,690
Like this.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:08,460
-This part here. -It's fine.

3
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,600
I'll try again.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,030
You'll be late for work.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,020
No.

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,800
This is your first interview.

7
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,220
I have to help you tie your tie.

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,966
At this rate, you'll be
going to interviews too.

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:20,990
Go to work.
Damn it.

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,420
What's going on? You
still haven't left for work?

11
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,800
Where are you off to?

12
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,440
Interview at the company.

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,550
It's okay, I'll look
up how to tie it online.

14
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,410
It's fine.

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,660
Move, move.

16
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:44,730
Brother.

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,960
I'm counting on you.

18
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,770
Okay.

19
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,730
Where'd you learn all this anyway?

20
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,270
What're you talking
about? I'm Han Jin-hyuk.

21
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,590
I've been to plenty of award shows before.

22
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,420
Done.

23
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,515
You'll do great even without me saying it,

24
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:20,539
but still, go crush it.

25
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,150
You suit a suit way

26
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,580
more than

27
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,770
being a hitman or doing part-time gigs.

28
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,410
You know that, right?

29
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,009
Han Jin-hyuk looks best
in a baseball uniform.

30
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:48,970
I'm gonna be late.

31
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:50,340
Thanks for tying my tie.
