00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,250
The spring breeze blowing now

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:09,859
makes us can't help but hope,
those things we missed and longed

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:11,289
for all winter

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,440
will quietly find their way to us.

5
00:00:12,441 --> 00:00:18,400
-=Han Jin-hyuk=-

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,590
For some, that spring might be baseball.

7
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,750
For others, a lover.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,200
Do you remember?

9
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,279
That player’s entrance music, the one that

10
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,116
set everyone’s hearts
racing right from the start?

11
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,580
He’s finally back.

12
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:27,020
Today,

13
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,210
pitcher Han Jin-hyuk,
bringing romance to the field,

14
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:33,210
will face off in an exciting showdown
against the Tigers’ Yang Hyun-jong.

15
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,409
The number you have
dialed is not in service.

16
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,980
Please check the number and try again.

17
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,610
The number you have dialed...

18
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,210
I’ll pitch well.

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,310
Next news.

20
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,969
Serial killings targeting violent murderers

21
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,860
have resurfaced after a year of silence.

22
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,910
Police have linked the previous suspect...

23
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,730
Is that Ho-jin?
