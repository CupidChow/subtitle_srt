In fact

224
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,112
It was a little dizzy because I kept coming and talking

I think it must have been excited

230
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,375
Many men approach and stick to and whisper

231
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,460
Of course, there was a woman who didn't like it.

232
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,712

-It's a simple expression- [idol] criminal looks handsome…

There's a baby who has been obsessed with Matilda these days.

657
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:30,693
What the baby was like, Matilda Hakko, he just promoted it.

658

Suddenly it changed, so I just got ridiculous

00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,086
Oh, I live like this, really

732
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:18,754
I'm my friend, but really…

733
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:19,922
Oh, hello

734
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,342
[Mechanical sound]

735
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,939
Hey, there are two doors?

736
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,190
[Mechanical sound]

737
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,942
End room? The best room?

738
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,242
Hmm!

739
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,079
Is it?

740
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,459
Are you, Lee Jin -sung?

741
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:01,213
[Small] Give me

742
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,592
[hem]

743
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,308
Child, don't take a picture, turn the camera

744
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,770
- [Dalgak] -Ho, Mr.

745
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,021
Oh, it

746
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,939
[Sweet -Moon]

747
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,200
[Tak -Switch]

748
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,161
- [Tense Music] -Hae, Mr.…

749
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,750
- [Woodang -tang -Tong] -Ho, fuck

750
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,627
[Surprised breath of form]

751
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,254
-What are you doing, aren't you coming in? - [Type] Oh, it is in

752
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:43,839
-Ah, seed- [Dalgak -Tong]

753
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,634
[Format] Ha…

754
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,312
[Dalgak -Mungori]

755
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,236
[Idol] Ha…

756
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:16,789
[Small] Among the babies who live like this

757
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,249
There is a lot of pervert

758
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,379
Wow,

759
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:33,055
If you are excessive, you will be obsessed if you are excessive.

760
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,017
Give me the camera

761
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,147
Now, everyone

762
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,982
It is a picture of Matilda, no matter who sees it.

763
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,114
In this dark room

764
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,074
Lee Jin -sung is alone

765
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,368
What did you think while drawing Matilda?

766
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,371
하, 개새끼

767
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,001
[Dalgak]

768
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,210
Ha, everyone

769
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,087
Can you see it?

770
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,259
Obsession, obsession

771
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,858
[Type] Brother, you think you should see this?

772
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:26,984
what?

773
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,821
Oryun -gu, Lolly Park

774
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,656
What, Mr. Lee

775
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,159
[롤리팍] 야, 이 새끼야 저거 우리 거야, 이 개새끼야

776
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,452
[Oh -ryun -gu] Fucking cubs, fucking fast

777
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,996
- [Woman's rough breath] - [Lolly Park] Oh, it's hard, fuck

778
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,332
- [Mechanical sound] - [Ryungu] Oh, pants, fuck

779
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,542
-Hey, this dog! - [Machine sound]

780
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,045
Wow, ah, hard work

781
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,213
[Mechanical sound]

782
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,589
[Lolly Park] Hey, hey, hey…

783
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,673
[Mechanical sound]

784
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,717
[Oryun -gu] Hey, catch it quickly ah, that idiot baby

785
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,302

00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,888
-Oh, uh, it's hard to see -[girl] brother, run faster

787
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,181
- [Lolly Park] Wow, seed- [idol] Lee Jin -sung!

788
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:58,641
- [Ryungu] What is that? - [Machine sound]

789
00:41:58,724 --> 00:41:59,892
[Oryungu] Oh, go out, go out, get out of it

790
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:02,311
-Hey, why intercept! - [Lolly Park] This fuck!

791
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,979
[Intense music]

792
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,442
[Idol] Oh, fuck

793
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,487
- [Machine] - [Idol] I, Lee!

794
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,076
-We, come to work, come to work! - [Jinseong]!

00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,702
- [Machine] - [Lolly Park] Wheel, catch, catch

796
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:19,870
[Mechanical sound]

797
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:20,955
[Idol] Me and this cheap baby!

798
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:21,872
[Lolly Park] Child, fuck!

799
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,123
[Bright music]

800
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,208
Uhe

801
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,584
- [Man] Do you need money, young? -Huh, huh?

802
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:29,046
[Man] Huh huh, well, everyone is easy, salty!

803
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,006
Yay!

804
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,843
[Together] Berry Good Money, 5252-7979

805
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,178
[Idol] Pull the zoom

806
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,388
Pull, pull, more, more, more

807
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:39,014
More, more, more, more, it

808
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,766
- [Finger -Finger] -Ha, Jin Sung, Jinseong

809
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,309
-How do you see the camera in front of you? - yes

810
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,936
[Idol] I'm talking about this camera lens

811
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,521
-Yes- [Idol] Jinseong

812
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,605
ah…

813
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,233
[Idol] Do you know why Matilda disappeared?

814
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:51,860
Have you kidnapped Jinseong?

815
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,029
-Oh, no- [Idol] Why did you run away?

816
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,740
You went to catch it with those babies, like hunting

817
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,075
I'm chased

818
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,494
I'm so sensitive that I have been so excited since I was young

819
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,622
So I didn't run away because of that wrong

820
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,000
[Idol] Oh, don't cry, don't cry

821
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,918
Okay, heh, don't cry, don't cry

822
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,087
Okay, good, good, yes

823
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,171
Now, but

824
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,090
These pictures

825
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:14,174
and

826
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,760
This message

827
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,305
Isn't this obsessed?

828
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,640
Do you remember this? Read me?

829
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,309
-'Matilda, I yesterday… ' - [Jinseong] I, stop

830
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,352
So tell me to explain this

831
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,354
I have been watching since Hako

832
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,232
These days, I'm different from those cubs that cling to me

833
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:33,485
Hey, you keep doubt

834
00:43:33,569 --> 00:43:35,988
It's not wrong to like and obsessed

835
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,072
This baby

836
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,368
It's suspicious because you're obsessed

837
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,872
Now, when you stop contacting you

838
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,999
Matilda's disappearance matches with each other

839
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,584
How will you explain this? - I don't know

840
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,668
- I don't know? - I don't know

841
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,503
No, you know

842
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,755
So even if Matilda rests on the broadcast

843
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,465
Didn't you send a message, why?

844
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,342
Because you already know that Matilda can't broadcast.

845
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:57,259
No!

846
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,386
[Idol] Then fuck this situation logically!

847
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,514
[Heavy music]

848
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,982
Now, I honestly

849
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,485
I don't think you would have kidnapped Matilda

850
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:15,694
Everyone here think so…

851
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,988
Do you think so?

852
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,574
You are the image of the culprit we thought

853
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,701
Too different

854
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,703
however

855
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,747
But

856
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,126
I can't erase the feeling that you know what you know

857
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,838
Hey, what do you know?

858
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,550
Tell me that

859
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,345
[Jinsung's foolish]

860
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,389
eww! Bitter

861
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:45,307
Now, Jinseong, Jinseong, Jinseong!

862
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,602
It's okay, tell me

863
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,896
I don't know if I can talk about this…

864
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,189
[Idol] You can do it, do it, do it!

865
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,524
-How, zoomed- [format] Yes

866
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:56,527
I met a person at an art academy

867
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:58,821
The picture style was similar to each other, so I became close

868
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,614
Because I'm talking about Matilda

869
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:03,033
I was curious while showing interest

870
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,244
While asking even trivial things

871
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,703
I started to cling

872
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:09,706
One day, he was angry like a crazy person

873
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,916
- suddenly? - yes

874
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,543
- why? -The joined

875
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,169
Combined?

876
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,380
Yes, I couldn't forgive what I said there

877
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,590
-What? - uh…

878
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:20,884
He betrayed himself and insulted him

879
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,846
Well, I insulted the truth by playing a childish play

880
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,808
Then a woman dressed in a red clothes passed by.

881
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,101
- [Idol] Red clothes? - yes

882
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:30,269
But don't be angry

883
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,438
I looked at her for a while

884
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,731
As if it was like this

885
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,197
Who is that baby? Where are you?

886
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,782
I don't know, but I know I live near Hongdae

887
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:44,700
Where is Hongdae?

888
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:45,993
Hapjeong from Hongdae

889
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,161
Is there a phone number?

890
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,997
Oh, I don't know, I only talked about it at that academy

891
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,457
[widely!]

892
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,500
[Idol] Ha… What does that baby look like?

893
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:54,710
It looks ordinary

894
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,962
[Idol] Now, look, this baby?

895
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:57,963
I don't know this

896
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:59,840
It seems to be right or not

897
00:46:00,757 --> 00:46:02,885
[Idol] Is there any clue we can find?

898
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:06,138
I have a school cafe, and I know that person ID

899
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,224
But I saw the person's ID in the chat window

900
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,316
- [Anxious music] - [idol] huh?

901
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,400
yes?

902
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,155
Uh, where?

903
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:25,032
In this broadcast?

904
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:26,783
yes

905
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:32,998
[Idol] This baby is a funny baby

906
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:34,500
This fuck is a baby!

907
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,585
-Why do you say that now? - no…

908
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,962
[Idol] Yeah, look for, find out, Mr.!

909
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,422
Find, find, seed!

910
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:42,216
