1
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:21,699
Tanya. I got this.

2
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,828
Go take a shower, or
you might be late for school.

3
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,020
Okay, Barbie.

4
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:28,498
By the way, your allowance.

5
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,319
I already put it on your bed, okay?

6
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,793
Thank you, Barbie!

7
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,950
- That’s why I love you so much!
- Hey!

8
00:02:33,996 --> 00:02:35,563
We both

9
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,923
smell so sour already!

10
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:38,915
Gosh! So dramatic!

11
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,341
Just make sure

12
00:02:41,424 --> 00:02:42,664
you don’t neglect your studies.

13
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:46,030
Just like I promised Mom
before she passed away.

14
00:02:46,055 --> 00:02:48,084
That I will work hard to
support your education.

15
00:02:48,424 --> 00:02:49,842
Of course, Barbie.

16
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:53,062
Of course, when I graduate with a
degree in hospitality management.

17
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:54,646
I’ll help you next.

18
00:02:54,673 --> 00:02:56,114
We’ll start planning for

19
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:58,623
Barbie’s ultimate barbecue!

20
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:02,223
We’ll outdo every
restaurant in the Philippines.

21
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:04,219
So fabulous!

22
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:06,217
- Go on now, take a shower.
- Alright.

23
00:03:06,242 --> 00:03:07,695
You’ll be late already.

24
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,591
What?

25
00:05:00,004 --> 00:05:01,451
Why are you looking
at me like that?

26
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:03,206
Hmm?

27
00:05:04,534 --> 00:05:06,120
Make me a cup of coffee!

28
00:05:13,915 --> 00:05:16,608
- Hmm, you really smell so good.
- Bro!

29
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:17,975
- Hmm?
- Shall we drink some more?

30
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:19,602
I'm still not satisfied.

31
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,170
I’ll go buy more, wait a bit.

32
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,547
Let’s wait for Barbs.

33
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,105
- Cheers! Cheers!
- Alright, if you say so.

34
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:26,259
- Barbs!
- Hey!

35
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,202
- So you’re here.
- Barbie’s here already.

36
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,805
- She's here.
- Do your best later, okay?

37
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,665
So you can finish

38
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,761
- your barbecue quickly.
- Give her a drink.

39
00:05:35,059 --> 00:05:36,102
It's still early.

40
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,034
- You’re drunk already.
- Shut up!

41
00:05:39,014 --> 00:05:40,182
Just give me some.

42
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,207
- Just for alcohol—
- Geez! No way!

43
00:05:42,451 --> 00:05:43,911
- This early in the morning!
- Bro!

44
00:05:43,936 --> 00:05:45,562
She doesn’t want to give.

45
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:46,630
Bet.

46
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:49,672
Looks like Madam Barbie
is embarrassing you.

47
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,788
Don’t ever embarrass me in
front of my friends, okay?

48
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:54,957
Hmm?

49
00:05:56,585 --> 00:05:58,325
- You're hurting me.
- Oh, that tastes good.

50
00:05:58,555 --> 00:06:02,270
- You’re really going to get hurt if—
- Let me go!

51
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:04,310
Just give me some!

52
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:06,098
What is it?

53
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:08,120
Bogart, that’s enough.

54
00:06:08,145 --> 00:06:09,160
Wait!

55
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:10,311
I'm hungry, bro.

56
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:11,971
- There!
- Here it is!

57
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,981
That was meant to pay
the loan shark later!

58
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,099
There you go!

59
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,609
- Bro!
- Let's go, Valerie!

60
00:06:16,634 --> 00:06:17,939
Oh yeah!

61
00:06:17,964 --> 00:06:20,341
We’ve got more for drinking again!

62
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,714
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

63
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:23,366
You’re amazing, Barbs!

64
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,885
That’s what I like about you, bro!

65
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:27,607
You’re so powerful around here!

66
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,430
You’re the boss around here, bro.

67
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,541
- Thanks, man!
- You!

68
00:06:30,615 --> 00:06:32,158
Buy! Buy!
Go buy, bro!

69
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,741
- Let’s buy more!
- Let’s buy!

70
00:06:42,362 --> 00:06:47,116
[background chatter]

71
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:49,100
How much do I owe you, Barbie?

72
00:06:49,632 --> 00:06:50,638
Oh, how many?

73
00:06:51,764 --> 00:06:52,807
- How many?
- Five.

74
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,410
Five? Five pieces?

75
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:57,100
Wait, twenty for one piece.

76
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,443
- That’s one hundred total.
- Okay.

77
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,113
Thank you.

78
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:07,726
- We don't match.
- Oh, it got burned!

79
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:08,842
Whatever!

80
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,329
Oh, friend!

81
00:07:12,354 --> 00:07:13,981
Once you dip
your barbecue

82
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:15,333
into the sauce,

83
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:17,777
you can’t dip it again.

84
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:19,147
We need to stay clean.

85
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,827
It’s fine. Thank you.

86
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:24,686
- Hey girl, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

87
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:25,921
Totally fine.

88
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,364
- Of course.
- Ugh, come on!

89
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,728
So annoying.

90
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:30,367
What is it again?

91
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:32,497
I thought I was
going to hit the jackpot.

92
00:07:32,522 --> 00:07:34,523
A kid! A girl!

93
00:07:38,655 --> 00:07:39,823
Shit!

94
00:07:48,484 --> 00:07:49,777
Slap me, Lando.

95
00:07:50,055 --> 00:07:51,473
Slap me.

96
00:07:53,886 --> 00:07:54,929
Shit!

97
00:08:03,437 --> 00:08:04,565
You’re so stingy!

98
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:07,105
Shit!

99
00:08:07,845 --> 00:08:09,305
Harder, Lando!

100
00:08:09,515 --> 00:08:10,515
Harder!

101
00:08:11,966 --> 00:08:13,843
- Oh, gosh! Lando!
- Shit!

102
00:08:16,053 --> 00:08:17,053
Shit!

103
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,199
You feel so good.

104
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:30,927
Really!

105
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:39,733
It's so hot!

106
00:08:41,943 --> 00:08:43,319
Was it good?

107
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:44,344
It was okay.

108
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:45,328
Hey, hey!

109
00:08:45,353 --> 00:08:47,313
Don't forget now.

110
00:08:47,338 --> 00:08:48,756
My payment, Lando?

111
00:08:48,781 --> 00:08:50,718
You think I’d run off?

112
00:08:51,173 --> 00:08:52,173
Here.

113
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,024
Son of a bitch! What is this?

114
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,866
That’s good enough.
I’ve got nothing left.

115
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,682
- That’s all I have left on me.
- What do you think of me?

116
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,923
Barbie’s barbecue?

117
00:09:01,963 --> 00:09:04,174
Her barbecue tastes
even better than you.

118
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:05,228
What an asshole!

119
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,795
- I’m out of here.
- Screw you!

120
00:09:08,065 --> 00:09:09,441
You think you're that good?

121
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:10,759
Your dick is small!

122
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:11,784
Loser!

123
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:13,835
Bullshit!

124
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,681
You really think you’re all that?

125
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:19,695
Shit!

126
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:21,462
[sighs]

127
00:09:22,558 --> 00:09:25,586
Oh, geez! Life of a
prostitute is really hard.

128
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,370
And he still wants to kiss.

129
00:09:29,565 --> 00:09:31,525
As if his breath smells nice.

130
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,754
Your breath stinks!

131
00:09:37,488 --> 00:09:38,617
This will do.

132
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,783
Hey! Son of a bitch!

133
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,613
Oh, here you go.

134
00:10:34,548 --> 00:10:36,699
- Oh?
- Can I get one?

135
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:39,353
There you go again,
you won't pay again!

136
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:40,698
What's with that face?

137
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,564
Don’t frown.

138
00:10:42,589 --> 00:10:44,424
People might not buy from me.

139
00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:47,097
We still need to pay
Tanya’s tuition.

140
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:48,994
That Lando is a jerk!

141
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:50,606
He promised five hundred.

142
00:10:50,631 --> 00:10:52,164
He thinks he has
a huge dick.

143
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,666
Turned out to be tiny.

144
00:10:53,692 --> 00:10:55,871
And uncircumcised!
Plus he wanted to kiss me.

145
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,977
Son of a bitch!
His breath reeked.

146
00:10:58,263 --> 00:10:59,723
It's still early, girl!

147
00:10:59,748 --> 00:11:01,005
Make up for it later.

148
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,885
- Hi, Barbie!
- Hello!

149
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,078
How are our sales?

150
00:11:04,103 --> 00:11:05,697
They're okay, Tanya.

151
00:11:05,722 --> 00:11:07,215
A lot of people bought today.

152
00:11:07,746 --> 00:11:09,290
She can finally pay

153
00:11:09,315 --> 00:11:10,983
her tuition now!

154
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:13,338
Wish we could all say the same.

155
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,663
Hi, Valerie!

156
00:11:14,688 --> 00:11:16,170
This is Philip, by the way.

157
00:11:16,417 --> 00:11:18,319
- He's my classmate.
- Hello!

158
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,931
Liar! Classmate?

159
00:11:19,956 --> 00:11:22,275
- Maybe he's your boyfriend?
- Hey!

160
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,183
Tanya's not allowed
to have a boyfriend yet.

161
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,702
She hasn’t even
graduated yet, right?

162
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:30,220
- Correct!
- Bogart would get mad at her.

163
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:31,455
Very no.

164
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,648
- Yes!
- You and your sister are so clueless.

165
00:11:33,673 --> 00:11:35,945
If you only knew,
Bogart already has desires

166
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:38,108
- for your sister.
- What? Did you say something?

167
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,107
Nothing. I was saying...

168
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,384
Hey, cutie.

169
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,618
Maybe you want some?

170
00:11:43,754 --> 00:11:45,454
Huh? Yes.

171
00:11:45,594 --> 00:11:47,323
I really like the...

172
00:11:47,348 --> 00:11:50,402
- Barbecue from Barbie.
- Hey, don’t listen to her.

173
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:53,659
Don’t you dare drag
Philip into your business.

174
00:11:53,699 --> 00:11:55,297
He’s way too young.

175
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:57,085
Can't you see he's still a student?

176
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,344
What business?

177
00:11:58,369 --> 00:11:59,495
You want to know?

178
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,230
Come with me to the back.

179
00:12:01,298 --> 00:12:02,591
So you’ll find out.

180
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:06,009
Later you’ll forget
about Tanya.

181
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,064
This Valerie is really crazy.

182
00:12:08,089 --> 00:12:09,534
Ignore her, that’s just how she is.

183
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:10,824
Oh my.

184
00:12:10,849 --> 00:12:12,529
Maybe you’ll like this one.

185
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:13,941
This one, just this one.

186
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,067
- Marry him.
- Hey!

187
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:16,177
He’s big.

188
00:12:16,432 --> 00:12:18,649
You really know
the type I like, huh?

189
00:12:18,674 --> 00:12:20,507
- That’s what you’re looking for.
- Do you want me to explain

190
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,532
how small?

191
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,179
Oh, gosh.
You’ll be disappointed, girl.

192
00:12:24,204 --> 00:12:25,363
Look, come here.

193
00:12:25,388 --> 00:12:27,216
This one’s better.
He’s got a big head.

194
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,073
Bogart...

195
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:29,893
I’m tired.

196
00:13:31,784 --> 00:13:33,953
I’ll take care of it.

197
00:13:34,385 --> 00:13:37,221
I have to wake
up early tomorrow.

198
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:39,512
Damn it.

199
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:41,420
You’re so dramatic.

200
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:45,032
Want me to hit you again, huh?

201
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:35,202
Gosh, it’s so hot, Barbie.

202
00:18:35,227 --> 00:18:36,289
I know, right?

203
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,941
I’m worried here.

204
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,667
Prices are really
high these days.

205
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,950
How are we supposed
to make a profit?

206
00:18:47,975 --> 00:18:49,435
I know!

207
00:18:49,978 --> 00:18:51,480
I thought of a way, Barbie.

208
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,286
It’s a waste if my
eyelash expires.

209
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,706
Oh my! I know that already!

210
00:18:55,736 --> 00:18:57,988
- You really are something.
- Barbie...

211
00:18:58,013 --> 00:19:00,189
If only I didn’t really love you.

212
00:19:00,517 --> 00:19:01,517
Geez!

213
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:32,043
I'm glad you're here
so you can help me.

214
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,415
Of course, Barbie.

215
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,049
We don’t have work anyway.

216
00:20:35,607 --> 00:20:38,786
- Philip, thank you very much.
- Welcome.

217
00:20:40,283 --> 00:20:42,519
I wish everyone had that.

218
00:20:42,544 --> 00:20:43,592
Oh, Valerie.

219
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,285
Why haven’t you started

220
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,624
selling something already?

221
00:20:46,681 --> 00:20:48,559
- There are lots of customers!
- I don’t know about you.

222
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,085
You want me to copy you?

223
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,069
Just stay there.

224
00:20:51,094 --> 00:20:52,347
There’s no dick here anyway.

225
00:20:52,372 --> 00:20:53,915
Oh, my!

226
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,074
It’s okay now.

227
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:56,717
Just get some dipping sauce.

228
00:20:57,242 --> 00:20:58,560
Thanks!

229
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:06,555
- Pass it here, come on.
- Delicious.

230
00:21:06,711 --> 00:21:08,296
I’ll just fix this.

231
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:10,198
- This is delicious.
- It's been like this.

232
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,297
- Ah!
- Give it to me.

233
00:21:14,322 --> 00:21:15,468
Give it, it's my turn.

234
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:19,615
It's so good, man!

235
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,222
What?

236
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:22,275
Enjoy it!

237
00:21:23,466 --> 00:21:25,010
So you’ll want more.

238
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:26,993
Light it up.

239
00:21:27,018 --> 00:21:29,187
- Son of a bitch!
- Lighter! Lighter!

240
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,249
There!

241
00:21:38,327 --> 00:21:39,327
What?

242
00:21:46,355 --> 00:21:47,564
Damn, bro!

243
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,520
This is smooth.

244
00:21:49,545 --> 00:21:51,034
Of course, man!

245
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,453
- Let me try!
- Try this.

246
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:53,500
I’ll try it.

247
00:21:55,829 --> 00:21:57,414
I’ll serve you.

248
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,859
- Okay.
- I like that.

249
00:21:58,884 --> 00:21:59,954
Hurry up!

250
00:22:05,643 --> 00:22:06,662
Damn, bro!

251
00:22:06,687 --> 00:22:07,980
Where did you get this?

252
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,030
[exhales]

253
00:22:11,681 --> 00:22:12,880
Bro...

254
00:22:12,927 --> 00:22:15,054
The stuff Boss told me to sell,

255
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:16,288
I cut back.

256
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:18,270
Just don’t make noise.

257
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,612
Damn you guys!

258
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:21,532
You’re crazy, bro.

259
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:22,915
You’re really something, man.

260
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,047
That’s why I’m with you!
Hey! Fist bump!

261
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,627
Oh, you again!

262
00:22:27,652 --> 00:22:29,214
Try your hard work.

263
00:22:30,544 --> 00:22:31,544
- It's good, man!
- What?

264
00:22:33,968 --> 00:22:34,980
Here!

265
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:36,022
Try it.

266
00:22:38,488 --> 00:22:39,774
[groans]

267
00:22:42,873 --> 00:22:45,185
Listen to me, Lando, Tony.

268
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,516
If my moves get out,

269
00:22:48,051 --> 00:22:49,121
you’re done for!

270
00:22:49,598 --> 00:22:50,808
Damn, bro.

271
00:22:50,915 --> 00:22:51,973
What about us?

272
00:22:52,555 --> 00:22:55,905
We can try these for free,
why would we out you?

273
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:57,795
- Good.
- We won't do that.

274
00:22:58,972 --> 00:23:00,328
But bro, you know.

275
00:23:00,353 --> 00:23:01,797
Just a friendly advice, okay?

276
00:23:02,832 --> 00:23:04,042
Be careful too.

277
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:05,193
It’s risky now.

278
00:23:05,218 --> 00:23:06,805
What if Boss finds out?

279
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:07,964
You’re done for.

280
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,140
- Okay, okay.
- What are you saying?

281
00:23:10,165 --> 00:23:12,140
- I'm
- Here, here.

282
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,492
Cheers! Cheers!

283
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,202
I’ll take care of that, bro.

284
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,813
- Don’t ruin the vibe.
- Damn, bro!

285
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:19,550
- This is a lot!
- You too, you too!

286
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,027
- Damn it!
- Damn you!

287
00:23:23,877 --> 00:23:25,128
[yells]

288
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,005
- Damn you, Valerie!
- Damn it!

289
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,940
- It’s just you!
- It’s just you! Damn it!

290
00:23:28,965 --> 00:23:30,891
- You ruined the fun!
- What's that?

291
00:23:30,916 --> 00:23:32,377
Overreacting?

292
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,413
- Hey! What’s that?
- We got nervous there!

293
00:23:35,438 --> 00:23:37,516
Give me some!

294
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,855
No more! It's finished!

295
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,352
Yes, Tony, my love!

296
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,661
- Wait a minute.
- Oops!

297
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:42,867
You actually like me.

298
00:23:42,892 --> 00:23:44,143
- Yes! Of course!
- Really?

299
00:23:44,168 --> 00:23:46,955
Tony, maybe
you can book me.

300
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:49,351
Because the customers
at Barbie’s stall

301
00:23:49,376 --> 00:23:51,234
are quite slow.

302
00:23:51,259 --> 00:23:52,871
Alright, stand up!

303
00:23:53,801 --> 00:23:54,904
Spin, spin!

304
00:23:56,036 --> 00:23:57,686
- Wow!
- Wow!

305
00:23:58,194 --> 00:23:59,751
- Hmm!
- Is it okay?

306
00:23:59,776 --> 00:24:00,776
- Is it okay?
- Sure!

307
00:24:00,831 --> 00:24:02,249
I’ll check, okay?

308
00:24:02,282 --> 00:24:03,825
My customers

309
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:05,811
prefer new dishes.

310
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,528
Oh, really? Screw you!

311
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,846
Wait a minute!
You're already angry!

312
00:24:10,871 --> 00:24:12,341
- Calm down!
- Come here!

313
00:24:12,366 --> 00:24:13,786
- Come here!
- Let's go, my friends.

314
00:24:14,239 --> 00:24:15,490
I got you!

315
00:24:19,678 --> 00:24:21,198
One more, one more.

316
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,459
Ah!

317
00:24:23,592 --> 00:24:25,136
Delicious, right?

318
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:26,971
What?

319
00:24:30,117 --> 00:24:31,117
Delicious!

320
00:24:31,457 --> 00:24:32,457
Of course!

321
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,076
That’s from us!

322
00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:35,344
Let’s keep eating!

323
00:24:35,781 --> 00:24:36,781
Have a drink first!

324
00:24:36,806 --> 00:24:38,144
- Okay!
- Cheers, buddy!

325
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:39,244
No!

326
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,861
Looks like you’re getting
tastier today, Valerie!

327
00:24:41,991 --> 00:24:42,991
There!

328
00:24:43,805 --> 00:24:45,790
- Tony!
- Smelling good too!

329
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:46,984
Maybe!

330
00:24:47,103 --> 00:24:48,976
- Who?
- Geez...

331
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:50,601
Hey...

332
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,784
- Hey!
- Ah!

333
00:24:52,944 --> 00:24:53,987
Having fun?

334
00:24:55,092 --> 00:24:56,092
Oops!

335
00:24:56,456 --> 00:24:57,457
What now?

336
00:24:57,482 --> 00:24:59,192
You better pay first!

337
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,249
Dammit, Valerie!

338
00:25:01,274 --> 00:25:03,950
What is this, you keep
using my drugs for free?

339
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,643
- Stupid bulls—
- Hey!

340
00:25:05,668 --> 00:25:07,056
Seafood is expensive!

341
00:25:07,081 --> 00:25:08,161
How much more for a vagina?

342
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:09,468
Eat first!

343
00:25:09,858 --> 00:25:10,901
Eat first...

344
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,319
- I’ll eat first.
- Go ahead!

345
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,411
I’ll go first.
I’ll go first, buddy!

346
00:25:14,436 --> 00:25:15,478
- Okay.
- Wait! Wait!

347
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:16,765
- Wait! Okay, okay!
- Okay, what?

348
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,364
Okay, on one condition, okay?

349
00:25:18,389 --> 00:25:20,225
- What condition?
- I’ll let you do it.

350
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,855
You better eat me...

351
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,833
- Yeah!
- And I’ll eat you too!

352
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,018
Woohoo!

353
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,193
- We want that!
- Yeah!

354
00:25:28,218 --> 00:25:29,636
I’ll go ahead first!

355
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,625
Tony, come on!

356
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,587
Eat up, buddy.

357
00:34:15,863 --> 00:34:18,415
Hey, Tanya! You haven't
said a word since a while ago.

358
00:34:19,272 --> 00:34:20,290
Barbs!

359
00:34:20,315 --> 00:34:21,399
Seems like...

360
00:34:21,424 --> 00:34:23,742
your barbecue slices
got smaller today.

361
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,753
Yeah...

362
00:34:25,778 --> 00:34:28,698
Prices of pork are going up now.

363
00:34:28,723 --> 00:34:29,849
It's 380 now.

364
00:34:29,876 --> 00:34:32,128
We have to adjust too.

365
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,431
Because we won't earn anything.

366
00:34:34,963 --> 00:34:36,299
But don’t worry!

367
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:39,452
When pork prices return
to their old rates...

368
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:40,628
Most likely,

369
00:34:40,653 --> 00:34:43,281
we will return it
to its original size.

370
00:34:43,473 --> 00:34:45,600
It seems there’s no hope
that prices will go back,

371
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,561
or drop for goods anymore.

372
00:34:47,812 --> 00:34:49,230
I know.

373
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:50,772
Don’t worry! Here.

374
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,352
Just make it up with the sauce.

375
00:34:52,683 --> 00:34:54,651
There, no matter how much.

376
00:34:58,788 --> 00:34:59,824
Hey!

377
00:34:59,849 --> 00:35:01,101
Tanya, what’s up?

378
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,017
- What happened to you?
- It's nothing.

379
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:06,440
I thought you had
an exam tomorrow,

380
00:35:06,465 --> 00:35:08,256
that’s why I didn’t
bring you here.

381
00:35:08,552 --> 00:35:09,845
I’m fine here.

382
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,218
I’ll just study here.

383
00:35:12,148 --> 00:35:13,364
Are you sure?

384
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,211
Are you sure

385
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,871
Thanks, handsome!

386
00:35:25,434 --> 00:35:27,019
Hi, Barbs!

387
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,763
Looks like you’re
happy today!

388
00:35:29,788 --> 00:35:31,050
Of course!

389
00:35:31,123 --> 00:35:32,123
Here.

390
00:35:33,607 --> 00:35:34,942
This is big!

391
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:36,630
The handsome one is generous!

392
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,177
I told you.

393
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,829
Just be patient.

394
00:35:40,545 --> 00:35:42,255
Thanks, Barbs!

395
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:45,116
- Please clean the room.
- What’s that?

396
00:35:45,398 --> 00:35:47,942
The customers
are already complaining.

397
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:50,428
I’ve never been short
on rent with you, right?

398
00:35:50,453 --> 00:35:53,314
Oh, fine. Okay, Madam V.

399
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:55,466
- Next time.
- Okay, okay!

400
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,047
Alright, alright. I’ll clean up.

401
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,672
- Oh my!
- Ugh!

402
00:35:59,697 --> 00:36:01,699
Everytime this happens...

403
00:36:01,724 --> 00:36:03,518
Delicious! Delicious!
Delicious! Delicious!

404
00:36:03,543 --> 00:36:04,794
If you’re always like that!

405
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,830
Then we’d all be happy!

406
00:36:06,855 --> 00:36:08,731
Look at me,
so many customers.

407
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,543
You know,
he tastes great.

408
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,679
- It’s big!
- Oh! My!

409
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:14,056
Generous!

410
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,198
Even bigger dick.

411
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,299
Oh!

412
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,886
You really are something!

413
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,664
Geez...

414
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,143
Hot!

415
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,610
What? Cheers, handsome!

416
00:36:35,635 --> 00:36:36,719
Cheers!

417
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,942
You guys are so weak!

418
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:41,966
Oh! You pour too high!

419
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,242
- Damn you!
- Amazing!

420
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,720
- What the hell is that?
- You’re getting weak—

421
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,539
- Hey!
- She's trying to get us drunk.

422
00:36:46,564 --> 00:36:47,597
Hey!

423
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,043
- Wait.
- Weakling.

424
00:36:49,096 --> 00:36:50,472
Why, Bogart?

425
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:52,434
Is this the man
you’re flirting with?

426
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:53,612
Of course it’s me!

427
00:36:54,535 --> 00:36:56,453
We’re just friends.

428
00:36:57,594 --> 00:36:58,929
You’re such a liar, girl!

429
00:36:58,954 --> 00:37:00,163
Friends?

430
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:02,466
Does a friend always
follow you around?

431
00:37:02,772 --> 00:37:04,831
Don’t lie to me!

432
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,328
Come on, Valerie.

433
00:37:06,621 --> 00:37:08,998
Don’t make me a liar, okay?

434
00:37:09,126 --> 00:37:10,670
Just admit to Bogart

435
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,547
that Baby Boy is your boyfriend.

436
00:37:13,321 --> 00:37:14,822
Then it would be over, right?

437
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,192
You’re just starting,

438
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:17,569
I’m already done.

439
00:37:18,294 --> 00:37:19,378
Oh, dude!

440
00:37:22,015 --> 00:37:23,746
Remember this face, okay?

441
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:26,550
You know already.

442
00:37:28,036 --> 00:37:29,537
Bogart...

443
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,182
You’re no different
from your sister.

444
00:37:33,911 --> 00:37:35,162
You’re just as flirtatious.

445
00:37:35,187 --> 00:37:36,187
Come on!

446
00:37:36,351 --> 00:37:37,480
Go home. Go home.

447
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,731
- Go home. Go home.
- Go home!

448
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,549
Help your sister Barbs.

449
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,973
- Hurry up, let’s go.
- Cheers! Cheers!

450
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,480
Cheers? You guys
are weak drinkers.

451
00:37:44,504 --> 00:37:45,847
Fill it up, fill it up!

452
00:37:46,202 --> 00:37:48,078
Son of a bitch! Cheers!

453
00:38:09,776 --> 00:38:11,077
- Bogart.
- What?

454
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,651
Why is the money short?

455
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:16,069
Damn it.

456
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,463
I just took some for my drinks.

457
00:38:18,488 --> 00:38:19,690
Don’t be selfish!

458
00:38:20,327 --> 00:38:21,662
Come on, Bogart!

459
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,150
You know that’s my payment

460
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,550
for the pork and the debt!

461
00:38:25,659 --> 00:38:28,009
Sales are really slow now.

462
00:38:28,034 --> 00:38:29,795
You even took my capital.

463
00:38:30,052 --> 00:38:32,570
You know very well
your sales are low,

464
00:38:32,798 --> 00:38:35,341
why won’t you
stop your nonsense?

465
00:38:35,366 --> 00:38:37,569
What if you stop using drugs?

466
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:39,542
Don’t ever interfere

467
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,027
with what I want in life, okay?

468
00:38:41,345 --> 00:38:43,789
- Bogart, enough!
- And you!

469
00:38:43,814 --> 00:38:44,973
Not Tanya!

470
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:46,716
You guys, damn you.

471
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,955
Listen to me, okay?

472
00:38:48,301 --> 00:38:49,427
As long as you’re here

473
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,661
in my household,

474
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,397
I am the law here.

475
00:38:52,972 --> 00:38:54,014
Is that clear?

476
00:38:55,037 --> 00:38:56,037
Understood?

477
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,856
Damn these people.

478
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,427
Barbie,

479
00:39:08,676 --> 00:39:10,803
maybe we should leave.

480
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,990
Where is that coming from?

481
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,772
Look at what he’s doing to you.

482
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,593
That’s where my questions
to you come from, Barbie.

483
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,139
I can’t leave Bogart.

484
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,745
Despite everything, I love him.

485
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,400
He’s the only one who
accepted me into his home.

486
00:39:38,402 --> 00:39:40,862
You know where
I came from, right?

487
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,991
He’s the only one
who gave me hope.

488
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,634
To us.

489
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:51,501
So don’t think about me.

490
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,107
Just focus on

491
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,628
finishing your studies.

492
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:58,269
Hmm?

493
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:17,248
Hey, got candy?

494
00:40:17,273 --> 00:40:19,098
- Hey, man. What’s up?
- Hey!

495
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,872
- Shit, man! Where've you been?
- Why?

496
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:24,027
Damn, man.
Have you seen Boss yet?

497
00:40:24,896 --> 00:40:26,898
You’re wanted
by him right now.

498
00:40:27,622 --> 00:40:30,578
Damn, your schemes
with him are exposed.

499
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,222
Shit, man.

500
00:40:33,503 --> 00:40:34,963
He knows now, man.

501
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:39,328
The stuff you sold to "S,"

502
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,419
you didn’t deliver.

503
00:40:43,737 --> 00:40:45,674
If I were you,
I’d be careful.

504
00:40:46,837 --> 00:40:49,448
You don’t know what
our boss can do to you.

505
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,548
Philip, what’s up with you?

506
00:41:18,775 --> 00:41:21,116
That bastard Bogart
might show up.

507
00:41:21,863 --> 00:41:23,031
He won't.

508
00:41:23,056 --> 00:41:24,850
I saw him earlier outside.

509
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,212
Barbie's on her way back...

510
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:28,668
The barbecue is almost finished.

511
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,492
What? Come on.

512
00:41:31,527 --> 00:41:32,861
This will only take a moment.

513
00:41:32,886 --> 00:41:34,988
I still want to
finish my studies.

514
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:36,952
You might get me pregnant later.

515
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:38,913
Come on.

516
00:43:30,183 --> 00:43:31,183
What’s that?

517
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,398
Damn you!

518
00:43:35,524 --> 00:43:38,343
- Bogart, please don’t.
- Weren’t you warned, asshole?

519
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:39,633
Huh?

520
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:41,418
- I’m not doing anything!
- You have no fear!

521
00:43:42,109 --> 00:43:43,844
- Damn you!
- Bogart, please don’t!

522
00:43:55,457 --> 00:43:56,458
Barbie!

523
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:57,867
Barbie!

524
00:43:58,208 --> 00:43:59,567
- Barbie!
- What?

525
00:43:59,592 --> 00:44:01,138
Hurry! It’s Bogart!

526
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,389
He’s beating up Philip!

527
00:44:02,414 --> 00:44:03,831
- Hurry!
- What?

528
00:44:04,006 --> 00:44:05,065
What happened?

529
00:44:05,165 --> 00:44:07,375
I don’t know. Just hurry!

530
00:44:07,767 --> 00:44:09,370
Oh no! Hurry up!

531
00:44:15,914 --> 00:44:17,165
- Baby boy!
- Bogart!

532
00:44:17,466 --> 00:44:20,260
- Baby boy, what happened to you?
- What did you do to Philip?

533
00:44:21,254 --> 00:44:22,547
Don’t ask me.

534
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:24,630
Ask

535
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:25,746
that smart

536
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:27,456
and flirtatious sibling of yours!

537
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:32,503
Damn you!

538
00:44:32,615 --> 00:44:34,242
When you’re high,
you act like that!

539
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:37,033
You beast! You don’t
even spare the kids!

540
00:44:37,517 --> 00:44:38,563
Come on!

541
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:40,320
- You don’t know anything here!
- You stop!

542
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,643
Damn you!

543
00:44:42,128 --> 00:44:43,295
Screw you all!

544
00:44:43,858 --> 00:44:44,858
Hmm?

545
00:44:45,327 --> 00:44:46,327
Especially you!

546
00:44:46,615 --> 00:44:48,104
I already warned you!

547
00:44:48,129 --> 00:44:50,131
- Damn you!
- Stop it!

548
00:44:50,452 --> 00:44:51,745
Stop it!

549
00:44:52,914 --> 00:44:53,957
Damn you all!

550
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:59,154
What did you do?

551
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:09,903
What kind of life is this?

552
00:45:10,525 --> 00:45:11,995
Barbs, short sales, right?

553
00:45:13,316 --> 00:45:16,385
Maybe people aren't
into barbecue today.

554
00:45:19,379 --> 00:45:21,536
Why do you look upset, girl?

555
00:45:21,763 --> 00:45:22,778
Are you still hoping

556
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,634
your baby boy will
still come here?

557
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:26,682
Oh my gosh, girl.
With that face?

558
00:45:26,782 --> 00:45:27,908
Beaten up, hard!

559
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,309
His face looks terrible.

560
00:45:29,436 --> 00:45:32,606
I don’t know if he still have
the nerve to come here.

561
00:45:33,546 --> 00:45:35,256
I don’t know about you.

562
00:45:35,281 --> 00:45:37,367
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

563
00:45:37,392 --> 00:45:40,178
I would have covered for you!

564
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:43,658
Hello?

565
00:45:44,002 --> 00:45:45,628
Am I talking to someone?

566
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:47,448
Damn it.

567
00:45:47,474 --> 00:45:49,469
Seems like I’m talking to mutes.

568
00:45:49,666 --> 00:45:50,666
Alright then.

569
00:45:51,201 --> 00:45:52,285
I'll go ahead.

570
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:53,353
This is crazy.

571
00:45:58,161 --> 00:46:00,413
Why did you do that, Tanya?

572
00:46:01,787 --> 00:46:02,934
Barbie...

573
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,053
Sorry.

574
00:46:07,975 --> 00:46:09,726
It won’t happen again.

575
00:46:11,694 --> 00:46:12,904
I promise.

576
00:46:14,632 --> 00:46:15,819
Barbie!

577
00:47:07,757 --> 00:47:09,167
Who the hell are you?

578
00:47:11,602 --> 00:47:12,854
Shit! Who are you?

579
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:14,561
Boss, what?

580
00:47:14,586 --> 00:47:15,586
What's the problem?

581
00:47:16,197 --> 00:47:17,197
Huh?

582
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,274
Bear with it, okay?

583
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,608
Ouch!

584
00:47:43,023 --> 00:47:44,358
This will only be for a moment.

585
00:47:44,503 --> 00:47:45,545
Take it slow!

586
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:47,721
Ouch!

587
00:47:48,399 --> 00:47:49,461
Hold still!

588
00:47:50,627 --> 00:47:52,244
You’re acting like a child!

589
00:47:53,635 --> 00:47:55,262
What the hell happened?

590
00:47:58,219 --> 00:48:00,013
Barbie, help me.

591
00:48:00,038 --> 00:48:01,600
I’m really scared.

592
00:48:04,209 --> 00:48:05,335
Stop crying.

593
00:48:06,456 --> 00:48:07,498
Stop crying.

594
00:48:11,064 --> 00:48:12,064
Barbie...

595
00:49:28,228 --> 00:49:29,318
Yes, Barbie.

596
00:49:29,673 --> 00:49:32,870
I’ll be able to pay
the boss bit by bit.

597
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,021
What bit by bit?

598
00:49:35,238 --> 00:49:36,908
As long as you don’t
pay your boss,

599
00:49:36,933 --> 00:49:38,423
I won’t stop?

600
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,493
Come on, Barbie.

601
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,728
Help me out here.

602
00:49:41,134 --> 00:49:43,189
Stop acting like you
weren’t a prostitute.

603
00:49:43,593 --> 00:49:44,861
Stop pretending to be clean.

604
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:46,759
Oh, tomorrow.

605
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,487
Tony’s new client booked you.

606
00:49:49,623 --> 00:49:51,179
They say he gives big tips.

607
00:49:53,131 --> 00:49:54,257
This is fine now.

608
00:49:54,759 --> 00:49:55,784
Let’s go.

609
00:49:56,038 --> 00:49:57,051
Come on.

610
00:50:05,091 --> 00:50:06,259
Come on!

611
00:50:34,571 --> 00:50:36,200
I’ve cooked dinner already.

612
00:50:36,225 --> 00:50:37,476
Eat now.

613
00:50:41,057 --> 00:50:42,267
Barbie...

614
00:50:43,087 --> 00:50:44,880
Let’s leave here now.

615
00:50:46,556 --> 00:50:48,696
Have mercy on yourself.

616
00:50:49,711 --> 00:50:51,087
I'm okay.

617
00:50:51,623 --> 00:50:53,207
This will end too.

618
00:50:54,235 --> 00:50:56,993
Don’t neglect your studies, okay?

619
00:51:03,213 --> 00:51:04,367
Hey, Barbie!

620
00:51:04,733 --> 00:51:06,061
Enough already, come on!

621
00:51:06,489 --> 00:51:08,167
Stop the drama! Let's go!

622
00:51:37,591 --> 00:51:39,413
This place is closed already?

623
00:51:41,241 --> 00:51:42,700
Yes, mister.

624
00:51:42,725 --> 00:51:44,494
She’s the one
getting poked now.

625
00:51:44,709 --> 00:51:45,709
Huh?

626
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,451
Acting clueless?

627
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,523
I don’t understand you!

628
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,795
Sir, just poke me instead.

629
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:55,973
You’ll say “yamate”
from how good it feels!

630
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,238
Idiot!

631
00:51:57,464 --> 00:51:58,464
Crazy!

632
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:08,721
Ouch!

633
00:53:30,272 --> 00:53:31,398
Wait, Barbie.

634
00:53:31,499 --> 00:53:32,500
Damn it!

635
00:53:32,695 --> 00:53:34,965
Tony's customer is
complaining about you!

636
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:37,130
They say you’re as cold
as a corpse in bed!

637
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,673
I’m done, Bogart.

638
00:53:38,713 --> 00:53:40,548
You’ve been using me too much.

639
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,997
Really Barbie?

640
00:53:45,136 --> 00:53:46,596
Now?

641
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:50,085
Unbelievable! I thought I
was done with selling myself.

642
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:52,479
But it was only temporary.

643
00:53:54,803 --> 00:53:55,803
Fine.

644
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:56,990
I agree.

645
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:58,630
If you don’t want to anymore...

646
00:53:59,983 --> 00:54:01,237
Tanya’s the replacement.

647
00:54:01,316 --> 00:54:02,526
Son of a bitch!

648
00:54:02,769 --> 00:54:05,408
Don’t you dare
touch my sister!

649
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,452
Or I’ll kill you!

650
00:54:07,846 --> 00:54:08,846
Really?

651
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,289
I’m really scared, Barbie.

652
00:54:11,785 --> 00:54:13,162
My knees are shaking.

653
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,086
Maybe you forgot.

654
00:54:17,103 --> 00:54:18,980
I have a lot of friends here

655
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:21,216
who are ready to kill for me.

656
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,175
Remember that!

657
00:54:24,148 --> 00:54:25,355
You’re so evil!

658
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,515
Evil indeed.

659
00:54:29,306 --> 00:54:30,516
Screw you.

660
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,019
You’re a worthless husband.

661
00:54:55,566 --> 00:54:56,650
Oh girl.

662
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,258
Where are you going?

663
00:54:58,934 --> 00:55:00,671
You know where
I’m going, right?

664
00:55:02,858 --> 00:55:06,328
I thought... You were on
track with your new life.

665
00:55:06,872 --> 00:55:09,166
I was really happy for you.

666
00:55:10,694 --> 00:55:12,711
Maybe this is my life now?

667
00:55:13,503 --> 00:55:16,548
To sell myself, to be sold.

668
00:55:17,806 --> 00:55:19,015
That’s why I...

669
00:55:19,584 --> 00:55:21,669
I won’t change who I am.

670
00:55:21,972 --> 00:55:22,972
Whatever happens.

671
00:55:23,482 --> 00:55:25,735
As long as someone
is paying me.

672
00:55:26,016 --> 00:55:27,755
Someone poking in me.

673
00:55:27,906 --> 00:55:29,073
Just go for it.

674
00:55:30,584 --> 00:55:32,253
Long live the whores.

675
00:55:33,002 --> 00:55:34,587
Long live the whores.

676
00:57:31,562 --> 00:57:32,607
Hey!

677
00:57:32,632 --> 00:57:34,300
Where are you going?
Why are you dressed?

678
00:57:34,403 --> 00:57:35,571
I’m leaving!

679
00:57:36,058 --> 00:57:37,601
Tony and I never agreed

680
00:57:37,626 --> 00:57:39,115
that you would use drugs!

681
00:57:39,403 --> 00:57:40,863
And who’s with you?

682
00:57:58,434 --> 00:57:59,519
Come here!

683
00:57:59,544 --> 00:58:00,837
You talk too much!

684
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,104
We already added payment
to Tony and Bogart!

685
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:04,613
Bogart!

686
00:58:04,845 --> 00:58:05,845
Bogart!

687
00:58:09,162 --> 00:58:10,162
Hold her, bro!

688
00:58:11,507 --> 00:58:13,853
Bogart!

689
00:58:14,436 --> 00:58:15,894
- Wait!
- Bogart!

690
00:58:16,540 --> 00:58:17,958
Let me go!

691
00:58:19,461 --> 00:58:20,963
You’re mine now.

692
00:58:20,988 --> 00:58:22,406
Bogart!

693
00:58:23,709 --> 00:58:24,958
Bogart! No!

694
00:58:24,983 --> 00:58:26,401
Bogart!, please!

695
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,482
Bogart!

696
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,797
Bogart!

697
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:38,143
Make the most of the
money you paid, bro!

698
00:58:56,478 --> 00:58:58,253
Make the most of it, bro!

699
00:59:43,331 --> 00:59:45,018
You bastard!

700
00:59:49,538 --> 00:59:51,289
Dude, it’s so tight!

701
01:05:38,626 --> 01:05:41,358
You deserve that, you bastard!

702
01:05:41,792 --> 01:05:43,131
Damn you!

703
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:44,393
You bastard!

704
01:05:46,163 --> 01:05:47,163
Keep going!

705
01:05:47,669 --> 01:05:50,922
You deserve that, asshole!

706
01:05:51,404 --> 01:05:52,537
Screw you!

707
01:05:52,701 --> 01:05:53,848
Shit!

708
01:06:54,214 --> 01:06:55,214
Barbs!

709
01:06:55,925 --> 01:06:56,925
Barbie!

710
01:06:57,916 --> 01:06:59,125
Barbie!

711
01:06:59,845 --> 01:07:00,845
Barbie!

712
01:07:01,818 --> 01:07:03,169
What happened here?

713
01:07:10,681 --> 01:07:11,723
Barbie...

714
01:07:12,903 --> 01:07:15,316
Barbie, Bogart is gone.

715
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:19,211
Bogart and Tony are dead.

716
01:07:20,282 --> 01:07:22,230
They were shot, Barbie.

717
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:24,472
Killed by those

718
01:07:24,497 --> 01:07:26,958
they get drugs from.

719
01:07:27,878 --> 01:07:30,214
They’re gone, Barbie.

720
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:06,848
Barbie?

721
01:08:07,409 --> 01:08:09,786
Why do you look... happy?

722
01:08:12,317 --> 01:08:13,860
We are free now.

723
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:17,710
We are free now.

724
01:08:25,451 --> 01:08:26,911
Free...

725
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,547
This is our chance to change, Barbs.

726
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:05,474
Good thing, Barbs.

727
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,624
You went back to
selling your barbecue.

728
01:09:07,821 --> 01:09:09,228
You know what I noticed.

729
01:09:09,848 --> 01:09:12,261
The barbecue slices
are back to their original size.

730
01:09:12,286 --> 01:09:13,749
Of course, regular customers!

731
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:15,000
What did I say before?

732
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:18,045
When pork prices
return to normal,

733
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:19,446
we’ll bring back

734
01:09:19,471 --> 01:09:22,600
the original barbecue slices.

735
01:09:23,676 --> 01:09:25,010
Bro, fishball!

736
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:26,329
- Fishball!
- Hey, Tanya!

737
01:09:26,354 --> 01:09:27,371
Philip.

738
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:29,154
- Hello, Barbie.
- Promise me, okay?

739
01:09:29,179 --> 01:09:32,050
That you’ll finish your
studies first, okay?

740
01:09:32,075 --> 01:09:33,103
- Yes, Barbie.
- Yes, Barbie.

741
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,464
- Promise.
