1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,257
-SOOHEON: Really?
-AJUNG: Yeah, your bangs are burnt.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,925
-SOYEON: What?
-SOOHEON: I was so surprised, really.

3
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,844
Seriously, come on.

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,512
AJUNG: Oh. Gi Osung?

5
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:13,638
Oh, hey, Osung.

6
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:15,265
Did you come here looking for me again?

7
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,349
Yeah.

8
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:18,101
By any chance are you guys
celebrating Ok Chanmi's birthday?

9
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,227
I guess you already ran into her?

10
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,520
It seemed like she was on her way
to wash her face

11
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:22,522
-after getting a cake smash.
-(soft laugh)

12
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:24,441
Why don't you stay and celebrate with us
since you're already here?

13
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,151
Yeah, you should join us.

14
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,112
It's fine. I wasn't even invited anyway.

15
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,197
Jaebum, I'll wait for you
in the café out front.

16
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:32,657
Okay, then.

17
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,368
(cell phone ringing)

18
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,371
(Osung grunts)

19
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,626
FATHER

20
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,462
-(cell phone ringing continues)
-I'm going to head out.

21
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,963
See you.

22
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,716
Yes, father.

23
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,384
(gasps)

24
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,890
It was Gi Osung?

25
00:00:56,973 --> 00:01:00,185
Are you saying it was Gi Osung's ringtone?

26
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,563
Yeah, Gi Osung came in after you left.

27
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,065
Then I heard his ringtone.

28
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,901
(gasping)

29
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,778
It's not a common ringtone.

30
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,529
And he was close to Park Wonseok.

31
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,615
That's why I think the person
who called you...

32
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:14,949
(exhales deeply)

33
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,618
...was Gi Osung.

34
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:17,535
(breathes shakily)

35
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,622
Gi Osung. I'm going to kill him.

36
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,707
(breathes deeply)

37
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,752
-Don't even think about shooting him.
-Why not?

38
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:27,545
You punished all those bad guys yourself,

39
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,963
and now you're telling me
to leave this murderer alone?

40
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:30,673
I'm not saying you shouldn't take action.

41
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,343
All I'm saying is that you should think
about how it will impact your life!

42
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,970
I don't care. I'm going to kill them all.

43
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:37,931
Mind your own business!

44
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,643
(grunts)
Chanmi.

45
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:42,977
I understand.

46
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:46,648
-Let's calm down for now.
-(breathes deeply)

47
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,735
Promise me you won't pursue this alone.

48
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,824
Promise me.

49
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,909
Don't go after Gi Osung alone.

50
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,285
(exhales deeply)

51
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,497
Fine.

52
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,791
(suspenseful music)

53
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:08,211
(Chanmi pants)

54
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:12,298
(suspenseful music continues)

55
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:28,898
Jaebum, why don't you go back home today?

56
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,359
Your mother's worried about you.

57
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:35,530
What's keeping you from going back home?

58
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,660
You haven't been back since I gave you
that photo of you and Park Wonseok.

59
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,498
The photos have nothing to do with it.

60
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,750
Really?

61
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,920
I'm just scared to be home.

62
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,756
What do you mean?

63
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,384
When I'm alone at home,
crazy ideas pop into my head.

64
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,849
What I'm trying to say is that
I start having these crazy delusions.

65
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,102
I get the feeling
that I did something that I didn't do.

66
00:03:06,186 --> 00:03:09,105
And for things that I did do,
I have no memory of them.

67
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,566
(sobs)

68
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,861
I think I'm going crazy, seriously.
I'm really scared.

69
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:15,945
(sobbing continues)

70
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,614
(inhales deeply)
Jaebum?

71
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,616
It's driving me crazy!

72
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:23,036
(sobbing)
I can't come out of these crazy delusions.

73
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,954
Jaebum.

74
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,623
Calm down. Just calm down.

75
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,083
Do think you're going crazy right now?

76
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:32,420
You jumped from a building

77
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:35,632
and hurt your head. You lost memories,
and you're just recovering is all.

78
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,675
That's why you're feeling so confused.

79
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,721
(sighs lightly)

80
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,806
Fuck, how can you be so sure?

81
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,476
What?

82
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,104
I'm asking you how you can be so sure.

83
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,942
You seem to know everything
that's going on right now.

84
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,068
You know what I've done

85
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,320
and you know what's going on
inside my head, huh?

86
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:58,529
Jaebum, I'm... it's not...

87
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,366
Are you trying to manipulate me
by showing me a picture of Park Wonseok,

88
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,743
knowing it would embarrass me
that I dated him?

89
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,913
And you're trying to use that against me?

90
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,998
No, damn it,
what are you even talking about?

91
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,667
Why on earth would I manipulate you?

92
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,504
You manipulated Park Wonseok too.

93
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,923
-That's not the same.
-(grunts)

94
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:19,092
How is that any different, you bastard?

95
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,428
What were you going to do
by exploiting my weakness? Huh?

96
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,390
Were you going to kill me too
if I didn't listen to you?

97
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,433
Damn, you're totally
out of your mind, seriously!

98
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,396
(breathes deeply)

99
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,068
(breathes heavily)

100
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,320
Osung.

101
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,031
Osung.

102
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:46,494
Was I really in a relationship
with Park Wonseok?

103
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,998
Is it true?

104
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,210
Hah, shit!

105
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,135
(pants)

106
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,438
(breathes deeply)

107
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,399
Ajung, are you hungry?
Want to have some dumplings?

108
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,235
-Should I go get something for you?
-I'm okay. Don't try so hard to look calm.

109
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,447
-I know you're feeling shitty right now.
-Stop giving me shit.

110
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,241
Hey.

111
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,536
Did you know Sooheon and Chanmi
were living together?

112
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,289
They're not actually living together.

113
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,292
-They're just living in the same building.
-I'm asking if you knew that already.

114
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,131
I knew.

115
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,258
You idiot.

116
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,385
You shouldn't have let them live
in the same building!

117
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,971
Who am I to tell them not to live
in the same building?

118
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,349
(sighs)

119
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,309
Judging by the vibe between those two,

120
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,102
it seems like they're already in love
with each other.

121
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,396
Hey, shut up.

122
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,939
(exclaims)

123
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,067
Why are things so messed up?

124
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,569
The wrong person was shot by cupid's arrow

125
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,613
and now Ji Sooheon's a suspect.

126
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,074
But even still...
(grunts)

127
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,951
I think we made the right decision
to celebrate her birthday.

128
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,661
Chanmi seemed happy.

129
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,041
It was my first time seeing her smile.

130
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,092
You didn't have to follow me up here.

131
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,307
Thank you

132
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,643
for today.

133
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,604
No problem.

134
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,609
About Gi Osung,

135
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:46,197
you're not going to report him
to the police, are you?

136
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,366
No.

137
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,494
These are the same cops that didn't
even carry out a proper investigation

138
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,579
and just concluded
that my brother was a suicide.

139
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:54,789
How can I trust them?

140
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,958
Also, his father's a police chief.

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,044
Oh, while we're on the topic,

142
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:03,214
let's start by confirming

143
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:05,550
if the ringtone we heard on that call
is actually the same

144
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,218
as the one on Gi Osung's cell phone.

145
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:08,845
How could we be any more certain about it?

146
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,514
How could it possibly be a coincidence
that Gi Osung's ringtone

147
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,141
is the same as the one on that call?

148
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:14,559
That's why we should double check.

149
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,770
If we're half-baked about this,
we might not catch the killer.

150
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,939
What did you have in mind?

151
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,860
If we can match the time
that you heard the ringtone

152
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,571
with an incoming call on Gi Osung's phone,

153
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,531
then he's the killer.

154
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,200
There's probably a call log on his phone.

155
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,454
So are you saying we should get a hold
of his phone and unlock it?

156
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,080
That's the hard part.

157
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,959
Right after I transferred to this school,
my cell phone was stolen.

158
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:43,087
Someone hit me over the head with a brick
so that I would lose consciousness

159
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,422
and used my fingerprint
to unlock my phone.

160
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:49,802
So are you saying we should hit him
over the head with a brick as well?

161
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,179
Why not?

162
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,056
(sighs) Gosh.

163
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,102
Yeah. Let's give it some more thought.

164
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,270
(inhales deeply)

165
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,397
Anyways, rest up for now.
I'm heading back downstairs.

166
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,690
Okay.

167
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,027
Ah, I almost forgot!

168
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,111
Sorry.

169
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,906
I wasn't able to prepare a birthday gift.

170
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,283
(chuckles)
No worries.

171
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,951
There's no way you would've known
it was my birthday.

172
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,161
Still...

173
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,997
is there anything in particular
you'd like as a gift?

174
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:20,750
I told you it's fine.

175
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,752
I mean, but...

176
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,295
I still...

177
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,422
would like to...

178
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:28,841
get you something.

179
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,761
(breathes sharply)

180
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,305
In any case, I'll think about it.
Sleep well.

181
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,806
Night.

182
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:40,394
Hey, Sooheon.

183
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,231
Then how about...

184
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,317
those shoelaces on your tennis shoes.

185
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,485
(breathes lightly)

186
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,656
The shoelaces?

187
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,740
Yeah.

188
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,909
What're you going to do with these?
They're pretty old.

189
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:58,996
Nothing, really. I just thought
it was the finest thing you owned.

190
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,581
Hah, come on!

191
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,708
Are you making fun of me?

192
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,585
I own expensive things too.

193
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,671
-No, you don't.
-Right, I don't.

194
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:08,256
(soft chuckle, inhales deeply)

195
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:11,759
You don't have to give them to me.
Who would want used shoelaces?

196
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,927
I was just joking.

197
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,470
See you tomorrow.

198
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,060
(inhales deeply)

199
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,145
(light music)

200
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,541
SOOHEON: Tada.

201
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,960
Huh? What's this?

202
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,421
What's with these red shoelaces?

203
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,590
Mom, don't you recognize these?

204
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:53,884
Aren't these the shoelaces
from my tennis shoes?

205
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,636
That's right.

206
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,221
I took them from your shoes.

207
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,431
(chuckles)

208
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,349
Sooheon.

209
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:05,021
Why would a boy put red shoelaces
on a pair of white sneakers?

210
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,982
Since you can't walk with them on,

211
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,817
I'm going to do the walking for you.

212
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:10,985
(exhales deeply)

213
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,696
I can't wear your old sneakers
because they're too small for my feet,

214
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,823
so I just tied my shoes
with your shoelaces.

215
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,950
(breathes deeply)

216
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,994
(both chuckle)

217
00:10:22,747 --> 00:10:27,168
I'll walk a lot praying
you'll get better soon.

218
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,712
Okay, then.

219
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,591
-What do you think? Aren't they nice?
-(Sooheon's mother chuckles)

220
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,012
(light music)

This is where we found the receipt.

224
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,218
YONGTAN POLICE DEPARTMENT

225
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,012
This is the receipt.

226
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,223
It was left over on the floor
of the body shop.

227
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:25,017
The torn part of the receipt
was not found at the scene.

228
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:26,060
(inhales sharply)

229
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,354
The reason why I'm emphasizing
the importance of this receipt

230
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,273
is because it's likely
that it belonged to the suspect.

231
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,526
Isn't it possible that it belonged
to one of the customers

232
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,861
at the body shop rather than the suspect?

INSIDE THE BODY SHOP AFTER THE INCIDENT

236
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,880
Here, the receipt is there
at the scene of the crime.

237
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,342
But here you will see that it wasn't there
before the suspect arrived.

238
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,804
Ah, also, it seems this barcode isn't

239
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:05,433
something you might find
on just another restaurant receipt.

240
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,767
Rather, it's a kind of barcode
that certain businesses

241
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,562
might use for their own intents
and purposes.

242
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,022
Which leads me to believe
this is part of a membership ID.

243
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,568
Oh, yeah. This barcode is commonly used
in gyms or other places like that.

244
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,527
Yes, sir.

245
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,405
That's why I'm planning to check
the shopping malls in the area first.

246
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:22,283
That's going to be good evidence.
Make sure you search thoroughly.

247
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,368
You haven't made any progress at all!

248
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,122
(tongue clicks)

249
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,086
(chuckles lightly)

250
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:42,011
Huh? I was just about to feed Thor.

251
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,345
I guess we'll have to watch out.

252
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,264
Thor will probably pretend
he hasn't eaten just so he can eat twice.

253
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:47,308
Wow, you fat cat.
(inhales deeply)

254
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,226
Maybe we should decide
who'll feed him on which day.

255
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,188
(chuckles)

256
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,733
-(grunts)
-(chuckles lightly)

257
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,901
(sniffs)

258
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,781
Um?

259
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:05,701
(laughs)

260
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,870
What? Are you really giving these to me?

261
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,705
Didn't you ask for them?

262
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:14,251
Thanks.

263
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,465
Hold on.

264
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,676
(door rattles)

265
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:29,892
(sighs)

266
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,853
Did you really have
to change your shoelaces?

267
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,313
Why wouldn't I?

268
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,899
What else would I do with shoelaces
other than put them on shoes?

269
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,276
It seems like
something's been bothering you.

270
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,072
It makes me feel
like you're wearing my clothes.

271
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,032
(scoffs)
What? It's like that now?

272
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,368
Just don't throw them away.

273
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:51,205
If you feel like throwing them away,
just return them to me.

274
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,415
Do these have
some sort of special meaning for you?

275
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,750
Maybe I shouldn't have asked you
to give them to me.

276
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,419
(tongue clicks)
Nah, it's nothing.

277
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:01,173
Anyways, go wherever you want
in those shoes.

278
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,466
Go visit awesome places.

279
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,510
And visit some fun places too.

280
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:05,845
What do you mean?

281
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,014
Nakjun!

282
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,683
Hey, Sooheon!

283
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:12,601
Hurry up, dude.

284
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,978
I'm surprised you're going to school
on time today.

285
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,896
Hey, hey. When was I ever late? Damn.

286
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,648
-(exclaims)
-It's good to see you.

287
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,109
(laughs lightly)

288
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,578
(sighs)

289
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,998
(breathes heavily)

290
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,332
Nothing?

291
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,042
Nope, nothing.

292
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,878
All right, let's head
to the next building then.

293
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,337
Cheer up.

294
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,715
The way I see this
is that I'm getting paid for working out.

295
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,300
-Let's go.
-Okay.

296
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,303
It's this one here.

297
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,847
(breathing seriously)
Hmm.

298
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,641
On our receipt,
we have the barcode in the center.

299
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,018
-You're right.
-Thank you.

300
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,102
Of course.

301
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,065
Hm, hold on one moment.
(inhales sharply)

302
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,485
I think it actually looks
a lot like our membership pass.

303
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,695
Excuse me?

304
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,824
Here, if you take a look at this...

305
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,328
Ah, this looks the same.

306
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:15,164
Sir, could you please check
when this receipt was issued?

307
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,959
Since only the front part was lost,
most of the information is intact.

308
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,378
The torn-off part just has information
about our store.

309
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,756
But this back part has all the information
about the date, time,

310
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,507
and, well...
all of that information comes up.

311
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,468
Oh, really?
Could you please check it for me?

312
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,094
Yes, sir. Since the torn-off part
is identical on each receipt,

313
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,596
I can just fill in the rest
and give it a try, yeah?

314
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,556
-Yes, please. Thank you.
-Yes, sir.

315
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,939
WITH ME REAL ESTATE

316
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:40,898
Nothing?

317
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:41,941
Nope. Nothing.

318
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,401
Wow, did I just set us up for failure?

319
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,195
I think you'll be proven right.

320
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,030
Why don't we keep going
for a little bit longer?

321
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,990
Oh, I can really count on you, huh?

322
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:52,910
-(laughs)
-Cool, let's go!

323
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,704
(sighs lightly)

324
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,332
(suspenseful music)

325
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,213
You can trust me, Sooheon.

326
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,589
I know, I know.

327
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:09,635
I trust that you didn't kill Ju Hyeokgeon,
that bastard.

328
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:10,719
(sighs)

329
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,473
If I hadn't run into him at the OBGYN,
this wouldn't have happened.

330
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:19,228
I'm not blaming you though, Sooheon.

331
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,189
I totally agree that bastards like that
should get their asses kicked.

332
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,273
The reason we asked to see you
is because...

333
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:24,191
(sighs)

334
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:27,987
If the cops were looking for you
while you were gone,

335
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,698
it means they must know something.

336
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,075
That's why I thought
we should share what we know,

337
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,952
so that we can coordinate our stories.

338
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,620
The cops stormed into the gym

339
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,373
to find evidence.

340
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,711
I had a backpack
where I kept all the tools I used

341
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,546
when I smashed those guys.

342
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,172
(gasps)
So?

343
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,383
Chanmi

344
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,969
had snatched the backpack in time.

345
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,015
If it weren't for her,
I would've already been arrested.

346
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,641
Had I been caught,

347
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,561
I could've been framed as a murderer.

348
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:01,478
(gasps)

349
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,188
Chanmi is awesome, seriously.

350
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,358
In that case, we should probably
include Chanmi in this

351
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,610
so that we can all share information.

352
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,115
(exhales deeply)
Anyways, let's just be careful.

353
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,199
By the way.

354
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:17,244
Who do you think was responsible
for cutting her brake

355
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,412
and breaking the windows?

356
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,290
Who would've gone into her room
to break her things

357
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,916
and rip up her school uniform?

358
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,336
Isn't Kook Jihyun pretty eager
to destroy Ok Chanmi these days?

359
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,756
Also, Kook Jihyun has bullies for friends.

360
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,675
You know they beat me up once too.

361
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,177
(exhales deeply)

362
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,429
I'm suspicious of Gi Osung.

363
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,014
Why would Gi Osung do that to Chanmi?

364
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,098
(scoffs)

365
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,350
Well, they are siblings after all.

366
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,062
If it was Gi Osung who did it,

367
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:44,521
don't you think he would've taken a photo
with his cell phone?

368
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,523
If he did it, he probably would've.

369
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,192
So that he could show it to Kook Jihyun.

370
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,359
Why don't we...

371
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,279
check Gi Osung's phone?

372
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,574
(light music)

373
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,927
You son of a bitch,
do you have a death wish?

374
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,014
Have you lost your mind? Hey!

375
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,100
-What?
-Ugh, shit.

376
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,392
What was that?

377
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,811
I said, what was that?

378
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,980
What, I know you've been talking trash
about me, you son of a bitch!

379
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,900
What the hell are you talking about?
Huh?! Huh?!

380
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,862
You. Go. Just leave. Fuck off. Shit.

381
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:35,823
-Who do you think you are?
-Hey, hey, hey.

382
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,991
(exhales deeply)
You crazy bastard.

383
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,827
-Damn bitch, what the hell?
-(student groans)

384
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:40,911
SOYEON: Let me go!

385
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,246
Hey, hey, hey, let me go!
I said let me go! Shit!

386
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,580
You, I told you to leave me alone, shit!
You're dead today!

387
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,665
-Calm down, calm down, okay?
-You, come over here.

388
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:46,041
This crazy bitch wants to die today.

389
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,876
-Fine, it's just...
-Hold on. Hey, let me go for a second.

390
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,337
When did I ever have sex with you,
you motherfucker! Huh?

391
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,548
What the fuck?
Why would I ever sleep with you?

392
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:54,758
-SOYEON: You bastard. Go fuck yourself!
-OSUNG: Let go!

393
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,051
-SOYEON: You, come here!
-OSUNG: Stop with that bullshit.

394
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,678
-I'm going to kill you.
-SOYEON: You motherfucker!

395
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,471
Hey, Sooheon, Sooheon,
it looks like a fight just broke out.

396
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,014
Do you want to go check it out?

397
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,182
-STUDENT 1: Hey, Soyeon, calm down.
-STUDENT 2: Osung, she's a girl.

398
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,101
-Ah.
-SOOHEON: Uh...

399
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,227
You should go watch.

400
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,146
No, it's fine. Those pathetic fools.

401
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,565
Aren't they too old to fight like that?

402
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,650
-Hey, Nakjun.
-Yeah?

403
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,152
You seem interested in the fight.
You should go.

404
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,862
Nah, come on. I'm not curious.

405
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,906
Hey, Ajung, who's fighting
who in your class right now?

406
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:18,991
Gi Osung and Tae Soyeon.

407
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,784
Huh? Why? Hold on.

408
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,703
OSUNG: See? Answer the question, bitch.

409
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:25,247
Why don't you start
talking like you did earlier?

410
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:26,999
STUDENT: Hey, calm down, calm down.

411
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,084
(ominous music)

412
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,004
SOYEON: Why don't you just hit me?

413
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,141
(gasps)

414
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,852
CHANMI: <i>When the suspect
called my phone, it was...</i>

415
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:47,769
The 8th...

416
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,105
CHANMI: <i>...8:17 p.m.
on the night of the 8th.</i>

417
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,857
CLASS 4 KANG YOUNGHOON
JAEBUM HYUNG'S MOTHER

418
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,233
(groans curiously)

419
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,444
(whispering)
He got a new cell phone.

420
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:57,112
There's no call log.

421
00:19:58,071 --> 00:20:00,282
FIND MY PHONE YOUR CELLPHONE SIGNAL
WAS FOUND WITHIN 100M FROM YOU

422
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:04,286
You dared to steal my phone
when I just lost one 4 days ago?

423
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,621
GI OSUNG

424
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:07,289
You're fucking dead.

425
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,416
KOOK JIHYUN

426
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,877
-(gasps)

427
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,258
MEN'S RESTROOM

428
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,097
(sighs)

429
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,768
(exhales deeply)

430
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:29,853
(cell phone ringing continues)

431
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,815
GI OSUNG

432
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,109
(suspenseful music)

433
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,084
CALL MISSED

434
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,129
Ah, fuck. Filthy thief.

435
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,634
He put my phone in the toilet and ran off.

436
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,644
Fucking thief!

437
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,979
(gulps)

438
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:13,814
When I find you,
I'm going to tear you apart.

439
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,360
PLEASE WASH THE MOP
THOROUGHLY AFTER USE.

440
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,653
(door closes)

441
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,823
(breathes shakily)

442
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:24,908
(exhales deeply)

443
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,812

444
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,241
TEACHER: The places

445
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,534
(sighs)

446
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,245
...and the Indian Ocean,
which is a neutral space,

447
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,747
where the protagonist goes.

448
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,873
It's from an omniscient
writer's point of view.

449
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,374
(sighs)

450
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,625
(exhales deeply)

451
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:19,129
...this topic is ideological conflict
and the way...

452
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,219
Gi Osung got a new phone?

453
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,222
Seems like he did 4 days ago.

454
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,184
It was brand new, and there was
no call history before 5 days ago.

455
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,186
Why would he replace it?

456
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,521
He said he got a new one
because he lost it.

457
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,982
But the timing
is what makes it suspicious.

458
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,443
He probably tried to hide the evidence.

459
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,862
Do you think it's possible
that he might've started to notice

460
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,406
and got rid of my brother's phone
and the rest of the evidence?

461
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,366
(breathes heavily)

462
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,034

(Jongguk sighs)

465
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,833
(exhales deeply)

00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,046

00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,054
(breathes heavily)

468
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,059
Sergeant Hyun.

469
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,311
-What brings you here?
-Oh, yes, Chief.

470
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,814
-Hello.
-Hello.

471
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,023
Oh, these are my kids.

472
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,274
Hi.
(soft laugh)

473
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,192
HYEJUNG: Welcome.

474
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,861
Excuse me, ma'am,
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

475
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,571
I'll bring you a cup of coffee
in the reading room.

476
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:27,614
So...

477
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,950
What is it? Let's go in. Yeah.

478
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,245
(sighs)

479
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,372
Mom.

480
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:38,667
I've seen that investigator at school.

481
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,710
Do you think he's here
because of the incident at school?

482
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,212
He probably didn't come
for the investigation.

483
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,588
It must be a personal matter.

484
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,362
(ominous music)

485
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,491
(sighs deeply)

486
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,086
(clanking)

487
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:24,713
(Sejin grunts)

488
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,006
(Sooheon gasps, grunts)

489
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,382
(Sejin groans)

490
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,010
(both grunt)

491
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,472
(Sejin coughs)

492
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,473
-(pants)
-(groans)

493
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,224
(groans in pain)

494
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,851
(breathes in anger)

495
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,144
Gwon Sejin?
(pants)

496
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,480
(groans)

497
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,149
(dog barking in distance)

498
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,536
Um...
(clears throat)

499
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,537
Thank you.

500
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:58,955
But...

501
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,957
are you sure?

502
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:06,213
Are you sure Ji Sooheon
isn't the one who killed Wonseok?

503
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,422
It's not him.

504
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,633
Ji Sooheon's not the murderer.

505
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,928
The real culprit is someone else,
I'm sure.

506
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,472
Ah, I'm hundred percent sure
I saw the suspect running away.

507
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,349
The murderer was wearing a pair
of white sneakers with red shoelaces.

508
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,892
White sneakers with red shoelaces.

509
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,229
I don't recall anyone else wearing
those shoes other than Ji Sooheon...

510
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,649
Then are you saying the suspect
is pretending to be like Ji Sooheon?

511
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,192
Why me...

512
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,818
So you're saying it's someone else?

513
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:29,861
Who is it?

514
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,158
(breathes seriously)

515
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,451
(sighs)

516
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,662
(exhales deeply)

517
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,498
Well, I guess you guys
don't know yet either.

518
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,877
Hey, Ji Sooheon.

519
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,339
Sorry I suspected you.

520
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:50,423
It's okay.

521
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:52,926
It's all good.

522
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,721
Chanmi, I'm sorry.

523
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,308
I'm sorry for breaking your windows...

524
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,476
(inhales deeply)

525
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,521
...breaking the things inside the room,
and ripping up your uniform.

526
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,647
What?

527
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,358
Were you... were you the one who did that?

528
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:12,195
I mean, after I told you that Ji Sooheon
was the suspect,

529
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,864
nothing came of it after that.

530
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,032
(sighs)

531
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,619
So I came here,
wondering why, only to see that

532
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,747
you were living with Ji Sooheon.

533
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:27,043
That's when I felt totally betrayed,
and I couldn't forgive you for it.

534
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,047
I'll be going over to the United States
this weekend.

535
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:34,426
Since I didn't have much time left,

536
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,679
I couldn't bear to leave
without taking care of Ji Sooheon first.

537
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,265
So that's why
it all went down like this today.

538
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,850
I'm sorry.

539
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,436
You must have been really angry then, huh?

540
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,565
I almost died in the scooter accident.

541
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,066
A scooter accident?

542
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,653
What?

543
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,697
Aren't you the one who

544
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,199
cut the brake on my scooter?

545
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:02,162
What? What are you talking about?
That wasn't me.

546
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,084
(soft groans)

547
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,964
So, what brings you here
at this time of night?

548
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:13,882
(sighs)

549
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,675
Um, Chief...

550
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,512
It's about what we talked about
in the briefing,

551
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,097
about the murder case at the body shop.

552
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,849
What? You're here to talk about the case?

553
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,434
(laughs)

554
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,436
I thought it was about something personal.

555
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,605
Hey, I thought you were about to tell me
you're getting married or something.

556
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,398
-(scoffs)
-(laughs)

557
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,483
So what's up?
(sniffles)

558
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,109
-Tell me.
-It's...

559
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,614
about the receipt with the barcode.

560
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:38,615
Yeah, what about it?

561
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:42,452
It was torn off from a receipt
that was used

562
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,787
as an entrance pass to a study café.

563
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,748
It was a reading room years ago,
but now it's a study cafe...

564
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:47,832
Yeah, yeah I know it.

565
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,877
Osung and Jihyun go there sometimes.

566
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,338
Ah, I see!

567
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,132
So the receipt is part of an entrance pass
to the study café?

568
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:02,013
If you check the barcode,
you'll know who used the pass.

569
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,433
If you check
the surveillance footage there...

570
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,103
we can see for certain who it is.

571
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,781
(suspenseful music)

572
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:25,912
(gasps)

573
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,792
Hey, Jongguk, what's going on?

574
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,587
Who was it?

575
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,509
It's Gi Osung.

576
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:42,011
(soft laugh)

577
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,596
Hey, man, what are you talking about?

578
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,306
Hey...
(chuckles)

579
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,767
Hey, hey, tell me. Who was it, really?

580
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:54,691
(ominous music)

581
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,152
Jongguk.

582
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,320
Jongguk, hey.

583
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,282
Are you sure it was Osung?

584
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,410
Yes.

585
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,121
It actually is

586
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,123
your son's receipt.

587
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,588
(groans)
That doesn't necessarily mean...

588
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,801
Osung was at the murder scene, does it?
It's not direct evidence, is it?

589
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:23,970
No, sir.

590
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:25,597
(sighs)

591
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,265
So what we need to figure out is...

592
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:30,185
why Osung's receipt was

593
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,061
at the crime scene?

594
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,022
Yes, Chief.

595
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,565
WANGDO: Are you...

596
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,359
Are you the only one

597
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,031
who knows it was Osung's receipt?

598
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,032
(sighs)

599
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,285
I've yet to report
this to detective Jin Sojung.

600
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,246
Is there some reason why you haven't?

601
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,169
I thought I should report
to you first, Chief.

602
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,215
And wait to follow your order.

603
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,424
Good.

The rich guy is on the bus.

00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,360
Hey, Seok Jaebum.

00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,361
Oh?

610
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,321
So you guys take this one too?

611
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,657
Jaebum, I thought you always
came to school in a Rolls Royce.

612
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,116
I'm going to be taking the bus
from now on.

613
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,036
Jaebum, are you trying out
the life of a commoner?

614
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:31,830
Nope.

615
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,915
I just prefer a bigger vehicle.

616
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,543

00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,257
Are you done fraternizing with him?

619
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,551
What? Jaebum and I
are from the same middle school.

620
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,760
Cheongwoo Middle School.

621
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:48,263
A seat just opened up. Go sit.

622
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,306
Did you even know each other
in middle school?

623
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,266
(sighs)

624
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,852
He's the grandson of a corporate mogul.
Everyone knew him.

625
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,395
I knew about Ajung as well.

626
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,855
She's a greater dancer
and good at singing too.

627
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,649
Even a third-generation corporate mogul
knows who I am.

checking Gi Osung's cell phone location.</i>

630
00:31:09,242 --> 00:31:12,579
He wasn't near the scene of the crime

631
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,455
from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m. the next day.

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,416
(laughs)

633
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,542
Is that right?

634
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,003
According to the log,
he was near the study café at the time.

635
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:23,214
Oh, I see, he was studying.

636
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,216
(laughs)

637
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,928
But according to the entrance log
at the study café...

638
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,473
There was no record of him
entering the café after 6 o'clock.

639
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,059
So then...

640
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,561
(soft laugh)

641
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,146
Ah, so what are you saying happened?

642
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:44,652
Do you mean he left his cellphone
in the study café and then left?

643
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,071
(clears throat)

644
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,866
Uh, I mean...

645
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:55,246
I'll ask Osung about this directly.

646
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,164
(inhales deeply)

647
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,042
Jongguk, so, um...
can you keep this information to yourself

648
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,043
for just one more day?

649
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,253
I'll follow your orders, Chief, but...

650
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,256
it seems like the victim in the case,

651
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,425
Ju Hyeokgeon graduated
from the same middle school as Gi Osung.

652
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,303
Gi Osung is a year older.

653
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,431
When Ju Hyeokgeon committed the murder
as a juvenile delinquent,

654
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,310
Gi Osung was attending
the same middle school.

655
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,314
(groans)

656
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,398
(sniffles)

657
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,901
After I leave work today,

658
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:29,322
I'll get the truth out of my son.

659
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,867
(inhales deeply)

660
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,454
So please keep these records to yourself
until tomorrow, understood?

661
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,790
Yes, Chief.

662
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,794
POLICE
SPECIAL SURRENDER PERIOD

663
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:45,588
Uh? Sergeant Hyun...

664
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,347
POLICE POLICE
CHIEF'S OFFICE

665
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,745
What's up?

666
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,830
(inhales deeply)

667
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,123
You know how I wasn't able
to take the practice exam

668
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:21,582
because I've been ditching class?

669
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,710
I'm worried about you.
What's going on with you?

670
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,838
I know you're pretty busy,
but can I ask you for a favor?

671
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,757
Could you tutor me?

672
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:30,967
A private lesson?

673
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,135
Oh...

674
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,056
Sure, where should we study?

675
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,726
Well, wherever's most convenient
for you...

676
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:41,394
A study café?

677
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,441
All my materials are at home, so...

678
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,900
Why don't you come to my house?

679
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,528
Would that be okay?

680
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,447
Well, I don't see why not.
We'll just be studying.

681
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,490
Let's head to my house together
once class is over.

682
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,412
Jihyun, thank you.

683
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:00,997
Psh, you're welcome.

684
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,258
Chanmi.

685
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:14,844
Hey.

686
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,894
-Jaebum.
-Yeah?

687
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,896
Can I ask you for a favor?

688
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,773
Yeah, what is it?

689
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:29,776
I have something to talk
to Gi Osung about.

690
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,195
Could you be there with me
when I talk to him?

691
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,988
You want me to be there
when you're talking to him?

692
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,031
Yeah.

693
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:38,409
I fought with Kook Jihyun once,

694
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,995
Gi Osung fought with Tae Soyeon.

695
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,122
And I don't want things
to be like this forever.

696
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,168
That's why I thought I should apologize
and try to reconcile with him.

697
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,172
But I felt it might be awkward
if I asked him myself.

698
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,423
Okay.

699
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,467
I'll ask Osung about it.

700
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,551
(sighs)

701
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:56,844
Oh, so, when?

702
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,304
After school today.

703
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,514
Today?

704
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,601
I don't think
I'll have any free time otherwise.

705
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,355
Please, I'd really appreciate it.

706
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,650
Okay, I'll arrange for him to meet you.

707
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,528
Thank you, thank you so much.

708
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,196
(laughs)

709
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,115
(gunshots)

710
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,745
(telephone ringing)

711
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:27,708
HYUN JONGGUK, SERGEANT,
INVESTIGATION TEAM 1

712
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,210
Hello, this is the Special Victims Unit
at the Yongtan Police Department.

713
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,380
MAN (on phone): <i>Yeah, can I talk
to Detective Hyun Jongguk?</i>

714
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,757
He's currently out of office.
How can I help you?

715
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,008
<i>I wanted to ask some questions</i>

716
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,302
<i>about what he's going to do
with the surveillance footage.</i>

717
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,054
What footage?

718
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,182
<i>You know, Detective Hyun checked it
when he stopped by my shop yesterday.</i>

719
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,560
<i>I'm calling from the study café
where the torn receipt was from.</i>

720
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:46,602
(gasps)

721
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,104
I see, yes, yes.

722
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,648
<i>So, what are you going to do
with the recordings?</i>

723
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,151
<i>If I reactivate the surveillance camera,
the old recordings will be gone.</i>

724
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,403
<i>In fact, I'm currently operating my store
without the cameras on.</i>

725
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,947
Please don't...
don't activate it just yet.

726
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,615
I'll be right there.

727
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,908
What is the address there?

728
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:03,911
This.

729
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,830
Yeah. That's right. The entrance pass.

730
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,541
It looks just like what the male detective
showed me yesterday

731
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,003
(sighs)

732
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,882
So where is the recording?

733
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:19,051
Ugh, here. Here it is.

734
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,263
You guys are going about this
really inefficiently.

735
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,514
Oh, sir.

736
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:26,309
Can you zoom in a bit?

737
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:27,310
Sure, sure.

738
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,769
Here.

739
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,396
CAM-ENTRANCE

740
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,400
GI OSUNG

741
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,776
(gasps)

742
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,487
The Chief's son?

743
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,492
(sighs)

744
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,788
Tell me whatever you want to have today.
I'll prepare it for you.

745
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,833
Why don't we have some <i>kalguksu</i> today?

746
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,753
With some clams and zucchini?

747
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,047
-And some fresh kimchi to top it off.
-What the...

748
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,555
(gasps)

749
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,684
Excuse me.

750
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:11,771
You recognize me, right?

751
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,274
I'm Min Seonha's dad.

752
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,861
I thought you were a college student,

753
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,988
but it seems you're actually
just one year older than Seonha.

754
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,784
(sighs lightly)

755
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,212
Mr. Min.

756
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,883
Why don't we talk inside?

757
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:48,099
(grunts)

758
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:50,142
SOYEON: Seems like
I'm having a bad makeup day.

759
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,394
It's fine, just stop.

760
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,520
PILSEUNG EXPRESS

761
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:56,899
I never imagined that I'd ever go
to an OBGYN with you.

762
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,943
And you think I would've seen this coming?

763
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,906
(plastic rustles)

764
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,370
Do you know him?

765
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,706
No.

766
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,258
SEONHA'S FATHER: <i>So...</i>

767
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:25,136
that's when I found out you live here.

768
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,930
The reason why I came here today is...

769
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,560
It's okay. You can keep talking.

770
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,730
My friend knows about what happened.

771
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,649
Thanks to you...

772
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,819
Seonha was doing just fine,

773
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:48,159
until that bastard Sa Junggyeong
showed up again.

774
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,201
(breathes deeply)

775
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:50,745
Sa Junggyeong...

776
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:52,747
I'll get to the point.

777
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,374
I guess I'm asking you
to take care of him again.

778
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,793
This time, please make sure

779
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:02,923
he won't ever dare to appear
before Seonha, ever again.

780
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,926
Please tell that person...

781
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:07,970
that I need his help.

782
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,517
(sighs)

783
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,941
That place was pretty good.
Let's go there again sometime.

784
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,568
Oh, I didn't think it was good,
to be honest.

785
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,448
Oh, Detective Jin.

786
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,451
You look tired.
Why don't you head home early today?

787
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,165
(gasps)

788
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,250
You crazy bastard.

789
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,627
Are you even human?

790
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,170
Detective Jin, why are you doing this?

791
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,797
Detective Jin,
what are you doing right now?

792
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,256
(shouts)
Why am I doing this?

793
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,009
You call yourself a cop, you bastard?

794
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:51,097
How could you go straight
to the Chief's office with that evidence?

795
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:53,933
You filthy bastard.

796
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,310
How dare you stand there
like you've done nothing wrong?

797
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,561
You son of a bitch!

798
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,147
(grunts)
How could you do this to me?

799
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,525
-(man grunts)
-You bastard!

800
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,944
-Get lost, you bastard, let me go!
-(gasps)

801
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,330
Why isn't Ok Chanmi coming?

802
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,290
Jaebum, why don't you give her a call?

803
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,418
You know I did just a few minutes ago.

804
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,211
She said she's on her way,
so let's just wait a little longer.

805
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:23,337
(sighs)

806
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,923
She's the one who asked to meet.
She should have come before me.

807
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:34,515
(breathes deeply)

808
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,860
This is my house.

809
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,820
It's nice.

810
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,697
You've never been
to this side of the town, have you?

811
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,450
(cell phone vibrates)

812
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,576
CHANMI: <i>Are you there?</i>

813
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:54,577
OK CHANMMI
ARE YOU THERE?

814
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,578
SOOHEON: <i>Yes.</i>

815
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,165
Come in.

816
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,458
Are you uncomfortable at all?

817
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,251
No, not at all.

818
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:03,461
No one's home.

819
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:04,628
Wouldn't that be more comfortable?

820
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,422
Yeah, for sure.

821
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,757
(laughs lightly)

822
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,348
(breathes deeply)

823
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,651
Where should we study?

824
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,278
My room is on the second floor.

825
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:31,113
But I guess the kitchen table
would be better?

826
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,907
Oh, yeah. I think so, too.

827
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,496
So where's Gi Osung's room?

828
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:39,830
Over there.

829
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,167
I'm just going to change
into something more comfortable.

830
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,251
Oh, okay.

831
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,638
(ominous music)

832
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,605
(breathes deeply)

833
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,767
(ominous music continues)

834
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,481
(gasps)

835
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,911
Hey, Sooheon.

836
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,372
Should we start studying?

837
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,165
Ah, I'm really sorry,

838
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:07,710
but can we have some ramen
before we start studying?

839
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,211
Oh, really?

840
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,379
Do you want me to cook it for you?

841
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:12,673
Um, sure. Thanks.

842
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:13,632
(laughs lightly)

843
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:14,967
When I cook ramen, my family goes crazy.

844
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,760
They keep telling me
I should start a restaurant.

845
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,178
Hold on just a moment.

846
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,347
I'm so sorry.

847
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,558
It's fine. You're my guest.
Of course I have to make it for you.

848
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,066
Do you mind if I add an egg to your ramen?

849
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,735
Oh, yeah.

850
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:33,694
Thanks.

851
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,154
(soft laugh)

852
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:45,414
(hums)

853
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,215
-(camera shutter clicks)
-(chuckles lightly)

854
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,134
(chuckles lightly)

855
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:59,011
MA_ROCKROCK THERE'S A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR
WHO WENT UP A MOUNTAIN

856
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:02,890
Jaebum.

857
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,351
What are we even doing here?

858
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,977
I'll send Chanmi a text.

859
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:11,106
JIHYEONY(KOOK JIHYUN)
HAS UPLOADED A NEW POST

860
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,361
JIHYEONY
HOME

861
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,445
What?

862
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,696
Jihyun's home.

863
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,867
NARIN:
<i>Seems like studying was just an excuse.</i>

864
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:24,119
<i>Was your true goal to have ramen
with Ji Sooheon? Don't cross the line.</i>

865
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:26,205
HEEJEONG: <i>Sooheon, would you like
to have ramen with me at my place?</i>

866
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,289
(Heejeong giggles)

867
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,416
Osung, Chanmi says she's almost here.

868
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,337
Huh?

869
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:44,014
OK CHANMI

870
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,974
(panting)

871
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,114
(ominous music)

872
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:01,573
(grunts)

873
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:04,284
(panting)

874
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,294
(clatters)

875
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,350
(gasps)

876
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,773
(panting)

877
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:36,692
(rattles)

878
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:39,862
Fucking shit.

879
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:41,655
(beeping)

880
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,199
Ji Sooheon, you bastard.

881
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,038
(breathes heavily)

882
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:55,794
What were you doing in my room, bastard?

883
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,965
Why would I go into your room?

884
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:00,966
I didn't go in there.

885
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:03,385
(shouts)
Don't lie to me, you bastard!

886
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:06,138
What did you do in my room?
Answer me! What did you do? Hey, Osung!

887
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,015
What are you doing?

888
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,017
You stole my phone earlier today.

889
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,685
I saw it was you, you bastard.

890
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,103
What are you talking about?

891
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,271
Come on!

892
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,856
-You bastard!
-(Jihyun screams)

893
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,191
(breathes heavily)

894
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:20,027
-(gasps)
-(groans)

895
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,654
(breathes roughly)

896
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:25,949
(shatters)

897
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,076
(gasping)

898
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,328
Gi Osung.

899
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,704
Who are you?

900
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,332
I'm Detective Jin Sojung,

901
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,833
from the Special Victim's Unit
of Yongtan Police Station.

902
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,418
My father's not home yet.

903
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,171
I need you to come with me
to the police station.

904
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,756
Why should I follow you
to the police station?

905
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,090
You're under arrest.

906
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,592
What?

907
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,344
Under arrest?

908
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:48,013
What are you talking about?
What have I done to get arrested?

909
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,224
I'll call my father now.

910
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,851
He already knows about this.

911
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,355
I'm arresting you to prevent
possible destruction of evidence.

912
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,982
Damn it! I haven't done anything!
Let me go.

913
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,151
Follow me without resisting,
or I'll put handcuffs on you.

914
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,823
Hey, Kook Jihyun.

915
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,700
Call father right now.

916
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,208
(sighs)

917
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,637
(exhales deeply)

918
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,391
(siren blaring)

919
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:34,852
Neunghwa Nursing Home

920
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,736
119 EMERGENCY

921
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,573
(sighs)

922
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,743
(breathes heavily)

923
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,036
(sighs)

924
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,207
(exclaims)

925
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,458
Are you okay?

926
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,877
Gi Osung just ran off suddenly.

927
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,420
We met.

928
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:02,546
What happened?

929
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:04,172
Actually, so many things happened.

930
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,425
I don't even know where to start.

931
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,845
Okay, there wasn't a phone
in Gi Osung's room.

932
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,306
Park Wonseok's wasn't there either.

933
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,640
(sighs disappointedly)

934
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,309
(tongue clicks)
Really?

935
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,560
But I found something else
that was strange...

936
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,771
There were lots of polaroid photos
in his drawer...

937
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,774
MOM'S NURSING HOME

938
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:23,901
Hold on.

939
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:24,902
Okay.

940
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,403
Hello?

941
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:27,321
(sighs)

942
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,406
Yes, hello, ma'am.

943
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,200
What?

944
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,536
My mom?

945
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,538
Uh...

946
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,124
(sobs)
Which hospital is she in right now?

947
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,628
(dramatic music)

948
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:12,324
CRITICAL CARE UNIT

949
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:16,495
Her heart wasn't beating when she arrived,
so we tried to resuscitate her.

950
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,747
Now she's on a ventilator.

951
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,166
We'll just try to keep her on life support
from here on out.

952
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:23,752
Are you saying...

953
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,422
it's unlikely she'll wake up again?

954
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,636
But she's alive.

955
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,097
Yes, she is.

956
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,848
And there could be a miracle, right?

957
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,101
Well, I'm sorry to tell you this

958
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,352
but you and your family should discuss

959
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,854
whether you'll continue
to keep her on life support.

960
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,523
It's because of the cost.

961
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:47,567
Once the cost reaches a certain point
you'll be billed right away.

962
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:48,944
If the bill isn't paid,

963
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:52,656
it will be difficult for us to continue
the life support treatment.

964
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,241
(sighs)

965
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,325
Okay.

966
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,661
I'll get the money together
no matter what.

967
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:00,497
Please.

968
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:03,959
Just keep my mother alive.

969
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:14,553
(soft music)

970
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,683
(sighs deeply)

971
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,770
(sobbing)

972
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,233
(sniffs)

973
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,445
-Hey, stop crying.
-(sobbing continues)

974
00:50:31,528 --> 00:50:32,654
(clears throat)

975
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,282
Why are you crying?

976
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,577
(sobbing)
Because I feel so sorry.

977
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,623
I can't do anything for you.

978
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,626
I'm so sorry.

979
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,716
(breathes deeply)

980
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:59,181
(both sobbing)

981
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,687
(Sojung sighs)

982
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:07,814
INNO MOTORS

983
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,316
(sighs)

984
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,526
I've never been there before.

985
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,821
And I have no idea
why my study café receipt

986
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,782
was found there.

987
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:22,120
On that day, from 11 p.m. to 2 a.m.,
I was sleeping at home.

988
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:24,164
How many times do I have
to repeat this simple fact?

989
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,666
Your father, Gi Wangdo,
the head of the police station

990
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:32,005
hid the fact that this pass is yours.
Why would he do that?

991
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,342
You should be asking my father that.

992
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,805
What's your relationship with Ji Sooheon?

993
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,182
We go to the same school.
What other relation would we have?

994
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:45,185
Have you ever lent him
your study café pass?

995
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,189
Nope.

996
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:53,235
Why did you leave your cell phone
at the café?

997
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:54,444
I tend to be forgetful sometimes.

998
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,323
Are you implying
that I left it there on purpose?

999
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,535
Who did you meet that day?

1000
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:04,746
Everyone at school.

1001
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,039
(scoffs)

1002
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,086
(sighs)

1003
00:52:11,586 --> 00:52:12,712
Detective Jin, I'm sorry.

1004
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:16,007
-Come out for a second.
-Yes, sir.

1005
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:22,180
(inhales deeply)

1006
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:25,183
(exhales deeply)

1007
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,310
TOWER STUDIO APARTMENT
YONGTAN POLICE STATION

1008
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:36,444
If you're trying to persuade me,
I'll just head downstairs.

1009
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,196
(gasps)
You have me all wrong.

1010
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,991
Detective Jin, I'm sorry.

1011
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,868
I had no intention
of sweeping the evidence under the rug.

1012
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:47,581
As a father,
all I wanted was to protect my son.

1013
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,333
(sighs)

1014
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,835
Look, there might be a possibility

1015
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,379
that my son didn't do anything wrong,

1016
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:58,508
and that he just got involved
in the case by chance.

1017
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,470
I thought it might be a shock for him
to be treated as a suspect,

1018
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,972
as young as he is.

1019
00:53:06,224 --> 00:53:07,434
(sighs deeply)

1020
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,311
I shouldn't have entertained that thought.

1021
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,147
It was my mistake. I'm sorry.

1022
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,275
If you ever try to intervene
in the investigation from this point on,

1023
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,569
I'll resign.

1024
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,156
And you'll have to prepare to do the same.

1025
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:36,755
(exhales deeply)

1026
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,302
(indistinct chatter)

1027
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,850
What the fuck is this?
Saying whatever the fuck you want.

1028
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,644
-(Junggyeong laughs)
-EUNHYEOK: Hey, he's got jack shit.

1029
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:51,770
He just won the jackpot.

1030
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,271
-JUNGGYEONG: I mean, fuck.
-SEOJUN: Hey, hey, hey.

1031
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,397
EUNHYEOK: That's a stretch.

1032
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,274
Honestly, you suck at this.

1033
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,068
JUNGGYEONG:
Ha, fuck off. Get out of my house, shit.

1034
00:53:58,151 --> 00:53:59,027
(Eunhyeok laughs)
Idiot.

1035
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,320
JUNGGYEONG:
Hey, open the door and come on in.

1036
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:01,655
Okay, I'll call. It's 100 thousand won.

1037
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,156
(Eunhyeok laughs)

1038
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,241
JUNGGYEONG: Huh?

1039
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:05,450
Gi Osung?

1040
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,411
Wow, Gi Osung, what brings you here?

1041
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:11,039
Hey, shit, come here. Have a drink.

1042
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:11,998
Yeah.

1043
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,751
Let's talk.

1044
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,589
What? Shit. Now?

1045
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,508
(inhales deeply)

1046
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,176
Get ready to lose when I come back.

1047
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,303
(grunts)

1048
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,014
(groans)

1049
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,557
(breathes heavily)

1050
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,851
Hey, what's up? What happened?

1051
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,186
(exhales deeply)

1052
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,272
I'm coming from the police station
because I'm under investigation.

1053
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,232
You? Why?

1054
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,025
Because of the guy who crushed your foot.

1055
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,568
Have they found that bastard?

1056
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,279
Nope.

1057
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,197
The bastard had one more run,

1058
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:45,991
but this time he tried to frame me for it.

1059
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,158
(chuckles)

1060
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,869
Are you under investigation because of it?

1061
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,539
We really should find
that bastard and kill him.

1062
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,999
Keep this to yourself.

1063
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,627
This is just something I noticed
while they were questioning me, but...

1064
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,421
I think the bastard is...

1065
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,093
Ji Sooheon.

1066
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,054
(scoffs)

1067
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,515
Ji Sooheon.

1068
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:12,934
That bastard?

1069
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,020
(foreboding music)

1070
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:20,734
(inhales deeply)

1071
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:26,698
(sighs)

1072
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:41,087
SOYEON: Who is it?

1073
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,797
-It's me, Sooheon.
-(door beeps)

1074
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,597
It's pretty late. What's up?

1075
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:52,932
(sighs lightly)

1076
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,602
(sighs deeply)

1077
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,272
AJUNG: What is it you want to tell me?

1078
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,565
Tell me.

1079
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,276
Hey, Soyeon.

1080
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,322
Let's do it one more time.

1081
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,825
Let's beat up those bastards

1082
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,619
and get paid for it.

1083
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,703
(sighs)

1084
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:18,708
Have you gone mad?

1085
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,003
Did you forget
that you're still a suspect?

1086
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,296
Are you serious?

1087
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,882
I need money, desperately.

1088
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:27,884
My mother

1089
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,929
is in the ICU now.

1090
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:35,558
She can't survive
without being on life support.

1091
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,478
(sighs deeply)

1092
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,482
Still, we can't do it.

1093
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,317
It's too dangerous.

1094
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:46,903
It will be okay.

1095
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:51,783
-Just one more time...
-You must be crazy!

1096
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,911
Get your head on straight.

1097
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:57,122
It seriously can't happen.

1098
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,540
(breathes heavily)

1099
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,833
Leave.

1100
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,835
Just leave
if you're going to say nonsense.

1101
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:03,711
I said get lost!

1102
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:04,754
Hey.

1103
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:05,922
Go.

1104
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,174
I told you.

1105
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,844
Hey, get out of here.

1106
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,973
PILSEUNG EXPRESS

1107
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,526
(gentle music)

1108
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:29,612
AJUNG: Hello.

1109
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:32,073
Do you remember me?

1110
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:33,867
Oh, of course. Of course.

1111
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,953
But hey, what brings you here?

1112
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,708
I have something to tell you.

1113
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:48,631
We'll do it.

1114
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:52,385
(Junggyeong groans)

1115
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,138
(groans)

1116
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,182
(breathes heavily)

1117
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:04,397
(grunts)

1118
00:58:05,982 --> 00:58:07,567
(sighs lightly)

1119
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,699
(sighs)

1120
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:16,868
(inhales deeply)

1121
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,286
(exhales deeply)

1122
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,580
(foreboding music)

1123
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,636
(exhales deeply)

1124
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,808
(ominous music)

1125
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,340
(closing theme music)
