(shaky breathing)

4
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:16,558
I didn't kill him.

5
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:17,934
I'm being honest.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,645
(shaky breathing)

7
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,355

(breathes deeply)

9
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,443
Hey, Chanmi.

10
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,694
What are you doing?

11
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,071
I think you're misunderstanding something.

12
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,115
You can take the bag to the police.

13
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:33,241
(inhales deeply)

14
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:34,743
It wasn't me.

15
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:35,994
I didn't kill him.

16
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:37,120

17
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:39,706

What do you think you're doing right now?

25
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,244
Have you gone mad?

26
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,329
Hey, explain this to me.
What are you trying to do?

27
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,664
Don't move!
(shaky breathing)

28
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,042
Hey, come on! Why are you doing this?!

29
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,754
Okay, fine.
With Sa Junggyeong, that was me.

30
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:30,256
I'm the one who crushed his foot.

31
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,635
But what does that have to do with you?

32
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,261
(sobs)

33
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,430
I didn't kill
that damn juvenile delinquent!

34
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,765
(whimpers)
Why did you kill...

35
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,061
my older brother?

36
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,609
What did you say?

37
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,402
(sobers)

38
00:01:51,486 --> 00:01:52,779
-You think I killed Wonseok?
-(sniffs)

39
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,198
Shut up! You bastard!
(sniffs)

40
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,324
There's evidence.

41
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,576
Why would I kill him, why?

42
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,662
You're the one
who should be answering that question.

43
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,871
Why did you?

44
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,873
(sobs)
Why did you kill him, why?

45
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,085
You demonic bastard.

46
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:11,548
How dare you smile at me
after killing my brother?

47
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,550
How dare you even talk to me?

48
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,969
(sobbing)
You deserve to die.

49
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:20,140
(breathing shakily)

50
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,352

-Please just stop!

(gasps)

54
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,035
If I'm the one that killed Wonseok,
then I'll kill myself.

55
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:43,163
(sobbing)

56
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:46,207
If you really believe that I killed him,

57
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,544
I'll go ahead and kill myself.

58
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,713
So tell me.

59
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,715
Did I kill him?

60
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:54,841
(cell phone vibrates)

61
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,427
Answer me!

62
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,221
Do you think I killed Wonseok?

JAEBUM: Osung.

89
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,859
Was I the one

90
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,153
who killed Park Wonseok?

91
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,239
(suspicious music continues)

92
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,666
Jaebum.

93
00:04:51,749 --> 00:04:53,334
Why would you have killed Park Wonseok?

94
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,128
It's just not true.
Why would you think that?

95
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,297
Jaebum, what did I tell you

96
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,424
when you brought that photo
of you and Park Wonseok to school?

97
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,050
Didn't I tell you?
You didn't even know Park Wonseok.

98
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,845
How could I not know him if we had taken
a polaroid picture like that

99
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:04,929
at this race track?

100
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,973
That's why I'm suspecting.

101
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:08,016
Maybe you're lying to me

102
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,684
because I did something bad
to Park Wonseok.

103
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,601
Jaebum.

104
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,105
How far back can you remember?

105
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,316
How far?

106
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,776
Is your memory
slowly coming back to you these days?

107
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,822
I think so.

108
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,449
Don't trust your memory, Jaebum.

109
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,201
You'll be in big trouble
if you do, seriously.

110
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:29,037
Your memories might not be real.

111
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,122
You never know
if it's just part of your imagination,

112
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,457
so don't trust your memories.

113
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,001
(sighs)
So are you saying

114
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,211
that it wasn't a suicide
and that it was in fact a car accident?

115
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,590
Where did it happen?
What kind of accident was it?

116
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,051
Was it a car collision? Was I jaywalking?

117
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,886
It's true that you were trying
to commit suicide.

118
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,472
You...

119
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,307
jumped.

120
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,643
Don't tell your parents
your memory came back.

121
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,270
It was actually your parents

122
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,898
who decided to tell you
that it was a car accident.

123
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,692
Where did I jump from?

124
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,402
From the building
of your parents' company nearby.

125
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,654
Why?

126
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,949
Do you know the reason why?

127
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,702
No, I don't.
I don't know why you tried to jump.

128
00:06:10,495 --> 00:06:11,662
There was no suicide note.

129
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,122

134
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,800
Is this a good thing or a bad thing?

135
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,927
This seems like a breakthrough.

136
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,428
Regarding what happened

137
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,806

169
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,445
And if the doctor asks me how I got hurt,
should I tell him I was shot?

170
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,906
Why don't you just tell them
you messed with some bullies on the street

171
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,033
and that's how this happened.

172
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,078
SELF PHOTO STUDIO
PLEASE TOUCH SCREEN

173
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,166
What are you doing?

174
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,086
It's not everyday you get shot
unless you're fighting in a war.

175
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,214
CASH

176
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,049
We have to commemorate this day
with a souvenir.

177
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:53,926
(groans)

178
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,136
PLEASE INSERT CASH

179
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,638
Hey, what are you doing?

180
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,390
-(camera shutter clicks)
-Damn it.

181
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,690

-(indistinct chatter)
-STUDENT 1: Good one.

185
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,600
STUDENT 2: That was so close.

186
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,685
-OSUNG: Hey, I'm heading out.
-STUDENT 1: Okay. Good job. Take care.

187
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,729
-Bye.
-Okay, see you next week.

188
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,857

SA JUNGGYEONG

193
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:03,579
(sighs)

194
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,750
Jaebum, sorry to keep you waiting.

195
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,377
Hey.

196
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,172
Why were you playing basketball
when you were supposed to meet with me?

197
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:14,799
(sighs lightly)
Sorry.

198
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:16,509
It's just that if I didn't join,
they wouldn't have been able to play.

199
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,968
It was three against three.

200
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,679
Then you could have called...

201
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,014
(sighs)

202
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:24,725
So, do you remember now?

203
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,227
Do you remember why you committed suicide?

204
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,354
(slurps)

205
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,689
(exhales deeply)

206
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,399
Can you really not remember?

207
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,484
Memories aren't something
you can bring back

208
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:35,361
just because you think hard and focus.

209
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,697
Well, maybe it will just pop up randomly?

210
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,908
With some sort of a triggering event
or a shock?

211
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,620
I did exactly
what you told me to do, Osung.

212
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,707
I went back to the office building
near the horse track,

213
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,377
but I couldn't remember anything at all.

214
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:56,215
I couldn't remember
why I had jumped from there.

215
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,008
By the way,

216
00:11:58,092 --> 00:12:00,469
how were you able to realize
that it wasn't a traffic accident

217
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,555
and that you had
actually attempted suicide?

218
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,058
I guess the feeling of floating mid-air?

219
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,856
For a very long time...

220
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,985
And that fear of falling.

221
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,865
That feeling resurfaced like a nightmare.

222
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,244
That's why I thought

223
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,955
maybe that's what had happened.

224
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,833
You haven't told your parents about this,
have you?

225
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,210
No.
(sighs lightly)

226
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,383
Osung.

227
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,470
Thank you.

228
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,932
You're the only one I can trust.

229
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,351
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

230
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,480
Come on, you're making me feel awkward.
You don't have to thank me.

231
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:54,648
(chuckles)

232
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,859
(sighs lightly)

233
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,653
You said...

234
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,240
you had something to show me concerning

235
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,242
what happened
between Park Wonseok and me, right?

236
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,590
Jaebum.

237
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,300
I have it here in my bag.

238
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,095
Are you prepared
to take whatever comes out of it?

239
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:26,305
(exhales deeply)

240
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,933
What do you mean? What is it?

241
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:31,560
(suspicious music)

242
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,861
This envelope...

243
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,863
The thing inside this envelope...

244
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,825
was once yours.

245
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,535
(paper rustles)

246
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:53,541
You asked me to hold onto this a few days
before you tried to commit suicide.

247
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,460
I asked you to hold onto this for me?

248
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,754
You told me not to open it
under any circumstances.

249
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,965
But after you jumped,

250
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:03,092
you lost consciousness
and weren't waking up.

251
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,678
So I opened it.

252
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,930
I feel really bad about that.

253
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:10,641
(suspenseful music)

254
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,883
So, Jaebum,

255
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,303
that's why I told you

256
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,180
not to mention Park Wonseok to anyone.

257
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,558
(suspenseful music continues)

258
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,831
What are you going to do now?

259
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,416
Well, the last train has left by now.

260
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,585
I'll have to catch the train
early tomorrow morning

261
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,753
and head back to Seoul.

262
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,464
That's not what I meant.

263
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,883
I mean, what are you going to do
about the body shop murder?

264
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,510
You've been framed as the suspect.

265
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:29,970
(inhales deeply)

266
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:33,515
Well, I'm not actually being framed,
I'm just a suspect.

267
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:35,809
What do you call it, a person of interest?

268
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,102
(exhales deeply)

269
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:40,731
Had it not been for you,
I'd be in jail by now.

270
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,027
I would've been investigated
as the suspect for a murder case.

271
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,529
All we can do is hope
that the real culprit will be caught.

272
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,240
By the way, how did you know?

273
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,534
That the police were looking
for the backpack?

274
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,665
Gi Osung told me.

275
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,333
Gi Osung?

276
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,343
Gi Osung.

277
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,055
I heard you manipulated Park Wonseok
after learning about his weaknesses.

278
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,933
I'm here because I wanted
to hear you elaborate on that.

279
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,644
Is that why you've been waiting
for me in front of my house?

280
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,563
Do you really need to bring up the past?
Wonseok isn't here with us anymore.

281
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,525
I need to find the person
who killed my older brother.

282
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,610
How is the fact
that I manipulated Park Wonseok

283
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,904
related to his murder?

284
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,948
That's why I'm asking you to explain.

285
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,408
(scoffs)

286
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,702
Do you think I'm the one who killed him?

287
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,747
Before I actually catch the killer,

288
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,500
everyone is a suspect in my eyes.

289
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,168
The police are tracking down
the suspect now.

290
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:44,712
What?

291
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,338
When I went to visit my father
at the police station,

292
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,673
I came across this information
by accident.

293
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,759
(inhales deeply)
Several days ago, there was a murder.

294
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,761
And the police think that the suspect

295
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:55,597
is the same one who was behind
the dark room assault at our school.

296
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,099
They say it's highly likely

297
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,809
that it's the same person
behind Park Wonseok's case.

298
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,144
They're about to catch the suspect.

299
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,731
What do you mean
they're about to catch the suspect?

300
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,982
It seems they spotted him
on some surveillance footage

301
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,775
at the scene of the crime a few days ago.

302
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,652
I watched the surveillance myself.

303
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,571
So...

304
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,491
I guess they've identified the suspect.

305
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:15,868
Just his back.

306
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,412
All they have is a photo of him
wearing a backpack.

307
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,914
They said it won't take long
before they catch him.

308
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:23,834

00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,816
Because if you had been caught,

324
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,735
from that point on, I wouldn't have had
the chance to confront you directly.

I wouldn't have been able to ask you
why you did it.

I also wouldn't have been able to...

329
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,872
So I thought it'd be better
not to let the police catch you,

330
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,335
until I had the chance
to catch you myself.

331
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,295
I did almost die at your hands.

332
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,588
(chuckles)
If you hadn't received that call...

333
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,842
Hey, how can you laugh
and joke about what happened?

334
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,344
(inhales deeply)

335
00:18:57,427 --> 00:19:00,347
Life and death is not a big deal.

336
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,558
There's only a small difference
between the two.

337
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,601
Now's not the time for such talk.

338
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,311
Looking ahead...

339
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:10,232
Death isn't what's waiting
for us after life.

340
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:14,695
It's more like life and death
are running along parallel tracks.

341
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,408
You can die just by slightly veering
to the other side.

342
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:22,077
Come on, stop being weird.

343
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,704
Why would you have
any reason to talk about death?

344
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,417
You do realize that I was almost shot
to death today, right?

345
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,461
Damn, come on.

346
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,425
What I mean is, we have to keep on living.

347
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,470
Even when you reach the brink of death,
if you're able to surpass that moment,

348
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,890
your life will continue to go on.

349
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,727
We should do whatever we can to survive.

350
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:51,356
That's the only responsibility
we have in life.

351
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,151
What you're saying sounds right,
but you're getting on my nerves.

352
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,319
(soft chuckles)

353
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,779
Sorry.

354
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,495
(sighs deeply)

355
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,123
The person that called earlier...

356
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,169
They must be the culprit, right?

357
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,173
That must have been the culprit.

358
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,927
That person must have picked up
my brother's phone

359
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,178
after pushing him out the window.

360
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,388
Why would they turn on the cell phone?

361
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,183
They should know
that it can be tracked down.

362
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,019
Why did they call me with his cell phone?

363
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,647
They must've been keeping
an eye on me, right?

364
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:35,192
Do you think they were just
trying to mess around with me?

365
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,902
Are they trying to have fun with this?

366
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,571
(sighs)

367
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,114
That son of a bitch.

368
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,701
What are you going to do about the police?

369
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,037
Are you going to tell them

370
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,705
you got a phone call
from Wonseok's cell phone?

371
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,957
No.

372
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,794
(cell phone trilling)

373
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,924
AUTOMATED VOICE (on cell phone):
<i>The person you dialed cannot be reached...</i>

374
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,592
CALL ENDED
JI SOOHEON

375
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,679
(cell phone trilling)

376
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,767
AUTOMATED VOICE (on cell phone):
<i>The person you dialed cannot be reached.</i>

377
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,061
<i>-Please record the message after the tone.</i>
-AJUNG: Soyeon.

378
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:13,272
Hey, why are you so startled?

379
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,650
You have such a loud voice.
How could I not be startled?

380
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,528
I was going to introduce
you guys formally,

381
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,946
but I guess this is how it goes.

382
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,489
This is my boyfriend.

383
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,074
Why don't you say hello?

384
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,576
-It's nice to meet you, I'm...
-Aren't you Bang Wootak?

385
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,079
-Oh my, what? How did you know?
-(laughs awkwardly)

386
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,958
-He's completely disguised.
-You can just tell he's an idol star.

387
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,838
It's nice to finally meet you.

388
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:40,173
I've heard a lot about you from Ajung.

389
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,051
Come to think of it, you don't strike me
so much as an idol star.

390
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,219
You're giving me more daddy vibes.

391
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,137
(laughs awkwardly)

392
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,722
Hey, Soyeon, do you really need
to embarrass him like that?

393
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,931
You barely just met.

394
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:51,018
In any case, if you do so much
as scratch Ajung, you better watch out.

395
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,060
(sighs)

396
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:55,147
I'll make sure you never work
in the entertainment industry ever again.

397
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,148
(scoffs)

398
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,233
(laughs awkwardly)
I don't know why she's being this way.

399
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,484
I don't know why she's so mad.

400
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,610
Don't worry.

401
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,154
After my contract expires this fall,

402
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,239
I'm going to retire
and fulfill my military service.

403
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,117
Then we'll live together
as a happy family. Just the three of us.

404
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,369
You can say all you want now, but...

405
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,164
regardless, you'll be forced to retire
if you ever go back on your word.

406
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,373
-You can take my word for it.
-(both laugh awkwardly)

407
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,208
I don't know what's gotten into her.

408
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:18,295
Soyeon, I hope you'll continue
to look out for Ajung

409
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,005
with the same loyalty you have
for her now.

410
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,049
I'm never going to change.

411
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,176
(scoffs)

412
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,803
-Oh no, what to do...
-Oh, my cutie pie.

413
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,140
Ah, she must be emotional
from all the hormones.

414
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,476
-Are you okay?
-I'm just so touched.

415
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,685
-(sighs)
-You're so silly.

416
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:37,272
WOOTAK: Don't cry, okay, sweetie?

417
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,191
(door beeps)

418
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,200
Did you say your parents went down south?

419
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:51,495
Yeah, they'll be away
for a while for work.

420
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,623
In that case, maybe I'll stay here
for a while doing prenatal care.

421
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,458
Fine.

422
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:01,713
You must be tired
from your date today. Rest up.

423
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:03,715
Hey, Soyeon.

424
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,634
I just thought of this, but...

425
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,095
wouldn't it be fun if the four of us
went out on a double date?

426
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,888
What are you talking about?
I don't have a boyfriend.

427
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,060
You have Ji Sooheon. Just grab him
by the collar and drag him along.

428
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,186
Are you out of your mind?

429
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,480
It's time you already started dating.

430
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,857
It's obvious you have feelings for him,
so just bring him along.

431
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,652
He'll be excited about it as well.

432
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,570
If I were to cuss you out
in a five-minute rap battle,

433
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,656
that wouldn't be good
for your prenatal care, would it?

434
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,449
You punk. I'm going to take a shower.

435
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:33,245
I already know you've been worried
for the past few days.

436
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,498
-I know it's because of Ji Sooheon.
-Shut the heck up.

437
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,131
(sighs lightly)

438
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:48,718
CLEAN, HYGIENIC LAUNDROMAT 24/7

439
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:54,891
(inhales deeply)

440
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,393
(sighs)

441
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,894
What are you going to do now?

442
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,940
Well, I guess
it will all work out somehow.

443
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,777
What do you mean it will all work out?
You're being framed as a murder suspect.

444
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,697
There's nothing I can do about it.

445
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,533
Plus, I did commit a crime.

446
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,578
What you did wasn't a crime.

447
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,746
It was.

448
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,957
I assaulted someone.

449
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:24,963
I wasn't planning to be a hero,
or whatever everyone else was calling it.

450
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:26,840
No.

451
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,343
I'm no hero.

452
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,847
I just needed the money.

453
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,017
Money to pay for my mom's medical bills.

454
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,605
Don't be so hard on yourself.
You don't need to do that.

455
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,357
You did the right thing.

456
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,942
(sighs deeply)

457
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,152
(soft laughs)

458
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:49,905
How did I end up like this?

459
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:50,864
(inhales deeply)

460
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,324
If you were to ask me yesterday,

461
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,242
I could never have imagined

462
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,785
that I'd be sitting
in a laundromat in Busan.

463
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:57,621
The same goes for me.

464
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,372
(sighs deeply)

465
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,876
When you make a snowman,

466
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,171
first you insert a stone
to form a snowball.

467
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,758
That's me.

468
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,260
I'm the stone.

469
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,307
I feel like someone inserted me
into a snowball,

470
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,477
and that I'm just being rolled
into something bigger.

471
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:25,357
The more it rolls, the bigger it gets.

472
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:30,445
To the point where it's too big for me
to get myself out of it.

473
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,823
A snowball
that's gotten too big to escape.

474
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,451
What you're saying sounds right,
but you're getting on my nerves.

475
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,620
(scoffs)
I'm sorry, okay?

476
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,793
I heard a phone ringing.

477
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:46,753
What?

478
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,713
When the culprit called me.

479
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,009
CHANMI (on cell phone): <i>Hello.</i>

480
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,344
CALL_RECORDING_OK_CHANKYU_00_16_25

481
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:58,014
CHANMI (breathes rapidly on cell phone):
<i>Hello?</i>

482
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,684
<i>Who is this?</i>

483
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,562
<i>-Why do you have Wonseok's cell phone?</i>

00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,028
What's with that guy? What's going on?

509
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,989
It's nothing. He's just a detective.

510
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,658
Detective? For Park Wonseok's case?

511
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,869
Oh, right.
There's Sa Junggyeong's case too.

512
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:09,247
-Is he here to catch the suspect?
-Don't stare at him so much. Let's go.

513
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,375
Hey, watch it! You're dealing
with a pregnant woman, okay?

514
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,710
You crazy...

515
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,385
(rattles)

516
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,312
Oh, may I help you with anything?

517
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:33,521
Oh.

518
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,317
I'm a detective
at the Yongtan Police Station.

519
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:41,863
Ji Sooheon parks his bike here
when he comes to school, right?

520
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,239
That's right. Why do you ask?

521
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,742
He was absent yesterday
and didn't come back home.

522
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:46,910
And he's not at school yet.

523
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,578
Oh, Sooheon's phone's been off.

524
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,038
What's going on?

525
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,540
That's what we're eager
to find out as well.

526
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:53,458
(inhales sharply)

527
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,752
Do you know where we might find Sooheon?

528
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,379
It seems he hasn't been at the gym either.

529
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,058
Oh, okay.

530
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,352
Hey, Chanmi, have you seen Sooheon?

531
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,145
Why can't I reach him?

532
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,522
Uh...

533
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,703
It seems you've become quite friendly
with Sooheon.

534
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,705
We're in the same class.

535
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,458
When did you start living
on the rooftop above the gym?

536
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,418
Am I not allowed to be living up there?

537
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,255
You sound a bit emotional today.

538
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,841
(sighs)

539
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,343
Are you making any progress
tracking down your brother's murderer?

540
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:46,511
(scoffs)

541
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,471
Are you being sarcastic?

542
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,722
(scoffs)

543
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:52,308
That was scary.
I don't know how to respond to that.

544
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:54,644
I need to go to school.

545
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,230
The police are the ones
who catch criminals.

546
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,357
If you know of anything,
or find anything suspicious,

547
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,650
come to the police.

548
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:04,237
That's the fastest way
we'll catch the killer.

549
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,238
Okay.

550
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,073
If the police had done a better job,

551
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,950
we'd probably be
in a better situation by now.

552
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:11,953
Good luck.

553
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:19,586
I don't think it's a good idea for you
to stay so close to Ji Sooheon.

554
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,051
(sighs)

555
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:39,564
If I don't show up again
for the next couple of days,

556
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,733
could you take care of him for me?

557
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,319
(light music)

558
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,945
(meows)

559
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,407
(sighs)

560
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,756
All rise. Bow.

561
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,466
ALL: Good morning.

562
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,259
(sighs)

563
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,345
Seok Jaebum is absent today again.

564
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,180
Is he sick?

565
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,391
-Osung, can you check on how he's doing?
-Yes, sir.

566
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:19,270
All right.
There are still police officers on campus.

567
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,231
Let me give you all another warning.

568
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:26,027
Don't make up any fake news,
and don't spread any rumors.

569
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,280
Anyways, all of us in class 4,
let's not get distracted.

570
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:32,450
Let's all have a good day today, yeah!

571
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,493
STUDENTS: Yes, sir.

572
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,411
-Let's do this!
-STUDENT: Yes, sir.

573
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:41,542
Wow, even a third-generation
multimillionaire is cutting school, huh?

574
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,462
People are all the same.

575
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,339
Isn't that right?

576
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,092
Hey, are you ignoring me?

577
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,387
(sighs deeply)

578
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,311
Ok Chanmi,
your suspension is finally over.

579
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,522
Mind your manners and stay on track.

580
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,523
Yes, sir.

581
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,234
And where did Ji Sooheon go?
His cell phone is off.

582
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,360
Does anyone want to volunteer
to check up on him?

583
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:08,569
-Kook Jihyun does.
-Kook Jihyun does.

584
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,488
Good. Jihyun, please check on him.

585
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,656
-(laughs lightly)
-Yes, sir.

586
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,783
When will Ji Sooheon grow up?

587
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,036
Now, you are the most
valuable person in your world.

588
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,830
And the only way
to take care of yourselves

589
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,958
is to study, you guys! That's it!

590
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,837
(indistinct chatter)

591
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,592
(sighs lightly)

592
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,351
Congratulations on making it through
your suspension.

593
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,812
Why don't we try to get along
until we graduate?

594
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,648
It'll be great.
It'll be just like living in hell.

595
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,151
You might want to leave, but you can't

596
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:50,778
because you need to find
your brother's killer.

597
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,739
Hellish

598
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,699
school days.

599
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:55,950
(sighs)

600
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,771
While you were unlocking
Ji Sooheon's locker at the gym,

601
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,981
I had just arrived at the gym.

602
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,025
(breathes quickly)

603
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,193
(gasps)

604
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:34,989
JONGGUK: <i>That's when I saw Ok Chanmi
running down the stairs in a hurry.</i>

605
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,870
So what you're saying is that Ok Chanmi
took Ji Sooheon's backpack?

606
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,247
She helped the suspect,

607
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,833
who might've killed her brother,
hide his evidence?

608
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:48,044
That's the question on my mind as well.

609
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,213
How could she have known Ji Sooheon
was our suspect?

610
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,173
And how could she have known

611
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:54,842
that the backpack
was the major piece of evidence?

612
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,930
Most importantly, how could she have known
the police were on their way?

613
00:34:59,013 --> 00:34:59,931
(breathes heavily)

614
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:01,808
How could she have opened
Ji Sooheon's locker?

615
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:02,975
I...

616
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,103
I also think that doesn't add up.

617
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,271
But that backpack seems weird.

618
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,273
There's something weird about it.
Especially at night.

619
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:10,525
(sighs)

620
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,947

Why is Chanmi here?

634
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,497
Osung, I'm sorry.

635
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,374
I know this has been a burden for you.

636
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,170
Not at all, ma'am.
Our teacher and I were just concerned.

637
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:55,129
(sighs)

638
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,715
Is Jaebum not answering your calls either?

639
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,884
No.

640
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,969
I think of you as my second son.

641
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:07,433
That's why I trust you and why I'm asking
for your help with this.

642
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,143
Oh, it's my pleasure, ma'am.

643
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,437
I also think of Jaebum
as a brother of mine.

644
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,440
Thank you.

00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,197
It seems his memories
are slowly coming back to him.

646
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,448
Right.

647
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:25,451
The last time,
he called me from the stables at night.

648
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,912
He was asking me where he was
and he told me he was scared.

649
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,914
I wonder if that's when it started.

650
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,457
What did he tell you?

651
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,918
He didn't say anything in particular.

652
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:38,422
But after that call, I installed
a tracking app on his cell phone.

653
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:40,341
That's what he asked me to do.

654
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,509
Because he said himself
that he wasn't sure

655
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,302
-what kind of places he might go to.
-Then...

656
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,222
Could you check where Jaebum is right now?

657
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:52,937
(sighs lightly)

658
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,105
(cell phone beeps)

659
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,445
SEOK JAEBUM NEW MESSAGE

660
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,613
(sighs)

661
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,449
JAEBUM: <i>Chanmi, are you free right now?</i>

662
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:06,492
(sighs)

663
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:09,078
CHANMI: <i>Yeah, sure. What's up?</i>

664
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,663
<i>You weren't at school.</i>

665
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,665
JAEBUM: <i>I came out for a walk
because I was feeling stuffy.</i>

666
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,667
<i>Where should I meet you?</i>

667
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,797
CHANMI: <i>How about the intersection
by Lucky Mall?</i>

668
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,090
JAEBUM: <i>Okay.</i>

669
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,510

THE LIFE AHEAD
LA VIE DEVANT SOI

673
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,643

674
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:33,871
(sighs lightly)

675
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,874
Hey, isn't that man the detective?

676
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,543
(exhales deeply)

677
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,338
Tae Soyeon, do you recognize me?

678
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,007
I'm from the Special Victims Unit
at Yongtan Police Station.

679
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,967
Yes, I do.
(inhales deeply)

680
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,344
How can I help you?

681
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:50,304
When we looked up your phone record,

682
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,430
we found that you were the one

683
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,641
who called
and messaged Ji Sooheon the most.

684
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,476
And what's wrong with that?

685
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:56,602
Ji Sooheon.

686
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,188
-Do you know where he is right now?
-(scoffs)

687
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,148
How would I know that?

688
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,650
Do you have a warrant, sir?

689
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:04,151
You can ask simple questions
without a warrant.

690
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,278
So I guess we're not obligated
to answer simple questions, right?

691
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:08,864
(sighs)

692
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:11,534
Can you relay this message
to Ji Sooheon for me?

693
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,577
Hiding isn't always the best option.

694
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,039
If he helps us with the investigation,
his compliance will be taken into account.

695
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,541
So tell him to come out of hiding.

696
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:20,251
Investigation? Take that into account?

697
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,378
What is he talking about?

698
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,379
What's going on?

699
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,505
Mr. detective.

700
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,633
I have no idea
what Sooheon's being investigated for.

701
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,177
So please don't come at me
if you don't have a warrant.

702
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,596
Who do you think you are?
Showing up out of nowhere?

703
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,848
Come on, let's go.

704
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:37,309
-What was that all about?
-I don't know.

705
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,686
-What is this about?
-What? I don't know...

706
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,895
What?

707
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,940
-AJUNG: Hurry up.
-SOYEON: I'm hungry too.

708
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,400
(sighs)

709
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:48,779
What? Are you saying Ji Sooheon
was the hero that beat up Sa Junggyeong?

710
00:40:49,905 --> 00:40:52,450
Wow, that's crazy awesome!

711
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,243
Ji Sooheon, seriously.

712
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,162
Oh, and the juvenile delinquent
from your middle school.

713
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,872
The one we met at the OBGYN clinic.

714
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,206
That bastard...

715
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,126
What's wrong with him?

716
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,003
Sooheon also beat up
that juvenile delinquent.

717
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,463
That's amazing.

718
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,381
(sighs)
He really is a true hero, isn't he?

719
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:10,050
Wow, seriously.
(exhales deeply)

720
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,344
-This is crazy.
-The juvenile delinquent...

721
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,388
is dead.

722
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:16,932
What?

723
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,851
Dead?

724
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,941
(gulping)

725
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,111
(exhales deeply)

726
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,037
Ajung.

727
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,956
I'm really sorry to ask you
to do this, but...

728
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,209
if a detective asks you
about the juvenile delinquent,

729
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,418
just say you don't know him.

730
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,337
Are you saying the police
will come after me too?

731
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,006
The detective saw your face
just a few minutes ago.

732
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,467
When he plays
the surveillance footage at the clinic,

733
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,676
he's going to recognize

734
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,762
your face.

735
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,389
I can just say I don't know him,
and that'll be it.

736
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,141
(breathes deeply)
But what's Sooheon going to do?

737
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,809
Sooheon didn't kill him.

738
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,145
Of course not.

739
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,730
He's not that type of person.

740
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,608

Ji Sooheon?

749
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,766
Ji Sooheon lives here?

750

(laughs)

751
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:46,480
What's going on? Are all the people
ditching class all gathered here?

752
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,898
That's cute. Real cute.

753
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:49,400
Are you here to see Ji Sooheon?

754
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,151
Yeah, the homeroom teacher told me
to check up on him

755
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,528

Is Ok Chanmi in there?

00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,279
No, she's not.

764
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:36,780
Ok Chanmi?

765
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,282
Isn't this place Ji Sooheon's?

766
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,909
Why are Ok Chanmi's clothes here?

767
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,536
Is she living with Ji Sooheon?

768
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:45,164
No, it doesn't seem like
they're living together.

769
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,290
Is Ji Sooheon inside?

770
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,291
No, he's not.

771
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:48,709
Then what were you doing inside?

772
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,628
I thought this was Ji Sooheon's place.

773
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:54,340
So Ok Chanmi is living here, right?

774
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:55,799
I think so.

775

778
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,357
She told me your location.

00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,700
Ok Chanmi has seduced Ji Sooheon

807
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,869
and they're living together
on his rooftop.

808
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:51,039
Wow, this bitch is so much
more than I'd expected.

809
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:57,004
What? Isn't this Ok Chanmi's scooter?

810
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,093
What?

811
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,846

815
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,203
CHANMI (on cell phone): <i>Hello?</i>

816
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,622
<i>Who are you?</i>

817
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,666
<i>-Why do you have Wonseok's cell phone?</i>
-(buzzing over cell phone)

I think you'll be able to leave tomorrow.

824
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,494
(soft laughs)
Thank you.

825
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:12,496
Your test results don't indicate
that you've gotten any better,

826
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:13,997
but you haven't gotten worse either.

827
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,875
All we can do is leave it in God's hands.

828
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:18,627
Yes, sir.

829
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,505
That's what you told me last time, too.

830
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:24,508
Don't worry about the hospital bill.
You need to come to the hospital.

831
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:27,094
There are lots of good people
in this world.

832
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,679
There are a lot of organizations
that make charitable donations.

833
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,389
I'll help you secure a donation
for your bills.

834
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:31,807
Thank you, sir.

835
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,184
Also...
(inhales deeply)

836
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:35,727
Here.

837
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,189
No matter what it is,
give me a call on my cell phone.

838
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,691
I'd be happy to hear from you.

Okay.

842
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:47,406
How is that wound on your shoulder?

843
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,492
It's much better now.

844
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,870
Why would you pick a fight on the street?

845

Get out of way! Uh, I'm sorry.

HYEONJONG:
Did you say the brake wasn't working?

865
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,958
Yes, sir. It didn't seem to work at all.

866
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,501
Did something break?

867
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:24,086
Chanmi.

868
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:26,463
This isn't broken.

869
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,715
It looks like
someone cut it intentionally.

870
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,050
What?

871
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,636
There's no way
the brake could've broken from wear.

872
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,554
This part here looks like an even cut.

873
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,431
Someone cut this with a knife.

874
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:39,685
Do you mean someone cut it on purpose?

875
00:49:39,768 --> 00:49:42,646
Wow, this could have killed you.

876
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,564
(tongue clicks)
This is outrageous!

877
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,774
(sighs deeply)

878
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:49,486
Hey, Chanmi, might there be anyone
who'd try to hurt you?

879
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:56,618
(indistinct chatter)

880
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:03,250
Listen up, you murderer!

881
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,086
I'm doing just fine!

882
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:09,548
Keep on trying with your bullshit,
you crazy bastard!

883
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,342
You can't kill me. Ever!

884
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,136
I won't die.

885
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:17,222
Instead, I'll track you down.

886
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,223
(Chanmi scoffs)

887
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:19,599
She's really gone mad.

888
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,101
Are you afraid?

889
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:24,855
Come at me, come at me now.
You crazy piece of shit!

890
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:27,190
Stop hiding with your bullshit.
Come out, I said!

891
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:28,817
I'll make sure I kick your ass. Come out!

892
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,194
-Hey, stop it, I said. Stop! Shit!
-Why? Let me go!

You should see a doctor
about your knee and wrist pain.

898
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,642
You might have after-effects,
so make sure you go see a doctor.

899
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,102
I will. Thank you.

Yeah, I'm fine.

903
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,656
Do you want us to take you
to the hospital?

904
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,742
(chuckles)
No, I'll be fine.

905
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,411
I'm just going to head home
and get some rest.

906
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,038

910
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,051
What?

911
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,095
What do you mean?

912
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,805
I mean, how do you know that?

913
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,973
Oh, because Park Wonseok's birthday
reminder has been popping up

914
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,934
on my messaging app since 3 days ago.

915
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,228
Oh.

916
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,355
They were twins, right?

Hey, sweetie?

Oh, honey!

932
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,481
Didn't we say we were going to meet
at the main entrance?

933
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,400
Well, you know, it's been a while
since I've been in your office,

934
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:16,610
so I thought I'd pop in.

935
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:17,944
I thought you hated hospitals.

936
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,112
It's not that I wanted
to visit the hospital.

937
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,822
I just wanted to see the room
where you work.

938
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:24,993
Detectives and doctors have dull offices,
don't you think?

939
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,870
Um-hm. I guess we're pretty dull
as people too.

940
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,246
(laughs)
I can't argue with that.

941
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:29,247
Um...

942
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,290
So where are you going to take me
for lunch?

943
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:31,583
I'm not going to eat vegan food.

944
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,210
-Okay. Right.
-(knocking)

945
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,294
Please come in.

946
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:39,049
Oh, hey, Sooheon,
are you heading home now?

947
00:53:39,132 --> 00:53:40,383
Yes, Doctor.

948
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,937
(sighs)

949
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:54,648
(slurps)

950
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:03,406
You've been in the hospital all this time?

951
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:05,659
Yes.

952
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,620
Why didn't you keep your phone on?
Your friends were worried about you.

953
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,831
I didn't want to tell them
I was in the hospital...

954
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,167
Ah.

955
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,545
Well, I guess I jumped to conclusions.

956
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:18,505
(inhales deeply)

957
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,423
And it goes without saying

958
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:23,134
that I won't tell anyone
about your illness.

959
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:28,014
If you're uncomfortable
talking about this,

960
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,474
of course you're free to leave.

961
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:32,727
No, it's fine.

962
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:35,814
(inhales deeply)

963
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,065
(sighs)

964
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:40,026
I'm sure we'll run into each other again,

965
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:44,030
but I'll pretend I never saw you
at the hospital.

966
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,323
(tongue clicks)

967
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,659
You're a detective.
You need to do your job.

968
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:51,663
Just like the doctor did his job
as a doctor.

969
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,960
This is kind of an odd thing
for me to say,

970
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:00,630
but, Sooheon, you're very mature.

971
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,718
I know it's also an odd thing
for me to say,

972
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:06,845
but, Detective,

973
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,556
I think you've married a great person.

974
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,309
My husband?

975
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:13,727
Yes.

976
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:18,106
I think Dr. Jeon is a really nice person.

977
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,609
(inhales deeply)

978
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:26,197
I never tell my husband
about my investigations.

979
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:31,494
So don't be stressed
about meeting my husband at the hospital.

980
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,829
Just focus on your treatment.

981
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,414
Yes.

982
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,082
Thank you.

983
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:38,543
(inhales deeply)

984
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:43,006
But I guess I don't have to say
I'm innocent while I'm here, do I?

985
00:55:43,923 --> 00:55:46,801
No, that's not something
we need to talk about right now.

986
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:48,845
(inhales deeply)

987
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,764
If it's okay with you,
I'll be heading out now.

988
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:54,434
As far as I know,
we never met at the hospital.

989
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,862
(sighs deeply)

990
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,250
THE LIFE AHEAD
LA VIE DEVANT SOI

991
00:56:19,334 --> 00:56:20,251
(gasps)

992
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,879
Where did the photo go?

993
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,508
(sighs)
I put it in this book.

994
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:27,759
(groans)

995
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:31,763
(knocking)

996
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:33,848
I guess the repair man is here
to replace the glass.

997
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:36,643
Yes, I'll be right there!

998
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,193
(light music)

999
00:56:56,955 --> 00:57:00,542
What happened to the door?
And to your forehead?

1000
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:02,752
(breathes deeply)

1001
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:06,798
You're alive?

1002
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:08,842
What happened to you?

1003
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,386
What happened?

1004
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:12,971
I fell while riding my scooter.

1005
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,265
The glass was broken
because someone broke in.

1006
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,350
You should've been more careful.

1007
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,061
Was something stolen?

1008
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,229
Nothing.

1009
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,314
There's nothing worth taking.

1010
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,858
I guess it's all cool then.

1011
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,695
-What happened to you?
-Me? I'm a suspect.

1012
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,238
That's why I went silent.
To go into hiding.

1013
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:32,532
And you had your cell phone turned off
because you were hiding?

1014
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,868
-Right.
-(scoffs)

1015
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,870
I just turned my cell phone on
and saw that you called.

1016
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:38,246
Twenty-nine times.

1017
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,039
Yeah.

1018
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,084
Twenty-nine missed calls.

1019
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,086
So now, do you understand how upset I was?

1020
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,546
(laughs)

1021
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:47,714
Sorry.

1022
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:51,509
Well, it's not something
you need to apologize for.

1023
00:57:53,052 --> 00:57:55,054
I also dealt with a lot of stress

1024
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,598
while I was alone
with my phone turned off.

1025
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:58,975
I'm sure you were.

1026
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,186
(inhales deeply)

1027
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,855
Hey, why don't we go
and relieve some stress together today?

1028
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:06,024
(both chuckle lightly)

1029
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,193
That's not a bad idea.

1030
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:09,777
Cool.

1031
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,738
-You're a pretty good singer.
-I thought you were way better.

1032
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:12,864
(laughs)

1033
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:21,289
(all cheer)

1034
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,250
(laughs)

1035
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:28,922
(singing)
<i>♪ Congratulations, congratulations ♪</i>

1036
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:32,967
<i>♪ We congratulate you on your birthday ♪</i>

1037
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:35,345
(all cheer)

1038
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,138
What are you waiting for?
The candles are melting.

1039
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:38,139
Ah, okay.

1040
00:58:38,973 --> 00:58:40,099
(blows candle)

1041
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,727
(all cheer)

1042
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,646
Hey, how did you know
to put all of this together?

1043
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:45,855
How did you know it was my birthday?

1044
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,316
I knew Wonseok's birthday,

1045
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:51,027
So I and Soyeon planned to throw you
a birthday party and put it all together.

1046
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:54,447
Sooheon turned on his cell phone
just in time.

1047
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:58,034
Well since he had tons of missed calls,
I'm assuming he felt guilty and called me?

1048
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:02,372
I also happened to call him a lot,
and he called me back too.

1049
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,624
AJUNG: Why don't we create a club?
A missed calls club?

1050
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,501
JAEBUM: Cool! I'm all for it.

1051
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:07,710
-AJUNG: Sounds good, yeah?
-JAEBUM: Yes.

1052
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,171
-"Missed Calls" sounds cool.
-(Ajung laughs)

1053
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,881
JAEBUM: If it's a missed calls club,

1054
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,092
would anyone even show up
when we called them up?

1055
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,301
SOOHEON: I'll show up.

1056
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,219
(Chanmi gasps)

1057
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:17,804
-(all laugh)
-JAEBUM: What?

1058
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,056
(all continue laughing)

1059
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,725
(all cheer)

1060
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:23,893
AJUNG: You're cute, Soyeon.

1061
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,979
(all continue cheering)

1062
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,105
Yes, ma'am.

1063
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:30,191
I followed the map you sent me.

1064
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,152
It seems like Jaebum is here.

1065
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,029
Yes.

1066
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:39,200
I'll persuade him to come back home today.

1067
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:41,244
Don't worry too much.

1068
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:43,121
Yes.

1069
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:55,842
HIGH TEEN KARAOKE

1070
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,386
(indistinct singing)

1071
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:59,512
Huh.

1072
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:00,930
This guy's getting weird.

1073
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:02,473
Why is he at a karaoke?

1074
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,433
(sighs)

1075
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:06,894
Huh?

1076
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,273
Isn't that Ok Chanmi?

1077
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:13,901
-AJUNG: It's all over my face!
-JAEBUM: Uh, you...

1078
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,737
Hey, Chanmi doesn't know about this,
does she?

1079
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:16,821
AJUNG: Huh?

1080
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,784
Here.

1081
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:25,163
HAPPY 19th BIRTHDAY

1082
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:26,581
Gi Osung?

1083
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:28,499
Osung.

1084
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:31,169
-Are you here for me?
-Yeah.

1085
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,962
Are you guys celebrating
Ok Chanmi's birthday here?

1086
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,547
Yeah, I guess you must have run into her.

1087
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:35,590
I saw that she was on her way
to the bathroom

1088
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:36,799
with a bunch of cream on her face.

1089
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,343
(both chuckle)

1090
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,386
Why don't you stay and celebrate with us
since you're already here?

1091
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,596
Yeah, come join us.

1092
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,598
It's fine, I wasn't invited anyway.

1093
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,267
Jaebum, I'll be waiting for you
in the café out front.

1094
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,727
Okay, then.

1095
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,854
(cell phone ringing)

1096
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:00,698
Bye.

1097
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,116
See you.

1098
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,035
(ominous music)

1099
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:16,047
(closing theme music)
