00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,100
Young Miss.

5
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,780
I don't know what happened to me earlier,

6
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,220
and ended up pushing her down.

7
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,820
Will we be okay?

8
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,630
I don't know.

9
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,780
I'm sorry, Young Miss.

10
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,400
By the way,

11
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,530
Lü He.

12
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,750
Where is the person who saved me earlier?

13
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,780
We couldn't find him.

14
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,640
I only remember he shouted "Miss Fairy",

15
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,830
before jumping down to save you.

16
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,140
Your Highness.

17
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,660
Actually now,

18
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,060
General Lu has sent Young Mistress Song

19
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,620
back to her home.

20
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,390
So you...

21
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,820
don't have to worry anymore.

22
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,130
Actually earlier,

23
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,820
I stopped you from diving into the water

24
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:46,070
because I was thinking of your health.

25
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,100
Moreover,

26
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,660
in front of His Majesty,

27
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,100
you should not be improper in any sense,

28
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,170
Your Highness.

29
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:03,250
I know my limits.

30
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,330
Yes.

31
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,580
Cui Bi.

32
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,860
Young Master Lu.

33
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,320
How is Xiangyun?

34
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,029
She's awake now.

35
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,339
My goodness.

36
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,090
Since I've ruined

37
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,300
Immortal Chu Kong's innocence,

38
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,870
how will I still be allowed to live?

39
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,460
Xiangyun.

40
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,220
Are you okay?

41
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:34,220
Did you catch a cold?

42
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,230
She's not even breathing.

43
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,820
In this case,

44
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:53,020
I guess I'll need to give her two more breaths of energy to...

45
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:54,700
Lu Changkong.

46
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,700
I didn't know you were this kind of person.

47
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,050
You weren't like this when we were younger.

48
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,380
Who did you learn this from?

49
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,840
I always hang out with you.

50
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,820
Of course I picked up

51
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,580
a couple of

52
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,080
little tricks.

53
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:07,780
You...

54
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,880
You learn nothing good,

55
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,080
and only pick up useless things.

56
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:14,510
Xiangyun, let me ask you.

57
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,820
When you were by the river earlier,

58
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,880
did someone push you in from behind?

59
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,680
Song Xiangyun!

60
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,950
How dare you offend Young Miss Yingshi!

61
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,220
I can't let him know that

62
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,580
it was Princess Yingshi who pushed me down.

63
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,580
No.

64
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,900
There were too many people on the bridge.

65
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,200
I got squeezed off by accident.

66
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,100
Xiangyun.

67
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,340
At that time,

68
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,540
it was an emergency. I didn't think that much.

69
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,020
If you're upset about it,

70
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,790
I apologize.

71
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,450
I'm not that petty of a person.

72
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,870
Since it was to save me,

73
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,030
I'll just let it slide.

74
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,580
But remember,

75
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:56,690
you did this of your own accord.

76
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,020
Don't try

77
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,710
coming after me for it later.

78
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,660
Why would I do that?

79
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,410
You're the one who's coming after me for it.

80
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:06,950
I...

81
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,820
I won't come after you either.

82
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,270
About our earlier topic,

83
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,320
you haven't answered my question.

84
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,650
Why did you suddenly run away?

85
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,880
Don't tell me you really got angry...

86
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,220
I don't know why my cousin

87
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,880
was there earlier either, I...

88
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,580
I-I'm not angry.

89
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,220
I...

90
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,140
I don't know Yingshi at all.

91
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,580
I didn't know that you two had

92
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,900
that kind of relationship either.

93
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,700
You even went to

94
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,980
find out her name?

95
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,390
She...

96
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,710
She's my uncle's adopted daughter.

97
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,110
She grew up near the border in Anliang.

98
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,490
When we were younger,

99
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:46,930
we- we did meet a few times,

100
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,230
but those were all casual jokes we made as kids.

101
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,000
As adults, we can't be that bold anymore.

102
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:55,740
Don't worry.

103
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,900
I will settle this as soon as possible.

104
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,750
It should be settled as soon as possible.

105
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:19,860
Come in.

106
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:31,930
Your Highness.

107
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,970
It's time to take your medicine.

108
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:43,730
Your Highness.

109
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,030
Such an oblivious fool you are.

110
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,290
Did you not realize that

111
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,380
His Highness caught a cold?

112
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,940
Go off now,

113
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,660
and bring two more blankets here.

114
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:09,890
Yes.

115
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,170
Your Highness, you should not be impulsive.

116
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,660
You should know

117
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,780
Concubine Xian

118
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,180
personally ordered for this medicine to be delivered.

119
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:30,100
If Her Highness knows

120
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,580
-you didn't take your medicine today...
-Whatever.

121
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,549
I'm sick and tired of

122
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,289
pretending to be weak.

123
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,230
Call Captain Feng here.

124
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,000

127
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,020
Are you looking for me?

128
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,490
Why did you do this to yourself?

129
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,140
I...

130
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,940
The day after tomorrow will be the royal

131
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,720
riding and archery tournament organized by His Majesty.

132
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,340
They say its a test of physical ability,

133
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,980
but His Majesty actually

134
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,010
wants to select a martial arts tutor for the royal princes.

135
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,340
I was already worried that your hand injury

136
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,450
would affect your performance.

137
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,000
I didn't expect you to

138
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:41,200
make yourself so exhausted.

139
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,340
If you catch a cold on top of this,

140
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,390
you will lose the chance to fight for the title.

141
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,550
Isn't that...

142
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,230
a good thing?

143
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,580
What do you mean?

144
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,210
Father, look.

145
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,590
With our current status,

146
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,400
if we're adamant on taking the title of the Princes' Tutor,

147
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,650
it might cause suspicion.

148
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,030
The tallest trees catch the most wind.

149
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,730
You taught me that.

150
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,640
The court has already reminded the Lu family of that.

[Manual of Wenkang's Military Provisions and Funds]

152
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:25,220
This is all the Lu family's ledgers you got

00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,420
from Second Brother's side?

154
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,950
Yes, Your Highness.

155

156
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,410
Yes, Your Highness.

157
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,080
You are a smart man.

158
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,390
You should know

159
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,090
the consequence of betraying me.

160
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,140
Please bear witness to my innocence, Your Highness.

161
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,910
Since I became an official,

162
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,860
I've always been loyal to Your Highness.

163
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,980
Even if I was sent by you

164
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,390
to serve the Second Prince as a spy,

165
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,730
all I have been thinking

166
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,790
and worrying about every day

167
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,050
is you, Your Highness.

168
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,160
Then I shall

169
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,990
assign you with

170
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,580
the most crucial

171
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,070
and important task.

172
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,500
I won't let you down.

173
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,970
Go to the suburbs of Wenkang.

174

Kong,

175
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,750
the Lu family has always been fiercely loyal.

176
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,520
We have a clear conscience.

177
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,950
How can you give up your responsibility as a subject

178
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,780
just because you're afraid of people talking?

179
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,970
As a general of the imperial court,

180
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,740
not only should you be responsible for serving the country,

181
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,700
but you should also help the princes stabilize the empire.

182
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,670
A general should not be

183
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,790
as timid as you are.

184
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:37,860
Besides,

185
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,590
with His Majesty's temper,

186
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,890
if he really wants to kill us,

187
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,040
even if I hide in my tortoise shell,

188
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,720
it won't be of any use.

189
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,660
-I really...
-Just do your best.

00:11:59,620 --> 00:11:59,940
Hurry.

192
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,270
Mother!

193
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,880
Drink this while it's hot.

194
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:02,980
I'm fine.

195
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
I'm not a child anymore.

196
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,270
Your father knew you fell into the water,

197
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,250
so he asked someone to make this ginger soup

198
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,900
in case you catch a cold.

199
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,280
Look at you, how did you even fall into the water

200
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,140
while looking at the lanterns?

201
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,500
Slow down.

202
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:19,980
Slow down.

203
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,220
Mother.

204
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:23,760
I'm fine.

205
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,400
What about Yingshi?

206
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,370
Is she back?

207
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,270
Yes.

208
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:28,960
She fell asleep in the guest room.

209
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,460
Don't worry about her.

210
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,410
That child...

211
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,000
Why didn't she tell me she's back in the capital?

212
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:37,860
Okay.

213
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,700
Rest early.

214
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,320
I'm fine,

215
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,010
Mother.

216
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:25,800
Protector.

217
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,290
That stone goblin has made a new move.

218
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,180
What is it?

219
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,540
He broke taboo for the woman he loves.

220
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,100
After becoming stone,

221
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,830
he stayed underwater for a whole night.

222
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:40,900
Good.

223
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,650
As I expected,

224
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,310
he fell in love.

225
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,110
Protector,

226
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:48,580
is it the right time now?

227
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,720
No hurry.

228
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,870
Love in this mortal world

229
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,930
is unpredictable.

230
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,490
With the power of the Stone Heart,

231
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,870
once he falls in love,

232
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,620
he will fall deep

233
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,790
and won't be able to get out of it.

234
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,580
Just continue observing.

235
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:13,620
Yes.

236
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,650
I’m waiting for that stone goblin

237
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,740
to entertain us with a good show.

238
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:20,590
This entertaining romantic tragedy

239
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,400
has now begun.

240
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,470
[Lu Mansion]

241
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,440
Young Miss, why are you up?

242
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,260
How are you now?

243
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,260
I feel refreshed

244
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,340
and my body feels light.

245
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,860
I've never felt so good.

246
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,810
Young Miss, seems like you're really ill.

247
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,160
Look at where we are now.

248
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:58,980
Lu Mansion.

249
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,160
That's right.

250
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,620
This way,

251
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,470
I can see Cousin every day.

252
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:06,910
They do say, whoever's closer gets the catch.

253
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,070
I'm already living in Lu Mansion.

254
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,990
There's no way I'll lose to Song Xiangyun.

255
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,850
But...

256
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,510
they are engaged.

257
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,940
Even if they are engaged,

258
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,100
Song Xiangyun

259
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,920
can't live in Lu Mansion openly.

260
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,220
While I, Xie Yingshi,

261
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,710
I can live here openly and proudly.

262
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,270
So don't blame me for catching up fast

263
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,180
and taking her place.

264
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,200
Young Miss,

265
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,710
are you sure

266
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,860
you can really capture his heart first?

267
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,620
Am I wrong?

268
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,320
By the way,

269
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,220
have you found the person who saved me last time?

270
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,330
I've put out a handsome reward to look for him.

271
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,950
But there's no news yet.

272
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,890
He did an act of kindness

273
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:47,880
without leaving his name,

274
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,940
nor asking for a reward.

275
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,190
I didn't expect

276
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,220
such noble people to still exist.

277
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,080
What?

278
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,210
The lady who lived on the second floor moved out?

279
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,470
Yes, sir.

280
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,860
She moved out?

281
00:15:59,040 --> 00:15:59,700
I don't believe it.

282
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:00,790
How is that possible?

283
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,220
I'm not lying, sir.

284
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,210
She really moved out?

285
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,180
You mean this lady here

286
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,370
really moved out?

287
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,160
Sir,

288
00:16:12,830 --> 00:16:14,050
are you sure there's nothing wrong

289
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,420
with this painting?

290
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,850
No. It's just that Miss Yingshi

291
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,170
was as beautiful as a fairy.

292
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,800
Every frown and smile of hers is vivid in my mind.

293
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,740
No, this...

294
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,100
Miss Fairy.

295
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,100
Miss Fairy.

296
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,590
Sir, let's look elsewhere.

297
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,820
She really moved out.

298
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,100
Miss.

299
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,450
Sir, do you have a mirror?

300
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,660
This rascal.

301
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,170
Where have you been

302
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:46,280
since last night?

303
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,240
Why,

304
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,580
you don't want to be a human anymore?

305
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,070
You...

306
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,900
What's that smell?

307
00:16:58,370 --> 00:16:59,610
You...

308
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,340
You want to change form

309
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:02,380
into a fish?

310
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:03,940
That's fine too.

311
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,490
Salted fish, dead fish, edible fish.

312
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:07,869
Anything is fine.

313
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,180
What?

314
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:14,170
Are you actually sad?

315
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,540
Miss.

316
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,410
Miss Fairy...

317
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,500
is missing.

318
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,300
Don't worry.

319
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,220
She's fine.

320
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,260
She just moved into Lu Mansion.

321
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,140
She moved into Lu Mansion?

322
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,720
Then Young Master Lu and her...

323
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,460
It's a matter of time.

324
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,260
Shouldn't you be happy?

325
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:47,930
Isn't that what you want?

326
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:50,200
Yes.

327
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,730
It's going according to my plan,

328
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,870
and I'm setting the two of them up.

329
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,740
I'm not offending the Eastern Sea,

330
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,500
and also protecting the Marriage Pavilion.

331
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,330
I should be happy.

332
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,740
But why am I not happy at all?

333
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:10,400
When can I ever

334
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,030
see Miss Fairy again?

335
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,780
How should I face them?

336
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:24,550
Cousin,

337
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,170
your hand hasn't recovered yet?

338
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,060
Let me see.

339
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,320
I'm fine.

340
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:31,960
Looks like you've fully recovered long ago.

341
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:39,520
Cousin, you will win tomorrow's tournament.

342
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,260
I will cheer loudly for you

343
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,090
and boost your morale.

344
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:43,630
Come on.

345
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:46,300
Horseriding and archery are so common at the border.

346
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,030
Don't tell me you haven't seen enough.

347
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,230
It's never enough.

348
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,330
My father always said

349
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,510
you are a young hero.

350
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,300
He asked me come to the capital to learn from you.

351
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,900
Not only horseriding and archery,

352
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,450
but I should also study military strategy.

353
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,630
But I don't know where to start.

354
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,100
Learning military strategy is too hard.

355
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,730
Cousin, please teach me.

356
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,680
These books,

357
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,050
finish reading them before dark.

358
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,310
Together with three discussion essays.

359
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,370
And these too.

360
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,720
[Tai'an Palace]

361
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,490
Father.

362
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,190
The national treasury is running low, and things are unstable at the border.

363
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,050
I don't think it's appropriate

364
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,260
to renovate Tai'an Palace now.

365
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:39,910
Your Majesty.

366
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,890
The Eldest Prince is right.

367
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,090
The fields in the southwest are hit by disaster.

368
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,450
Many people haven't harvested anything this year,

369
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,060
and are still suffering from hunger.

370
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,150
At present,

371
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,360
we shouldn't be doing such major renovations.

372
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:53,900
General Lu.

373
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,870
Father is the most important person in the nation.

374
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,400
He has lived in the cold and damp Tai'an Palace for a long time.

375
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:01,960
If he falls sick,

376
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:04,030
isn't that the biggest loss to Great Chen?

377
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:05,790
Your Majesty.

378
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,850
Your Majesty.

379
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,580
Jinghua Palace was just renovated last year.

380
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,240
In my opinion,

381
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:15,150
you can move to Jinghua Palace temporarily.

382
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,670
Father is the ruler of the country,

383
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,520
and is also the representative of the nation of Great Chen.

384
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,080
If he keeps living in an obscure palace for long,

385
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:21,980
once word gets out,

386
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,820
the neighboring countries will laugh at us.

387
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:30,830
In my opinion,

388
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:33,890
prioritizing the people's needs is the basis of good governance.

389
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,930
The country prospering, and the people living stable and good lives

390
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,440
is the true hallmark of Great Chen's dignity.

391
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:41,730
And Your Majesty's reign

392
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,750
will also be praised for years to come.

393
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:44,780
Father,

394
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,820
-I think...
-Enough.

395
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,650
They just don't want to allow  me to renovate my sleeping chamber.

396
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,150
What's the big deal?

397
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,340
Let's just not renovate then.

398
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,070
Your Majesty, this...

399
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:07,460
Everything in the palace

400
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,960
is up to Your Majesty's discretion.

401
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,700
Us humble subjects

402
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,020
have crossed the line.

403
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:16,900
Lu Liang.

404
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,630
Let's conclude this matter.

405
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,610
No further discussion is needed.

406
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,220
My dear ministers.

407
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:25,110
The royal riding and archery tournament is approaching.

408
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,740
Get ready for it.

409
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,140
We respectfully send Your Majesty off.

410
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,430
I know you are loyal to the country.

411
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,010
But for some pieces of advice...

412
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,120
you should think about how to convey it properly.

413
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,920
Don't make the situation so difficult every time.

414
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:51,690
You know how

415
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,000
His Majesty is like.

416
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:54,960
If I hint indirectly,

417
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,530
I'm afraid he'll just play dumb.

418
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:57,930
But you know very well that

419
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,610
the Eldest Prince is not favored by His Majesty now.

420
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:01,730
You should hold off

421
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,640
on speaking up for him so much.

422
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:06,720
You know me.

423
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,180
I stand on the side of reason, not who's close to me.

424
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,690
The Eldest Prince is benevolent and cares for the people.

425
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,380
He is better than any other prince,

426
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,640
and even better than the emperor.

427
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,480
Why can't I help him?

428
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,440
Watch your mouth.

429
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,040
Don't get yourself killed.

430
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,060
Brother Song.

431
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,460
The Lu family is full of loyal men.

432
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,410
We are not afraid of death.

433
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:31,810
If it's for the country,

434
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,310
even if I die,

435
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,210
I should give my honest advice.

436
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,300
Hey...

437
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:37,660
Brother Lu.

438
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:38,790
You...

439
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,140
Is that my cousin?

440
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,220
It looks like it!

441
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,480
The one riding the horse!

442
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:07,740
Young Miss.

443
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,480
Are you also looking for Young Master Lu?

444
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,490
What?

445
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,290
I just want to see

446
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:16,570
which horse looks more handsome.

447
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:19,000
So which horse do you like?

448
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,310
Could it be Young Master Lu's?

449
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,000
He is quite handsome indeed.

450
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,000
Are you talking about the horse, or the person?

451
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,680
What nonsense are you saying?

452
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,700
In any case, I know.

453
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,670
Young Miss, you always say this.

454
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,150
But deep down,

455
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:51,030
you still care about Son-in-law Lu.

456
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,200
Son-in...what?

457
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,270
Welcome, Your Majesty.

458
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:08,380
We welcome Your Majesty.

459
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:11,970
[Scoreboard]

460
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:17,290
Everyone.

461
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,560
You may rise.

462
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,070
Thank you, Your Majesty.

463
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,110
Rise.

464
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,300
Be seated.

465
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,600
All of you are the pillars of the country.

466
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:37,420
Let's have a good competition today.

467
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,560
Show me your real skills.

468
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:41,610
Let me tell you.

469
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:43,430
Today is an opportunity.

470
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,990
See that?

471
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,400
All the noble ladies are watching you.

472
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,740
Even if I don't end up noticing you,

473
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,880
you may just win the heart of a beauty,

474
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,830
which will be well worth your trip here.

475
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,270
Yes, Your Majesty.

476
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,330
Good!

477
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,010
His aim is accurate.

478
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:36,940
Good!

479
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,220
Great!

480
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,340
When is it Lu Changkong's turn?

481
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,700
He is the young genius who defeated

482
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,420
a 20,000-strong army with just 3,000 elite troops.

483
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,230
So it's him.

484
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,180
Why are we still competing?

485
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,320
We're already here.

486
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:11,700
Your Highness.

487
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:35,250
Young Miss, stop eating.

488
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,290
It's Young Master Lu's turn.

489
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,450
Lu Changkong is amazing.

490
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,060
Young hero Lu Changkong!

491
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,750
Lu Changkong, come on!

492
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,540
Lu Changkong is invincible!

493
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,330
Dominating the field!

494
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,710
Young Master Lu Changkong!

495
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,230
Young hero!

496
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,260
Invincible and unbeatable!

497
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,420
Come on!

498
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,180
Cousin!

499
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,320
Lu Changkong, come on!

500
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,340
Xiangyun.

501
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,090
Come on!

502
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:39,500
I know you're cheering for me sincerely,

503
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,900
and hoping that I can shine.

504
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,700
But this time,

505
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:44,930
I'm afraid I'll be letting you down.

506
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,150
I'm sorry.

507
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,120
Come on!

508
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:18,000
Stalemate.

509
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:21,040
Lu Changkong, let's see how long you can hide it.

510
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,220
General Lu isn't performing

511
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,260
up to standard today.

512
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:25,980
I heard he hurt his arm.

513
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,460
I'm afraid he can't hold a bow

514
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:28,890
anymore in the future.

515
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,950
Serving the country

516
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,870
doesn't necessarily mean you have to lead troops into battle.

517
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,120
Lu Liang.

518
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,900
Don't worry.

519
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,220
Considering Young General Lu's previous contributions,

520
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,900
I won't treat him badly.

521
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,530
Thank you, Your Majesty.

522
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,350
General, come on!

523
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,140
Young Miss!

524
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,070
Lu Changkong.

525
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,500
I don't believe

526
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,530
you won't step in to save them.

527
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,620
Do you want to die?

528
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:09,860
I...

529
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,220
Don't you dare do such a dangerous thing

530
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,430
ever again!

531
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:13,670
Do you hear me?

532
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,240
Do you hear me?

533
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:24,610
Follow me.

534
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,710
I'm at fault for startling Your Majesty.

535
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:51,630
General Lu.

536
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:53,530
Please rise.

537
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,250
In such a dangerous situation at the field earlier,

538
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,490
it's all thanks to you that

539
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,310
those noble young ladies were saved.

540
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,310
Commander Song.

541
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:10,820
Yes.

542
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,220
Go find out

543
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,870
who was in charge of setting up these structures.

544
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,030
Once you find out,

545
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,810
I will punish them severely.

546
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:19,940
Yes.

547
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,060
It's too dangerous.

548
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,150
As for selecting

549
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,310
the tutor for the princes...

550
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,670
Father.

551
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,000
At that moment of danger,

552
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,060
General Lu was not afraid in the face of danger

553
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,220
and turned the tide successfully.

554
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,960
Not only did he show excellent horseriding skills,

555
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,140
he also risked his life

556
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,170
to save the young ladies of the families here from danger.

557
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,620
In my opinion,

558
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,720
this kind of courage and strategizing

559
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:51,260
should be an example for the princes to live up to.

560
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,000
Your Majesty, the Eldest Prince is biased.

561
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:56,680
You've all seen

562
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,690
Young General Lu's horseriding skills

563
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,390
during the tournament.

564
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,090
There's nothing outstanding about it.

565
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,220
This is unfair

566
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,380
to the other candidates.

567
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,700
That's because Lu Changkong injured his arm.

568
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,720
Despite that,

569
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,520
he can still hit the highest target.

570
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,610
Is anyone present here

571
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:12,930
capable of that?

572
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,330
It's just a coincidence.

573
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,550
Xiangyun, don't say anything.

574
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,410
Your Majesty, General Lu has made great achievements.

575
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,180
He also showed the bearing of a great general earlier.

576
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,860
I also think

577
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,630
General Lu rightly deserves to be

578
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,600
the princes' tutor.

579
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,000
Father,

580
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,070
I second that.

581
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:42,580
Your Majesty, we agree.

582
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,640
Your Majesty, we agree.

583
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,880
What you all said makes sense.

584
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,300
Lu Liang.

585
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:10,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

586
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,150
Not bad.

587
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,520
You have a good son.

588
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,610
You flatter me, Your Majesty.

589
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,420
What are you all waiting for?

590
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,600
Greet your tutor now.

591
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,990
Greetings, Tutor.

592
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:40,540
I'm flattered.

593
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,370
General Lu.

594
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,700
Looks like the future of Great Chen's empire

595
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,280
will fall on the shoulders of the Lu family.

596
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,890
Your Majesty, I'm flattered.

597
00:33:59,030 --> 00:33:59,810
Your Majesty,

598
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:04,880
-I'm afraid I'm not capable of taking up this responsibility. I...
-My dear General Lu, you've made great achievements.

599
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,590
You were calm and collected earlier,

600
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,420
and could prevent a big crisis from happening.

601
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,570
If I don't go with everyone's opinion here,

602
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,710
what would the people think of me?

603
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:21,560
Do you want everyone to criticize me?

604
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,550
I shall obey, Your Majesty.

605
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,310
Thank you for your benevolence, Your Majesty.

606
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,389
I'm tired.

607
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,780
Let's call it a day.

608
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,070
We respectfully send Your Majesty off.

609
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:05,660
Are you hurt?

610
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,570
I'm fine. What about you?

611
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:08,940
I'm fine.

612
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:10,580
Tutor Lu.

613
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:15,740
Congratulations, Tutor Lu.

614
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,460
I'm flattered.

615
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,980
You deserve it.

616
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,710
It's getting windy.

617
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,600
Yun'er.

618
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:45,610
Go ahead.

619
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,530
General Lu, by His Majesty's orders,

620
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,080
we received emergency military intel that

621
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,740
bandits are attacking Xiangbei.

622
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,390
They're asking to be granted temporary authority for

623
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,470
General Chen to lead troops

624
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,650
as reinforcements immediately.

625
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:17,160
I shall obey, Your Majesty.

626
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:26,940
Father.

627
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,430
Let's talk at home.

628
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,000
It's not wrong to save Changkong.

629
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,540
But how can you talk nonsense in front of His Majesty?

630
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,480
Do you not want to live anymore?

631
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:43,530
It's not that serious.

632
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,980
The Song family and Lu family

633
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,600
share our glories and losses.

634
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,560
If His Majesty gets angry,

635
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,080
not only will our family be in trouble,

636
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,100
Changkong will also be affected.

637
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,150
How would I know if you didn't tell me?

638
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,330
Anyway, I did nothing wrong.

639
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:55,890
You...

640
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,240
Commander Song.

641
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:04,210
Lu Changkong, I...

642
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,500
Whatever you want to say,

643
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:06,910
we can talk about it later.

644
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,060
Don't make your father angry.

645
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,660
Go.

646
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,350
Lu Liang.

647
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,070
Not bad.

648
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,230
You have a good son.

649
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,630
My dear General Lu, you've made great achievements.

650
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:08,570
Do you want everyone to criticize me?

651
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,340
The storm clouds are rising,

652
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:16,340
and the chaos is about to begin.

653
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,800
I can't drag Xiangyun into this mess.

654
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,390
Xiangyun.

655
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,500
I'm sorry.
