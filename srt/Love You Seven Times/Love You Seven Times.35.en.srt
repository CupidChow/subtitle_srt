[Love you seven times]

3
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:45,050
[Episode 35]

4
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,820
But

5
00:01:48,009 --> 00:01:49,930
I did hurt you.

6
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,300
I…

7
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,259
It's not your fault.

8
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:55,660
You've been through enough.

9
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:56,979
This time,

10
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:58,800
if it weren't for me,

11
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,740
you wouldn't have broken into the Demon King's Mansion alone

12
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,910
and ended up in Haoxuan's hands.

13
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,470
So,

14
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,699
you know

15
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,850
everything I did for you.

16
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,860
Sorry for all that you've been through.

17
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,720
I'll wait for you.

18
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,240
I

19
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,980
have prepared for years

20
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,280
to activate the Demon-Vanishing Formation.

21
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,060
The time has finally come.

22
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,970
What are you waiting for?

23
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,360
After I

24
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,300
absorb these Demon Cores,

25
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,150
the Demon-Vanishing Formation will be fully activated.

26
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,550
By then,

27
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,020
all the demonic power in the Mystery Forest

28
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,470
will be at my disposal.

29
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,100
They…

30
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,470
Immortal Sun.

31
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:19,140
You asked to meet me immediately.

32
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,050
What happened?

33
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,760
Really?

34
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,340
Yes.

35
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,700
I saw it in the Mystery Forest

36
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,530
with my own eyes.

37
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,140
Soon,

38
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,930
all the demonic power in the Mystery Forest will be mine.

39
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,020
Then I can be free of worry.

40
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,010
What are you doing?

41
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,659
There's still one Demon Core left!

42
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,960
I won't let you get what you want.

43
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,820
I indeed need

44
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,630
a demon as powerful as you

45
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:00,540
to activate the Demon-Vanishing Formation.

46
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,980
But it's too late

47
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,410
for you to stop me.

48
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,770
I already have demonic power.

49
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,480
Without your help,

50
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,170
I can complete this formation all the same!

51
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,240
We'll see

52
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:38,480
if I can stop you or not.

53
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,990
No matter who

54
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,120
killed Buwen,

55
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,820
I'll find them

56
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,990
wherever they are.

57
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,640
Haoxuan killed Buwen.

58
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,340
He's now activating the Demon-Vanishing Formation in the Mystery Forest.

59
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,580
[Haoxuan killed Buwen. He's now activating the Demon-Vanishing Formation in the Mystery Forest.]

60
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,780
I know

61
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,220
where the murderer is.

62
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,500
Stone goblin, how dare you get in my way?

63
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,840
Even if you could gather ten more Great Demons,

64
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,170
I would not let you activate the Demon-Vanish Formation again.

65
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,900
To fight against me,

66
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,380
you even forfeited your Stone Heart.

67
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,570
Is the Mystery Forest

68
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,900
worth it?

69
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,110
As long as I can thwart your ambition,

70
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,580
even if I die,

71
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,620
it'll be worth it.

72
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,030
You want to rule the six realms?

73
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,190
Not gonna happen!

74
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,640
Why did you come?

75
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
Leave!

76
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,340
You leave first.

77
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,780
My Stone Heart has been destroyed.

78
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,910
My days are numbered.

79
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,860
Don't risk your life for me.

80
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,090
Leave!

81
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,080
Then let's die together!

82
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:04,740
So touching.

83
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,450
Let me grant your wish.

84
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,070
Zihui.

85
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,500
Zihui.

86
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,150
You fools.

87
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,370
Standing against me

88
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,870
means death.

89
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,190
Don't be afraid. I'll protect you.

90
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,420
You're the new Demon King.

91
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,820
It's you!

92
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,440
You killed Buwen!

93
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,260
Sorry for the disturbance.

94
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,610
I let you off today.

95
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,980
But before long,

96
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,710
I'll come back to take over the Mystery Forest.

97
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,590
Your Majesty, are you alright?

98
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,250
I'm fine.

99
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,170
Zihui.

100
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,820
You're wasting your time.

101
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,650
Zihui.

102
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,160
Stop trying.

103
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,560
Zihui. Zihui.

104
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,100
Zihui.

105
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,970
Zihui.

106
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,100
Zihui.

107
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,830
Who is that Demon King?

108
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,460
He's so powerful.

109
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,530
I must get rid of him,

110
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,150
or in the future,

111
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,330
he'll become a great threat.

112
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,500
Keep an eye on the Demon King's Mansion.

113
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,710
Don't miss anything.

114
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,740
Yes.

115
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,420
Chu Kong, what happened?

116
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,180
How did Zihui get so badly injured?

117
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,620
Haoxuan prepared for years

118
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,420
and wanted Zihui to activate the Demon-Vanishing Formation for him

119
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:53,710
so that he could claim all the demonic power in the Mystery Forest.

120
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,110
To ruin his plan,

121
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,130
Zihui destroyed the Demon-Vanishing Formation

122
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,100
by breaking his Stone Heart.

123
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,170
Without the Stone Heart,

124
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,750
what will happen to him?

125
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:12,260
Zihui's true form is the Nuwa Stone.

126
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,990
The Stone Heart is the source of his spiritual power.

127
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,380
Without the Stone Heart,

128
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,870
he can only last for three days at most.

129
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,060
Three days?

130
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,650
Xiangyun.

131
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,850
Leave his last days

132
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,740
to them.

133
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,970
You're finally awake.

134
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:19,990
Careful.

135
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,610
Sorry

136
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,570
for making you worry.

137
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,920
Are you okay?

138
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,500
Are you hurt?

139
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:38,730
I'm fine.

140
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:41,060
You've been in a coma for so long.

141
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,020
Take the medicine.

142
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,130
Here.

143
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,710
You're a physician.

144
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,820
You should know

145
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,900
that after my Stone Heart was destroyed,

146
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,850
I lost all my spiritual power

147
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,859
and will die soon.

148
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,170
The medicine

149
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,650
won't be of any help.

150
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,420
I'm the physician.

151
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,589
You need to do what I say.

152
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,089
I won't give up

153
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,900
until the last moment.

154
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:36,850
That's more like it.

155
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,150
After your injuries recover,

156
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,410
we'll get married.

157
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,980
But look at me now…

158
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,060
You promised me

159
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,690
that we'd get married if you came back alive.

160
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,590
We've missed too much.

161
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,050
Zihui, I don't want to have more regrets.

162
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:27,750
I, Zihui,

163
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,640
whose true form is the Nuwa Stone,

164
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,210
wonder

165
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,640
if you will marry me.

166
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:42,740
I will.

167
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,690
[Jin Luo and Zihui are getting married today. As Jin Luo's brother, you have to be present. Come to the Mystery Forest immediately.]

168
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,710
Lord Protector.

169
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,060
What does the Empress say in the letter?

170
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,030
Jin Luo and Zihui

171
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:17,760
are getting married in the Mystery Forest.

172
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,040
I'm invited

173
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:21,730
to their wedding.

174
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,370
Will you go

175
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,480
or not?

176
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,830
To thank you for being so generous,

177
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,860
I prepared a surprise for you.

178
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,630
What surprise?

179
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,400
What are you doing here?

180
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,740
Zihui's Stone Heart has been destroyed.

181
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,620
You're too late.

182
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,580
I asked Xiangyun

183
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:12,450
to invite him here.

184
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:16,840
He's your brother after all,

185
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,760
your only family in the world.

186
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:21,950
Today,

187
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,910
my only sister is getting married.

188
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,840
How can I be absent?

189
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:35,810
[Happy Marriage]

190
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,750
This is the dowry I prepared for you.

191
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:42,740
Today,

192
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,200
we'll need you

193
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,090
to be our witness.

194
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,330
Ren.

195
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,030
We're Shengling's Dynamic Duo.

196
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,530
Jin Lian went to the Demon King's Mansion.

197
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,560
Are you sure

198
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,960
you didn't take someone else for him?

199
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,990
I'm sure it was him.

200
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,430
You asked me to keep an eye on the Demon King's Mansion.

201
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,340
I carried out your order meticulously.

202
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,070
That Demon King's maid

203
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:15,730
does have connections with the Moluo Divine Clan.

204
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,000
Besides,

205
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:18,870
Jin Lian appears

206
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,290
very respectful to that maid.

207
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,670
The new Demon King

208
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,730
shouldn't have anything to do with the Moluo Divine Clan.

209
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,160
Jin Lian holds a high position.

210
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,900
Why is he close with a maid?

211
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,220
Have you found out

212
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,100
who that maid is?

213
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,220
Not yet.

214
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,510
Keep an eye on her.

215
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,240
Find out who she is.

216
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:46,390
Yes.

217
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,150
[Happy Marriage]

218
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:55,010
Happy wedding day, Jin Luo, Zihui.

219
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:56,870
Thank you.

220
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,710
Thank you.

221
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,630
How long has it been since we ate together like this?

222
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,890
It's as if we were back to the Shengling Sect.

223
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,940
This soup is so delicious.

224
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,760
You don't get to have such delicious soup every day.

225
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:30,710
Have some more.

226
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:40,880
[Happy Marriage]

227
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,050
Thank you, Sect Leader.

228
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,980
Thank you, Xiangyun.

229
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,630
Thank you for your help, Miss.

230
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,310
You and His Divinity

231
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,440
should cherish each other.

232
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,440
[Happy Marriage]

233
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,370
Zihui and I wasted too much time.

234
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,400
Don't repeat our mistake.

235
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,830
We won't.

236
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,540
The world is so big.

237
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,020
It's very great

238
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,470
to meet you guys.

239
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,630
We've drunk a lot

240
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,410
but

241
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,260
haven't drunk the cross-cupped wine.

242
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,780
The cross-cupped wine

243
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,610
should be saved for last.

244
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:17,480
Luo.

245
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,270
I'm sorry.

246
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:28,130
Three Letters and Six Etiquettes.

247
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,710
Betrothal gifts.

248
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,810
Palanquin with eight carriers.

249
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,320
Ten-mile red dowry.

250
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,690
Special wedding invitations to your family.

251
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,420
I didn't get you any of those things

252
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,510
I promised you.

253
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,880
We don't have much time.

254
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,780
So just skip

255
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,030
those niceties.

256
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:51,910
But

257
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,560
you have to do all the heavy lifting

258
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,280
and all the housework.

259
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,290
You also need to

260
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,520
look after our children.

261
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,560
Those are not negotiable.

262
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,680
As you wish.

263
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,630
After we leave here,

264
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,310
let's find a beautiful place,

265
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,060
open a clinic,

266
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,870
and save lots of people,

267
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:18,910
shall we?

268
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,740
Sure.

269
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,670
Anything you say.

270
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:37,620
Luo.

271
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,220
After drinking the cross-cupped wine,

272
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,080
we'll be husband and wife.

273
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,810
We'll live

274
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,050
or die together and never be apart.

275
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,370
Luo, my wife,

276
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,780
I wish you happiness and health.

277
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:15,400
When you come back,

278
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:17,810
we'll get married.

279
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,140
♫Brighter than the moon was your face♫

280
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,830
♫When you said goodbye♫

281
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,930
♫And turned around to leave♫

282
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,180
Okay.

283
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,080
I promise you.

284
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,670
♫Missing you in the cool wind♫

285
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,430
♫I know I can never see you again♫

286

♫Tears stream down my face♫

287
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,430
♫We were the perfect match♫

288
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,900
♫But the unpredictable fate pulled us apart♫

289
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,300
♫Stumbling on the way to you♫

290
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,790
♫I found myself trapped by love♫

00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,530
♫Can you hear my wistful sighs?♫

♫Do you wish we could start all over?♫

304
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:35,280

00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,970
♫You left at sunset♫

307
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,100
♫My heart grew cold because I knew our story ended♫

♫Your face faded in the wind♫

309
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,540
Why

310
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,880
do we all have so many regrets?

311
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,910
♫You left at sunset♫

312
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,870

00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:11,850
Zihui.

315
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,240
Rest assured.

316
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,540
I will avenge you.

317
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,990
Why did you

318
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:33,910
bring me here?

319
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,800
On the pedestal

320
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,640
is the Power of the Demon King.

321
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,030
We demons never choose our king

322
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,460
solely based on demonic power.

323
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,340
To be the Demon King,

324
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,850
one has to be selfless

325
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:52,280
and devoted to protecting the Demon Clan.

326
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:53,880
The other day,

327
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,500
I saw you shielding a few demons

328
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,640
behind you without hesitation.

329
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,910
That has convinced me

330
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,800
that you truly care about

331
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,700
the Demon Clan

332
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:09,140
instead of just your own interests.

333
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:13,130
Everything you did for the Mystery Forest

334
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,780
has proved that you deserve

335
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,800
to have the Power of the Demon King.

336
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,620
To be the Demon King,

337
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,500
one has to be selfless

338
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,950
and devoted to protecting the Demon Clan.

339
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,790
The other day,

340
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:05,270
I saw you shielding a few demons

341
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,260
behind you without hesitation.

342
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,630
It's convinced me

343
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:15,800
that you deserve the Power of the Demon King.

344
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:30,940
You're back.

345
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,000
What took you so long?

346
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,260
Why did Elder Kuanglong say?

347
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,630
He…

348
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,760
He agreed to give me the Power of the Demon King.

349
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,970
That's great.

350
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,970
Everything you did after coming to the Mystery Forest

351
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:55,250
was to get the Power of the Demon King.

352
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:02,820
You're afraid

353
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,840
that you'll forget everything about us,

354
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,460
aren't you?

355
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,600
Just do what you want to do.

356
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,880
Don't forget what you promised me.

357
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,010
Moreover,

358
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,310
have a little faith in me.

359
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,310
No matter what happens,

360
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,010
I'll make sure you get to know me again.

361
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,300
I don't want to forget my promises to you.

362
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,310
We are to grow old together

363
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,360
and there are many places I want to show you.

364
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:01,430
I asked the men we planted around Jin Lian.

365
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:03,310
Based on their descriptions,

366
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,380
the painter drew

367
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,790
the portrait of the maid in the Demon King's Mansion

368
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,310
who has connections with Jin Lian.

369
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,650
Xiangyun?

370
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,080
The Love Knot has become unstable.

371
00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:10,940
It means Chu Kong

372
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,740
will get the Power of the Demon King soon.

373
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:35,400
Chu Kong.

374
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,410
I won't let you forget me.

375
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:01,770
I've put

376
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,410
a trace of my primordial spirit into it.

377
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,880
When you wear it,

378
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,950
wherever you go,

379
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,310
I can find you.

380
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,190
Then I'll put a trace of my primordial spirit into it too.

381
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:11,890
This way,

382
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,060
in the next life

383
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:15,610
and the life after that,

384
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:17,730
you'll be able to find me.

385
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,570
Chu Kong.

386
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:05,190
It's okay. We can get to know each other again.

387
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,340
My name is Xiangyun.

388
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:33,040
Sorry.

389
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:37,570
Sorry.

390
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,280
Sorry, I…

391
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,100
You didn't forget me.

392
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:46,070
You still remember me?

393
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,360
I didn't forget you.

394
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,540
I may forget who I am,

395
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,940
but never will I forget you again.

396
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,700
Then tell me

397
00:38:58,830 --> 00:38:59,830
who I am.

398
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:08,890
You were the naughty girl Song Xiangyun from Great Chen,

399
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,010
the wide-eyed disciple

400
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,290
Yang Xiaoxiang of the Shengling Sect,

401
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,530
and the fearless Princess Xiangyun of the State of Qi.

402
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,170
You're Empress Cang Hai

403
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,020
who promised to grow old with me 30,000 years ago.

404
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,020
You're also

405
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,200
the bad-mannered Fuyuan Fairy of the Marriage Pavilion,

406
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:37,270
Xiangyun.

407
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,150
I knew

408
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,960
you wouldn't forget me.

409
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:56,070
Chu Kong, can you promise me this?

410
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,690
No matter what happens,

411
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,480
you won't leave me alone.

412
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:02,980
I promised to grow old with you.

413
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,700
How could I ever

414
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:08,900
leave you alone

415
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,660
in this big world?

416
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:18,440
You scared me just now.

417
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,370
♫You understand my love♫

418
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,660
♫I lived again and again just for you♫

419
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,930
♫I'm not afraid of hardships♫

420
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:32,130
♫I'm just afraid of losing you in the crowds♫

421
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:35,520
♫I don't care if this is right or wrong♫

422
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:39,030
♫You're the only answer I want♫

423
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:42,320
♫They say it's not worth it♫

424
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:48,530
♫But for love I'll do everything♫
