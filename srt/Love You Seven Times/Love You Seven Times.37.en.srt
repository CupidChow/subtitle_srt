[Love you seven times]

3
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,840
[Episode 37]

4
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,000
I advise you to plead guilty now.

5
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,500
You want me to admit this unfounded accusation?

6
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,460
Dream on!

7
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,550
Then I'll see

8
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,040
how long you can hold on.

9
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,620
Xiu Ming.

10
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,480
This whip

11
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,020
is for the people of the six realms

12
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
who've been seeking the truth for 30,000 years.

13
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,280
Xiangyun.

14
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,150
Wait for me.

15
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Cang Hai.

16
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,200
You are bloodthirsty

17
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:49,710
and cruel,

18
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,340
and caused disaster to the six realms.

19
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,860
Today, you deserve it.

20
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,020
It's your own undoing.

21
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,650
Plead guilty now

22
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,880
and be accountable to the people of the six realms.

23
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,180
Well said.

24
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:07,240
All these crimes

25
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:10,670
are really heinous

26
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,990
and unforgivable.

27
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,380
But am I really the one who committed

28
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,020
these heinous crimes?

29
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,720
Everyone in the six realms knows

30
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,150
that the members of the Moluo royal family

31
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,320
are born as twins.

32
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,020
Today, all immortals are gathered here

33
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,900
just for the sake of the public trial for the crimes you committed.

34
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,720
They are not here to hear

35
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,110
these irrelevant statements.

36
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,910
What I said

37
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,980
is related to the truth from 30,000 years ago.

38
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,690
Are you this eager to interrupt me

39
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,150
because you're afraid that I'll reveal

40
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:42,890
the existence of my twin sister,

41
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,079
Ming Yue?

42
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,950
Nonsense!

43
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,210
Everyone in the six realms knows

44
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,160
that you don't have a sister.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,240
Aren't I the one to know best

46
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,890
whether I have a sister or not?

47
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,440
Everyone knows Cang Hai

48
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,900
but not Ming Yue

49
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,800
because she was born

50
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,450
with an evil aura.

51
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,070
Father couldn't bear to kill her,

52
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,750
so he locked her up.

53
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,550
Wasn't the one who released her from the dungeon,

54
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,550
signed the soul contract with her,

55
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,620
and controlled her to kill the people of Dixiu Divine Clan

56
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,310
you?

57
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,820
Cang Hai has a sister?

58
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:24,520
Is it true or not?

59
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,070
That's just utter nonsense.

60
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:28,860
But everyone in the six realms

61
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,650
would not be easily deceived by you.

62
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,170
Xiu Ming.

63
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,260
Take action now.

64
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,580
Xiu Ming.

65
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,200
What do you mean?

66
00:04:56,450 --> 00:04:58,310
You're in such a rush to kill me.

67
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,750
Aren't you afraid others will think

68
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,090
that you're angry

69
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,290
and want to silence me to cover up the truth?

70
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:25,980
Your Holiness.

71
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,800
If you rush to annihilate her soul,

72
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,070
aren't you falling prey to her provocation

73
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,540
and solidifying

74
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,980
your crime of killing and silencing her?

75
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:44,080
I am the leader of the six realms.

76
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,020
I should enforce justice on behalf of Heaven.

77
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,180
Eliminating this devil

78
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,100
is my duty.

79
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:52,920
Why should I

80
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,400
care about the rumors?

81
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,350
You may not care about your reputation,

82
00:05:58,780 --> 00:05:59,850
but everyone

83
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,780
cares about the truth.

84
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,040
Bad news!

85
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,290
Bad news!

86
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,500
Bad news!

87
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,730
The Moluo Divine Clan has come to attack us!

88
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,060
Inform His Holiness immediately!

89
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:23,700
Yes.

90
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,740
Prepare to fight!

91
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,740
All immortals present here

92
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,460
naturally believe your innocence.

93
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,580
But it's not guaranteed that those in the six realms

94
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,130
who have long been unsatisfied with the Imperial Court

95
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,700
won't take the opportunity

96
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:40,020
to spread rumors.

97
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,980
I happen to have an ancient magical instrument

98
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,460
that can find out

99
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,180
the truth from 30,000 years ago.

100
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,520
As long as you sign the contract with me

101
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:05,510
and complete the three things I told you...

102
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,340
Is this Cang Hai or...

103
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,140
I can give you freedom.

104
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,370
If you want freedom,

105
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,840
you have to pay the price.

106
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,780
Don't tell me you don't know

107
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,370
such a logic?

108
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,390
Princess, once you sign this soul contract,

109
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,930
you must obey me.

110
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:25,370
The first thing

111
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,880
is to kill the entire Dixiu Divine Clan

112
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,100
for me.

113
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,940
Let the six realms see clearly

114
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,520
how the most loyal vassals of the Moluo Divine Clan

115
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,310
would end up.

116
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,980
Now, the six realms already know

117
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,740
that Cang Hai turned demonic

118
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,460
and massacred the innocent.

119
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,540
So, the second thing is settled.

120
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,690
What's the third thing?

121
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,760
The third thing

122
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,060
is

123
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,560
to give up your power to me

124
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,190
for my use.

125
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,080
This...

126
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,220
This...

127
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,850
Did you think

128
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:22,310
destroying the Xuantian Mirror

129
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,570
meant that you could hide the truth of the past?

130
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,380
Karma catches up with you eventually.

131
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,750
Everything

132
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,160
comes to light one day.

133
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,340
Reporting to Your Holiness!

134
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,700
Your Holiness.

135
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,740
The Moluo Divine Clan is coming at us menacingly.

136
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,000
They have already reached the Southern Heavenly Gate.

137
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,460
This...

138
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,419
They've reached the Southern Heavenly Gate?

139
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:41,460
What should we do?

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,310
I'm impressed, Cang Hai.

141
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,700
You're really well prepared.

142
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,800
Are you trying to lead the Moluo Divine Clan

143
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,780
to overthrow the Heaven Realm?

144
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,760
I will never allow something like this to happen.

145
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,260
Immortal Zhao.

146
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,620
Lead the Heavenly soldiers to defend against them.

147
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,120
Don't allow even one person

148
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,750
to break through the Southern Heavenly Gate.

149
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:11,660
Yes, sir.

150
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:16,970
Xiu Ming.

151
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:21,560
I'm so disappointed in you.

152
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,900
Even though you practiced the Soul-shattering Arrow secretly,

153
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,910
I'd always chosen to believe

154
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,580
that you wouldn't hurt Chu Kong.

155
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,670
Never in my wildest dreams did I think

156
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:35,730
that you'd collude with this devil.

157
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,380
Not only do you want to hurt Chu Kong,

158
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,710
but you also want to overthrow the Heaven Realm.

159
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,710
As Chu Kong's elder brother,

160
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,550
I've let him down.

161
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,060
I misjudged you, you rat.

162
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,350
Today,

163
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,670
I will avenge Chu Kong

164
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,980
and eliminate the traitors

165
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:03,580
for the Heaven Realm.

166
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,600
Xiu Ming!

167
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,210
Haoxuan, you...

168
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,860
Moluo Divine Clan, you sure are bold.

169
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,300
How dare you trespass the Heaven Realm?

170
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,460
Your Holiness.

171
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,370
We don't know

172
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,630
what the truth is yet.

173
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,400
Why don't we let Xiu Ming finish his words

174
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,900
before making a judgment?

175
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:47,020
It seems that many people

176
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,470
in the Heaven Realm

177
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,740
are vassals of this devil.

178
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,380
Red Thread Master. Red Thread Master!

179
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,270
Red Thread Master!

180
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,720
Red Thread Master!

181
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,060
Who else?

182
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,420
Who else wants to speak for this devil?

183
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,840
Who else?

184
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,820
You look...

185
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,770
so beautiful today.

186
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,460
I...

187
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,220
Come on.

188
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,830
Do you remember

189
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,180
the promise I made to the meteor?

190
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,400
To always be together

191
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,230
forever.

192
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,560
After tonight,

193
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,530
we'll be an official married couple.

194
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,220
Here.

195
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,050
We're now husband and wife.

196
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,260
We'll never be apart.

197
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,410
We'll live and die together.

198
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,560
We'll never turn our backs on each other in this lifetime.

199
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,350
Life is the beginning of death.

200
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,990
Death is the beginning of a new life.

201
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,320
To sacrifice one's life and forget one's death.

202
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:25,210
To die and be reborn.

203
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,140
Since the beginning of the primal chaos,

204
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,010
there's been endless time.

205
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,470
You're the only one

206
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,090
who'd die

207
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,340
for the one you love.

208
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,000
This dream is indeed beautiful.

209
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,010
But I know you're not Cang Hai.

210
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,730
Because Cang Hai

211
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,800
would never drag me down here.

212
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,990
I didn't expect you to break through the Thousand-year Dream.

213
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,140
Unfortunately,

214
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,950
this is the Void that devours everything.

215
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,890
Even if you broke through the Thousand-year Dream,

216
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,580
you won't be able to take me away.

217
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,490
No matter what,

218
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,080
I must take the Power of Cang Hai with me.

219
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,090
Your Power of the Demon King

220
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:34,240
and the Power of Cang Hai in me are mutually destructive.

221
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,720
If you insist on taking me away,

222
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,150
your soul will vanish.

223
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:37,930
Besides,

224
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,960
what's wrong with this place?

225
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,260
Why should I leave?

226
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,840
Why don't you

227
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,100
stay and accompany me?

228
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,070
Today,

229
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,360
I will

230
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,820
personally...

231
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,600
get rid of the evil in the six realms!

232
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:13,470
Xiu Ming.

233
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,130
Xiu Ming.

234
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,510
In order to repair the Xuantian Mirror,

235
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,580
you used up your spiritual power.

236
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,030
Yet you still want to go against me.

237
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,960
You overestimated yourself.

238
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,900
Your Holiness.

239
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:36,070
Please stop.

240
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,300
What?

241
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,610
Even you...

242
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,470
were bribed by this devil?

243
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,230
I promised you...

244
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,070
I will...

245
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:01,980
take...

246
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,730
Take back...

247
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,060
Haoxuan.

248
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,280
Don't vent your anger on others.

249
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,240
Just

250
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,810
come at me.

251
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,619
After the ninth whip,

252
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,490
you will perish

253
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,339
and your soul will vanish.

254
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,550
The boundaries of good versus evil and right versus wrong

255
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,050
are definite.

256
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,370
Sooner or later,

257
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,180
you'll get what you deserve.

258
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,530
Then let me see

259
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,800
whether the order of things in Heaven

260
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,620
is on your side

261
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,080
or my side.

262
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
No!

263
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,220
Cang Hai!

264
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:31,980
Chu Kong!

265
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,230
♫Cold light♫

266
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,590
♫Knocking on the wind♫

267
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:48,720
♫It's impossible to hide my heart that's going crazy♫

268

♫There's no harm in fighting hard♫

I'm late.

282
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:28,960
You must have suffered a lot.

283
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,680
The God of War is back.

284
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,680
Chu Kong?

285
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,530
Is it really you?

286
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,210
The Soul-shattering Arrow...

287
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,260
I already know the truth.

288
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,440
30,000 years ago,

289
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,680
you tampered with the Divine Prophecy for your own benefit

290
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,840
and set up Cang Hai such that she turned demonic and ruined the world.

291
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,530
Today,

292
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,930
not only do you not repent,

293
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,200
but you've also become worse

294
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,260
and are repeating the same mistake.

295
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:10,970
Chu Kong.

296
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,420
You are the God of War of the Heaven Realm.

297
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,440
Are you willing

298
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,530
to be fooled by this devil?

299
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,790
For her,

300
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,020
are you willing to be enemies with your brother

301
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,650
and the six realms?

302
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,780
You're the one who really hurt the six realms.

303
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,640
It's time to get everything back on track!

304
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,360
It's the Doom Mark.

305
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,380
Chu Kong.

306
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,290
It's you.

307
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:18,680
Stop it, Your Holiness.

308
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,820
Stop it.

309
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,430
Don't make any more mistakes.

310
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,390
No matter what,

311
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,940
everything I've done

312
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:37,140
was for the six realms

313
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,020
and all the living beings.

314
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,040
Today,

315
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,380
Chu Kong has been bewitched by the devil

316
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,950
and has betrayed the Imperial Court.

317
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,130
Take him down now!

318
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,350
What is this?

319
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:24,780
The Doom Mark.

320
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,650
[Moluo Princess will turn demonic and ruin the world.]

321
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,540
This is the price I pay

322
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,850
for tampering with the Divine Prophecy.

323
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,840
It hurts a lot.

324
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,660
It hurts a lot.

325
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,360
I was the one who tampered with the Divine Prophecy.

326
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,580
I was the one who released Ming Yue.

327
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:48,030
I also made Ming Yue

328
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,940
kill everyone in the Dixiu Divine Clan.

329
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,720
I even took

330
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,300
the Power of Ming Yue.

331
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,120
So what if I did all this?

332
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:10,730
And you guys

333
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,630
are just...

334
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,720
the devil Cang Hai's vassals

335
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,350
who betrayed the Imperial Court!

336
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,810
Come on.

337
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:40,910
What's wrong?

338
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,270
The Power of Ming Yue

339
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,750
is still in his body.

340
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,820
To be prepared for such a day,

341
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,620
I have never given up

342
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,300
the Power of Ming Yue in my body.

343
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,530
Now,

344
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,690
the Power of Cang Hai has been restored.

345
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,610
So, the Power of Ming Yue

346
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,790
has been restored by fate too.

347
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,130
I'm not that easy to kill.

348
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,640
If you want me to die,

349
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,450
you'll have to give up on your life too.

350
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,700
What do you think?

351
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:11,900
I'll wait for you in the Void.

352
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,300
Haoxuan.

353
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,650
You have nowhere to run.

354
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,190
If you follow the law obediently,

355
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,680
I can spare your life.

356
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,180
Follow the law?

357
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,520
Do you want me to abandon my cultivation,

358
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,170
be imprisoned in the wasteland of Hell,

359
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,920
bear eternal condemnation,

360
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,360
and be lonely forever?

361
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:49,920
Why should I?

362
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,510
Why should I admit my mistake?

363
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,050
What did I do wrong?

364
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,740
You're the one that's wrong.

365
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,580
Killing your brother

366
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,200
and disrespecting your elders

367
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:05,140
go against the order of things in Heaven.

368
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,390
As the God of War of the Heaven Realm,

369
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,720
I should uphold justice and the order of things in Heaven.

370
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,830
We are brothers.

371
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,990
I should stop you from making

372
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,320
those unforgivable mistakes.

373
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:19,980
Before you make a bigger mistake,

374
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,460
stop it now.

375
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,220
You have no right to speak ill of me.

376
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,540
One of you was born

377
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,370
as the supreme Moluo Empress of the six realms,

378
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,930
and the other was born a Golden Qilin.

379
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:33,950
What about me?

380
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,880
Have you ever thought about who I am

381
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:38,150
and how I feel?

382
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,940
I am the rightful leader of the six realms,

383
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,080
the supreme Lord of Heaven and Earth!

384
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,190
The two of you

385
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,800
can only submit to me!

386
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,670
Today,

387
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,430
I will show you

388
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,620
the results of rebelling against me.

389
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,180
If he can completely release the Power of Ming Yue,

390
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,910
the six realms

391
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,140
will be in chaos.

392
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,170
This time,

393
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,450
I must stop him.

394
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,430
Such a powerful evil aura

395
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,020
is enough to destroy the world.

396
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,380
Dark clouds are covering the sun.

397
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,390
It's a bad omen.

398
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,920
Sit tight, Your Highness.

399
00:28:52,790 --> 00:28:53,640
Prince Xiu Ming.

400
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,590
Prince Xiu Ming.

401
00:28:56,430 --> 00:28:58,040
Your spiritual power is gone now.

402
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,300
You will just die in vain if you go there.

403
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,380
Will the Empress be okay?

404
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,220
You lost.

405
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,930
I tried my best,

406
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,300
but in the end, I still failed.

407
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,220
I admit it.

408
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,390
But if you kill me,

409
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,790
Cang Hai can't live on either.

410
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,880
Will you choose

411
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:06,120
to kill the person you love

412
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,830
or to submit to me

413
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,830
for her?

414
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:17,450
It's your choice.

415
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,290
Your obsession

416
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,820
started because of me.

417
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,570
Now,

418
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,490
let me end it personally.

419
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,750
I have a third choice.

420
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,920
You brat.

421
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,500
Cang Hai is in danger.

422
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,100
Here, Red Thread Master.

423
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,570
How is Xiangzi?

424
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:56,470
Cang Hai...

425
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,660
The strength of Cang Hai's primordial spirit is sporadic.

426
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:02,490
What on earth happened?

427
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,490
Chu Kong.

428
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,030
Chu Kong.

429
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:12,850
Chu Kong.

430
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,760
What's going on?

431
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,740
A Soul-protecting Spell

432
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,630
only protects one person for a lifetime.

433
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,230
I did it.

434
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,260
No.

435
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,700
This can't be.

436
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,600
Are you kidding me?

437
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,740
You will be fine.

438
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,920
You will be fine.

439
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,390
You will be fine.

440
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,160
Don't waste your energy.

441
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,220
My primordial spirit has been destroyed

442
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,120
and my spirit is gone.

443
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,250
It's useless.

444
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:52,420
No.

445
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,220
This can't be.

446
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,150
You will be fine.

447
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,360
Have you forgotten?

448
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,480
You promised me.

449
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,600
We're now husband and wife.

450
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,030
We'll never be apart.

451
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,630
You promised me yourself.

452
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:11,610
We still have countless days and nights.

453
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,860
We still have to be together forever.

454
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:16,750
Even if our hair turn gray

455
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:18,260
and we become an old granny and grandpa,

456
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,840
we will never be apart.

457
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,410
Of course I haven't forgotten the promise.

458
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,580
We'll live and die together.

459
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,320
We'll never turn our backs on each other in this lifetime.

460
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,630
Unfortunately,

461
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,260
I can't grow old with you.
