00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,980
Let's go home.

196
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,500
Look.

197
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,740
I told you

198
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:25,980
that you needed

199
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,390
my

200
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:28,710
protection.

201
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,160
What is love?

202
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,860
It makes death an easy choice.

203
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:37,860
Congratulations, Lord Protector.

204
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,040
You'll succeed soon.

205
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,820
Zihui.

206
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,060
Lord Protector.

207
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,780
Luo.

208
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,720
I finally found you.

209
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,010
Do you mean

210
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,370
that the Saintess

211
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:13,960
lives in Yingshi's body?

212
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,930
Yingshi stayed in the Eastern Sea for too long

213
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,760
and went to the mortal world for tribulations

214
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,000
like those idiots in the Heaven Realm.

215
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,500
Unfortunately, she forgot one thing.

216
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,800
When the mortal body perishes,

217
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,570
the immortal mind will be revived.

218
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,590
Her primordial spirit will be repaired.

219
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,060
I

220
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,630
can feel it.

221
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,300
You've been hiding from me for so many years

222
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,090
but got exposed

223
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,000
because of a dumb stone.

224
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:52,020
Have you met the one

225
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,780
you'd give up everything for?

226
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,500
Unfortunately,

227
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,940
no matter where you are,

228
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,500
I'll find you.

229
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,980
Xiangzi.

230
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,300
Xiangzi.

231
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:26,700
You're finally back.

232
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,220
I missed you so much.

233
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,460
Xiangzi.

234
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:32,580
This time,

235
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,580
you went through so much.

236
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,590
Mortals' romances

237
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,740
should end in the mortal world.

238
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:41,330
Now that you're back,

239
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:45,130
stop feeling sad.

240
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:45,920
Silly girl.

241
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,310
You've come back.

242
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:47,890
Yes.

243
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,690
Don't worry about me.

244
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,510
I'm fine.

245
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,420
Okay.

246
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,700
Okay.

247
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,410
This tribulation

248
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,620
was excruciating.

249
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,460
His Divinity

250
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,220
will definitely blame me for it.

251
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,460
He won't.

252
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,330
You took an arrow to save Lu Changkong.

253
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,150
That was brave

254
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:09,930
and touching.

255
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,650
I don't think His Divinity will blame you.

256
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,540
I agree.

257
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,260
I agree.

258
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,550
How did you know that?

259
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,380
I…

260
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,500
I don't know anything.

261
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,380
How could you?

262
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,840
When I was struggling and suffering

263
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,710
in the mortal world,

264
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,630
you were chatting

265
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,540
and enjoying the show.

266
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,220
No, no, no.

267
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:28,860
That was not the case.

268
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,930
We didn't do that.

269
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:30,660
Definitely not.

270
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,300
Definitely not.

271
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,220
We watched the Chenyuan Mirror because we were worried about you.

272
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,390
We were so worried

273
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,460
that we couldn't sleep.

274
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,320
That's right.

275
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:41,590
Watching you two suffer

276
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,500
made us

277
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,370
overcome with grief.

278
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:46,780
Yes.

279
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:47,910
We wish

280
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,980
we could've changed your fates.

281
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,160
If you ask me,

282
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,140
it was all

283
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,230
Immortal Li's fault.

284
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,900
If you feel very sad,

285
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,060
go get even with him.

286
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,570
I agree

287
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,050
with that too.

288
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,260
Yes.

289
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,880
It was all Li's fault.

290
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,740
I'll settle the score with him.

291
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,290
Yes.

292
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:13,780
After I died,

293
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,200
how has Changkong been?

294
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,620
Lu Changkong…

295
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:22,570
Hope you won't be sadder after knowing it.

296
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,260
Xiangyun?

297
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:04,470
Is that you?

298
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,260
Why did you become like this for me?

299
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:21,610
I told you to go on with your life.

300
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,350
Look.

301
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,140
I kept my promise to you.

302
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,660
I didn't end my life.

303
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,040
If you're here,

304
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,910
can you come out to see me?

305
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:47,100
Let me have a look at you.

306
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:52,460
At least let me know

307
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,910
that I'm not alone in this world.

308
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,140
Xiangyun.

309
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:19,160
[Here lies my beloved wife Song Xiangyun]

310
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,070
Let me see him again.

311
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:37,840
I…

312
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,020
Xiangyun,

313
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,810
you're already dead

314
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,380
in that life.

315
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,520
If you meet him again,

316
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,540
the order of the six realms will be disturbed.

317
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:47,930
Chaos will be caused.

318
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,710
I just want to see him one last time.

319
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,270
I just need to know that he's alive.

320
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,230
He is alive.

321
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,090
At least he's alive at the moment.

322
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,730
Don't worry.

323
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,860
Yeah.

324
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,460
Immortal Chu Kong hasn't returned,

325
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,130
which means Lu Changkong is still alive.

326
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:11,610
Yes.

327
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,000
That's great.

328
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:48,960
[Marriage Pavilion]

329
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,730
I thought

330
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,300
for immortals whose lives are so long,

331
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,260
love tribulations

332
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:52,380
were like smoke that blew away very quickly.

333
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,990
But after I experienced one myself,

334
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,670
I realized

335
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:02,970
[Marriage Pavilion]

336
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,660
that every moment of it

337
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,640
and everyone I met

338
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,090
was destined.

339
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,790
Fate is inescapable.

340
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,080
From the moment we met,

341
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,890
our story began.

342
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,400
To know how it would end,

343
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:22,720
I experienced everything

344
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,160
to finally get the answer.

345
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,020
Love tribulations

346
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,830
can turn someone

347
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,620
into a completely different person.

348
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,020
A gentle and kind man

349
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,700
became crazy and obsessed

350
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,510
because of love

351
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,620
and paid with his life.

352
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,050
It's also because of love

353
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,060
that the invincible God of War

354
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,080
spent the rest of his life

355
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,610
missing his dead wife.

356
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:01,220
Hurry up.

357
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,300
We have no time to waste.

358
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,140
Lu Changkong is about to get wrinkles.

359
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,270
Okay.

360
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,830
Red Thread Master walks so slowly.

361
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,630
Mortals age.

362
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,600
It's normal for him to have wrinkles.

363
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:13,590
Why are you in such a hurry?

364
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:14,370
Calm down.

365
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,600
After His Divinity returns,

366
00:33:15,810 --> 00:33:16,810
you can take your time

367
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,770
to look at him

368
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:18,880
as closely as you want.

369
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,240
That's different.

370
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,180
Red Thread Master.

371
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,840
Fairies.

372
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,650
Nice to meet you.

373
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,050
Immortal Qian.

374
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,300
What are you doing here?

375
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,150
I've been busy with work

376
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,850
and came here as soon as I got time.

377
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,450
Hello.

378
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:36,700
Hey.

379
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:39,280
Immortal Qian.

380
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,320
His Divinity

381
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,890
is always cold.

382
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,950
He barely laughs

383
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,260
and doesn't talk too much.

384
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:46,910
You're his subordinate

385
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,980
but you're always so cheerful.

386
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,900
Why

387
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,090
is that?

388
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:55,550
As the God of War,

389
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,070
Immortal Chu Kong has to appear serious.

390
00:33:57,330 --> 00:33:59,050
If he always wears a goofy smile,

391
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,620
people will doubt if he can protect the six realms.

392
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,150
As for me,

393
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,480
I don't need to worry about that.

394
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:11,639
What time is it now?

395
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,750
Why hasn't the Goddess of Fate

396
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:14,699
come to activate the Chenyuan Mirror?

397
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,260
Just now,

398
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,050
the Goddess of Fate

399
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,920
sent someone to tell us

400
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,280
to wait for Immortal Chu Kong here.

401
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,560
Have I

402
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:22,670
gotten

403
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:23,580
the wrong idea?

404
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,510
Lu Changkong

405
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:28,440
is dead?

406
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,360
How could that happen?

407
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,050
Didn't he win a great victory and come back?

408
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,520
In the past few years,

409
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:36,310
Lu Changkong

410
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:37,510
fought countless wars

411
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,929
and got injured again and again.

412
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,350
After the war ended,

413
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,600
he suffered from depression.

414
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,750
The physician said he didn't have much time left.

415
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:49,949
I didn't expect it

416
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,750
to happen so soon.

417
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,750
Mortals

418
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,360
grow old and die.

419
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,620
As a mortal,

420
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,540
Lu Changkong

421
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,500
has done his best.

422
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:09,110
In that case,

423
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,790
His Divinity will come back very soon.

424
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:14,110
Let's go welcome him.

425
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,030
Don't look at me.

426
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,940
It's time for you to face it yourself.

427
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,380
I won't go with you

428
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,750
this time.

429
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:30,460
You

430
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:32,750
come to me every day.

431
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,010
Have you fallen in love with Immortal Chu Kong?

432
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,450
Of course not.

433
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,650
That's impossible.

434
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,190
Greetings, Your Divinity.

435
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:04,560
Your Divinity.

436
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,140
Your Divinity.

437
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:05,780
She's here.

438
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,340
Is she the fairy who had the love tribulation

439
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,340
with the God of War and Prince Xiu Ming?

440
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:25,480
Yes, it's her.

441
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:13,410
Don't forget

442
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,690
that Lu Changkong is just a role

443
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,950
Immortal Chu Kong played in this tribulation.

444
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,980
Everything Lu Changkong experienced

445
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,690
is just a love tribulation for Immortal Chu Kong.
