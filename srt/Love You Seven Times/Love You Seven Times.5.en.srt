00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,420
If you're in danger,

195
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,810
she'll rush to stand in front of you.

196
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,710
Normally,

197
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,490
she likes to play tricks on people.

198
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,870
I know about that.

199
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,530
But as long as she's happy,

200
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,720
I am happy.

201
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,780
The person you like

202
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,300
may not be as good as you think.

203
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,440
Impossible.

204
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
If I go into details,

205
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,740
I can go on for days to no end.

206
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,950
That's enough.

207
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,440
We'll end it here.

208
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,680
I haven't finished yet.

209
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,190
Stop.

210
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,930
Tell me when the time comes.

211
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,300
What time?

212
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,710
You'll know then.

213
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,730
I have something to do.

214
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,750
I have to go.

215
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,770
Xiangyun.

216
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,940
Last night,

217
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,420
you were not the only one

218
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,130
who couldn't sleep.

219
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,490
You didn't sleep well either?

220
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:23,980
You had a dream too?

221
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,400
Yes.

222
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,720
Because

223
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,310
I thought of you.

224
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,020
I really have something to do.

225
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,690
I have to go.

226
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,250
Look, Miss.

227
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,600
The daughter of the Minister of Military Affairs,

228
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:57,780
Zhuang Bingwan.

229
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,740
She's gentle, polite,

230
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,890
and she likes poetry.

231
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,130
How about

232
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,390
the second daughter of Deputy Minister of Rites,

233
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,410
Fu Chenshuang?

234
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,770
She has practiced martial arts since young.

235
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:15,190
She's skilled at horse riding too.

236
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,420
Normally,

237
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:20,020
she likes to play tricks on people.

238
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,390
I know about that.

239
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:24,380
But as long as she's happy,

240
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,510
I'm happy.

241
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,010
And this,

242
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,620
-Xie Huilan, daughter of Marquis Wuwei.
-I wonder

243
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,060
where he learned to

244
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,550
say that sweet nonsense.

245
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,930
Governor Ci's eldest daughter, Fan Xuehui.

246
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,440
She is a stunning beauty

247
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:41,700
who is good at qin, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

248
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,350
Actually, I know all about

249
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,260
your little tricks.

250
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:54,590
No, no.

251
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,780
I can't afford to offend the Eastern Sea.

252
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,170
I can't implicate the Marriage Pavilion either.

253
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,340
I'm just a fairy from the Marriage Pavilion.

254
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,180
Don't dream about it.

255
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,950
Wake up.

256
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,770
Forget it.

257
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,480
What do you mean forget it?

258
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,470
Miss...

259
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,800
I tried so hard

260
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,040
and went to great means

261
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,000
to get these pictures and information.

262
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:20,110
You didn't even look at them.

263
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,870
Please take a look

264
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,310
and pick one for Young Master Lu.

265
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,660
The second one down there.

266
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:34,280
We'll pick her.

267
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,850
Xie Huilan, daughter of Marquis Wuwei.

268
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,720
Are you sure?

269
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:42,370
Look.

270
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,690
She can do work, she can cook.

271
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,770
She can climb walls, she can win fights.

272
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:49,650
It's perfect.

273
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,270
Isn't this just another version of you?

274
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,230
What do you know?

275
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,890
I...

276
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,110
We'll pick her.

277
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:57,250
Well,

278
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,900
what should we do next?

279
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,240
One more.

280
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,340
How is the task

281
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,130
I asked you to do going?

282
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,160
Don’t worry, Young Master. It’s done.

283
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:44,930
Young Master, look.

284
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,510
Speaking of which, Young Master,

285
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,760
she sent me a reply

286
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,000
as soon as I sent her the letter.

287
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,280
Looks like Miss Song

288
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,750
was looking forward to it.

289
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,110
A beautiful day, with splendid scenery, and a dear companion.

290
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,440
With flowers in full bloom and a full moon, the wandering poet returns.

291
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,440
It's rare for us to be out.

292
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,400
Take Cui Bi with you

293
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:16,800
and have a good stroll.

294
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,780
To take a good stroll, you say?

295
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,640
For that,

296
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,310
I'll need...

297
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,380
Don't come back too early.

298
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,160
Okay.

299
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,980
Go.

300
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,060
I won't disturb you.

301
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,380
What a sudden surprise.

302
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,490
The ancient wooden block actually fell for it.

303
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,460
Now the time

304
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,170
and location are both right.

305
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:51,380
I just need the right person to complete the set.

306
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,860
Where is the beauty I ordered?

307
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,340
Where is the beauty I ordered?

308
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,470
Hurry up and take Miss Xie there.

309
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,250
Wait.

310
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,890
There are so many people here.

311
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:02,940
Are you sure

312
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,950
you can find Miss Xie Huilan?

313
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,180
Don't worry.

314
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:08,910
I've gathered all the information needed.

315
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,540
I even know

316
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,530
what clothes

317
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,460
and accessories

318
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,960
Miss Xie Huilan is wearing today.

319
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,780
And I’ve talked to

320
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,650
the maid of Xie’s Mansion.

321
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,590
The maid sent Miss Xie's reply.

322
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,930
She said if someone was willing to introduce them,

323
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,260
she would love to meet Young Master Lu.

324
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,500
I knew

325
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,850
you are popular with women.

326
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,900
Do you remember what I told you?

327
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,980
I'm a servant from the Lu Mansion.

328
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,220
Mr. Lu Changkong asked me to guide you there.

329
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:33,770
You're a good student.

330
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,530
Go.

331
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,330
Have you asked around?

332
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,700
Will he really be here?

333
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,970
I spent some silver

334
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,900
to get the exact information

335
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,940
from Young Master Lu's servant, Lu Fang.

336
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,420
So, he knows I'm back in the capital?

337
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:00,880
No.

338
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:02,090
Lu Fang just thought the information was

339
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,260
bought by one of Young Master Lu's admirers.

340
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,620
He didn't notice anything else.

341
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,230
That's good.

342
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,700
I want to see for myself

343
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,330
my cousin's expression when he first sees me.

344
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,100
He must be so surprised.

345
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,000
Help me take a look.

346
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,180
Is my makeup ok?

347
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,230
Many young masters and ladies

348
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,550
came to the lantern festival.

349
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,180
I heard

350
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,460
the young master of the Lu family

351
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,590
booked the entire Qiongfang Pavilion.

352
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,000
Is it for a lady?

353
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:46,820
I heard he was engaged to the daughter of the Song family.

354
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,290
It's probably for her.

355
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,620
What a perfect match.

356
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,410
Young Miss, maybe you don't have to wear it.

357
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,330
It's my fault. I, Xie Yingshi,

358
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,640
am just too beautiful.

359
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,900
If I just add a beauty mole to my looks,

360
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,010
my cousin will certainly love me.

361
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,140
My beauty mole!

362
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,390
What should I do?

363
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:21,270
It looks like a scar now.

364
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,650
Don't worry.

365
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,140
I'll get a basin of water.

366
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,300
A butterfly-and-flower hairpin,

367
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,050
and white pearl flowers.

368
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,470
Excuse me, are you Miss Xie?

369
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,490
What's the matter?

370
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,190
I'm a servant from Lu's Mansion.

371
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,710
Young Master Lu Changkong told me

372
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,060
to tell you that

373
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,580
he is waiting for you at Qiongfang Pavilion.

374
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:02,770
Wait.

375
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,140
What did you say?

376
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,790
Mr. Lu Changkong asked me to go there.

377
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,570
Of course.

378
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,040
Young Master Lu has long noticed you.

379
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,010
In fact,

380
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:14,280
he specially prepared a surprise

381
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,780
for you at Qiongfang Pavilion.

382
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,460
Specially prepared?

383
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,940
Looks like he still cares about me.

384
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,090
You go first.

385
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,380
I'll be right there

386
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,380
after some preparation.

387
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:31,740
Thank you.

388
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,720
You useless, clumsy bunch!

389
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,630
Is this how you do things?

390
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,340
If you hurt his Highness the third prince,

391
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,430
your death alone wouldn't be enough.

392
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,060
I'm so mad.

393
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,340
How is the task I assigned you going?

394
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,340
I found Miss Xie.

395
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,720
She's willing to go on a date with Young Master Lu.

396
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,170
Considering the time,

397
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,700
she should be with him by now.

398
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,610
Since ancient times,

399
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,670
the noble young masters and ladies

400
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,620
all used these tricks to date and fall in love.

401
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,190
Since he agreed to meet the dear companion,

402
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,300
it's time for us poets

403
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,140
to retire successfully.

404
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,050
Miss Xie Huilan!

405
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,940
Miss Xie Huilan!

406
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,220
Miss Xie Huilan. This way.

407
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,020
This name sounds familiar.

408
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:25,940
Exactly.

409
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,660
It's exactly the same as our candidate.

410
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,540
You are...

411
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,700
Miss Xie Huilan.

412
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,940
My young master invites you to...

413
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,360
A pink dress,

414
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,800
a butterfly-and-flower hairpin,

415
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,170
and white pearl flowers.

416
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,470
Why are they dressed the same?

417
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,500
Why are there two Miss Xie?

418
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,020
Oh no.

419
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,610
Who did you send over?

420
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,580
I...

421
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:47,280
This way, please.

422
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,000
Is it that one?

423
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:04,860
Why doe she

424
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,240
look so familiar?

425
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,580
I'll believe you one last time.

426
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:13,980
If anything goes wrong...

427
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,380
I won't make a mistake again.

428
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,700
Yingshi?

429
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,740
Miss Fairy?

430
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,350
Why do you call her Miss Fairy?

431
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,020
Is she the Yingshi you're looking for?

432
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,500
You did a good thing.

433
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:30,790
With her around,

434
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,280
the love tribulation can be resolved,

435
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,830
and the Nuwa Stone debt can be cleared too.

436
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,650
You have induced a good marriage.

437
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,390
But that's my love.

438
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,150
How dare you, Zihui.

439
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,980
How dare you use my money

440
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,450
to seek your own love?

441
00:24:47,630 --> 00:24:48,510
Wait, wait. Don't.

442
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,780
Listen carefully.

443
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,970
Bear with it no matter what happens.

444
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,350
Do you hear me?

445
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:00,100
Miss.

446
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,060
Look over there.

447
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,450
You brat!

448
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,220
What are you doing?

449
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,400
I'm not ready yet.

450
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:34,170
What?

451
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,280
I mean

452
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,950
Young Master Lu is not ready yet.

453
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:37,900
Miss,

454
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,180
may I have a word with you?

455
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,270
Did they go upstairs?

456
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,470
If Zihui

457
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:52,730
messes up,

458
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,900
I'll teach him a lesson.

459
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,180
Xiangyun?

460
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:01,710
I...

461
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,720
Why are you here so early?

462
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,880
I came at a bad time.

463
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,720
I won't disturb your important business.

464
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:12,880
What important business?

465
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,220
Didn't you promise

466
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,020
to go to the lantern festival with me?

467
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,780
Didn't you agree to go with a dear companion?

468
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,940
I mean...

469
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,050
Today is the lantern festival.

470
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,090
The business naturally refers to admiring the lanterns.

471
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,380
Such beautiful scenery at a perfect time,

472
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,300
it must be shared with a dear companion.

473
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,280
Let me ask you.

474
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,690
What is considered a perfect time and beautiful scenery?

475
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,780
The beautiful scenery

476
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,180
refers to these lanterns

477
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,460
and the stars in the sky.

478
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,900
The perfect time is...

479
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,540
Now.

480
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:46,260
I'm doomed.

481
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,720
I dragged myself right into it.

482
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,690
Let me ask you again.

483
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,110
What is a dear companion?

484
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:54,500
A dear companion...

485
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,060
Is the person you like.

486
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,580
I'm already here

487
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,460
with the person I like.

488
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,330
how can it not be considered an important business?

489
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,110
Why should you leave?

490
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:09,780
I...

491
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,220
I'm not leaving.

492
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,900
I'm just a little nervous.

493
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,850
There are some words

494
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,700
I've waited a long time to tell you.

495
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,260
I drafted them over and over again

496
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,380
and finally mustered the courage to tell you.

497
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,250
So, I prepared these things.

498
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,590
Follow me.

499
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,220
Come.

500
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,580
I think

501
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,300
it's time.

502
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,430
Time for what?

503
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,270
This is...

504
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,170
This is what we look like since we were young.

505
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:29,170
We grew up together.

506
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:30,680
You.

507
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,160
You're lively

508
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:32,870
and full of tricks.

509
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,660
I've been a little dull since I was a kid.

510
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,410
I always followed you

511
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:39,810
and looked up to you,

512
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,420
hoping that one day,

513
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,810
I can be the person to stand by your side,

514
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,870
take care of you,

515
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,220
and protect you.

516
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,020
In the blink of an eye,

517
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,060
we're old enough to get married.

518
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:52,780
You said

519
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,350
there are many possibilities in life.

520
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:56,680
There will be many choices and opportunities in the future.

521
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,400
I've thought about it for a long time.

522
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,010
I had you in my past.

523
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:04,270
So in the future,

524
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,820
I wish to have you by my side too.

525
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,200
I wish to have your heart

526
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:14,800
and never be apart.

527
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,470
This is my feeling for you.

528
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,220
My wish in this life

529
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,960
is to have children with you

530
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:24,020
in the future.

531
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,670
By then, there will be more joy and liveliness

532
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,780
on the turning lantern.

533
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,500
Li, oh Li...

534
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,290
Don't go too far.

535
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,330
You even added kids to the scenario.

536
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:37,310
I...

537
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,370
I've said all the things I prepared.

538
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,150
Think about it

539
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,930
for an hour before you answer me.

540
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,090
You're right, I need to think about this carefully.

541
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,440
We have a whole hour.

542
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,140
There's no rush.

543
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,070
Let me think about it.

544
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,100
Don't look at me.

545
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:06,250
I'll get nervous.

546
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:07,710
Turn around.

547
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,180
As you wish.

548
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,370
Xiangyun.

549
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,420
I...

550
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,790
The situation in the court is unstable.

551
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,780
The marriage between the Lu and Song family

552
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:31,670
is a big deal.

553
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,300
I think,

554
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,030
we should fix our wedding date

555
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,740
after the court is stabilized.

556
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,390
What do you think?

557
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:40,890
I think it's great.

558
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,460
This is a big matter.

559
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,680
We must consider it carefully.

560
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,210
You're not the only one who's nervous.

561
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,230
I'm actually very nervous too.

562
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,740
I keep thinking,

563
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,580
if you don't like what I have prepared

564
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:56,940
and rejected me,

565
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,660
if you don't want to have a future with me,

566
00:30:58,810 --> 00:30:59,890
what should I do?

567
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:01,890
I didn't expect

568
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:04,260
you to love me so much.

569
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,280
You even have our future planned out.

570
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,560
Xie...

571
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,370
Cousin!

572
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,300
Yingshi?

573
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:13,610
I...

574
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,230
Why are you here?

575
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,150
Didn't you ask me to come?

576
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,860
The one I invited is Xiangyun.

577
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:20,430
Cousin.

578
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,490
Xiang... Xiangyun.

579
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,610
She is my cousin.

580
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,740
I...

581
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:30,990
Come.

582
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:32,710
Cousin.

583
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,590
This is my fiancée, Xiangyun.

584
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,890
She's the daughter of the Song family.

585
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,760
Xiangyun?

586
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,900
Song Xiangyun?

587
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,940
Your marriage arrangement was just a casual promise

588
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:43,340
between Commander Song and Uncle when they were young.

589
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,380
It's not a legit engagement.

590
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,010
Cousin,

591
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,430
you don't have to force yourself to marry her

592
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,710
for Uncle's sake

593
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,700
and aggrieve yourself.

594
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,700
No one is aggrieved!

595
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,470
Don't spout nonsense.

596
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,230
My cousin and I are destined lovers.

597
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,140
Who... Who's your destined lover?

598
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:04,060
Xiangyun, don't listen to her.

599
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,090
Let me explain.

600
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,620
You don't need to explain. I understand.

601
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,460
If there is any misunderstanding between you two,

602
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,460
just make it clear.

603
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:11,540
No!

604
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,950
There is no misunderstanding.

605
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,520
No! I mean, this is a misunderstanding.

606
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,900
Listen to me.

607
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,200
You don't have to explain. I understand.

608
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,400
I didn't misunderstand.

609
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,900
I just don't want to intrude

610
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,030
on your bonding time anymore.

611
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,420
Xiangyun, if you are angry,

612
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,210
just scold me.

613
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,130
You don't have to say these things against your will.

614
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:33,700
I...

615
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:34,620
Let me explain.

616
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,380
What's there to explain to her?

617
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:36,930
I...

618
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,180
No!

619
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:42,530
I just...

620
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:43,860
And then you...

621
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:44,780
I...

622
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:45,760
I...

623
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,880
Xiangyun!

624
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:50,890
Xiangyun.

625
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,040
That annoying Xiangyun.

626
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,060
Why do he only care about her?

627
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:56,950
Cousin!

628
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:57,880
Miss Fairy!

629
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:58,850
Miss Fairy!

630
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,690
Miss Fairy!

631
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:03,470
Xiangyun!

632
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,740
Xiangyun.

633
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:06,180
Xiangyun.

634
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,280
Excuse me.

635
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:08,910
Cousin.

636
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:09,240
Xiangyun.

637
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,260
Miss Fairy!

638
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,100
Miss Fairy!

639
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:23,940
Xiangyun.

640
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,130
Your Highness, why are you here?

641
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,590
What are you guys doing?

642
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,400
We are...

643
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,140
playing hide-and-seek.

644
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,170
This...

645
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:40,720
Your Highness.

646
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,670
Why are you hurt?

647
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,090
It's nothing.

648
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,310
Cousin.

649
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,270
Cousin!

650
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,360
Miss Fairy.

651
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:58,850
All done.

652
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,380
It’s practical and pretty.

653
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,420
Your Highness.

654
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,440
What are you smiling at?

655
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,159
I think this injury was worth it.

656
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,270
In the palace,

657
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,989
no one has ever cared for me like this.

658
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,110
That's because

659
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:19,310
you saved Lu Changkong and me before.

660
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:22,989
I heard

661
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,380
you and Young General Lu

662
00:34:24,489 --> 00:34:25,770
have been engaged since childhood.

663
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,100
That's true.

664
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,659
Then, why did you

665
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:33,250
avoid Young General Lu

666
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,300
like a plague just now?

667
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:37,889
Could it be that

668
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:40,580
you don't like Young General Lu?

669
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,929
Not really.

670
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,159
But my relationship with Lu Changkong is complicated.

671
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,440
I'm afraid of trouble.

672
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,449
So,

673
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,110
I want to avoid this bond.

674
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,409
You're right.

675
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,300
Considering the current state of the Lu family,

676
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,260
I also think

677
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,390
it's better not to

678
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,630
be too involved with the Lu family.

679
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:04,770
Hasn't it always been the case?

680
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:05,960
Military families are

681
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,800
always fighting and killing.

682
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:07,660
What's so good about them?

683
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,680
If there's nothing else,

684
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,190
I'll take my leave.

685
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:20,280
Xiangyun.

686
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,640
Thank you for your help today.

687
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,940
If you have any difficulties in the future,

688
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,660
remember,

689
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:28,950
you can always come to me.

690
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,010
Thank you, Your Highness.

691
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,260
Xiangyun.

692
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,020
Song Xiangyun.

693
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,140
Cousin has been bewitched by her.

694
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,540
Now, I'll teach you a lesson!

695
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,530
Lü He.

696
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:17,180
Go!

697
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,570
Go now.

698
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:25,980
Song Xiangyun!

699
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,040
How dare you offend Miss Yingshi?

700
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,410
Someone fell into the water!

701
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:34,950
Look over there!

702
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:39,910
Excuse me.

703
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:46,030
That looked like Young General Lu.

704
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,530
Xiangyun!

705
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:46,920
Look.

706
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:50,210
No! No!

707
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,740
Let go!

708
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:51,940
You might get hurt!

709
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,570
Move!

710
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:53,590
Cousin!

711
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,510
Young Miss!

712
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:55,430
Your Highness!

713
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,210
Did someone just jump in again?

714
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:08,560
Young Miss!

715
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:10,860
Miss Fairy!

716
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,110
-Miss!
-I'll save you!

717
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,430
Your Highness, let's go back first.
