00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:46,740
I knew

5
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,539
you wouldn't forget me.

6
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:58,860
Chu Kong, can you promise me?

7
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,300
No matter what,

8
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,170
you can't abandon me.

9
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,570
We agreed to grow old together.

10
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,180
How could I bear to

11
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:11,500
abandon you

12
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,260
and let you be alone in this world?

13
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,110
You scared me just now.

22
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,160
Why is this Fate Book like this?

23
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,660
Why did Immortal Li tear these pages out?

24
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,220
What is he trying to hide?

25
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,190
Crabapple flower hair ornament?

26
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,650
That's why she looked so familiar the first time I saw her.

27
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,760
That's why she disappeared after Chu Kong died.

28
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:46,220
That's why the Protector of the Moluo Divine Clan, Jin Lian,

29
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,780
was so obedient to her.

30
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,980
That's why this love tribulation...

31
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,300
I wonder

32
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:01,050
how beautiful that fairy is,

33
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,060
to make the emotionally unavailable God of War, Chu Kong,

34
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,190
favor and appreciate someone so much

35
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,420
for the first time in 30,000 years.

36
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,180
I am very curious.

37
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,790
I haven't noticed or cared about

38
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,590
how that fairy

39
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,740
looks.

40
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,220
I just didn't expect that a love tribulation with her

41
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,420
would help restore my primordial spirit.

42
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:26,010
That's why you're the only one who can experience love tribulations with Chu Kong.

43
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,490
So,

44
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,460
you've already been resurrected

45
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,100
as the Divine Prophecy said.

46
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,640
You have obtained the Power of the Demon King.

47
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,280
I plan to go to the Void immediately.

48
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:51,900
Jin Lian.

49
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,170
I know you have a grudge against me.

50
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,110
But if I were to go on this trip...

51
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,280
I'll entrust

52
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,340
Xiangyun to you then.

53
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,260
Protecting the Empress

54
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,460
has always been the Moluo Divine Clan's duty.

55
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,570
Even if you don’t say it,

56
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,230
I will still do everything I can to protect Empress.

57
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,580
With these words of yours,

58
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,530
I can rest assured.

59
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:21,900
Chu Kong.

60
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,340
What's the matter?

61
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,700
Promise me

62
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,960
you will come back safely.

63
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,909
Don't worry.

64
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,290
Even if I'm entangled in thorns,

65
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,460
or even if it's a narrow escape,

66
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,710
I will successfully bring back

67
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,850
your Power of Cang Hai.

68
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,450
The lives of the living beings of the six realms are important,

69
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,020
but your life is also equally as important.

70
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,480
You must protect yourself.

71
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,530
I'll wait for you to come back.

72
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,720
Got it.

73
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,450
Bad news.

74
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,740
Just now,

75
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,450
Haoxuan has led tens of thousands of Heavenly soldiers and generals

76
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:12,890
to surround the Mystery Forest.

77
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,680
What?

78
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,150
Then Haoxuan made a threat,

79
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,730
asking for us to hand the Empress over immediately

80
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,400
or they'll destroy the Mystery Forest.

81
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,100
How did they come so quickly?

82
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,780
Although you have mastered the Power of the Demon King,

83
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,930
I'm afraid it's too late

84
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,260
even if you go to the Void right now.

85
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,840
Haoxuan is coming for me.

86
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,370
I can't implicate the Mystery Forest.

87
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,780
Empress, you can’t go.

88
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,780
Chu Kong, what are you doing?

89
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,659
Let me out!

90
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:46,659
Let me out!

91
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,600
So what if the Heavenly army is putting pressure on our borders?

92
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,950
This time,

93
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,090
I won't let you face it alone again.

94
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,320
After we've handled the situation,

95
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,800
I'll let you out.

96
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,110
Jin Luo. Jin Lian.

97
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:09,820
You...

98
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,070
We, the members of the Moluo Divine Clan,

99
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,420
are at your disposal.

100
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,750
Lead our army to fight the battle.

101
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,470
Yes.

102
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:25,530
Chu Kong.

103
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:27,150
Haoxuan is after me.

104
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,550
I can't run away like this

105
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:31,050
and let you all be implicated and suffer because of me.

106
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:33,710
Don’t forget

107
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,960
that I'm the Heaven Realm's God of War.

108
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:36,790
I'm also

109
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,930
his biological brother.

110
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,110
I should stop him from making another grave mistake.

111
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,390
But...

112
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,570
Enough.

113
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,860
Your primordial spirit hasn't been restored yet.

114
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,920
Even if you go out,

115
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,260
you won't be of much help.

116
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,860
Just stay here

117
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,690
and wait for me to return.

118
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:56,510
Chu Kong.

119
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,450
Chu Kong!

120
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,020
Your Majesty.

121
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:58,900
Chu Kong!

122
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,900
Chu Kong!

123
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,010
No.

124
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,480
Your Divinity.

125
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,940
Please allow the members of the Demon Clan in the Mystery Forest

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,170
to fight the battle with you.

127
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,700
Now that you know who I am,

128
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,300
you should know

129
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,510
this has nothing to do with the members of the Demon Clan.

130
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,170
The Demon Clan

131
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,590
is not allowed to get involved in this.

132
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,740
No individual can escape from the calamity its group is suffering.

133
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,050
Haoxuan is up to no good.

134
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,450
Even if all the members of the Demon Clan in the Mystery Forest hide,

135
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,580
we'd still be in danger.

136
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,039
Why don't we fight the battle with you?

137
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,220
Maybe then,

138
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,020
there'd still be a way out.

139
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:45,770
Let's go.

140
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:47,660
Chu Kong.

141
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,660
Chu Kong!

142
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,140
Chu Kong!

143
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,990
Chu Kong!

144
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,820
You're finally here.

145
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,850
Don't tell me you think

146
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,300
this mere magical barrier

147
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,430
can stop my Heavenly army of 100,000 men?

148
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,110
If you don't want

149
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,500
the Mystery Forest that's been peaceful for tens of thousands of years

150
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:54,490
to be destroyed in your hands,

151
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,680
just hand over the Empress.

152
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:59,040
Then I will show you mercy.

153
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,990
I'm afraid I'll have to let you down.

154
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,450
Although the Mystery Forest and the Moluo Divine Clan

155
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,810
are not as powerful as the Heaven Realm,

156
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,120
they are not as weak and vulnerable as ants.

157
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,070
Looks like

158
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,710
you are determined to go against me.

159
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,240
Then, I will destroy your magical barrier now.

160
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,560
Break their formation.

161
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,370
Yes.

162
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:47,910
The Mystery Forest and the Moluo Divine Clan

163
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,750
can't make such a huge sacrifice

164
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,330
for me again.

165
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,980
I advise you

166
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,200
not to waste your power.

167
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,770
If you continue,

168
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,710
your spiritual power will be depleted and you'll die.

169
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,620
What exactly is your relationship

170
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,860
with Cang Hai?

171
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,530
To protect her,

172
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,170
you're even risking your own life.

173
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,110
I also don't know what you're hiding your face for.

174
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,070
Then, let me

175
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,730
see who you really are.

176
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,930
Cang Hai?

177
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:06,970
Why are you here?

178
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,260
Go back now.

179
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:10,160
30,000 years ago, I just

180
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,700
casually helped your Demon Clan.

181
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,390
You've done enough for me.

182
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,200
We are even now.

183
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:18,230
We have nothing to do with each other anymore.

184
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,500
I'm the one you want.

185
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,860
It has nothing to do with them.

186
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,410
I’ll go with you.

187
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,470
Empress, you can't.

188
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,730
I won’t let you go with him.

189
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,440
This is not the time to be impulsive.

190
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,870
The Mystery Forest and the Moluo Divine Clan

191
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,030
can't be sacrificed for nothing because of me.

192
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:40,980
We should prioritize the overall situation.

193
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:43,050
You must hurry to the Void

194
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,560
and get my Power of Cang Hai back.

195
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,690
Only if we work together

196
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:48,230
can we defeat Haoxuan.

197
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,500
Otherwise, we,

198
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,050
including everyone in the Mystery Forest,

199
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,520
will die here.

200
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,330
Okay.

201
00:14:58,730 --> 00:14:59,660
Wait for me.

202
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,500
You must wait for me.

203
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,270
I can go with you.

204
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,080
But

205
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,180
you need to lead your 100,000 Heavenly soldiers and generals

206
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,200
to evacuate the Mystery Forest

207
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,470
and never step into it again.

208
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,720
Now that the magical barrier is broken,

209
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,580
what right do you have

210
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,850
to bargain with me?

211
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,770
Although the Mystery Forest and the Moluo Divine Clan are not as powerful as you,

212
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,500
we'll fight to the death.

213
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,540
You'll lose half of

214
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,400
your 100,000 Heavenly soldiers and generals.

215
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,300
Now, I'm willing to surrender

216
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,060
so that you can achieve your goal

217
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,440
without losing a single soldier.

218
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,630
Do you have to go into battle and cause destruction to both sides?

219
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:37,280
Is it worth it?

220
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,740
The Mystery Forest has always been peaceful with the six realms.

221
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,740
But you're paying such a heavy price

222
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,750
to break the magical barrier of this Mystery Forest.

223
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,440
Could it be that

224
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,010
there's a secret

225
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,920
in the Mystery Forest?

226
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,510
How could I

227
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:56,040
be concerned with the mere Mystery Forest?

228
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,420
If you surrender,

229
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,820
I'll pretend that

230
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,020
nothing happened today.

231
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,620
A catastrophe is brewing now that Cang Hai has been resurrected.

232
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,860
I shoulder the responsibility of maintaining the order of things in Heaven.

233
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,470
Fortunately, I haven't dishonored my mission

234
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:03,390
and have captured Cang Hai.

235
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:05,930
You must annihilate her soul quickly

236
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
so that she can never be resurrected again.

237
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,780
Message received.

238
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,420
Your Holiness!

239
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:18,530
Your Holiness!

240
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,050
Your Holiness!

241
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,310
Rumor has it that

242
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:23,890
the Fuyuan Fairy of our Marriage Pavilion

243
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,319
is a reincarnation of the devil Cang Hai.

244
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:28,670
That's absolute nonsense!

245
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,020
It's nonsense, Your Holiness.

246
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,540
Your Holiness, you must help me with this.

247
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,700
You must find out who fabricated this rumor.

248
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,140
It's actually not a rumor.

249
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,620
Fuyuan Fairy is Cang Hai.

250
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:46,760
How is that possible?

251
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,720
How is that possible?

252
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,140
Your Holiness, how is this possible?

253
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:53,760
Xiangyun

254
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,950
is a cloud that I personally enlightened.

255
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,460
How could she be the devil Cang Hai?

256
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,840
Your Holiness.

257
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,380
You must help me.

258
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:05,220
Someone is framing our Marriage Pavilion.

259
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,440
You don't know this,

260
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,630
but Cang Hai has always been very cunning.

261
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,940
In order to hide her identity,

262
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,540
she disguised herself as a fairy at the Marriage Pavilion

263
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,900
and hid in the Heaven Realm for thousands of years.

264
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900
I didn’t notice that either,

265
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,420
not to mention you.

266
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,220
This has nothing to do with your Marriage Pavilion.

267
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,460
This devil is so cunning.

268
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,540
She has deceived me for over 3,000 years.

269
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,670
Your Holiness.

270
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,420
What are you going to do with her?

271
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,860
I'll annihilate her soul first

272
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,910
so that she can no longer harm the six realms.

273
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:55,460
Your Holiness, this devil is really despicable.

274
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,760
It's too easy for her

275
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,450
to just kill her off like this.

276
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,700
The Red Thread Master is right.

277
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,310
Greetings, Your Holiness.

278
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,540
Are you here

279
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,880
for the matter of the devil Cang Hai too?

280
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,590
My entire Dixiu Divine Clan was wiped out by Cang Hai.

281
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,790
Cang Hai's crimes

282
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,070
are too numerous to even be recorded.

283
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,540
Just like what Red Thread Master said,

284
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,940
if we annihilate her soul in such a hurry,

285
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,400
wouldn't it be too easy a punishment for her to die like that?

286
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:37,630
After noon tomorrow,

287
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,930
it'll be the Heavenly Thunder Day.

288
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,940
When the Heavenly Gate opens,

289
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,420
the Heavenly Thunder can be induced to punish her

290
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,900
by breaking her bones and cracking her soul,

291
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,400
such that she suffers extreme pain until she dies.

292
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,490
Only then can my hatred be relieved.

293
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,770
Prince Xiu Ming, what you said

294
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,510
echoes my thoughts exactly.

295
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,180
Only by severely punishing Cang Hai

296
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,110
can Your Holiness show that you're fair and strict.

297
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:05,940
Moreover,

298
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,460
in order to catch this devil

299
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,140
and for the peace of the six realms,

300
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,940
you've greatly exhausted yourself.

301
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,180
How could such a great achievement

302
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,220
not be announced to the six realms?

303
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,400
We must let them witness

304
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:20,630
how you annihilate this devil.

305
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,500
In this way,

306
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,220
the six realms that were once hurt by the devil

307
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,860
will deeply remember your benevolence.

308
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,280
Your Holiness, the Red Thread Master is right.

309
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:39,190
If we can put the devil to death in public,

310
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,210
we can also scare those despicable people.

311
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,920
In the future, they will not dare to disrespect the Heaven Realm.

312
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,100
You are right.

313
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:54,030
In that case,

314
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,100
after noon tomorrow,

315
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,410
Cang Hai's public trial will be held.

316
00:20:58,070 --> 00:21:00,200
When the six realms know about her crimes,

317
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,150
we'll use the whips of the Heavenly Thunder

318
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,140
to annihilate her soul.

319
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,500
That's a wise decision, Your Holiness.

320
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,480
Xiangyun.

321
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,420
H-How did you get in?

322
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,540
Thanks to the help of Immortal Sun,

323
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,210
I got the opportunity to come here.

324
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,330
Don't waste your energy.

325
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,430
Haoxuan set up this magical barrier himself.

326
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,380
Except him,

327
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,540
no one else can break it.

328
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,060
Even if you manage to break it,

329
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,560
I won't leave with you.

330
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,860
You'd better leave now.

331
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:58,220
If someone finds out,

332
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,360
you'll be in danger.

333
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,300
As long as I can save you,

334
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,780
so what if

335
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,700
they kill me?

336
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,300
Xiangyun.

337
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,250
The Red Thread Master and I finally persuaded Haoxuan

338
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,700
to agree to a public trial at the main hall

339
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,840
after noon tomorrow.

340
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,560
There’s not much time left.

341
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,460
You must leave the Heaven Realm as soon as possible.

342
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,460
Go as far as you can.

343
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,940
Haoxuan will interrogate me in a public trial?

344
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:20,700
Yes.

345
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,780
But this is just a temporary measure.

346
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,720
I will definitely find a way

347
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,560
to get you away before that.

348
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,590
Then all the more should I not leave.

349
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,460
Why?

350
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,140
I want to expose

351
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,830
Haoxuan's true identity in front of everyone.

352
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,610
I want everyone in the six realms

353
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,220
to know the truth from 30,000 years ago.

354
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,420
You want to use the public trial

355
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,840
to expose Haoxuan's conspiracy?

356
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,460
As long as Haoxuan is still alive,

357
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,260
the dead souls who died in his hands

358
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,060
will not rest in peace.

359
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,260
The six realms will also not be able to gain true peace.

360
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,890
But Haoxuan

361
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,980
is currently the God of Heaven Realm

362
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,220
and skilled at disguise.

363
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,500
I'm afraid it won't be easy

364
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,590
to expose his true identity.

365
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,950
In Changning Palace,

366
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,180
there's an ancient magical instrument called the Xuantian Mirror.

367
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,910
It can reveal the truth from 30,000 years ago

368
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,030
to the public.

369
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,940
Unfortunately,

370
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,610
that sly old fox, Haoxuan,

371
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,700
schemed such that the Xuantian Mirror is now destroyed.

372
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,760
The Xuantian Mirror?

373
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,930
The Xuantian Mirror is an ancient magical instrument.

374
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,990
Even Haoxuan

375
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,380
wouldn't be able to destroy it completely.

376
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,980
As long as the Xuantian Mirror still has a trace of spiritual power,

377
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,390
I can try to repair it.

378
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:33,750
Really?

379
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:35,980
Leave this

380
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,520
to me.

381
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,500
Then you have to take care of yourself.

382
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,220
Your Highness, it's time to go.

383
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,940
Xiangyun.

384
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:46,920
Wait for me.

385
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,410
Xiu Ming, you must be careful.

386
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,380
The Xuantian Mirror is badly damaged.

387
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,530
How are you going to repair it?

388
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,570
Are you crazy?

389
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,180
You used your heart to nourish the Xuantian Mirror.

390
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,900
Your spiritual power will be greatly damaged.

391
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,130
Even if this mirror is repaired,

392
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:33,090
you'll be dead, you know?

393
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,020
As long as I can clear the name of Cang Hai,

394
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,200
so what if it

395
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,030
kills me?

396
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,180
Thank you so much.

397
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,360
I must make sure all this fate

398
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:19,640
is completely destroyed.

399
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,690
Your Holiness.

400
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,060
Your medicine is here.

401
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,000
You may leave.

402
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,460
Yes.

403
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,990
30,000 years ago,

404
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,590
you were the Moluo Empress.

405
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,200
You were supposed to set an example

406
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,920
by shouldering the responsibility of maintaining the order of things in Heaven.

407
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,500
But you willingly

408
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,740
descended into the Devil Realm

409
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,390
and committed numerous and unredeemable

410
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,260
heinous crimes.

411
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,240
In the past,

412
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,590
if I hadn't

413
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:38,420
led all the clans in the six realms

414
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,170
to fight the battle,

415
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,200
the six realms would have been destroyed by you.

416
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:48,190
Today, all clans in the six realms are gathered here

417
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,610
to hold you accountable and seek justice.

418
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,980
Why isn't Prince Xiu Ming here yet?

419
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,530
It's so beautiful.

420
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,770
Cang Hai.

421
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,360
This time,

422
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:36,940
I'll definitely keep you safe.

423
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,740
You must hurry to the Void

424
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,210
and get my Power of Cang Hai back.

425
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,540
Only if we work together

426
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,270
can we defeat Haoxuan.

427
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,860
You must wait for me.

428
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,510
Xiangyun.

429
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:18,230
Cang Hai.

430
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,090
Hurry and plead guilty

431
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,720
to comfort

432
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,180
the souls who were killed by you.

433
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,060
We both clearly know what the truth

434
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,760
from 30,000 years ago is.

435
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,060
Should it be me

436
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,070
or you

437
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,290
who should confess?

438
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,140
Whether you admit it or not,

439
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,180
everyone in the six realms

440
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,920
is aware of this matter.

441
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,920
The evidence is solid.

442
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,140
This...

443
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,490
It's noon.

444
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,060
I...

445
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,060
will enforce justice on behalf of Heaven.

446
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,330
This...

447
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,130
Cang Hai.

448
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,700
I'll let you experience

449
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,210
the pain of suffering.

450
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,250
Almost there.

451
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:09,360
Give me another 15 minutes.

452
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,550
It's already noon.

453
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,750
The Heavenly Thunder punishment is about to begin.

454
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,670
This won't do.

455
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,700
I have to rush there

456
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,000
and try to buy time.

457
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,870
I want to see

458
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,250
how many whips of the Heavenly Thunder

459
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,460
you can endure.

460
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:17,540
Your Holiness!

461
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,500
Your Holiness.

462
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,080
I'd like to personally execute the punishment in the stead of the Dixiu Divine Clan's members

463
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,280
who died wrongfully.

464
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,150
What do you mean?

465
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:41,740
The whole of my Dixiu Divine Clan was destroyed by Cang Hai.

466
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,220
If I can't kill the culprit myself,

467
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,630
how can I face

468
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:47,150
the innocent people of my clan who died wrongfully?

469
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:52,960
Fine.

470
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,460
I'll give this opportunity

471
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,700
to you then.

472
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,540
I'll let you avenge

473
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,670
your Dixiu Divine Clan.

474
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,500
Thank you, Your Holiness.

475
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:24,159
As you all know,

476
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,860
the Dixiu Divine Clan

477
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,770
was loyal to the Moluo Divine Clan.

478
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:33,480
They even willingly sent me

479
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,199
to the Moluo Divine Clan as a hostage.

480
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,600
But in the end,

481
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,760
why did it get to the stage where my entire clan was wiped out?

482
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:43,219
30,000 years ago,

483
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,770
what exactly happened?

484
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,610
Since you'd long been scheming to destroy the Dixiu Divine Clan,

485
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,530
why did you take such good care of me?

486
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,540
Tell me.

487
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,460
As Moluo's Empress, the head of the six realms,

488
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:00,230
why did you become a devil who committed countless murders?

489
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:03,260
It's been 30,000 years.

490
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:05,750
A full 30,000 years.

491
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,230
These questions

492
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,200
are like a sharp knife

493
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,670
ruthlessly stabbed into my heart,

494
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:14,350
penetrating my blood and bones.

495
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,740
They've rotted and become maggots

496
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,860
and torture me day and night.

497
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:19,780
Finally,

498
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,940
you showed up again.

499
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:26,780
I finally have the chance to ask you in person.

500
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:28,980
Why

501
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,420
did you do all this?

502
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,460
Xiu Ming.

503
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,420
Stop wasting your time.

504
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,210
Be swift.

505
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,670
Take action now.

506
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,400
You are the key to exposing Haoxuan.

507
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,050
You can't let him suspect you.

508
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,460
The Xuantian Mirror still needs some time

509
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,740
before it's completely repaired.

510
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,000
Cang Hai.

511
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,700
I'm sorry.

512
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,130
This whip

513
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,050
is for causing confusion in me

514
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,220
that led to sleepless nights.

515
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,170
This whip

516
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,880
is for the unresolved grievances

517
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,940
of the Dixiu Divine Clan.

518
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,680
Cang Hai.

519
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,240
I advise you to plead guilty now

520
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,370
so you don't have to suffer the torture anymore.
