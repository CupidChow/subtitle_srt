00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,360
Miss.

198
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,320
Prince Xiu Ming?

199
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,610
We meet again.

200
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,390
Young Master.

201
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,750
Young Master, hold on.

202
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,340
Young Master.

203
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,580
Go send for a physician.

204
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:16,860
Yes.

205
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,460
Hurry.

206
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,300
Thank you

207
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,610
for helping us today.

208
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,300
You're welcome, Miss Xiangyu.

209
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,690
General Lu is my friend.

210
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,870
I should help him.

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,600
Prince Xiu Ming must have

212
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,930
taken the Water of Amnesia too.

213
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:37,090
Your Highness,

214
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,760
why are you staring at me?

215
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,770
Miss Xiangyun,

216
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,660
you remind me of my sister.

217
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,510
She's bored in the palace

218
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:46,620
and needs a friend like you

219
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,070
who's cheerful and outgoing.

220
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,100
I wonder if you can visit her

221
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,420
when you have time.

222
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,860
Of course.

223
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:55,500
You saved

224
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:56,570
my and Lu Changkong's lives.

225
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,060
Besides,

226
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,930
when we were in the Heaven Realm…

227
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,310
Anyway,

228
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:03,940
in the future,

229
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,740
if you need my help,

230
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,580
just say it.

231
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,980
I'll spare no effort

232
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,860
to help you.

233
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,220
Okay.

234
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:16,930
Then

235
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:18,560
I'll take my leave.

236
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,660
Mind your step, Your Highness.

237
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,590
Song.

238
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,340
You knew the danger

239
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,950
but still took Changkong to that remote place.

240
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,850
How should I explain to his father?

241
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,700
I didn't know those were real assassins.

242
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,010
You think you did nothing wrong?

243
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,550
I almost got hurt too.

244
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,320
Don't you care about me at all?

245
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:43,970
You…

246
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,220
Come back!

247
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,340
Mr. Lu.

248
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,130
Madam Lu.

249
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,460
General Lu's life is not in danger.

250
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,380
He's just badly injured

251
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,690
and needs time to recover.

252
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,550
Okay. Thank you.

253
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,630
I'll leave.

254
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:02,940
Okay.

255
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,050
[Song Mansion]

256
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,340
What happened?

257
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,620
What I wanted was a show,

258
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,060
not a real assassination!

259
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,980
I almost got killed!

260
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,250
Those guys I hired

261
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:35,930
didn't go to you.

262
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,140
So not everyone in the mortal world

263
00:13:38,290 --> 00:13:40,010
is as kind as you.

264
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,840
I paid them but they ran away

265
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,210
without doing their job.

266
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,180
You're such a big fool.

267
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,600
How can I trust you with anything?

268
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,980
Calm down, Miss.

269
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,450
Calm down?

270
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,340
How can I calm down?

271
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,700
My life was hanging by a thread!

272
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,440
Never mind.

273
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,050
I should calm down. Calm down.

274
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,010
[Lu Mansion]

275
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,820
I have no other choice now.

276
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:17,290
Just keep on acting.

277
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,460
Immortal Chu Kong must not know

278
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,800
that I drank Anti-Memory-Erasing.

279
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,820
Or I'll die even more miserably.

280
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,060
Lu Changkong.

281
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,250
Wake up.

282
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,630
Don't die.

283
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,580
How can I live

284
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,220
without you?

285
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,740
Lu Changkong.

286
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,300
You're awake.

287
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,570
You just said

288
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,630
you can't live

289
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,540
without me.

290
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,360
No.

291
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,220
Lu Changkong.

292
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:22,990
I'm sorry.

293
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,650
If I hadn't led you to that remote road,

294
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,400
you wouldn't have gotten hurt.

295
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,720
It's not your fault.

296
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,420
It's mine.

297
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,460
Sorry to scare you.

298
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,460
Look at them.

299
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,690
The Marriage Pavilion

300
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,700
will soon have a powerful backer.

301
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:57,880
Red Thread Master.

302
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,490
Congratulations.

303
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,950
It's all thanks to you.

304
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,420
Congratulations to you too.

305
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,220
When Xiangzi and Immortal Chu Kong

306
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,000
get married

307
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,770
and become the perfect couple in the Heaven Realm…

308
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:13,680
We'll be

309
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,390
relations of the God of War!

310
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:17,940
Come on.

311
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:18,840
Cheers.

312
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,540
Xiangyu, you're so good at acting.

313
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,610
If I didn't know you took Anti-Memory-Erasing,

314
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,730
I'd be fooled by you.

315
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,930
My mother gave me this longevity jade pendant.

316
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,950
She wanted it to bring me good fortune

317
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,820
and longevity.

318
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:46,650
Take it.

319
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:51,580
You must live a long life.

320
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,140
Xiangyun,

321
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:00,080
you're so nice to me.

322
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,089
Does it hurt?

323
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:19,810
No.

324
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:29,750
I'll blow on it.

325
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,120
The pain will go away.

326
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,610
Why is your hand

327
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,800
so badly injured?

328
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,340
I hope

329
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,640
it won't affect your performance in the royal tournament.

330
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,020
But don't worry. I got you.

331
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,080
I'll take good care of you.

332
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,500
Do you mean it?

333
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,360
If that's the case,

334
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,260
no matter how badly I got injured,

335
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:06,720
it was worth it.

336
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,540
Just keep in mind that I'm very nice to you.

337
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:11,420
Please

338
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,350
don't kill me in the future.

339
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:18,960
Silly.

340
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,170
I'll protect you at all costs.

341
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,860
Why would I kill you?

342
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,210
Then,

343
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:31,120
pinky swear.

344
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,420
Go ahead.

345
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:40,750
With heaven and earth as witnesses,

346
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,320
no matter what happens,

347
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,830
you, Lu Changkong,

348
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,210
can never kill Xiangyun.

349
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,110
You'll keep this promise forever.

350
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:49,210
Wait.

351
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,380
What kind of promise is that?

352
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,330
Just tell me if you'll promise that.

353
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,450
I promise.

354
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,330
Are you feeling better?

355
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:13,310
Sorry, my lord.

356
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,460
He escaped.

357
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:15,740
I'll accept any punishment.

358
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:17,840
Trash.

359
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,900
It was such a good opportunity

360
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,140
but you let him escape.

361
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,410
I'm terribly sorry, my lord.

362
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,290
Please give me some time.

363
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,130
I can definitely kill him.

364
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,460
I'll make this tribulation

365
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,660
the death of him.

366
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,290
Forget it.

367
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,450
He's the only Jin Qilin in the six realms.

368
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,030
Even if he has no magic and memory in this life,

369
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,480
he's hard to deal with.

370
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,250
Remember.

371
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,940
Proceed with caution.

372
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,210
Don't let him get suspicious.

373
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,100
Otherwise,

374
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,990
not only can't we kill him,

375
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,040
but also he may get in my way

376
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,870
after he regains his memory.

377
00:19:59,300 --> 00:19:59,700
Yes.

378
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:00,820
I will

379
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,820
keep it in mind.

380
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,980
[Lu Mansion]

381
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,040
Dad.

382
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,140
Is your hand better?

383
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:27,540
The medicine worked well.

384
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,060
I feel much better.

385
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,000
Good.

386
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,030
Who do you think

387
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,920
is behind this?

388
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,390
Armor of the Criminal Investigation Bureau?

389
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,560
Could it be Commander Feng?

390
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,850
Commander Feng is close with the Second Prince

391
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,130
who always looks down on the Lu family.

392
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,760
I think

393
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,810
it was very likely the Second Prince's doing.

394
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,910
I'm shocked that he's so bold.

395
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:58,670
Dad.

396
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,620
The princes have all grown up.

397
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,100
You're not involved in

398
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:05,710
their fight for the throne, are you?

399
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,740
The balance in the court may be tipped anytime

400
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,190
and the Lu family is walking a razor's edge.

401
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,020
I know

402
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,420
what I'm doing.

403
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,320
Just focus on your recuperation.

404
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,430
The royal tournament is coming.

405
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,500
Your elders have high hopes for you.

406
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,410
Don't let them down.

407
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:30,500
By the way,

408
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,300
the Third Prince sent

409
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,860
some valuable herbs to you.

410
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,800
When you meet him,

411
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,940
don't forget to thank him.

412
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,020
Prince Ning?

413
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,980
You don't know it?

414
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,180
It's Prince Ning and Xiangyun

415
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,130
who sent you back.

416
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,030
How did he know?

417
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:47,950
All right.

418
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:49,500
Take a good rest.

419
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,080
Wish talismans.

420
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,320
Come on.

421
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,470
Take a look.

422
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,720
Wish talismans.

423
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,660
That one?

424
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,330
Wish talismans.

425
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,860
They can fulfill all your wishes.

426
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,260
Come and take a look.

427
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:17,900
Wish talismans that can fulfill all your wishes.

428
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:18,540
Here.

429
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,700
Have a look.

430
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,170
Have a look.

431
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,150
Sir.

432
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,300
Come and take a look.

433
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,200
Take a look.

434
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,900
They can fulfill any wish?

435
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:31,700
Yes.

436
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,430
Write the name of the girl

437
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,020
you love on it

438
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,110
and hang it on the Wish Tree in the marriage temple ahead.

439
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,540
Before long,

440
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:42,800
all your wishes will come true.

441
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,540
Great. I'm looking for someone.

442
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,480
Looking for someone?

443
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,150
[Xie Yingshi, daughter of the Xie family]

444
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,060
Miss.

445
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,640
[Lü He, maid of the Xie family]

446
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,460
I saw a young man

447
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,700
looking for you with copies of your portrait.

448
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,140
He gave one to whoever he met

449
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,920
and asked them if they knew Miss Yingshi.

450
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,540
[Lu Mansion]

451
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,300
Take this

452
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,260
to Wenkang.

453
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:23,860
Yes.

454
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,250
Young Master.

455
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,140
Young Master.

456
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,570
Miss Song is here.

457
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,690
She wants to make soup for you.

458
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,620
Really?

459
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:41,830
Where is she?

460
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:42,680
Young Master.

461
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,260
You're so smart

462
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,180
but become dumb when it comes to her.

463
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,420
I…

464
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,460
Young Master.

465
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,120
If you want to see Miss Song often,

466
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,580
you should go lie down on the bed.

467
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,900
I grew up with Xiangyun.

468
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:03,110
I don't need to do that.

469
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:04,310
Young…

470
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,130
Then I'll invite Miss Song in.

471
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,800
Go.

472
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,660
Yes.

473
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,680
Young Master.

474
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:19,980
Young Master.

475
00:24:22,450 --> 00:24:23,610
Young Master, Miss Song…

476
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,540
Xiangyun.

477
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,740
Xiangyun.

478
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:28,700
I'm here.

479
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:29,650
I'm here.

480
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,080
Xiangyun.

481
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:35,980
Careful.

482
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,260
I thought

483
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:40,050
I could never see you again.

484
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,520
What are you talking about?

485
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,980
You'll be fine.

486
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,420
You were fine yesterday.

487
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,220
Why has his condition worsened today?

488
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,070
Young Master is very sick

489
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,110
and the pain keeps coming back.

490
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,910
I think

491
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,700
there may be internal injuries.

492
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:00,910
Internal injuries?

493
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,560
Do you expect me to believe that?

494
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,000
Have you taken me as a fool?

495
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,380
You'll pay for lying to me.

496
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,550
Internal injuries?

497
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:08,860
Go get him some water.

498
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:09,530
Okay.

499
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,120
Kong, are you alright?

500
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,010
Miss Song.

501
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,700

502
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,150
Young Master.

503
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,760
Your arm…

504
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:23,540
Seriously?

505
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,400
Anyone can see that you're acting.

506
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,010
You're the worst actor I've ever seen.

507
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,880
You can't feel your arm?

508
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:30,980
No, I can't.

509
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,940
So in the future,

510
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,060
you have to

511
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,180

514
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,330
How could this happen?

515
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,280
You really

516
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,520
can't feel your arm?

517
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,620
No.

518
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,610
You won't drop the act?

519
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,580
Let's see how long you can keep pretending.

520
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:12,020
Do you feel anything?

521
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,480
No.

522
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,570
Not at all.

523
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,330
You're quite tolerant.

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,400
What should we do?

00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,460

526
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,620

-What should we do?
-I'm fine.

00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,060
Lu, I heard that you've been sick for long,

539
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,140
so I came to visit you.

540
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,170
It's a bit embarrassing to say this,

541
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,210
but I was sickly when I was young.

542
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,180
So I learned a lot of remedies.

543
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,350
Let me check on Lu.

544
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,780
Prince Ning will call your bluff.

545

546
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,070

Please check on him, Prince Ning.

550
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,140
No need.

557
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,380
Can you feel it now?
