Master.

Master.

6
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,740
Why are you in the wheelchair again?

7
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,410
Are you feeling unwell?

8
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,700
Xiaoxiang.

9
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,950
Have a walk with me

10
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,650
by the lake.

11
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:10,940
Okay.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,420
The scenery here

13
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,900
is so beautiful.

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,960
♫The moonlight must be you♫

15
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,030
♫Laying the groundwork for emotions♫

♫Soft but firm♫

00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,350
♫The mist must be you♫

18
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,850
♫Soaking up my emotions♫

19
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,450
♫It's your sigh♫

20
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:51,090
♫But I can't explain these contradictory feelings♫

21
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:55,710
♫Actually yearning for me to cherish or delete them♫

22
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,470
♫You're just passing by♫

23
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,320
♫My heart ripples along, how fascinating♫

24
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,420
Can you skip stones?

25
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:04,980
Yes.

26
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:09,860
♫I want to ask, who has the maze to great love♫

27
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,480
♫Let me close my eyes♫

28
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,040

♫I dare not ask, so let me be half awake♫

Master, look.

35
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,490
♫I decided in an instant♫

36
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:37,190
♫Compared to having you♫

37

38

♫It's more touching♫

39
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:00,790
Look.

40
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,910
My stone skipped one more time than yours.

41
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,210
What do you think?

42
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,510
Shall we keep playing?

43
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,860
No.

44
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,320
You're not feeling well

45
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,440
but still so good at skipping stones.

46
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,380
I'm fine.

47
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,560
I'm worried about you.

48
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,410
You locked yourself in the room

49
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,360
and wouldn't come out.

50
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,800
I asked Qian Ren to go over

51
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,600
all the romantic novels he collected

52
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,460
and throw away those you shouldn't read.

53
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,580
As for those disciples

54
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,940
who made fun of you,

55
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,780
I beat them up.

56
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,210
You beat them up?

57
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,640
As the Sect Leader,

58
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,220
I have the responsibility to keep everything in order.

59
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,750
Straightening them out

60
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,830
is my job.

61
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,780
Master.

62
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,020
Thank you.

63
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,350
Those foolish boys were out of their minds.

64
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,580
How could they make fun of you?

65
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,460
They deserved to be taught

66
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,390
a hard lesson.

67
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:05,720
Did you see that?

68
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,020
Seven skips.

69
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,080
Seven!

70
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,440
That was the perfect stone skipping!

71
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,260
Master.

72
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,680
You lied to me.

73
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,790
What do you mean?

74
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,390
Master,

75
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,860
you said you had a heart attack.

76
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,020
I did

77
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,310
but I've recovered.

78
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,760
Then…

79
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,090
Why are you in the wheelchair?

80
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:38,990
I…

81
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:43,560
I'm just

82
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,600
lazy.

83
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,600
Are you angry with me?

84
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,540
Isn't it obvious?

85
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,670
My bad.

86
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,400
You can ask me to do one thing for you.

87
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,420
Okay?

88
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,990
Anything?

89
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,610
Anything.

90
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,960
Then I hope

91
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,880
your heart disease can be cured.

92
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,160
I also hope

93
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,460
that in the future,

94
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,310
you can eat like a pig,

95
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,750
be as strong as a horse,

96
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
and have more strength than a bull.

97
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,360
That doesn't sound flattering.

98
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,620
I just hope

99
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,260
you can be healthy

100
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:32,640
and when I push your wheelchair in the future,

101
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,140
you can jump up and say,

102
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:36,080
"I'm just lazy."

103
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,720
Master.

104
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,560
Are you okay?

105
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,390
Are you joking with me?

106
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,230
Master,

107
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,830
are you having a heart attack again?

108
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,290
My heart is beating a bit fast.

109
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,060
It doesn't hurt at all.

110
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,430
I'm fine.

111
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,330
Is your heart beating fast

112
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,550
because of me?

113
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,610
As I'm about to turn 20,

114
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,430
my Linglong Heart

115
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,210
is getting weaker and weaker.

116
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,840
Is it because

117
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,900
I used too much of its power?

118
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,159
Sect Leader,

119
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,040
I think

120
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:57,980
your heartbeat

121
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,900
has been irregular recently

122
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,840
because of Xiaoxiang.

123
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,890
Because of Xiaoxiang?

124
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,670
Yes, Sect Leader.

125
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,480
You're in love.

126
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:19,130
What are you talking about?

127
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,320
What's wrong with me?

128
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,700
You've fallen in love with Xiaoxiang.

129
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:30,300
No.

130
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,440
Impossible.

131
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,210
How is that possible?

132
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,990
According to the plan,

133
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,039
it should be Xiaoxiang falling in love with me.

134
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,330
I'm not sure of that.

135
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,650
But both of us can see

136
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,910
that you're in love with Xiaoxiang.

137
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,740
Shut up!

138
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,200
Qian Mou.

139
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,370
No matter what happens,

140
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,260
I'm determined to get her Linglong Heart.

141
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,310
That won't change.

142
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,150
I hope you can reconsider it.

143
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:20,820
I've thought it through.

144
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,580
But it's true that…

145
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,740
Shut up.

146
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:24,950
No matter what,

147
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,240
I'll get her Linglong Heart.

148
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,990
Why did he

149
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,120
repeat the same thing so many times

150
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,860
as if we couldn't understand it?

151
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,160
You fool.

152
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,100
He repeated that to himself.

153
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,340
What did you say?

154
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:50,940
Nothing.

155
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,750
I didn't say anything.

156
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,720
Your hand hurts?

157
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,910
Your arms are too weak.

158
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,100
You just started learning martial arts

159
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,080
and can easily get injured.

160
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,610
So you must tie the band

161
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,650
around your wrist tight.

162
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,700
Or you'll get hurt.

163
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,220
Keep it in mind.

164
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,620
Master.

165
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,920
Is there a way

166
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,680
to build internal power quickly?

167
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,930
It takes time to build internal power.

168
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,000
Disciples who have strong internal power

169
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:41,670
have all practiced for more than ten years.

170
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,650
There's no shortcut.

171
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:49,610
Learn swordplay first.

172
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,030
Come on.

173
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,700
Let me show you how to do it.

174
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,720
Sect Leader,

175
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,330
your medicine.

176
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,800
Xiaoxiang started learning martial arts just a few days ago

177
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,220
but has mastered all the moves

178
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,460
of Shengling Swordplay.

179
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,740
She's talented.

180
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:22,700
But her internal power is not strong enough.

181
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,300
Since she has the Linglong Heart,

182
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,620
she should have the Power of Linglong Heart

183
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,690
as you do.

184
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,540
Once it's activated,

185
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,300
her sword skills can improve by leaps and bounds.

186
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,660
Maybe she can be

187
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,710
even more achieved than me and Mou.

188
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,860
The Power of Linglong Heart

189
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,430
will do great damage to her heart.

190
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,390
She should not use it.

191
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,350
Let her live longer.

192
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,190
Everyone can see

193
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,500
how much you love Xiaoxiang.

194
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,460
You're already in too deep

195
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,380
but still wouldn't admit it.

196
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,780
Chu Kong.

197
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,040
Let me do you a favor.

198
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,430
Your Linglong Heart

199
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,710
will eventually belong to Xiaoxiang.

200
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,380
[Meet me by the lake at noon.]

201
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,440
Meet me by the lake at noon.

202
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,810
This medicine stinks.

203
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,420
Umbrella.

204
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,540
My umbrella!

205
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,330
Isn't that the umbrella I brought here?

206
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,240
Yes.

207
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,100
It was kept in the cabinet for too long.

208
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,000
I took it out

209
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,340
to repurpose it.

210
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,090
Repurpose?

211
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,650
Give it to me.

212
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,580
Give it to me!

213
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,270
Wait.

214
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,310
Qian Luo said

215
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,600
she wants

216
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:05,490
that umbrella.

217
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,170
Both the wind and the sunshine

218
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,490
can make her lose water.

219
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,730
So delicate.

220
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:17,340
I'm a flower fairy.

221
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,110
You're a demon.

222
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,480
Decades later,

223
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,420
only he

224
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,820
will become a wrinkled old man.

225
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,950
Stupid old man.

226
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,200
Is she calling me names?

227
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:32,990
No.

228
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,040
She must have.

229
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,190
No.

230
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,400
You're lying.

231
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,120
She's always mumbling on your shoulder.

232
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,710
Calm down.

233
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,170
She's been getting under my skin!

234
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,180
She didn't say anything.

235
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,220
Really. Stop.

236
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,770
Do you smell it?

237
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:48,980
What?

238
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,240
Someone's cooking meat.

239
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:56,660
It smells so good.

240
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:12,820
Pei Xiuming?

241
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,460
What is he going to do?

242
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,290
I thought that message was left by Master.

243
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,230
I didn't expect to see you here.

244
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,390
I heard that you've been practicing sword skills very hard recently.

245
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,290
I'm free today

246
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,980
so I borrowed the kitchen of the villa

247
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,400
to make these dishes for you.

248
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,550
You made

249
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,180
all of them yourself?

250
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,480
Braised pork belly.

251
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,060
Braised pork knuckles.

252
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,110
Sweet and sour ribs.

253
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,730
They're all your favorite dishes.

254
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:43,330
How did you know that?

255
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:44,750
I told you.

256
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,540
We've met before.

257
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,110
I didn't know he was good at cooking.

258
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,080
That's a lot of food.

259
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,310
I don't think

260
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,740
they can't finish them all.

261
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:07,690
Mou.

262
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,190
I remember you once calling Pei Xiuming

263
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:11,750
your friend.

264
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,430
Why don't we…

265
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,840
Even Xiaoxiang can resist the temptation.

266
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,120
Look at you!

267
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,570
You're right.

268
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:29,340
We must not fall for Xiuming's trick.

269
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,370
Does he think he can take Xiaoxiang away from the Shengling Sect?

270
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,260
What are you going to do?

271
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,160
I'm going to tell the Sect Leader.

272
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,280
Mr. Pei.

273
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,220
Why are you so nice to me?

274
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,200
Because I like you.

275
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,190
I've liked you for a long time.

276
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,340
Now I can finally spend some time

277
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,410
with you.

278
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,740
So,

279
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,849
I want to marry you.

280
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,869
I want to spend the rest of my life

281
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,300
with you.

282
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,869
Pei Xiuming.

283
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,349
Since you arrived here,

284
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,160
you've been trying to get close to Xiaoxiang.

285
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,210
I'll let go of what happened in the past.

286
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,860
But today.

287
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,290
Sit.

288
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,700
You've crossed a line.

289
00:17:40,510 --> 00:17:42,160
I proposed to Xiaoxiang.

290
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,490
She hasn't answered me yet.

291
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,250
Why are you so angry?

292
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,360
She won't marry you.

293
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,360
It's her marriage.

294
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,670
She should decide for herself.

295
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,740
It's her personal matter.

296
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,670
You don't get to meddle in it.

297
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,790
Xiaoxiang has come of age.

298
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,000
It's improper for you

299
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:00,030
to keep her by your side.

300
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,410
Have you

301
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,740
never thought of

302
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,800
asking Xiaoxiang's opinion

303
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,590
and letting her decide who to marry?

304
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,450
Mind your own business.

305
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,780
Master, you…

306
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,760
I think

307
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,470
we should hold a gathering for Xiaoxiang

308
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,360
to let her choose

309
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,950
who she wants to marry in front of everyone.

310
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,620
What do you think?

311
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,440
If Xiaoxiang doesn't choose me,

312
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,760
I won't pursue her

313
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,060
ever again.

314
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,150
I'll give up.

315
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,760
Master, I…

316
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,470
Deal.

317
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,020
I…

318
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,660
Come here.

319
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,870
Come here, Stinky.

320
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,230
Come here.

321
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,200
Come here.

322
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,540
Didn't you hear me?

323
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,910
You have such a bad temper.

324
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,840
Just like Master.

325
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,180
Do you want it?

326
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,550
Eat it.

327
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,450
You're spoiled.

328
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,120
Sect Leader,

329
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,060
it's cold.

330
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,940
Careful not to catch a cold.

331
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,800
Sect Leader.

332
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,420
I

333
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:29,890
have a question for you.

334
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,250
Why

335
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,240
did you agree

336
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,570
to hold that gathering?

337
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,010
Aren't you worried

338
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,100
that Xiaoxiang will choose

339
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:42,100
Mr. Pei?

340
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,910
You know what?

341
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,000
You don't need to talk

342
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:48,920
to prove that you're not a mute.

343
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,780
Sorry.

344
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:04,060
Give this

345
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:06,590
to…

346
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,660
To…

347
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,880
You know what I'm saying?

348
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,570
Thank you.

349
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,170
It's

350
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,500
not likely to happen,

351
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,260
but if you choose me,

352
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:01,820
I'll give up all my plans

353
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,080
and take you away at all costs.

354
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,400
This time,

355
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:13,430
I'll be an ordinary man

356
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,210
and spend the rest of my life

357
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,090
in peace with you.

358
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,630

[Leyi House]

360
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:33,260
Xiaoxiang will decide who she'll marry

Xiaoxiang.

Here's the embroidered ball.

364
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,510
Throw it to the one you truly love.

365
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,390
If you don't love anyone now,

366
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,410
you don't have to throw it.

368
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,580
Back off. Back off.

Come on.

370
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,300
Back off.

What are you doing?

My favorite person

374
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:06,960
is you, Master.

375
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:15,110
You're so willful.

376
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,350
You were supposed to throw it.

377
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,650
You were too far away from me.

378
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,030
I was afraid that I might miss.

379
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,060
You said I'm clumsy yourself.

380

00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,180
Are you going to refuse me?

382
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:36,220
Do you know

383
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,680
what it means

384
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,180
to give the embroidered ball to a man?

385
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,420
It means to be with him forever.

386
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,620
I promised

387
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,960
to be with you my whole life

388
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,990
and serve you.

389
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,070
Do you really want me

390
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,160
to walk away with someone else?

391
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,780
M-Master?

392
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:06,050
Never mind.

393
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:11,800
So,

394
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,160
you agree?

395
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,780
Silly.

396
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,540
My heart disease is getting worse.

397

It's hot.

Be careful when you drink it.

401
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,410
Master.

402
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,120
Is there a cure

403
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,120
for your heart disease?

404
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:31,340
I want to help.

405
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,340
I don't want you to suffer.

406
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,630
I was born with a heart defect.

407
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,110
There's no cure.

408
00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:49,260
After taking Ren's medicine,

409
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,280
I'll be fine.

410
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:57,310
Don't worry.

Urgent news from down the mountain.

414
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,330
Xu Wenrui was spotted

415
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,980
with a group of people

416
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,030
who looked like those warriors of sacrifice

417
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,860
we met at Manxiang Guesthouse.

418
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,490
Sect Leader. Senior.

419
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,200
Don't move.

420
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,220
Why are you two here alone?

421
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,420
Where is Lu Peng?

422
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:42,940
He was taken away by the Jinwu Sect.

423
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,020
What happened?

424
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:47,800
After sending the letter to Mou,

425
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,870
we followed Xu Wenrui secretly.

426
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,370
Unfortunately,

427
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,560
he discovered us.

428
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,000
Those warriors of sacrifice in grey hurt them.

429
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,440
They are not

430
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,500
warriors of sacrifice

431
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,220
but undead warriors.

432
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,790
When I fought them,

433
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,460
I cut off one guy's arm.

434
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:11,560
However,

435
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,620
that guy didn't even wince

436
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:15,460
as if

437
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,860
he didn't feel any pain.

438
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,630
Rumor has it

439
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:24,940
that the Jinwu Sect

440
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,090
has been practicing dark magic.

441
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,150
Those so-called warriors of sacrifice

442
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,460
should be puppets

443
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,770
controlled by Xu Wenrui with dark magic.

444
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,140
Which direction did they leave with Lu Peng?

What are you doing here?

448
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,340
I came to see Ren.

449
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,130
But

450
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,780
he went down the mountain with Master.

451
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,040
Did something happen?

452
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,350
I want to ask him

453
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,740
if there is any way to cure Master's heart disease.

454
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,440
Heart disease

455
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,390
is usually genetic.

456
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,300
It can't be cured.

457
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:16,810
However,

458
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,330
I know a tonic

459
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,250
that's good for the heart.

460
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,700
What's it?

461
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:25,900
Snow lotus.

462
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:28,940
I have

463
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:31,550
heard about that.

464
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,060
Most patients with heart disease take snow lotuses.

465
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:35,930
But

466
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,680
the effect of normal snow lotuses

467
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,750
is very limited.

468
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:41,410
To greatly improve your Master's condition,

469
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,520
you need snow lotuses on Shengling Peak.

470
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,080
Shengling Peak?

471
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,080
There are snow lotuses

472
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,610
on the peak of this mountain?

473
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:52,590
Don't you know it?

474
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,900
Mount Shengling

475
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:56,440
is a magical mountain.

476
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:59,010
The herbs growing on its peak

477
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:00,370
are all priceless treasures.

478
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,850
They work hundreds of times

479
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,000
better than normal herbs.

480
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,610
That

481
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:07,590
sounds amazing.

482
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,770
Xiaoxiang,

483
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,650
are you going to climb up the mountain to pick snow lotuses for your Master?

484
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,240
Shengling Peak is covered in snow.

485
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,180
One wrong move

486
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:18,830
can cost you your life.

487
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,340
Then

488
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,280
I'll be very careful.

489
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,370
As long as I can relieve Master's pain,

490
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,140
it's worth taking the risk.

491
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,530
Thank you, Xiuming.

lying in the snow again,

497
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,620

If I'm wrong,

499
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,770
the worst-case scenario

500
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,160
is that you'll die

501
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,320
and go back to the Heaven Realm.

502
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,020

must have a way to cover their tracks.

Send all the disciples out to look for them.

514

that the Jinwu Sect has been looking for

Xiaoxiang.

521

They even killed several disciples of the Yujian Faction for it.

522
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,660
Why did Xu Wenrui

523
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,240
do that?

524
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,520
Because Xiaoxiang is the witness

525
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,630
to that massacre.

00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:56,980

that killed countless people

528
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,700

just to find

a witness?

531
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,410
Do you mean

532
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:08,610
that Xu Wenrui is looking for Xiaoxiang

533
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,750

but didn't see Xiaoxiang.

546
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,780
We searched the field and the pigsty.

547
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
She was not there.

548
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,670
We searched the woods too

549
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:35,580

Four hours ago,

555
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,720
Xiaoxiang came to me

556
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,460
and asked about medicines that could improve your condition.

557
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,080
I told her

558
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,910
snow lotuses on Shengling Peak could do that.

559
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,610
How could you tell her that?

560
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,270
She wants to save her Master.

561
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,080
I just told her what I know.

562
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,590
You told a little girl

563
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,130
to collect herbs on the snow-covered peak alone.

564
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,100
She'll die there.

565
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,330
How could you do that?

566
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,060
If anything happens to Xiaoxiang,

567
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,060
