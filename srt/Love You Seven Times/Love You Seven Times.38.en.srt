[Episode 38]

4
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,190
We still have countless days and nights.

5
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,500
We still have to be together forever.

6
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,460
Even if our hair turned grey

7
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,900
and our skin wrinkled,

8
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,460
we would never be apart.

9
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,930
Of course I remember.

10
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,320
We will live and die together,

11
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,090
and we will never let each other down.

12
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,430
Unfortunately,

13
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:18,930
I can't grow old with you anymore.

14
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,910
In the future,

15
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,010
you have to take care of yourself.

16
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,940
Don't cry.

17
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,290
30,000 years ago,

18
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,840
right here,

19
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,070
you said...

20
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,840
Chu Kong.

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,600
You must live well.

22
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,870
Only if you live can there be hope.

23
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:55,980
Without you,

24
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,960
there is no hope.

25
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,830
You have to keep your promise.

26
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,110
You promised Li

27
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:06,670
you would take care of me forever.

28
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,580
Alright.

29
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,900
Stop crying.

30
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,170
You once said that

31
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,710
if you died,

32
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,570
you wanted to become a carefree cloud.

33
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,950
I'm greedier than you.

34
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,180
I want to become

35
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,090
the rivers, the mountains,

36
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:37,880
the breeze, and the moon of the six realms.

37
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:40,890
From now on,

38
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,930
I'll be free.

39
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,260
No.

40
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:50,880
Xiangyun.

41
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,380
It's time to say farewell.

♫You left at sunset♫

106
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,220
the 30,000 years of confrontation between the Heaven Realm

107
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,130
♫My heart grew cold because I knew our story ended♫

108
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,820
and the Moluo Divine Clan had finally ended.

109
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,020
Under the warm and bright sunset,

110
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:49,010
♫I'll forever remember your face♫

111
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,580
peace finally returned to the six realms.

112
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,900
However,

113
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:49,340
some people can never come back.

114
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,130
Chu Kong, the God of War, sacrificed himself

115
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,000
to annihilate his brother, Haoxuan.

116
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:57,220
He destroyed the conspiracy

117
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,590
that lasted for tens of thousands of years.

118
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,520
Although Empress Cang Hai

119
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,030
has regained her power,

120
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,100
she declined to rule.

121
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,320
Since then,

122
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,400
the Moluo Divine Clan has been governed

123
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,070
by the siblings, Jin Lian and Jin Luo.

124
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,020
Greetings, Your Holiness.

125
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,540
And the Heaven Realm

126
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:15,980
was governed by Prince Xiu Ming instead.

127
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:18,470
I am only temporarily in charge.

128
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,850
You don't have to call me that.

129
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,840
30,000 years ago,

130
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,910
Haoxuan took innocent lives

131
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,370
and harmed the six realms

132
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,320
for his own selfish desire.

133
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,030
He committed a heinous sin.

134
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,059
Now, he did not escape his sins

135
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,659
and met a fitting end.

136
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:40,320
His body and soul

137
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,580
were thoroughly destroyed.

138
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,440
The Moluo Divine Clan

139
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,580
was framed by Haoxuan

140
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,870
and had been wronged until now.

141
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:47,910
Now that the truth is revealed,

142
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,230
we must clear the Moluo Divine Clan's name.

143
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:51,930
From now on,

144
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,240
the six realms will no longer follow a hierarchy.

145
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,710
We shall all live in harmony.

146
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,480
Anyone who disobeys the order

147
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,160
will be punished by Heaven's rules.

148
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,020

With you governing Heaven

188
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,490
and Jin Lian and Jin Luo governing the Moluo Divine Clan,

189
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,420
I feel very assured.

190
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,980
I can finally

191
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,210
avoid these complicated things.

192
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,070
Please bear with it.

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,330
You let go of everything

194
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,500
just to watch the stars here

195
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,460
every night?

196
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,500
The Star of War has fallen.

197
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,400
Chu Kong

198
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,380
can never come back.

199
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:02,820
Xiuming.

200
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,660
If you meet the right person,

201
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,810
you must cherish her.

202
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,310
Don't be like us.

203
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,580
We missed each other every time,

204
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,760
leaving only regrets behind.

205
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,510
Did you see that?

206
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:41,570
The Star of War lit up!

207
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,170
Chu Kong is still alive.

208
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:45,050
He's really alive!

209
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,730
Xiangyun.

210
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,120
Are you mistaken?

211
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,890
I can't be.

212
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,820
Since Chu Kong disappeared,

213
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:55,930
I've been looking up at the Star of War every night.

214
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,050
He didn't lie to me.

215
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,770
He said he would come back.

216
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,250
Chu Kong must be waiting for me.

217
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,720
I'm going to find him.

218
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:05,990
Xiangyun!

219
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,440
When you find him,

220
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,630
remember to come back early.

221
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,430
Xiuming.

222
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,100
Thank you.

223
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,370
This life of mine

224
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,760
was meant to be worthless

225
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,000
and insignificant,

226
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,570
like weeds.

227
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,020
But how lucky I am

228
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,310
to have met you in the six realms.

229
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,170
Take it.

230
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,330
It can strengthen your body

231
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,590
and nourish your primordial spirit.

232
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,020
I once swore

233
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,920
to protect you forever.

234
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,720
Unfortunately,

235
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,230
I failed.

236
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,360
Over the 30,000 years of losing you,

237
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,480
every day,

238
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,700
every moment,

239
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,940
was a torture to me.

240
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,810
Fortunately,

241
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,210
by Heaven's blessing,

242
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,120
you finally returned.

243
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,010
So beautiful.

244
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,470
After all this,

245
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,420
I finally understand.

246
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,680
Our relationship is something above

247
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,680
the romantic attraction between couples.

248
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,580
Xiuming.

249
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:55,550
No matter what happens,

250
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,010
you are my most important family.

251
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:01,470
So,

252
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,420
no matter what happens,

253
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,180
you are my most important family.

254
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,470
This time,

255
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:10,850
no one can stop you.

256
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,970
Go and pursue your happiness,

257
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:16,800
Cang Hai.

258
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,400
Your Highness.

259
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,760
Did Xiangzi really go to the mortal world?

260
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,270
She said she saw the Star of War shine

261
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:44,850
and insisted on going to the mortal world to look for Chu Kong.

262
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,590
The Love Knot was broken.

263
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,290
Immortal Chu Kong's soul was destroyed too.

264
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,240
Maybe Xiangzi was too upset

265
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,360
and mistook what she saw.

266
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,120
Let her go find him.

267
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,220
It's better for her

268
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,000
to have hope in her heart

269
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:06,020
than exist with nothing to live for.

270
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,870
You're right, Your Highness.

271
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:14,280
After their six love tribulations,

272
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,380
Immortal Chu Kong and Xiangzi's love

273
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,760
has long transcended life and death.

274
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,820
If it weren't for the hope that

275
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,220
Immortal Chu Kong might still be alive,

276
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,090
I'm afraid

277
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:26,740
she would have long joined him in death.

278
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,430
Yes.

279
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,250
Back then,

280
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,220
when Haoxuan announced that Xiangyun was Cang Hai,

281
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,430
You didn't know the truth, did you?

282
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,800
Then, why were you brave enough

283
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,240
to help me put up an act

284
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,230
to persuade Haoxuan to agree to the trial

285
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,350
and buy us time?

286
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:55,790
After noon tomorrow,

287
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:56,850
Heavenly Thunder Day will arrive.

288
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,380
At that time, the Heavenly Gate will open,

289
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,550
and we can use the Heavenly Thunder

290
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,680
to torture her.

291
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,510
It will break her bones,

292
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,450
tear her soul apart,

293
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,339
and give her an extremely painful death.

294
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,829
Only then can it pacify my hatred.

295
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,010
I agree with

296
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,720
what Prince Xiu Ming said.

297
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:21,569
Your Highness.

298
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,319
At that time,

299
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,990
I wasn't thinking about anything.

300
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:26,920
I just thought

301
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,530
we can't let Xiangzi die on the spot.

302
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,580
No matter what others think,

303
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,100
in my eyes,

304
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,360
she will always be the Xiangzi

305
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,950
I raised.

306
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,880
You are right.

307
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,470
She is Cang Hai.

308
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,240
But she is also Xiangyun.

309
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,960
But no matter who she is,

310
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,780
she won't give up easily.

311
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,520
Maybe we can really expect that

312
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,030
she'll come back with Chu Kong one day.

313
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,050
Oh, my red thread.

314
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,610
Nothing in this world

315
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,260
is impossible for my Xiangzi.

316
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,900
Fragrance pouch and pendant, come and have a look.

317
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,960
Fragrance pouch.

318
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,480
How long do we have to keep searching

319
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,040
aimlessly like this?

320
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,280
Luo.

321
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:47,850
Look.

322
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,460
Here.

323
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,350
Why are you so slow?

324
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,870
I went to buy something for you.

325
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,620
Let me see.

326
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,260
So her name is Luo too.

327
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,340
I'll get him back for you.

328
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,510
No.

329
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,820
You waited for him for 300 years

330
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,920
and finally found him.

331
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,260
Are you just going to watch him

332
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,420
marry another woman?

333
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:07,780
His biggest wish

334
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,430
was to be an ordinary mortal.

335
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,900
This time,

336
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,690
he finally got what he wanted.

337
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,370
How could I bother him?

338
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,770
Brother, what are you looking at?

339
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,540
I think I saw her.

340
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:49,540
Who?

341
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,580
Who did you see?

342
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:56,370
Maybe I was mistaken.

343
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,170
Forget it.

344
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,410
Let's go home.

345
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:05,360
Tomorrow is your

346
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,530
engagement day with Liu Lang.

347
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,580
We have a lot of things to do at home.

348
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,480
Let's go.

349
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:11,600
Let's go.

350
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,740
You chose this yourself.

351
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,250
Don't blame me

352
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,460
for not helping you.

353
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,770
Brother, I'm already engaged.

354
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,390
Tell me.

355
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:31,690
When will you find me a sister-in-law?

356
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,700
There you go again.

357
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,680
Are you still

358
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,450
waiting for the girl in your dream?

359
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:44,290
But if you can't find her,

360
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:45,750
what will you do?

361
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:47,240
I'll keep looking.

362
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,100
Until...

363
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,680
I find her.

364
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,250
Immortal Sun?

365
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,220
Immortal Sun!

366
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,910
Greetings, Immortal Sun.

367
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,110
Greetings, Red Thread Master.

368
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:23,850
Shall we get straight to the point?

369
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,270
Of course.

370
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,340
Did you bring the stuff?

371
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,740
Why do you

372
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,900
need the Red Thread

373
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,970
from the Marriage Pavilion?

374
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,660
Do you have a crush on someone?

375
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,880
I heard that

376
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,870
as long as you tie this thread to the

377
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,570

380
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,070
Of course.

381
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,240
No matter how far apart,

382
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,070
the thread will extend indefinitely

383
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,750
and keep them connected.

384
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,930
Great. Great!

385
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,730
Now the Heaven Realm is finally at peace.

386
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,720
We can have a good rest.

387
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,040
That's right.

388
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,150
Look.

389
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,180
Who's here?

390
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,740
Why are you here?

391
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,880
You've been working hard lately.

392
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:25,570
I brought you some snacks and fruits.

393
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,580
Zhao,

394
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,810
you are in luck today.

395
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,830
Newlyweds

396
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,180
are really different.

397
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,240
When can I

398
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,730
find a fairy spouse too?

399
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,480
Looks like

400
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:46,020
I have to get on Red Thread Master's good side too.

401
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:47,620
These days,

402
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,630
Red Thread Master has been acting mysteriously.

403
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,970
I don't know what he's busy with.

404
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,980
If you want to see him,

405
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,930
you might have to look around for him.

406
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,120
Just now,

407
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,190
I saw

408
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,690
Immortal Sun dragging him

409
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,880
to Changning Palace.

410
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,420
Why did Immortal Sun drag him to the Changning Palace?

411
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,390
Why else?

412
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,030
Of course, it's to match-make.

413
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,300
Move.

414
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:10,770
Don't drag me.

415
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,220
You know what?

416
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,450
We must ask His Highness for his verdict.

417
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:12,780
Let go!

418
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,910
You've gone too far!

419
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,660
How could you do this?

420
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,860
You're getting old.

421
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,980
It has nothing to do

422
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,620
with my age.

423
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,420
Let go. Come on.

424
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:18,700
Your Highness.

425
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:18,900
Let go.

426
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,460
You must help me.

427
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,660
Instead of minding his own work,

428
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,280
Immortal Sun is interfering with

429
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,150
my work instead.

430
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,670
I'm interfering with your work?

431
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,020
Why don't you tell His Highness

432
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,410
what you are busy with?

433
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,930
Your Highness.

434
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,340
I am the Red Thread Master.

435
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,960
My job is to match-make for all living beings in the six realms

436
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,230
and grant them a happy marriage, right?

437
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,330
I just finished preparing for

438
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,400
the marriage between Immortal Qian and Jia Yun.

439
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,570
So I thought I should

440
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,500
match-make for the other members

441
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,560
of the Heaven Realm, right?

442
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:48,150
That is fine!

443
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,170
But who did you decide to match-make for?

444
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,410
Who is the biggest single man in the Heaven Realm right now?

445
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:53,940
Who?

446
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,460
Who?

447
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:54,980
Who?

448
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,740
Who?

449
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,740
Isn't that His Highness?

450
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,880
So I want to

451
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,400
look for a good match for you.

452
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:04,610
Your Highness,

453
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,000
I made this

454
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,110
extra-strong red thread myself.

455
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,550
Its function is several times stronger

456
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,220
than ordinary red threads.

457
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,900
Your Highness, put it on.

458
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,970
Maybe the perfect match will come.

459
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,500
Here.

460
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
The old man is too arrogant.

461
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:18,900
Let me tell you.

462
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,120
His Highness is busy now.

463
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:22,630
He's busy with official matters.

464
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,300
Do you think he has the mood for love?

465
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,970
That's true.

466
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:28,880
Indeed.

467
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:29,670
Last time,

468
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,740
because of your matchmaking,

469
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,220
we lost the God of War, right?

470
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:32,620
This time,

471
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,780
I won't let you put it on him no matter what.

472
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:34,460
Don't test me.

473
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,180
You can't abandon love

474
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,330
because you got hurt before.

475
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,050
I was badly hurt.

476
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:40,140
This is wrong.

477
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,860
Don't move.

478
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,460
Don't think you can do whatever you want just because you're old.

479
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,160
Let me tell you.

480
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,120

486
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,040
Okay. Then...
