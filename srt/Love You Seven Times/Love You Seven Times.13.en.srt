[Love you seven times]

3
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,950
[Episode 13]

4
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,259
It really seems like

5
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,500
someone's feelings have not been reciprocated.

6
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,530
His Divinity wouldn't like such a fairy.

7
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:15,820
She's from a small family,

8
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,100
yet she wants to curry favor with the God of War?

9
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,940
That's right.

10
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,770
Prince Xiu Ming is back.

11
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,420
Prince Xiu Ming.

12
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,540
Prince Xiu Ming is back.

13
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,100
Prince Xiu Ming.

14
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,650
Greetings, Prince Xiu Ming.

15
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:02,980
Where is Immortal Chu Kong?

16
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,260
Immortal Chu Kong has just left.

17
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:11,980
You're dismissed.

18
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,100
Yes.

19
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:18,380
Xiangyun.

20
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,340
Xiangyun,

21
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,140
are you still holding a grudge against me?

22
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,100
I dare not.

23
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:38,880
No.

24
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,820
You should hate me.

25
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,630
After all, it was me...

26
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,950
When I returned to the Heaven Realm,

27
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,520
I felt regretful thinking about what had happened in the mortal world.

28
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,170
I'm here

29
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,590
to apologize to you

30
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,940
on behalf of the Xiu Ming of the mortal world.

31
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,200
That's too much, Your Highness.

32
00:03:57,230 --> 00:03:58,470
I understand

33
00:03:58,490 --> 00:03:59,730
the Xiu Ming of the mortal world

34
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,770
is not Your Highness.

35
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,580
I didn't intend for

36
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,060
any of the things that happened in the mortal realm.

37
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,170
I hope you can forgive me.

38
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,800
I understand.

39
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,180
We were all done in by Li.

40
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,450
The plot

41
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,220
was rather ridiculous.

42
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,390
Yes.

43
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:17,779
It was ridiculous.

44
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:20,550
It's all Immortal Li's fault.

45
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,350
What nonsense was that?

46
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,120
He made it really embarrassing for us.

47
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,710
If I see him,

48
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,060
I won’t let him off the hook.

49
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,080
Remember to scold him

50
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,190
on my behalf too.

51
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,659
Let's go then.

52
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:46,409
The events of the mortal tribulation feel like a different world.

53
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,180
I’m not used to

54
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,409
being back in the Heaven Realm.

55
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,370
But when I look at you,

56
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,900
you seem extra familiar.

57
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,480
Although mortal tribulations are not of concern in the Heavenly Palace,

58
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,659
we

59
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,950
have gone through a lot.

60
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,140
From now on,

61
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,600
we are friends.

62
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,180
You're indeed Prince Xiu Ming.

63
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,000
You sure have a lot of friends.

64
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,350
Why didn't I see you just now?

65
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,970
Didn't you leave first?

66
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,260
Look at you.

67
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,810
You scared someone again.

68
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:26,890
We are all colleagues from the Heaven Realm.

69
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:27,950
We also went through mortal tribulations together.

70
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,980
What's wrong with being friends?

71
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,220
Don't be afraid.

72
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,130
Immortal Chu Kong

73
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:35,110
is all bark and no bite.

74
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,030
Do you still owe my friend

75
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,320
an explanation?

76
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,060
Of course I will give you a reasonable explanation.

77
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,100
Who would have thought

78
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,140
we would really forget everything?

79
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,820
There wasn't a trace of our memories of the Heaven Realm left.

80
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,810
If I had just a shred,

81
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,170
how could I have done such  cruel things

82
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,790
to you?

83
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,030
Chu Kong.

84
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,660
Come to think of it,

85
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,340
I don't seem to know you well.

86
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:17,900
Chu Kong.

87
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,410
I'm sad to hear that.

88
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,580
It's been 30,000 years.

89
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:22,660
You still haven't opened up to me.

90
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,670
Besides,

91
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,420
although I did you wrong in the mortal realm,

92
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,580
it helped you

93
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,470
through the love tribulation.

94
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,840
In that case,

95
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,950
I should thank you.

96
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,440
No need.

97
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,790
It's just that

98
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,210
I went to the mortal realm to help my friend,

99
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,520
but you misunderstood me.

100
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,690
Or

101
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,830
do you really have feelings for that fairy?

102
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,800
I’m here

103
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,360
to apologize to Immortal Chu Kong

104
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,890
on the behalf of the Third Prince of the Mortal Realm.

105
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,610
Please be the bigger person

106
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,700
and forgive me this time.

107
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:02,990
So you've forgiven me?

108
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:05,600
I'll leave then.

109
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,070
You look more haggard

110
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,260
after coming back.

111
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,220
Are you sick?

112
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,100
I'll get you a physician.

113
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,820
Sir.

114
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,310
The physician said that

115
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,390
I'm fine.

116
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,090
Don't worry.

117
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,080
A few days ago,

118
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,140
you kept going to the Fate Bureau.

119
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,400
I know you care about Lu Changkong.

120
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,170
I didn't say anything.

121
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,280
Immortal Chu Kong's spirit

122
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,020
has returned to its immortal position.

123
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,700
What are you intending to do

124
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,690
in the future?

125
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,140
He has disappeared.

126
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,690
If you really like Lu Changkong,

127
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,549
why don't you take this chance to pursue this connection?

128
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,100
Look.

129
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,100
Immortal Chu Kong

130
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,740
is highly powerful

131
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,980
and as long-lived as the heavens.

132
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,440
My red thread

133
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,920
can live for another two or three hundred thousand years.

134
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,870
If you are together,

135
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,440
you won't have to worry about being separated.

136
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,300
How is that possible?

137
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,740
Chu Kong and Lu Changkong

138
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,390
are completely different people.

139
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,190
Xiangzi.

140
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,140
Last time,

141
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,580
Immortal Chu Kong was deeply in love with you.

142
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,760
That wasn't Chu Kong.

143
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,560
There's a thin line between is and isn't.

144
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,070
He doesn't even know which it is.

145
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,980
How can you be sure?

146
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,220
Sir,

147
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,340
I want to be alone for a while.

148
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,980
Let me know if you want to eat or drink anything.

149
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,920
Your Divinity,

150
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,320
why did you

151
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,460
summon me here?

152
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,300
Do you remember

153
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,200
what you promised me

154
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,700
before I went to the mortal realm?

155
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,960
I guaranteed you’d be satisfied.

156
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,580
Your arrangement was great.

157
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,980
Well,

158
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,680
although this love tribulation

159
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:44,460
had some ups and downs,

160
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,080
fortunately, the result was good.

161
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:50,030
The relationship between Your Divinity and Xiangyun in the mortal world

162
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,460
was truly

163
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,720
earth-shatteringly touching.

164
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,030
Endless twists and turns,

165
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,150
indulgences, and lingering.

166
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,430
Really?

167
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,220
This...

168
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,860
Immortals' mortal tribulations

169
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,040
have always been like this.

170
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,500
The deeper the love,

171
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,580
the more your primordial spirit will recover.

172
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,200
It hurt me terribly

173
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:13,530
to watch it happen

174
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,580
too.

175
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,470
In that case,

176
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,520
making me follow her around

177
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,030
and making Xiu Ming kill me

178
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,700
was all part of your thoughtful plan too?

179
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,600
This has nothing to do with me.

180
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,910
I write the Fate Book,

181
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,830
which is a plot summary.

182
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,670
It can't detail

183
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,800
every word and every action.

184
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,750
Go on.

185
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,340
Based on

186
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,620
other immortals' experience in mortal tribulations,

187
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:49,350
the personality of immortals

188
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,230
when they go to the mortal realm

189
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,240
is based on their underlying personality.

190
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,290
As for what they will do

191
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,220
and how they will end up,

192
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,380
it all depends on

193
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,180
their different personalities.

194
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,100
It has nothing to do with my Fate Book.

195
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,500
Immortal Li,

196
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,510
I heard the other immortals talking about

197
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,770
how you have mastered the ancient skill, Scale Nine Peaks.

198
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,130
I’m really curious.

199
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,860
I want to see it.

200
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,000
It's just a petty trick.

201
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:41,150
How dare I show it to Your Holiness?

202
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,580
Are you afraid?

203
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,740
Or do you not know how?

204
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,420
I dare not.

205
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,460
You dare to talk nonsense in front of me.

206
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,450
What do you not dare to do?

207
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,950
The ancient secret skill is known to few.

208
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,420
You can fool others, but not me.

209
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,570
If you've really mastered Scale Nine Peaks,

210
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,860
your wrist must be full of spiritual energy

211
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,940
and your meridians will glow.

212
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,000
But

213
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,700
the pain is unbearable.

214
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:12,520
How can you hold a pen

215
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,070
to write such an exaggerated story?

216
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,860
Please calm down, Your Divinity.

217
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:20,830
Those immortals were only making fun of me.

218
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:23,460
Your Divinity, don't take it seriously.

219
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,460
Your Divinity,

220
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,920
I remember

221
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,310
I have a lot of work to do.

222
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,180
I won't disturb you

223
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,630
any longer.

224
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,760
The personality of immortals

225
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:52,700
usually reflects

226
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,380
their underlying personality.

227
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,950
Xiangzi.

228
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,150
Last time,

229
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:08,470
Immortal Chu Kong was deeply in love with you.

230
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,620
This is

231
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,300
all I have left.

232
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,860
Did Song Xiangyun really like Lu Changkong?

233
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,800
Was she really in love

234
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,740
or was it

235
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,620
just because of the love tribulation?

236
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,060
I'm fine now.

237
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,980
Let me

238
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,100
just be sad for a while.

239
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,040
Where is Cang Hai?

240
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,540
Cang Hai turned demonic

241
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:12,630
and wiped out the Dixiu Divine Clan.

242
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,800
Fortunately, Chu Kong took action

243
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,740
and sacrificed half of his primordial spirit

244
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,140
to banish Cang Hai

245
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,550
into the Void,

246
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,300
vanquishing him.

247
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,290
Prince Xiu Ming,

248
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,620
the Dixiu Divine Clan has finally been avenged.

249
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,110
All living beings in the six realms

250
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,180
are finally free.

251
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,470
My condolences.

252
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,690
I only hate that

253
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,200
I couldn't kill my enemy myself.

254
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,870
I've been searching for you for 30,000 years.

255
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,200
I finally found you.

256
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:15,860
This time,

257
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:18,310
I won't let the tragedy repeat itself.

258
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,010
I will protect you.

259
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:23,760
Even if I have to expend all my effort,

260
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:26,340
I will make the Soul-shattering Arrow

261
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,820
to get rid of the danger

262
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,930
and avenge you.

263
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:45,210
[Marriage Pavilion]

264
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,230
Why are you so down?

265
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,790
Immortal Chu Kong is back.

266
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,890
Shouldn't you be happy?

267
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,220
If I hadn't been busy yesterday,

268
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,910
I would have been able to welcome the God of War back to his immortal position.

269
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,810
Do you think you did something good?

270
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,150
Who wrote me like this?

271
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,730
You're just like His Holiness.

272
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:11,160
You don't understand my thoughtfulness.

273
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,510
Can't you feel

274
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,920
my thoughtfulness

275
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,380
and my care for you?

276
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,000
Think about it.

277
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:19,839
My goodness.

278
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,630
Two great deities, Chu Kong and Xiu Ming,

279
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,690
vied so brutally with each other

280
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,710
for your attention.

281
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,550
Even the Princess of the Eastern Sea was no match for you.

282
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,040
Yes.

283
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,950
It's all because of you.

284
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,110
In that case,

285
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,250
should I repay you?

286
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,060
Don't stand on ceremony.

287
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,670
There's no time to lose.

288
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,210
I'll repay you now.

289
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,380
Don't do anything stupid.

290
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,220
Watch out, my Scaling Nine Peaks might hurt you.

291
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,870
It hurts.

292
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,460
It hurts.

293
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,830
We've been friends for thousands of years.

294
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,900
You're really attacking me?

295
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,050
You can bluff others.

296
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,150
You think I don't know?

297
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,470
You can't even climb one peak.

298
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,430
Nine peaks?

299
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,880
Don't talk nonsense.

300
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:02,150
All immortals say that I am low-key

301
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:03,820
and that I conceal my strength, you know?

302
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,530
Why don't you tell the immortals

303
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,340
your stupid stories?

304
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,130
Forget about the stories.

305
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,660
If Princess Yingshi hadn't been locked up

306
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,920
by the Water God of the Eastern Sea,

307
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,870
I would have died.

308
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,580
I'll Scale Nine Peaks and drive you out of the Heavenly Court now.

309
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:17,900
I'm serious.

310
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,700
Scale Nine Peaks.

311
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,420
I'll Scale...

312
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,180
I'll Scale Nine Peaks.

313
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:20,700
I'll Scale...

314
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,260
Xiangyun.

315
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,320
Xiangyun.

316
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,010
Xiang...

317
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,540
Auspicious clouds are floating!

318
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,700
The pagoda suppresses the river monster!

319
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,390
Xiangyun, bad news!

320
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,420
What is it?

321
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,740
Yingshi is here with the Shrimp Soldier and Crab General.

322
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,660
What do you mean?

323
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:45,980
Yingshi is here?

324
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,980
Stop it.

325
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,980
Don't jinx it.

326
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:48,620
You...

327
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,060
Stop talking, both of you.

328
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,220
Xiangyun, run away.

329
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,490
Li,

330
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,980
we've been friends for thousands of years.

331
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,140
I acted on impulse just now.

332
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,380
I was just angry.

333
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,460
I didn't mean to beat you up.

334
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,210
Don't worry, Xiangyun.

335
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,760
We are friends.

336
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:11,660
I understand.

337
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,220
Get out of the way!

338
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,860
Get out of the way!

339
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,980
You can't go in.

340
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:19,980
Don't fight.

341
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,900
Get out of the way!

342
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:22,380
Move!

343
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,180
Get out of the way!

344
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:23,900
Get out of the way!

345
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,670
[Marriage Pavilion]

346
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,210
If you know what's good for you—

347
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:27,920
That way.

348
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,440
Aren't you looking for Xiangyun?

349
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,820
You're smart.

351
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:35,860
Yes.

00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,430
Let's go.

353
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,020
Immortal Li, you...

354
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,460
Xiang Yun is my best friend.

355

She won't bear to see me in danger.

356
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,530
That must be the case.

357
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,110
Goodbye.

358
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,560
You...

359
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,380
Stop!

Where are you going?

361
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,500
This...

362
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,370
Xiangyun,

363
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,530
what did you promise me before we went to the mortal world?

364
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,270
Wonderful design?

365
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,470
Consistency?

366
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,410
I had to see you

368

00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,560
Did you arrange for me to be in the audience?

370
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:26,220
Last time, it was fate.

371
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,180
I made a very

372
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,600
small mistake.

373
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,590
But I swear

374
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,250
There will be no problem this time.

375
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,790
I swear on the life

of my best friend, Immortal Li.

377
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,620
I'll get you and Immortal Chu Kong together.

378
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,520
No need.

379
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,250
Love is something you'll only understand

380
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,900
after you experience it.

381
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
No matter how powerful he is,

382
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,060
he's not as caring as my Mr. Zihui.

383
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,220
My Mr. Zihui?

384
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,340
You did a good thing.

385
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,210
But no matter what,

386
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,910
this Nuwa Stone was mine.

387
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:04,850
I'm just getting it back.

388
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,140
We don't owe each other anything anymore.

389
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,220
Zihui is that Nuwa Stone?

390
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,150
Are you blind?

391
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,620
How many purple Nuwa stones are there in this world?

392
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,690
Congratulations, Your Highness.

393
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,230
I didn't expect

394
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,470
to accidentally

395
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:23,910
make a good match.

396
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,530
I'll reluctantly count it as your credit.

397
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:28,790
Wait.

398
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,470
Let me think.

399
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:34,180
You used the Nuwa Stone to make this match.

400
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,470
Now, it's returned to you.

401
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,350
Did I make money or lose money?

402
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,570
Why do I feel

403
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:44,500
I'm getting the short end of the stick?

404
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,620
What stick?

405
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,020
Explain yourself.

406
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,910
Your Highness, calm down.

407
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,130
It's just a metaphor.

408
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,210
Zihui still belongs to you.

409
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,820
If you dare to have designs on Zihui,

410
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:56,160
I won't forgive you.

411
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,380
Who won't you forgive?

412
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,370
Where did the wind come from?

413
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,370
It blew Immortal Chu Kong here.

414
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,200
I was just passing by.

415
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,440
I don't want you to act recklessly.

416
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,390
You've walked a really long way here

417
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,180
from Xiaoyun Palace.

418
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,870
Don’t think you can do whatever you want in the Heaven Realm

419
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,890
by relying on the Water God of the Eastern Sea.

420
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,640
You have no right to lecture

421
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,300
people of the Marriage Pavilion.

422
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,160
You're protecting her?

423
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,460
You protected her in the mortal world.

424
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,530
It's still the same now that you've returned to the Heaven Realm.

425
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,460
Could it be that Your Divinity

426
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,970
has fallen in love?

427
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,080
What does it have to do with you?

428
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,610
The God of War who hasn't know love in 30,000 years

429
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,460
has finally been enlightened.

430
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,410
You're flirting here

431
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,880
and singing the same tune.

432
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,550
What are you looking at?

433
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,130
Are we staying here to sing with them?

434
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:56,990
Let’s go.

435
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:57,810
Yes.

436
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,850
You...

437
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,420
Are you here to help me?

438
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,420
You're my designated tribulation partner.

439
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,140
Naturally,

440
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,990
you can't get killed by others.

441
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,080
Otherwise, how can we go through tribulations together?

442
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,700
Yes.

443
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:37,700
I...

444
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,800
won't hinder your tribulations.

445
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,500
After this tribulation,

446
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,700
your primordial spirit has been greatly restored.

447
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,710
If you go through one or two more tribulations,

448
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,550
you should be able to recover completely.

449
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,300
Looks like the tribulation went well.

450
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,770
In that case,

451
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,530
I can rest assured.

452
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,130
However,

453
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,900
I heard that

454
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,680
you are not satisfied

455
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,060
with the fairy from the Marriage Pavilion.

456
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,760
Is that true?

457
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:21,860
No.

458
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,460
She's...

459
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,300
pretty good.

460
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:29,240
This is the first time

461
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,120
I've heard the God of War

462
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,340
praising someone else.

463
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:33,900
You must be joking.

464
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,610
It's just work.

465
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,240
Your Holiness,

466
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,100
I have something to tell you.

467
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,260
After I went through the mortal tribulation,

468
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,570
the damage to my primordial spirit

469
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,110
seems to have worsened.

470
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,590
If I continue,

471
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:54,900
my primordial spirit will be destroyed

472
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,290
and I will die.

473
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,800
Summon the fairy from the Marriage Pavilion.

474
00:24:59,350 --> 00:24:59,910
Yes.

475
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,680
Your Highness.

476
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:02,720
What's wrong?

477
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,010
Xiangyun

478
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:06,050
was summoned to Changning Palace by God Haoxuan.

479
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,450
You are the fairy

480
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,280
who went through the love tribulation with Chu Kong?

481
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,940
Yes.

482
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,430
Raise your head.

483
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,790
Where are you from?

484
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,810
I was transformed 3,000 years ago from a freely floating auspicious cloud

485
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,330
by the Red Thread Master.

486
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,080
Don't be nervous.

487
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,760
I summoned you here today

488
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,250
because Chu Kong

489
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,180
is the Heaven Realm's God of War

490
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,550
and also my younger brother.

491
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,460
Naturally,

492
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,300
I would want to meet

493
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,190
the fairy

494
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,660
who went through two love tribulations with him.

495
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,500
Seeing you today,

496
00:26:27,610 --> 00:26:28,890
you are really different.

497
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,410
I am the most ordinary

498
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,980
among all the fairies.

499
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,640
The Heaven Realm is so big

500
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,540
that I have never seen you

501
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,940
in the past 3,000 years.

502
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,500
You

503
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,950
really remind me

504
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,840
of an old friend.

505
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,820
Me?

506
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:08,460
You've been working diligently

507
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,530
in the Marriage Pavilion for 3,000 years.

508
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:13,610
This time, you helped Chu Kong with his mortal tribulation.

509
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,830
Whether personally or professionally,

510
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,470
I should reward you.

511
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,820
I will promote you by two ranks

512
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:20,900
and bestow you the title,

513
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,260
Fuyuan Fairy.

514
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,790
[Fuyuan]

515
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,660
You can stay in the Marriage Pavilion

516
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,390
and help the Red Thread Master

517
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,820
deal with all matters in the Marriage Pavilion.

518
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:34,990
Your monthly salary will be 500 spirit stones.

519
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,550
Thank you, Your Holiness.

520
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,520
Fairy Fuyuan,

521
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,910
I have great expectations of you.

522
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,260
Don't let me down.

523
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,260
You entrusted me with such an important task.

524
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,180
I won't let you down.

525
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,220
Good.

526
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:03,740
Xiangyun.

527
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,320
This is the first time

528
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,220
you've met God Haoxuan, right?

529
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,350
I was scared out of my wits.

530
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,270
Why did His Holiness

531
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,610
summon you?

532
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,700
Nothing.

533
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,510
He praised me.

534
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,220
By the way,

535
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,500
I'll be earning a salary from now on.

536
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:24,920
And this.

537
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:25,930
Look.

538
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,240
[Fuyuan]

539
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,420
This is a gift from His Holiness.

540
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,700
In the Marriage Pavilion,

541
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:30,510
this is the only one aside from Sir's.

542
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:32,100
Congratulations, Fuyuan Fairy.

543
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,660
I wish you promotions and wealth

544
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,110
and to reach the peak of the Heaven Realm.

545
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,620
Thank you, Your Highness.

546
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,560
From now on, we will be colleagues of the Heaven Realm.

547
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,930
We must contribute towards the Heaven Realm together.

548
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:42,930
Alrght.

549
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,670
But we should celebrate

550
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,310
your promotion.

551
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,980
I wonder if you would like to

552
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,740
come for a gathering at my Penglai Residence?

553
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,130
I have

554
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,000
a thousand years honey wine.

555
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:56,900
I...

556
00:28:59,110 --> 00:28:59,870
No.

557
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,940
The Qixi Festival is coming.

558
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,980
There must be a lot of trivial matters to handle in the Marriage Pavilion.

559
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,530
I just took office.

560
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,940
If I disregard all the lovers of the world

561
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:08,820
to indulge myself...

562
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,310
Let's

563
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,140
drink this wine another time.

564
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,650
Alright.

565
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,940
I'll thank you on behalf of

566
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,180
all the lovers of the world.

567
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,700
If

568
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,700
the Marriage Pavilion needs my help,

569
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,420
just tell me.

570
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,540
Thank you, Prince Xiu Ming.

571
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,260
It's getting late.

572
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,780
I need to go back and report to Sir.

573
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:31,300
Alright.

574
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,350
The wine will be ready for you at any time.

575
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:48,950
This is a relic of the Moluo Divine Clan,

576
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,120
the Tianqiong Jade.

577
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:53,520
Since you know the Tianqiong Jade,

578
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,900
I’ll say no more.

579
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,280
It contains a sliver of Cang Hai's power.

580
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,420
From now on,

581
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,130
you can carry it with you.

582
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,720
I can't take

583
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,320
such a precious item.

584
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:09,390
Take it.

585
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:11,350
It can help you strengthen your body

586
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,230
and nourish your primordial spirit.

587
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,740
I'll leave it with you

588
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:14,870
so that

589
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,570
it can be put to use.

590
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:25,060
Why is the Tianqiong Jade duller than before?

591
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,300
This time,

592
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,330
I must protect you.

593
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:30,400
Cang Hai.

594
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:33,640
[Marriage Pavilion]

595
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,900
Thank you for transforming me.

596
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,340
I will always remember

597
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,420
that you raised me.

598
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,700
Xiangzi, you've made it.

599
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:44,940
I

600
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,200
am very pleased.

601
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,830
Why do you cry so much?

602
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,310
You cry when you're sad

603
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,630
and you cry when you're happy.

604
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,260
I...

605
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,400
I'm crying of joy.

606
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,460
From now on,

607
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,860
as long as I'm still alive and kicking,

608
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,420
I will protect you.

609
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,700
Xiangyun.

610
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:07,020
Xiangyun.

611
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,780
Immortal Chu Kong wants to see you.

612
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,270
Sir.

613
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,160
You don't want to go?

614
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,820
Fuyuan Fairy,

615
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:24,350
you've grown up.

616
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,970
It's time for you to

617
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:27,410
face

618
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,470
the

619
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,050
music

620
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:38,790
yourself.

621
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:40,700
Sir.

622
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,620
Sir.

623
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,900
Greetings, Your Divinity.

624
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:13,920
His Holiness promoted you.

625
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,100
Have you thought about why?

626
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,300
Because

627
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,740
I did a good job.

628
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,280
Gold always shines.

629
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,880
Who do you have to thank?

630
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,870
I want to thank the Marriage Pavilion

631
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,540
and the Red Thread Master's transformation.

632
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,780
Lastly,

633
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,190
I want to thank myself

634
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,180
for enduring the difficulties

635
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,360
and going through hardships.

636
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,940
It wasn't easy

637
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:37,900
to get to this point.

638
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,830
Who else?

639
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,740
There's someone else?

640
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,370
What do you think?

641
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,220
Also,

642
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,670
I haven’t been here for long,

643
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,050
and I haven't contributed much

644
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,380
to the Heaven Realm.

645
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,980
But every time, I work hard

646
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,460
at matchmaking.

647
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,370
I’m grateful to the warm family of Heaven Realm

648
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,940
for my achievements today.

649
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,260
His Holiness's reward

650
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,140
is also a recognition and encouragement

651
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,060
of my work.

652
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,640
I feel very honored.

653
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,540
I always think

654
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,980
hard work doesn't let anyone down.

655
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,330
I will work hard

656
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,370
to live up to God Haoxuan's expectations.

657
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,200
Good.

658
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,220
Very good.

659
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:35,210
In that case,

660
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,160
I’ll reward you too.

661
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,710
That’s too kind of you.

662
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,300
What reward?

663
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,480
You can copy the Heart Sutra

664
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,450
to help you calm your heart.

665
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,880
I hope you can stop being arrogant and impatient.

666
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:06,640
This...

667
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,909
What kind of reward is this?

668
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,449
This is obviously a prank.

669
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,000
I’m not stupid.

670
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:39,290
I know all your tricks.

671
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,110
Your Divinity.

672
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,230
Please give me a few more days.

673
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:41,889
I still have a lot of work left to do

674
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,469
in the Marriage Pavilion.

675
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,650
Your Divinity!

676
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:55,380
His Holiness is so wise.

677
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:57,250
Why is his half-brother

678
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:58,280
like this?

679
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,640
One hundred more times!

680
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:07,920
Fine.

681
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,400
It's a piece of cake.

682
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,790
It's not that hard.

683
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:49,030
I feel much better after copying it.

684
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,780
Even if I have to copy it another 100 times,

685
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,660
I'm not afraid.

686
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,950
Your Divinity.

687
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,720
I'm not slacking off.

688
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,830
I've finished copying.

689
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,500
Have a seat, Your Divinity.

690
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,490
If there's nothing important,

691
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,030
can I leave now?

692
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,220
No.

693
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:26,190
Are you done?

694
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,440
Why do you want to see me?

695
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:31,390
Are you here

696
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,780
to buy me tea?

697
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,700
What do you think?

698
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,820
Could it be...

699
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,790
to get even with me?

700
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,940
I remember when I was in the mortal world,

701
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,170
you told me many times

702
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,580
not to hold a grudge against you

703
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,620
and not to get even with you.

704
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,720
I think you came to the mortal world with your memories.

705
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,360
I knew it.

706
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,100
There must be something bad.

707
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,090
You're here to get even with me.

708
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,300
Didn't you say you won't hold a grudge?

709
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:08,060
Why do you remember so clearly?

710
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,570
Aren't you

711
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,500
going to explain?

712
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,520
Even so,

713
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,430
but...

714
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,190
you promised me in the mortal world

715
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:21,760
you won't get even with me.

716
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:24,790
Yes.

717
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,360
But I am not Lu Changkong.

718
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,830
No matter what,

719
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,660
I...

720
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,130
took an arrow for you.
