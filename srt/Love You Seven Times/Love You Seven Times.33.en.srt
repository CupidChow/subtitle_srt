[Love you seven times]

3
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,979
[Episode 33]

4
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:09,780
I am Xiangyun.

5
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,420
Greetings, Your Majesty.

6
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,140
Where did you come from?

7
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,920
How unsightly.

8
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,610
Leave now.

9
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,380
How could this happen?

10
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,960
Why doesn't Chu Kong

11
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,650
recognize me?

12
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,140
Hurry, make a toast to His Majesty to show your apology.

13
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,340
Yes.

14
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,540
My appearance is vulgar

15
00:02:56,579 --> 00:02:57,660
and unsightly.

16
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,960
Please forgive me for offending you.

17
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,200
No need.

18
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,140
I sincerely apologize.

19
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,390
Please forgive me,

20
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,060
Your Majesty.

21
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,080
You are very bold

22
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:18,180
for a mere demon.

23
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,100
I just really

24
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,940
admire your prestige.

25
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,660
I wish to serve by your side

26
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,960
and redeem myself.

27
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Your Majesty,

28
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:29,260
please approve of it.

29
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,780
You want to stay by my side?

30
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,700
You don't deserve it.

31
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,640
Please forgive me.

32
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,030
I know

33
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,380
I'm lowly and inferior.

34
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,720
I am not worthy of a place by your side.

35
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:52,790
But

36
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,220
I can do some cleaning.

37
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,540
I hope you

38
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,380
can let me stay.

39
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,780
Be on your way.

40
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,820
Don't let me repeat myself again.

41
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,700
She's just a maid.

42
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,980
Why are you

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,240
so wary of her?

44
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,860
Are you worried that

45
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,140
she will ruin your plan?

46
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,890
Or,

47
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,019
are you worried that

48
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,899
you will fall in love with this beautiful tiger demon?

49
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,930
She's but a lowly demon.

50
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,780
Since she's a gift from Elder Kuanglong,

51
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:31,830
I'll keep her.

52
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,490
His Majesty has agreed to keep you.

53
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,380
In the future,

54
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,460
you must serve him to the best ability.

55
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,230
Thank you, Your Majesty.

56
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,490
From now on,

57
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,840
I will serve you with all my heart.

58
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,380
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

59
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,020
Chu Kong.

60
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,250
You went through so much trouble to arrive at the Mystery Forest.

61
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,790
You must have a plan in mind.

62
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,460
Chu Kong.

63
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,700
Do you know

64
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,400
how much I missed you?

65
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,780
You said

66
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,540
no matter what happens,

67
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,920
you won't hide it from me.

68
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,140
You can't go back on your word.

69
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,600
I'm only temporarily keeping you here

70
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,470
as my maid because of Elder Kuanglong.

71
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,510
Don't step out of line.

72
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,540
Is he

73
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,170
pretending not to know me?

74
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:44,820
No.

75
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,680
Chu Kong must be hiding something from me.

76
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:51,970
Chu... Chu Kong.

77
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:52,900
I know.

78
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,820
You must be here in the Mystery Forest

79
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,770
for something important.

80
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:56,580
But don't worry.

81
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,980
I will never hold you back.

82
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:00,980
Do you know

83
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,780
how much effort it took me

84
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,580
to find you here in the Demon King's Mansion?

85
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,900
Fortunately,

86
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,260
Elder Kuanglong wanted to find you a maid,

87
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,490
so I managed to slip in here.

88
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,460
Chu Kong...

89
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,420
Don't scare me.

90
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,930
I'm Xiangyun.

91
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,830
Have you really lost your memory?

92
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,870
Is this your new trick?

93
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,840
You want to pretend to be my old friend?

94
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,600
No way.

95
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,190
How could you

96
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:43,100
forget all our memories?

97
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,000
Chu Kong.

98
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,300
What's wrong with you?

99
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,159
Chu Kong.

100
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:49,050
Don't think you can act recklessly

101
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,960
just because you have Elder Kuanglong's backing.

102
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,350
You are not allowed to enter my room from now on.

103
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,020
Get out.

104
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,460
I...

105
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,150
I told you to get out.

106
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:07,950
Yes.

107
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,070
Chu Kong.

108
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,780
Do you really not remember anything?

109
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,790
How could this be?

110
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,850
Did you forget everything

111
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,350
because of that arrow?

112
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,340
Regardless,

113
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,490
we'll just have to get to know each other again.

114
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,250
Your Holiness.

115
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,230
Today's official matters have been taken care of.

116
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,940
If there is nothing else,

117
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,570
I shall

118
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,780
take my leave.

119
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,530
Since Chu Kong's assassination,

120
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,000
I haven't been able to pull myself together.

121
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,300
Thank you for managing the official matters

122
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,970
for me, Prince Xiu Ming.

123
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,470
Otherwise,

124
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,180
I really don't know what to do.

125
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,350
You're too kind.

126
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:20,470
I should thank you for your trust instead.

127
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,450
Are you talking about

128
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,450
the Soul-shattering Arrow?

129
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,580
Please don't take it to heart.

130
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,860
I was just

131
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,860
confused by my worries.

132
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:42,900
Thinking about it now,

133
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,610
you've been friends for so many years.

134
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,440
How could you possibly hurt him?

135
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,640
30,000 years ago,

136
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:56,510
Cang Hai annihilated the entire Dixiu Divine Clan.

137
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,830
How can I forget

138
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,640
such a blood feud?

139
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,060
Ever since the Divine Prophecy descended upon the world

140
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,830
and prophesied the demon's revival,

141
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,230
I have decided

142
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,930
to make her pay with her life.

143
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,670
Unfortunately,

144
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,230
my power is weak.

145
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,200
I had no choice but to

146
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,560
cultivate the Soul-shattering Arrow

147
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,560
in order to kill her.

148
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,840
I didn't expect to cause

149
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,950
such a big misunderstanding.

150
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,120
I have long suspected someone

151
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,330
as the culprit behind Chu Kong's death.

152
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,570
Since

153
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,300
the news of Cang Hai's resurrection started to spread,

154
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:40,190
even a leisurely idle man like you started to prepare,

155
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,750
let alone

156
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,830
the Moluo Divine Clan.

157
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,820
I believe

158
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,090
they must have wanted

159
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,310
to eliminate the strong enemies

160
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,300
for Cang Hai.

161
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,630
That's why they chose to attack Chu Kong.

162
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,300
I will avenge Chu Kong.

163
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,840
Prince Xiu Ming.

164
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,350
Chu Kong was lucky to have a friend like you.

165
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,860
He must have died with no regret.

166
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,510
I

167
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,090
thank you on behalf of Chu Kong.

168
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,470
You're too kind, Your Holiness.

169
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,900
I don't deserve

170
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,190
your kind words.

171
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,420
Your Holiness.

172
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,030
You should take care of yourself.

173
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,360
I won't disturb you.

174
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:41,730
Immortal Sun.

175
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,220
Your Holiness.

176
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,200
What's the matter?

177
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,860
Your Holiness.

178
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,100
You...

179
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,670
You always summon Prince Xiu Ming

180
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,250
to handle official matters.

181
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,280
Don't be blinded by

182
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,470
by his innocent face.

183
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,020
He's still a suspect for cultivating the Soul-shattering Arrow.

184
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,080
Don't mention this matter again.

185
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:13,850
No.

186
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,880
I mean his face.

187
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,790
Look...

188
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,580
Goodbye.

189
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,760
Where is Cang Hai?

190
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:31,720
Cang Hai turned demonic

191
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,770
and wiped out the Dixiu Divine Clan.

192
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,190
Fortunately, Chu Kong took action.

193
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,260
He sacrificed half of his primordial spirit

194
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,680
to banish Cang Hai into the Void,

195
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,830
turning her into ashes.

196
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,330
Prince Xiu Ming,

197
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,810
I'm sorry for your loss.

198
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,100
Back then,

199
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,130
when I arrived at the edge of the Void,

200
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,630
Cang Hai had already jumped into it.

201
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,650
Only a piece of her sleeve was left in Chu Kong's hand.

202
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,350
At that moment, I knew something was fishy.

203
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,100
Haoxuan,

204
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,100
you've hidden your intentions well.

205
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,290
This time,

206
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:13,550
if it wasn't for restoring Cang Hai's power,

207
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,700
my arrow

208
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,090
would have pierced your heart instead.

209
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,120
Chu Kong.

210
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,640
I'll leave the rest to you.

211
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,360
[Demon King's Mansion]

212
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,400
Get out!

213
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,550
Your Majesty,

214
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:42,970
I overstepped the line previously.

215
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,520
Please forgive me.

216
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,530
But don't worry.

217
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,260
I will do as you say in the future.

218
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,630
Are you ignoring my words again?

219
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,240
I told you to get out!

220
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:53,780
Your Majesty,

221
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,820
please give me another chance.

222
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,940
Your Majesty!

223
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,710
Get down.

224
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,530
No.

225
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,750
Come down!

226
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,370
No!

227
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,190
Come down.

228
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,100
No.

229
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,300
Unless you keep me by your side.

230
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:13,820
Otherwise,

231
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,500
I won't come down.

232
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,980
Come down.

233
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,460
Or it'll be too late...

234
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,550
Your ears...

235
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,580
I...

236
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,330
I added some catmint inside

237
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
to repel insects.

238
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,700
So,

239
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,180
you are a cat demon?

240
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:47,460
No wonder you were looking odd

241
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,220
when I came in just now.

242
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,700
Shut up!

243
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:54,240
You didn't see anything just now.

244
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,100
No wonder

245
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,190
Elder Kuanglong

246
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,430
wanted someone to test you.

247
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,760
You're hiding such a big secret.

248
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,120
Tell me.

249
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,540
What is so important

250
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,340
that it warrants taking such a big risk?

251
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,520
Don't you know that

252
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,910
since the Scorpion Demon King

253
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,580
was killed by the Cat Demon Clan,

254
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,460
a death order was issued in the Mystery Forest.

255
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,740
All cat demons

256
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,160
will be executed on sight.

257
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,700
If they know your true form,

258
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,440
you'll be in danger.

259
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,220
Only you and I

260
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,130
know about what happened today.

261
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,520
So if I kill you...

262
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,460
Kill me!

263
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,140
If you kill me,

264
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,240
it'll be over.

265
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,340
What?

266
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,570
You can't bear to do it?

267
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,630
No, wait.

268
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,550
You...

269
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,580
You work for

270
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,860
Elder Kuanglong.

271
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,810
So if you suddenly disappear,

272
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:55,910
I'm sure Elder Kuanglong will be suspicious.

273
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,990
Yes.

274
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,240
I'm a maid given to you by Elder Kuanglong.

275
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,150
If I disappear...

276
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,710
Elder Kuanglong

277
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,790
will surely investigate it.

278
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,910
By then,

279
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,330
your secret

280
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,480
will be exposed.

281
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,860
By the way, Your Majesty,

282
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,750
I have one more thing to tell you.

283
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,420
I have

284
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,660
a bad habit.

285
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,400
I'm not good at keeping secrets.

286
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,260
If I am not careful,

287
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,680
I might easily spill the beans.

288
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:33,700
So,

289
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,820
Your Majesty,

290
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,980
you have to keep me by your side

291
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,860
and keep an eye on me at all times.

292
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,460
Otherwise, I...

293
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:47,770
Don't ruin my plan.

294
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,570
Don't worry. I will help you.

295
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,200
Last night,

296
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,720
another Golden Core Great Demon died in the Mystery Forest.

297
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,770
It was a black leopard demon who sold crystal.

298
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,220
In the Mystery Forest,

299
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,710
excluding me and Buwen,

300
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,510
there are only a dozen or two Golden Core Great Demons.

301
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,210
In just a few days,

302
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,980
six of them died back to back.

303
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,440
Six Golden Core Great Demons have died.

304
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,390
Was there no clue before?

305
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,410
The previous Demon King

306
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,080
did not allow the Mansion to interfere in this matter.

307
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:33,180
How can the Mansion not interfere?

308
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,570
If we don't find the murderer soon,

309
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,320
the Mystery Forest will never see peace again.

310
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,020
This can't do.

311
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,610
I need to go to the scene

312
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,290
to see if I can find any clues.

313
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,080
I must let the murderer

314
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,360
have a taste of the Demon King's might.

315
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:01,900
Well,

316
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,030
our new king

317
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:07,450
is really different from the previous kings.

318
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,920
It's too early

319
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,940
to make a conclusion right now.

320
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,740
I have killed six Golden Core Great Demons.

321
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,390
I just need to kill one more

322
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,030
to help you activate the Demon-Vanishing Formation

323
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,810
and absorb all the demonic energy in the Mystery Forest.

324
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,550
Okay.

325
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,870
You did a good job.

326
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,020
But now,

327
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:32,550
the Mystery Forest has welcomed a new Demon King.

328
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,870
While the new Demon King is still settling in,

329
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,560
take the opportunity to finish this matter

330
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,450
and prevent

331
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,110
future problems.

332
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:43,000
Understood.

333
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,510
Do you remember

334
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:47,360
what you promised me?

335
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:52,010
Don't worry.

336
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,240
As long as you can help me complete the Demon-Vanishing Formation,

337
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,580
I will keep my promise

338
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,210
and give you everything you want.

339
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,010
It's a deal then.

340
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,230
What are you looking at?

341
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,780
It's late at night.

342
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,090
Why are you wandering around here

343
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,250
instead of staying in Penglai Residence?

344
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,470
It's all my fault.

345
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,770
I just remembered that

346
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,980
I forgot to report something to His Holiness.

347
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,950
So I hurriedly made my way to Changning Palace.

348
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,180
But when I got here,

349
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,220
I noticed that it was getting late.

350
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,460
If I go to see His Holiness now,

351
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,770
I'm afraid I'll disturb his rest.

352
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,040
So I'm planning to go back for now

353
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:02,100
and report tomorrow.

354
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:04,870
It's reasonable.

355
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,010
But I don't believe you.

356
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,410
I said,

357
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,880
your memory

358
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:13,860
has been bad lately.

359
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:21,460
Recently, I've spent a lot of energy

360
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,220
handling official matters for His Holiness.

361
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,980
My memory has indeed gotten worse.

362
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,930
It's been hard on you.

363
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,020
It's getting late.

364
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,630
You should go back and rest too.

365
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,150
No hurry. Let's have a chat.

366
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:36,610
No need.

367
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,900
Let's chat.

368
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,350
No thanks.

369
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,110
Don't you want to chat?

370
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:40,970
No thank you.

371
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,570
What were you looking at?

372
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,780
[Python Demon] [Hog Demon] [Black Bear Demon]

373
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,780
[Fire Bird Demon] [Gopher Demon] [Black Leopard Demon]

374
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:04,190
What’s the connection

375
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,830
between these six Golden Core Great Demons?

376
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:10,510
Your Majesty,

377
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,130
I'm here to help you wash up.

378
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:14,460
You may leave.

379
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,850
Your Majesty, I am your maid.

380
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,350
How can I sleep

381
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,550
when you're still awake?

382
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,490
Besides, even if you rest,

383
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,960
I have to watch the night for you.

384
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,390
No need.

385
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,790
Your Majesty,

386
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,620
are you afraid

387
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,470
that with just the two of us here

388
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,980
in the middle of the night,

389
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,300
you can't help but

390
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,780
do something to me?

391
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,620
You're too confident.

392
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,060
I think so too!

393
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,090
I also believe in your character.

394
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,070
Even if we sleep together tonight,

395
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,940
you won't do anything to me.

396
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
After all,

397
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,160
what can a kitty

398
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:07,930
possibly do?

399
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,760
Your Majesty,

400
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,610
I'm not saying you're incapable.

401
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,530
Your Majesty, don't be angry.

402
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,190
I... I apologize to you.

403
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,000
Look.

404
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,720
What do you think?

405
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,980
Do you like this

406
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:40,230
gift of mine?

407
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,110
Your Majesty.

408
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,430
Do you feel sleepy?

409
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,910
If you're sleepy,

410
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,360
then sleep.

411
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,590
Then sleep.

412
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,350
Sleep.

413
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,240
Then sleep.

414
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,860
Let me ask you.

415
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:18,910
Who am I?

416
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,570
Xiang Yun.

417
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:28,230
The maid given by Elder Kuanglong.

418
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,380
You...

419
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,260
Do you really not recognize me?

420
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,860
Tell me.

421
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,350
Are you...

422
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:36,490
Are you pretending?

423
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,700
Pretending...

424
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,610
Pretending to be what?

425
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,370
This is...

426
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,780
Your Majesty...

427
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,740
Is this your apology to me?

428
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,010
Your Majesty,

429
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,980
I just wanted to make you smile.

430
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,630
Happiness finds people who smile.

431
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,480
If this happens again,

432
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,220
even Kuanglong

433
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:09,350
can't stop me from...

434
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,530
Now!

435
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,760
Get lost!

436
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:19,950
What is Chu Kong hiding?

437
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,130
Why did the elders

438
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:23,160
ask me to test him?

439
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,460
Greetings, Elders.

440
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,120
Did His Majesty kick you out again?

441
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,500
Even such a beauty

442
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,510
couldn't move him.

443
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,610
It seems that he is really heartless.

444
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,060
Don't judge a book by its cover.

445
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,330
In the end,

446
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,590
who knows?

447
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,780
You're right.

448
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,580
Even now,

449
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,980
we don't even know

450
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,400
the new Demon King's true form.

451
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:14,100
The Late King's Xuling Mirror has been sealed for a long time.

452
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,680
It should be of use now.

453
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:17,800
Yes.

454
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,310
Why didn't I think of it?

455
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:25,230
The Xuling Mirror can detect a demon's true form.

456
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,410
No matter the demon,

457
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,820
one look in the mirror

458
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,490
will reveal everything.

459
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:37,830
Oh no.

460
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,410
Chu Kong is in danger.

461
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,380
Your Majesty.

462
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,810
You're up.

463
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,900
What is it?

464
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:00,260
Your Majesty,

465
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,060
please have a look.

466
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,830
What is this?

467
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,840
This is the Xuling Mirror left by the Late King.

468
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,540
It can detect the true form of demons.

469
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,120
I think

470
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,560
you should keep it.

471
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,710
If you carry this Disguising Hairpin with you,

472
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,370
it can help you disguise as a demon

473
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,210
so that you can walk freely in the Mystery Forest.

474
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,100
Remember.

475
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,350
Don't take it off.

476
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,240
Where is this divine aura from?

477
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,030
Over there.

478
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:29,770
Go after it!

479
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,300
Yes.

480
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:31,560
Let's go.

481
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,420
The divine aura

482
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:10,760
seems to have disappeared.

483
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,270
They must still be nearby.

484
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,710
Split up into two groups.

485
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,810
Keep chasing.

486
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:15,420
Yes.

487
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,030
Fortunately, I'm agile

488
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,300
and put on the hairpin again.

489
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,270
Otherwise,

490
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,060
they would have eaten me.

491
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,000
Beauty.

492
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,590
Where are you going?

493
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,220
How about

494
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,980
a drink with me?

495
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,710
Who are you?

496
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,080
I never change my name.

497
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,190
I am Master Weihu.

498
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,430
You're the fox demon

499
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,620
said to only abduct young ladies?

500
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,460
Wrong.

501
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,860
Those girls

502
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,130
fell for my handsome appearance.

503
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:22,390
[Golden Core Great Demon -  Master Weihu]

504
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:22,610
Miss,

505
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,130
you'll understand how great I am soon.

506
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,180
What do you want?

507
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,130
Don't you know

508
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,800
what I want to do?

509
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,590
Wait.

510
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,610
Listen.

511
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,310
My husband will be here soon.

512
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,050
He's a ruthless man of little words.

513
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,610
If he comes,

514
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,590
you'll suffer for sure.

515
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,630
Husband?

516
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,500
Fine.

517
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:51,200
I'll show you

518
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,270
how I

519
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,330
take care of his wife for him.

520
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,480
Where are you going?

521
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,420
As a Golden Core Great Demon,

522
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,220
do you think I'd lose to

523
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:22,020
a mere tiger demon who had just attained human form?

524
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,140
This is bad.

525
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,140
Am I going to die here today?

526
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:37,780
You're here!

527
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,740
Get lost.

528
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,180
How is it?

529
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,180
I told you

530
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,740
my husband is a ruthless man of little words.

531
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,220
Now you know how powerful he is.

532
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,080
I have something important to do.

533
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,440
I have to go.

534
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,550
I... I'm sorry.

535
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,400
I didn't mean to take advantage of you.

536
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,100
I just wanted to scare him.

537
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:08,990
By the way,

538
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:09,910
did the elders

539
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,700
find out about your true form?

540
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,820
Did you deliberately reveal your divine aura

541
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,570
to distract Kuanglong and Buwen?

542
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,040
I was too anxious.

543
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,150
I had no choice.

544
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:22,840
So...

545
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,550
Since you

546
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,610
know my real identity now,

547
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,830
why did you still save me?

548
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,970
Have you recalled something?

549
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,730
Don't think too much.

550
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,380
Since you helped me,

551
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,000
let me give you a piece of advice.

552
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,430
This is not your place.

553
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,190
Leave as soon as possible.

554
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,070
What if I insist on staying?

555
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:57,800
♫You understand my love♫

556
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,270
Chu Kong.

557
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,460
What are you hiding from me?

558
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:21,430
Your Majesty.

559
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,240
Forgive my incompetence.

560
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,960
That reckless immortal escaped our pursuit.

561
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,040
Elder Kuanglong.

562
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,750
You have a high status

563
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,970
and command great respect.

564
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,060
Yet you can't even catch

565
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,500
a mere immortal now?

566
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,870
Please forgive me.

567
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:54,730
Instead of asking me to forgive you,

568
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,380
you should gather the guards and continue searching.

569
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,860
Is something else

570
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,720
the matter, Elders?

571
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,540
Your Majesty.

572
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,260
The Xuling Mirror

573
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,130
is a treasure left by the Scorpion Demon King.

574
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,400
I know.

575
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,350
So I've kept it well.

576
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,690
You don't have to

577
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,780
worry about it.

578
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,510
Since you have kept it...

579
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,070
Your Majesty,

580
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,500
you must be tired.

581
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,720
Get some rest.

582
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,610
How dare this immortal

583
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,660
interrupt us at such a crucial time?

584
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:07,890
If they were one hour late,

585
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:10,449
we would have seen his true form.

586
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,429
But now,

587
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,340
he has taken the Xuling Mirror.

588
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,800
It's hard for us

589
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:19,980
to see his true form.

590
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,030
There is still

591
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,550
another method we could use.

592
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,159
What method?

593
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,989
This is a truth potion.

594
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,330
After drinking it,

595
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,469
the drinker can only tell the truth.

596
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,239
This is a good idea.

597
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,280
How will we make him drink it?

598
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:58,150
Now I only need the wife of the Black Leopard Demon.

599
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,980
Was she killed?

600
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,920
[Python Demon] [Hog Demon] [Black Bear Demon]

601
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,920
[Fire Bird Demon] [Gopher Demon] [Black Leopard Demon]

602
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,200
Or did she know

603
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,760
some untold secrets related to the deaths?

604
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,900
Your Majesty,

605
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,310
you've been working hard these days.

606
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,340
Eat something

607
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,330
and take a rest.

608
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,660
Thank you.

609
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,260
Your Majesty,

610
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,500
try this crabapple wine.

611
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,360
Smell it. Doesn't it smell good?

612
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,030
Okay.

613
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:37,650
Elder Kuanglong added a truth potion to it.

614
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,550
You can't drink it.

615
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,700
Why did you drink it?

616
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,690
If I don't,

617
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:50,860
how can I pass their test?

618
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,390
Don't talk.

619
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,820
Leave the rest to me.

620
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,410
Your Majesty,

621
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,180
what is your true form?

622
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,750
I am the ancient beast, five-tailed horned leopard.

623
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:19,030
I see, you are an ancient beast.

624
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,430
No wonder you are so much more powerful

625
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,240
than other demons.

626
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,840
So, the king's true form is the five-tailed horned leopard.

627
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:30,440
No wonder we couldn't tell.

628
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,890
If he's really the five-tailed horned leopard,

629
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,970
why didn't he ever show it?

630
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:38,690
He drank your truth potion,

631
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,060
he must be telling the truth.

632
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,470
Or did your truth potion fail to work?

633
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,810
Our king is resourceful and witty.

634
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,000
To prevent him from fooling us,

635
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,170
I added another item

636
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,110
in the wine.

637
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,300
If he was really affected by it,

638
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,300
it means

639
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:01,360
he did drink the wine.

640
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,340
What did you add?

641
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:09,670
Your Majesty,

642
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,180
although you are the Demon King,

643
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:13,900
but people around you have evil intentions.

644
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,000
Their motive is not pure.

645
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,750
Why don't you

646
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,180
keep me by your side?

647
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:20,860
You'd better not get involved in this.

648
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,390
I'm already involved.

649
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,660
It's too late to say that now.

650
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:26,110
Besides, if it weren't for me today,

651
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,440
would you have passed the test?

652
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,810
Get out.

653
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,620
I just helped you,

654
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,350
you can't burn bridges like that.

655
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,880
What's wrong with you?

656
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,130
I didn't bring any catmint today.

657
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,110
Why are you sweating so much?

658
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,700
Don't touch me.

659
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:01,250
What's wrong with you?

660
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:02,830
Tell me.

661
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,730
The wine...

662
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,830
In the wine...

663
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:07,680
There's something else

664
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,140
in the wine?

665
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,420
Aphrodisiac.

666
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,350
I...

667
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,440
I didn't know there was

668
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,980
an aphrodisiac in the wine.

669
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,410
I really didn't know. I...

670
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,100
It's okay.

671
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:21,900
You can go out first.

672
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,230
Go out first.

673
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:26,880
If I go out,

674
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,860
what will you do?

675
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,610
What good is it for you to stay here?

676
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,180
I...

677
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,130
I can help you.
