what happened to Immortal Li?

Li

10
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,440
was a lazy coward.

11
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,670
He was the first to run away in danger.

12
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,600
How could he die?

Is he hiding somewhere

17

that Fuyuan Fairy was very close to him.

Will your next tribulation be delayed?

Besides, after you came back from your last tribulation,

85

why wasn't your primordial spirit

We failed that tribulation

88
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,380
because Immortal Li's Fate Book is too poorly written.

89
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,340

It seems

that you only care about your tribulations

Do you think

114
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,860
his sudden death was related to it?

115
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,270
It was just an accident.

116
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,900
Immortal Li loved to have fun.

117
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,670
It was not the first time he'd traveled to the mortal world.

118
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,920
Unfortunately,

119
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,020
he ran into a Great Demon this time.

120
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,810
To save his dignity,

121
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:15,690
you must pretend to be a witness

122
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:18,020
to his demise with that Great Demon.

123
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:23,770
Immortal Li ran into a Great Demon in the mortal world.

124
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,110
He knew he was no match for it

125
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,420
and sent a distress signal to the Heaven Realm.

126
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,740
But I arrived too late.

127
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,110
I saw Immortal Li

128
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,440
die with that Great Demon.

129
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:37,100
There was nothing left of him.

130
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,110
If someone means to interfere with your tribulations,

131
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,580
Immortal Li would be worth more

132
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,790
to them alive than dead.

133
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,480
You have a point.

134
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,100
So,

135
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,100
the death of Immortal Li

136
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,640

137
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,200
Yes.

138
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,550
How surprising.

139
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,470
Immortal Li actually killed a Great Demon.

140
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,230
He played his ace,

00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,900
Scale Nine Peaks.

142
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,660
Immortal Li was just bluffing

143
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,290
when he said he mastered Scale Nine Peaks.

144
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
He didn't master that skill at all.

145
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,020
How could he use it to kill a Great Demon?

146
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,080
Why are you looking at me like that?

147
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,440
I just came back

148
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,160
and am a little tired.

149
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,940
All right.

150
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,980
Go back

151
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,570

00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,700
I've heard about

If you need my help,

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,620
just say it.

159

Thank you, Prince Xiu Ming.

160
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,440
I got an errand to run.

161
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,910
I'll go.

162
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,390
Your departure to the mortal world was so sudden

163
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,740
that I couldn't go with you.

164
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,380
Luckily, the Tianqiong Jade remains the same,

165
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,400
suggesting that your primordial spirit

166
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,380
didn't get damaged.

167
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,940

Immortal Li

169
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,980
was in charge of my Love Tribulation Fate Book.

170
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,820
Do you think

171
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,010
his sudden death was related to it?

172
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,050
His death

173
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,420
was just an accident.

174
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,070
He played his ace,

175
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,970
Scale Nine Peaks.

176
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,250
The ninth move.

177
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:31,470
If you've really mastered Scale Nine Peaks,

178
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,660
I'll be able to feel spiritual energy on your wrist

179
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,230
and your meridians will glow.

180
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,390
But

181
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,990
you'll be in unbearable pain.

182
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,500
How come you can still hold a pen?

183
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,730
Why are you looking at me like that?

184
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,260

[He pulls up the fishing net as he promised them.]
[What's in the net is divine.]

188
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,480
Can hi wronged.

189
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,520
Divine Prophecy changed.

190
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,350
Can Hai wronged.

191
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,260
Is someone trying to hide the truth?

192
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,190
Was Cang Hai really wronged?

193
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,930
Xiu Ming, don't forget

194
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:22,010
that she killed 20,000 officials

195
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,840
and also all the Dixiu Gods!

196
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,860
She didn't do that!

197
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,250
She would never commit such atrocities.

198
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,550
I believe her.

199
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,630
I'll always believe her.

200
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,930
God of War,

201
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,910
to what do I owe this pleasure?

202
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,380
Are you here for a drink?

203
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,160
You claim

204
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,600
that Cang Hai was wronged.

205
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,140
Do you have evidence?

206
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,230
Evidence?

207
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,880
History

208
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,060
is written by the victors,

209
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,180
not the losers.

210
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,210
It was the Qilin Divine Clan

211
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,740
that wrote the history.

212
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,480
How

213
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,350
can I find evidence for you?

214
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,820
I have no evidence to prove

215
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,860
that Cang Hai was innocent.

216
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,100
But I can swear on my primordial spirit

217
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,150
that Cang Hai

218
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,970
was not a devil.

219
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,980
If now

220
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,240
someone tells you

221
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:44,310
that Xiangyun is a bloodthirsty devil

222
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:46,110
who killed tens of thousands of people,

223
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,550
will you believe it?

224
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,220
Xiangyun is not that kind of person.

225
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,030
Neither was Cang Hai.

226
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,950
If you had known Cang Hai 30,000 years ago,

227
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,580
you would've believed

228
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,510
that she was innocent.

229
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,380
Rest assured.

230
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,220
I'll find out

231
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,060
what happened back then.

232

233
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,640
Why are you back?

234
00:14:58,430 --> 00:14:59,740
Did something happen?

235
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,010
Nothing serious.

236
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,940
Your Divinity.

237
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,490
I didn't mean to fall asleep.

238
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,350
I'm just a bit tired

239
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,980
from the tribulations.

240
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:17,500
Do you remember

241
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,820
that I told you

242
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:20,950
our primordial spirits have the same origin?

243
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,100
Of course.

244
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,250
But I don't understand

245
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,700
why we have primordial spirits from the same origin.

246
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,060
You're a high-born Qilin God.

247
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,970
I'm just

248
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,490
an ordinary cloud.

249
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,560
I don't know the answer now.

250
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:38,580
But both that

251
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,720
and the six-word message Immortal Li left

252
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,880
seem

253
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,000
to point to something that happened 30,000 years ago.

254
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,290
By the way,

255
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,990
I need to tell you something.

256
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,210
About Immortal Li's death,

257
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,960
my brother seems to be hiding something.

258
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:01,620
Do you mean

259
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,670
his death was not an accident

260
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,030
and was related to His Holi…

261
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,300
I haven't found out

262
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,590
the truth yet.

263
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,230
I told you about it

264
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,030
because I know

265
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,990
you'll get to the bottom of it.

266
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,040
Xiangyun.

267
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,130
We don't have any evidence now.

268
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,600
If we get ahead of ourselves…

269
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,260
Don't worry.

270
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,400
I won't rush into anything.

271
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:32,230
Since

272
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,420
all the clues point to 30,000 years ago,

273
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,340
let us

274
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,780
find the truth together.

275
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,820
Okay.

276
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,940
What have the two of them

277
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,540
been doing recently?

278
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,320
The God of War

279
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,330
is just being the God of War.

280
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,670
I don't think he'd be bothered

281
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,630

She's been in the Fate Bureau

285
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,390
reading the novels Li wrote.

286
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,850
She looks very sad.

287
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,910
Keep watching them.

288
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,470
Report to me if anything unusual happens.

289
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,390
Yes.

Did you find anything?

293
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,140
No.

294
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,500
How's it possible?

295
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,650

but can't find any records

of what happened 30,000 years ago.

298
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,570
Does it mean

299
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,120
someone is keeping the truth from us?

300
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:06,730
I didn't find records

of what happened 30,000 years ago,

316

So you must avoid going to the mortal world

383
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:10,400
I read about another ancient artifact

384
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,980
in that old book.

385
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,210
It's called the Tianji Compass.

386
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,330
It's the sacred relic of the Moluo Divine Clan.

387
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,890
It can open a time portal

388
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,350
and send us back to a specific time.

389
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,400
That sounds amazing.

390
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,810
But

391
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,590
it's in the hands of the Moluo Gods.

392
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:27,250
Even if you're capable enough

393
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:28,730
to take it away from them,

394
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,710
you'll cause a big commotion

395
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:32,690
and be noticed by His Holiness.

396
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,420
You worry too much.

397
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,230
You broke into

398
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,690
the Moluo Palace all alone.

399
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,910
Even if you're the God of War,

400
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:09,160
you give yourself too much credit.

401
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,710
For 30,000 years,

402
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,280
the Moluo Gods have been holed up in this small place.

403
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,530
Is this the kind of life you want?

404
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:21,930
If it weren't for the Heavenly Clan,

405
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,860
we wouldn't have ended up like this.

406
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:28,110
I'll find out the truth

407
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,350
of what happened 30,000 years ago.

408
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,980
The truth?

409
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,270
The truth is that the Moluo Divine Clan

410
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:41,350
was wronged

411
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,020
and you murdered Empress Cang Hai.

412
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,110
If what you said is true,

413
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,130
the Heavenly Realm will give you justice.

414
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,710
I came today

415
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,300
to borrow the Tianji Compass.

416
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,620
So you're here talking rubbish

417
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:05,110
because you want our Tianji Compass.

418
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,670
What do you think is this place?

419
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,520
Somewhere you can come and go

420
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,850
as you please

421
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,670
and take

422
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:22,690
whatever you want?

423
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,110
The Tianji Compass has been in your hands for 30,000 years

424
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,450
and is of no use to you.

425
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,360
If you really want to clear the Moluo Divine Clan's name,

426
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,590
trust me.

427
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,320
You have no other choice.

428
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:07,740
Lord Protector,

429
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,940
don't be fooled by him.

430
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,460
You swear.

431
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,940
I swear

432
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,580
on my primordial spirit

433
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,460
to find out the truth.

434
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
If you break your word,

435
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,960
even if you get away with the blood oath,

436
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,830
I'll kill you myself.

437
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,790
You're looking for Zihui, the Stone Heart,

438
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:54,370
to resurrect Cang Hai.

439
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,300
But do you have to sacrifice one life

440
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,380
to save another life?

441
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:11,990
I'm no longer Qian Ren

442
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,160
who did whatever he was told.

443
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,150
Thank you for what you did

444
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,000
in the Shengling Sect.

445
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,610
I'll leave

446
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,840
the Shengling Sect in your hands.

447
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,550
When we were in the Shengling Sect,

448
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,850
did he know I was Jin Lian from the very beginning?

449
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,440
Did you get it?

450
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,150
Yes.

451
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:29,790
Great!

452
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,260
Let's go to the mortal world now.

453
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,830
This trip will be very dangerous.

454
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,030
I think

455
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:37,090
you should stay in the Heaven Realm.

456
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,490
It's about Li's death.

457
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,120
I can't just stand by.

458
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:41,900
Besides,

459
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,650
we're tied together by the Love Knot.

460
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,960
It's impossible for us to be apart.

461
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,280
Moreover,

462
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,600
it's supposed to be our tribulation.

463
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,830
If only you go to the mortal world,

464
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,380
everyone will realize

465
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,360
that something is wrong.

466
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,390
In that case,

467
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,790
take this Spirit Nourishing Pill.

468
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,790
It's…

469
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:03,010
I haven't put a Soul-protecting Spell on you.

470
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,080
After we go down,

471
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,870
I can't guarantee the safety of your primordial spirit.

472
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,560
If you don't eat it…

473
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:09,910
Okay.

474
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:10,210
You…

475
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,860
I'm done.

476
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,460
Let's go.

477
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,100
Wait.

478
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,510
Your Divinity.

479
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,080
We can use the Tianji Compass

480
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,230
to go back to 30,000 years ago,

481
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,380
but

482
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,770
so many people are watching us here.

483
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,350
How can we get past them?

484
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,010
Have you forgotten

485
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,110
what the Goddess of Fate said the other day?

486
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,570
Right.

487
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,840
The Seven Stars Alignment.

488
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,510
We can use astronomic anomalies as a distraction.

489
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,060
That way,

490
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,500
no one can track us.

491
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,910
Clever.

492
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,360
Your Divinity.

493
00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:52,550
The Seven Stars will align today.

494
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,810
The stars are not stable.

495
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,840
You can't go to the mortal world for a tribulation now.

496
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,020
Just a few unstable stars.

497
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,170
Nothing to worry about.

498
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,020
The repair of my primordial spirit

499
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,080
is much more important.

500
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:01,910
But

501
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,700
it can wait just a few days.

502
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:04,730
As the mortals say,

503
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,620
you can't be too careful.

504
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,510
Although you can afford to be careless,

505
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:10,320
it doesn't hurt to be careful.

506
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,860
Do you think

507
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,670
I can't handle the Seven Stars Alignment?

508
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,320
Your Divinity.

509
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:23,710
Your Holiness.

510
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,260
Immortal Chu Kong insists on going to the mortal world now.

511
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,060
What?

512
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:30,260
He's going to the mortal world now?

513
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:31,970
He and Fuyuan Fairy

514
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,990
have gone to the Fate Bureau.

515
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,270
Go to them now.

516
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,250
Keep a close watch on them.

517
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,420
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

518
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,910
Chu Kong must not fail this tribulation.

519
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,610
Yes.

520
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,420
Your Divinity.

521
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,440
Please reconsider.

522
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,740
It's really not a good time.

523
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,780
Red Thread Master.

524
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:02,970
After I leave,

525
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:04,670
you must take good care of yourself.

526
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,220
Don't miss me too much.

527
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,230
Your Divinity.

528
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,380
Your Divinity.

529
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,720
I made it.

530
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,820
I'm in charge of the Fate Book now.

531
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,790
I need to see off the God of War and Fuyuan Fairy.

532
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,530
Otherwise,

533
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,220
I'll have to answer to His Holiness,

534
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,740
won't I?

535
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:29,750
If we go back to 30,000 years ago

536
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,220
without memories,

537
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,660
how can we uncover the truth?

538
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,060
Don't panic.

539
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,620
Things we experience

540
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,000
can be recalled

541
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,510
after we come back.

542
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,220
Let's go.

543
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:24,460
In a second,

544
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,389
we'll go back to 30,000 years ago.

545
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,120
To ensure that nothing goes wrong,

546
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,130
I've put a spell on the Tianji Compass.

547
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:37,469
The moment I lose my memories,

548
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,239
the Tianji Compass will appear.

549
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,389
Once I activate it,

550
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:43,370
it'll send us back.

551
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,679
We can definitely find out the truth.

552
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,880
I told you to keep an eye on them.

553
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,790
What did you do?

554
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:12,340
You don't even know where he is now.

555
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,300
Isn't it ridiculous?

556
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,160
You wrote the Fate Book,

557
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,780
but you don't know where he is.

558
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:18,820
I-I...

559
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,480
I did write the Fate Book.

560
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,490
But the stars have been acting abnormally lately.

561
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,530
It's not a good time to go to the mortal world.

562
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,210
Could it be

563
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,490
that they've been

564
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,580
transported to another dimension?

565
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:35,740
Yes.

566
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,970
They must be in another dimension now.

567
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:38,580
I don't care about that!

568
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,780
I just want to know

569
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,640
where they are now.

570
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:44,500
Well.

571
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:45,380
It's…

572
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,550
It's hard…

573
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,360
They…

574
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:48,850
No…

575
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,810
We can ask them when they come back.

576
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:55,900
I'll leave.

577
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:25,300
Only one step left to forge the Soul-shattering Arrow.

578
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,400
With one trace of ancient primordial spirit,

579
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:31,910
I can complete it.

580
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,510
Your Highness.

581
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,420
Are you all right?

582
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,120
Don't worry.

583
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,740
I'm fine.

584
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,910
Your Highness.

585
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,670
Yes?

586
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,820
Our source in the Moluo Divine Clan

587
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,440
said that Immortal Chu Kong visited Jin Lian a few days ago

588
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,170
and left with the Tianji Compass.

589
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,970
The Tianji Compass?

590
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,340
Has he

591
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,360
gone back to 30,000 years ago?

592
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,760
[30,000 years ago, Cang Hai Palace]

593
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,380
Congratulations, Your Grace. She's a princess.

594
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,100
I alone am to blame

595
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,250
for violating the rules.

596
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,470
It has nothing to do with my daughter.

597
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,760
If someone is to be punished,

598
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,200
punish me.

599
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:35,060
[Monarch of Moluo]

600
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,600
[3,000 years later]

601
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:57,560
[Cang Hai, Empress of Moluo]

602
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,840
The same dream again.

603
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,560
Since young,

604
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:15,100
I've dreamed

605
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,460
of the same scene countless times.

606
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,100
Dreams are messages.

607
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,560
They're dreamed for a reason.

608
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,590
Empress.

609
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:45,090
Happy 3000th birthday.

610
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,590
This is the list of gifts from different tribes.

611
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,780
Please have a look.

612
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,320
Do with them as you see fit.

613
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,750
I just got one year older.

614
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,500
Nothing to be happy about.

615
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,680
[Jin Cheng, Protector of the Moluo Divine Clan]

616
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:55,780
Empress,

617
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:58,140
you're very young.

618
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,590
"Old" is not the word for you.

619
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,680
Besides, turning 3,000 years old

620
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,620
means becoming an adult.

621
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:06,700
You can marry and have children now.

622
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:10,010
I've been looking forward to this day.

623
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,820
The royal family of the Moluo Gods

624
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,010
has few descendants.

625
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,030
You're the only one left now.

626
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:16,930
Empress,

627
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,480
you must get married as soon as possible

628
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,790
and start a family.

629
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:20,140
Only then can…

630
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:20,900
Enough.

631
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,240
Protector,

632
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,380
can we talk about something else?

633
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,200
Since I was 2,000 years old,

634
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,850
you've been nagging me about it.

635
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:31,500
You're talking my ears off.

636
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,200
Sorry to be annoying.

637
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:35,780
But

638
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,250
I'm saying this for your good.

639
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,820
In my opinion,

640
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:43,280
Prince Xiu Ming may be more anxious than me.

641
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,590
It's been over a thousand years

642
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:48,140
since he was sent here as a hostage.

643
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,170
You've been very nice to him.

644
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,790
No wonder he cares so much for you.
