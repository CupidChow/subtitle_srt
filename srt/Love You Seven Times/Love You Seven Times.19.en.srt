[Episode 19]

4
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,620
Snow lotuses can be used to treat heart disease,

5
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,910
can't they?

6
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,780
I don't like snow.

7
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,380
Why?

8
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,250
Someone once closed her eyes in the snow

9
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,080
and never opened them again.

10
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:24,170
Master,

11
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,220
you seem to have many sad memories.

12
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,980
I've made a wish.

13
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,220
I wish you could be

14
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,920
healthy and happy

15
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,280
in the future.

16
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,480
He's alone with her.

17
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,600
It's gonna be a long night.

18
00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:17,980
I want to watch too.

19
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,850
You're a flower.

20
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,500
Stay out of this.

21
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:23,100
I want to watch too!

22
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,100
In order to save Xiaoxiang,

23
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,960
the Sect Leader used the Power of Linglong Heart again.

24
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,440
Although with your help,

25
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:35,829
nothing life-threatening happened,

26
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,290
I'm still worried.

27
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,630
About what?

28
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,579
Are you worried

29
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,100
that I can't save him next time?

30
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,980
Or are you worried that he'll

31
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,540
change his mind about taking Xiaoxiang's heart?

32
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,770
In all these years,

33
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,750
have you ever seen the Sect Leader

34
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,220
treat someone else as well as Xiaoxiang?

35
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,560
He's injured

36
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,940
but spent the whole evening taking care of Xiaoxiang.

37
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,600
Even if he's acting…

38
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,940
Even if he's acting,

39
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,740
he doesn't have to go to such lengths.

40
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:07,980
In my opinion,

41
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,410
the Sect Leader

42
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,770
has fallen in love with Xiaoxiang

43
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,090
without realizing it.

44
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:20,930
So you're worried

45
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,690
that the Sect Leader is not acting

46
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,460
but truly caring for Xiaoxiang?

47
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,400
But there is only one way to cure the Linglong Heart.

48
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,470
If the Sect Leader doesn't take Xiaoxiang's heart,

49
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,530
he'll only have

50
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,450
one year to live.

51
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,540
If you were him,

52
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,640
would you let your beloved one

53
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,230
sacrifice for you?

54
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,020
Silly.

55
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,980
If this goes on,

56
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,260
I'll run out of time.

57
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,970
You may leave.

58
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,090
Yes.

59
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,890
Why is the Changning Palace empty?

60
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:46,320
Where is God Haoxuan?

61
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,330
There seems to be a magical barrier.

62
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,860
Let me take a look.

63
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:01,600
What kind of magic

64
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,390
is God Haoxuan practicing?

65
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,980
Why so secretive?

66
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,550
That's

67
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,100
the Doom Mark.

68
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,280
Darn it.

69
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,420
The Doom Mark is consuming me more and more quickly.

70
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:47,330
I must find a way to suppress it.

71
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,440
Curiosity killed the cat.

72
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:31,490
Immortal Li,

73
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,500
you went to the Changning Palace to visit me.

74
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:38,760
But why did you leave

75
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,070
before meeting me?

76
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,700
God Haoxuan.

77
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:46,570
What do you want?

78
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,210
Judging from what you saw

79
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,270
in the Changning Palace,

80
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:54,010
what I want

81
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,100
is not hard to guess.

82
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,700
Except for you,

83
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,900
I don't think anyone else

84
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,900
will know about it.

85
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:08,810
Because

86
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,250
today,

87
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,720
you'll die.

88
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,760
Where is Master?

89
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,450
How is Xiaoxiang?

90
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,820
If she had died,

91
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,900
I would kill you.

92
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,390
Look at your angry face.

93
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,090
You must love her very much.

94
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,850
Will you give her your Linglong Heart?

95
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,620
I will.

96
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,220
You don't even have a Linglong Heart.

97
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,220
You can't give her anything.

98
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,820
She almost died in the snow.

99
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,300
She almost died!

100
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,250
I know!

101
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:42,970
In time,

102
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,020
she'll understand me.

103
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,540
What if she hadn't made it?

104
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,440
Why did you put her at risk?

105
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,110
How dare you put her at risk?

106
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,710
Ask yourself.

107
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,920
Did you do that

108
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,840
because you love her

109
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,720
or because you wanted to hurt her?

110
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,220
You're in no place to judge me.

111
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,760
Stay away from her.

112
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,630
Your Holiness.

113
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,050
As you ordered,

114
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,940
I went to the Fate Bureau

115
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,870
to check on Immortal Chu Kong's tribulation.

116
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,070
Unexpectedly, he had sealed the Chenyuan Mirror

117
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,940
before going to the mortal world.

118
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,710
But

119
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,590
I read the Fate Book.

120
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,940
In this tribulation,

121
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,620
Fuyuan Fairy's family in the mortal world

122
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,040
all died in a massacre.

123
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,190
When she was helpless and desperate,

124
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,710
Immortal Chu Kong came out of nowhere

125
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,730
and helped her out.

126
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,200
A damsel in distress and her hero?

127
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,020
Cliche, isn't it?

128
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,850
I think so too.

129
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:46,880
But it works.

130
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,460
I think

131
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,340
Immortal Chu Kong's

132
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,820
primordial spirit

133
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,070
can be repaired soon.

134
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,380
Don't worry, Your Holiness.

135
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,300
I'll keep an eye on them for you.

136
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,970
Alright.

137
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,240
I see.

138
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,650
You did a good job.

139
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,490
You can go.

140
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,100
Where is she?

141
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:37,240
Sect Leader.

142
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,130
Sect Leader.

143
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,850
This is the hairpin

144
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,270
the craftsmen made

145
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,610
according to your drawing.

146
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:46,920
Here.

147
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,050
Take a look.

148
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,210
How do you like it?

149
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,120
You may leave.

150
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,460
Okay.

151
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,850
In this life,

152
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,920
you lost all your memories,

153
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,820
but why were you still willing to

154
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,100
risk your life for me?

155
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,540
Xiaoxiang,

156
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,230
when you were sick,

157
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,380
the whole sect revolved around you.

158
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,510
Don't be so willful again.

159
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,970
I know I was wrong.

160
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,940
When you were sick,

161
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,300
the most worried one was the Sect Leader.

162
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,690
He needed rest too

163
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,040
but took care of you all night.

164
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,490
In the whole sect,

165
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,090
he only treats you

166
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,580
so well.

167
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,110
As long as Master is with me,

168
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:42,990
I'm not afraid of anything.

169
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,680
Even when I was sick,

170
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,700
I felt warm inside.

171
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,610
I feel the same

172
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,140
when I'm with you, Qian Mou.

173
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,020
Xiaoxiang.

174
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,180
If…

175
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,410
I mean if.

176
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,530
If the Sect Leader needs your help,

177
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,640
will you do anything for him?

178
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,050
Of course.

179
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,740
Master is the most important person to me.

180
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,620
I'll do

181
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,870
whatever he asks me to do.

182
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,060
No matter what it is?

183
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,200
If he wants,

184
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,500
I'll be with him forever

185
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,900
and do whatever he wants me to do.

186
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:28,100
In this tribulation,

187
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,600
you don't have any memories of the past, but…

188
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:37,900
Xiaoxiang.

189
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,230
Master.

190
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,630
You're an adult now

191
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,880
but still eat like a clumsy kid.

192
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,560
Is it clean now?

193
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,590
Don't move.

194
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,140
After you return to the Heaven Realm and remember everything,

195
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,840
will you still care for

196
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,620
the man standing in front of you?

197
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:34,960
Master.

198
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,760
Is this a gift for me?

199
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,200
I heard

200
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,880
what you said just now.

201
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,500
I agree.

202
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,060
Master, do you mean

203
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,060
you'll let me stay with you forever?

204
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,010
In the future,

205
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,890
don't be so reckless again.

206
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,510
When I'm not around,

207
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,750
you must be careful with what you say and do

208
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,180
and

209
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,020
take good care of yourself.

210
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,480
You promised

211
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,320
to be with me forever.

212
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,020
Why will you not be around?

213
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,540
Just in case.

214
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,100
In case I…

215
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,760
It won't happen.

216
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,490
I'll always be with you.

217
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,730
We'll always be together.

218
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,760
Then promise me

219
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,420
to stay alive

220
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,510

I need to tell the Sect Leader something urgent.

Unless it's very urgent.

248
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:49,070
No.

249
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:50,940
Unless it's extremely urgent,

250
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,570
the Sect Leader will hit the ceiling

251
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,770
if you disturb him now.

252
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,120
Don't blame me for not warning you.

253
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:00,790

and Xiaoxiang…

255
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,770
I asked you to find that fairy

256
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,339
and stop her from having the love tribulation with Chu Kong.

257
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,150
You tried so many times

258
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,650
but never succeeded.

259
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,079
If you can't even do such an easy thing,

260
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,130
why do I need you?

261
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,560
Sorry, My Lord.

262
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,280
I'll accept any punishment.

265
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,230
will do everything I can

266
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,490
to make Immortal Chu Kong fail this tribulation.

267
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,980
My patience has limits.

268
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:00,390
Leave.

269
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:02,850
Yes.

270
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,020
Tell me.

271
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,080
Where is Yang Xiaoxiang?

272
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,430
I don't know.

00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,260
You can't hurt

275

Xiaoxiang.

276
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,960
The Shengling Sect won't allow anyone

277
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,720
to hurt her.

[Xu Wenrui, the leader of the Jinwu Sect]

279
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,090
Do you think your silence

280
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,050
can keep me from finding her?

281
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,720
She's under our Sect Leader's protection.

282
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:45,660
You

283
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,460
can't hurt her.

284
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,570
So she's with Chu Kong.

[Leyi House]

286
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,790
Master,

287
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,890
have some crabapple cake.

288
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:06,900
How do you like it?

289
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,390
Not bad.

290
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,220
Great.

291
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:13,980
From this day forward,

292
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,700
I'll make

293
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,660
crabapple cake for you every day.

294
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,020
Master.

295
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,390
Are you okay?

296
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,670
I told you

297
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,880
you haven't recovered yet

298
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,300
and shouldn't start working so soon.

299
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,300
I'm fine.

300
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:36,560

00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,480

302
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:49,870
Master.

303
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,900
Have a candied plum.

304
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,390
Do you think I'm like you?

305
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,810
I'm not a three-year-old kid.

306
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,120
The preserves you gave me are very sweet.

307
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,420
I've been saving them.

308
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,380
Be good.

309
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,380
Eat it

310
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,380
to get rid of the bitter taste.

311
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,120
I…

312
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,300
So naughty.

313
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,510
Sect Leader.

314
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,300
What's wrong?

315
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,740
A village down the mountain was slaughtered.

316
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,660
I'm afraid something is wrong.

317
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,500
Master.

318
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,770
What happened?

319
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,860
Something happened down the mountain.

320
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,400
I need to check it out with Qian Mou.

321
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,610
Master.

322
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:40,970
You haven't recovered yet.

323
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,380
Don't worry.

324
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,020
I'll be back soon.

325
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,460
Master.

326
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,300
Stop pretending.

327
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,410
You…

328
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,020
All you do is stare.

329
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,940
Stop staring!

330
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,410
You went to Shengling Peak all alone

331
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,490
and caused the Sect Leader

332
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,980
to save you with the Power of Linglong Heart.

333
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,800
The Sect Leader

334
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,900
is so weak now.

335
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,420
It's all your fault.

336
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:14,050
Even if you collected thousands of snow lotuses

337
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,080
or tens of thousands of them,

338
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,090
you could only treat the symptoms.

339
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,450
You can never make up for

340
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,980
the Power of Linglong Heart he used for you.

341
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,660

The Power of Linglong Heart?

343
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,850
What does it have to do with Master's heart disease?

344
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:36,140
I…

345
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,130
I don't know what you mean.

346
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,420
You heard me wrong.

347
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,950
Linglong Heart?

348
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,930
I seem to have

349
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,390
seen it somewhere.

350
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,490
[Record of Linglong Heart Disease]

351
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,510
[Record of Linglong Heart Disease]

352
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,810
The Linglong Heart

353
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,530
is only half the size of a normal heart.

354
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,730
People with it are very powerful

355
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:41,960
but have short lifespans.

356
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,620
They die before 20 years old.

357
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,500
The only way to cure it

358
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,450
is to get another Linglong Heart.

359
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,860
But a certain requirement needs to be met.

360
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,890
The donation must be made

361
00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:53,330
willingly and out of love.

362
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,840
To test if the donor is qualified, kiss him or her.

363
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,540
If your hearts glow together,

364
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,620
the donor is your true love

365
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,770
and the transplant can be started.

366
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,060
Even the most insane novel writer in the world

367
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,460
can't come up with such an absurd

368
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:09,220
and twisted plot.

369
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,960
You came here to read novels again.

370
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:26,450
If the Sect Leader finds out,

371
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,160
he'll blame me for being a bad influence.

373
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,980
Is what this book says about the Linglong Heart

374
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:34,940
true?

375
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,380
Linglong Heart? I've never heard of it.

376
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,600
These are all fictional stories.

377
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,570
Don't read them again.

378
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,460
I can ask Xiuming.

379
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,330
He's knowledgeable.

380
00:24:58,490 --> 00:24:59,730
Perhaps he knows something about it.

00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:17,670
I'm coming in.

384
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,260
Xiuming?

385
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,260
Are you here?

386
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,990
Does it look good on me?

387
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:10,100
Yes.

388
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,670
I'm Xiuming.

389
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,780
You know me?

390
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,180
Come with me.

391
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,280
I'll explain later.

392
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,370
Trust me.

393
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:26,250
So my surname is Yang

394
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,010
and my name is Yang Xiaoxiang?

395
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,420
We grew up together

396
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,630
and held each other dear.

397
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:31,980
Don't you

398
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,560
remember any of that?

399
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:52,300
Perilla should be used with angelica roots.

400
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,100
Understand?

401
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:53,740
Yes.

402
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,740
Ren.

403
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:56,410
Do you know where Xiuming is?

404
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,740
He's able-bodied.

405
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,640
He can go

406
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,730
wherever he wants.

407
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,220
You guys, be careful.

408
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:08,700
Okay.

409
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,060
Don't make any mistakes.

410
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,170
Okay.

411
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,390
Ke.

412
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,040
Have you seen Xiuming?

413
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:16,290
No.

414
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,910
Lin.

415
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,890
Do you know where Xiuming is?

416
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,280
No.

417
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,140
Sect Leader.

418
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,060
You guys, go over there.

419
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,570
Yes.

420
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,840
I made an investigation.

421
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,320
There were 65 people in this village.

422
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,040
Only a brother and sister survived.

423
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,330
According to them,

424
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,370
a group of people broke into the village last night.

425
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:52,480
After their parents heard the noises,

426
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,850
they hid them in a dry well in the backyard.

427
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,300
There was lots of screaming outside

428
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:01,390
but it lasted less than an hour.

429
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,430
I searched the scene

430
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,720
but didn't find any body.

431
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,420
However,

432
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,000
I found this.

433
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,570
[Token]

434
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,500
The token of the Jinwu Sect?

435
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:18,540
Yes.

436
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,900
Senior, nobody there.

437
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:20,780
Then let's go somewhere else.

438
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,620
Xu Wenrui

439
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:21,980
Okay.

440
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,270
must have been involved in this.

441
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,030
To kill so many people

442
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,540
and hide their bodies

443
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,770
in such a short time

444
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,460
was not an easy task.

445
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,280
Ren.

446
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,790
Have you seen Xiuming?

447
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,640
Ke.

448
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,260
No.

449
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,610
Lin.

450
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,190
I don't know.

451
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,490
Don't you want to see your family and friends?

452
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,260
You know where my family is?

453
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,760
That's great.

454
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,180
Later, I'll ask Master

455
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,380
to take us down the mountain.

456
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,290
Xiaoxiang.

457
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:03,900
Do you trust Chu Kong that much?

458
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:04,620
Yes.

459
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,640
He's my master.

460
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:07,390
No one would tell me

461
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,070
where Xiuming is.

462
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,190
Is it because they don't want me

463
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,000
to know about my family?

464
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,420
[Leyi House]

465
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,500
Is everything alright in the sect?

466
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,080
Where is Xiaoxiang?

467
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,220
Sect Leader,

468
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,560
everything's fine.

469
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,720
It's just that…

470
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,590
Xiaoxiang

471
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,270
asked me

472
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,690
where Pei Xiuming was today.

473
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,060
I didn't tell her anything.

474
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,940
I've told everyone in the sect

475
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,850
not to tell Xiaoxiang

476
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,670
where Pei Xiuming is.

477
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,830
Xiaoxiang asked about Mr. Pei

478
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:45,700
so suddenly.

479
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,960
Has she found out

480
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,420
that you put him in the dungeon?

481
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,230
When did she come to you?

482
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,540
Three in the afternoon.

483
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,460
Three.

484
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,660
I thought the Shengling Sect was my home.

485
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,070
I have Master

486
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
and seniors here.

487
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,500
Xiaoxiang.

488
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,200
But in the end, I find…

489
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:15,540
Xiaoxiang.

490
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:16,700
I'm just an outsider

491
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,790
like you.

492
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:19,530
Xiaoxiang.

493
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,220
Xiaoxiang.

494
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,770
The one they want to fatten and kill is not you.

495
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,380
It's me.

496
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:36,980
Xiaoxiang.

497
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,190
Are you deaf?

498
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:47,510
You just got over a cold.

499
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,660
Have you forgotten how unwell you were?

500
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:53,670
Go back to your room.

501
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,090
Is it because of Pei Xiuming?

502
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,750
Where is he?

503
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,760
Go back to your room first.

504
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,040
Where on earth is he?

505
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,890
Is he so important to you?

506
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,840
Of course.

507
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,180
If it weren't for him,

508
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,060
you wouldn't have…

509
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,740
Forget it.

510
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,750
I should mind my own business.

511
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:41,350
Sorry to bother you.

our lives will be affected too.

547
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:53,620
Who is

548
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,700
that poor guy

549
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,270
whose life is so bitter?

550
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,300
Our Sect Leader

551
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,860
may have forgotten his original plan.

552
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,870
This is why they say

553
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,350
life is unpredictable.

554
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,340
If this continues,

555
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,949
I think he'll even be willing to

556
00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:13,110
give his heart to…

557
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,250
Did you see that?

558
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,699
The Sect Leader

559
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:39,780
has been keeping a straight face the whole day.

560
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,570
In all these years,

561
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,900
I've never seen him

562
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,260
so frustrated.

563
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,219
Xiaoxiang is undoubtedly his nemesis.

564
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,630
The Sect Leader is always so sharp-tongued

565
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:53,000
but becomes dumb in front of Xiaoxiang.

566
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,470
Xiaoxiang is really something.

567
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,790
What exactly happened?

568
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:06,650
Before we left,

569
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:08,910
they were fine.

570
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:10,710
Why did everything change

571
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,810
after we came back?

572
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,100
Do you know what's the most common cliche

573
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,150
in romantic novels?

574
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:17,630
Blood feud?

575
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,610
Memory loss?

576
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:20,780
Substitutes?

577
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,050
Incurable disease?

578
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:26,640
It's the love triangle.

579
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,110
It's classic and never out of date.

580
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:30,550
Our Sect Leader

581
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,250
is in a melodramatic love triangle now.

582
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,430
Besides,

583
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:38,130
his rival seems to have the upper hand.

584
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,380
Did Mr. Pei manage to win Xiaoxiang's heart

585
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:43,330
while the Sect Leader was gone?

586
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,540
Are you stupid?

587
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,350
We threw him into the dungeon.

588
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:51,440
How could he manage to do that?

589
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,250
You're right.

590
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:56,720
I don't understand.

591
00:35:58,810 --> 00:35:59,890
Did she hear us?

592
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,010
She just…

593
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,310
Xiaoxiang.

594
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,640
Come with me.

595
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:02,860
Trust me.

596
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,480
But after Master saved me

597
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,030
down the mountain,

598
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,200
I got very sick

599
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,510
and forgot everything.

600
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,100
We grew up together

601
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,180
and held each other dear.

602
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,160
I promised

603
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,100
to be with you forever

604
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,300
and protect you.

605
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,020
Xiaoxiang.

606
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,980
Don't you want to meet your family and friends?

607
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,940
Xiaoxiang is childlike.

608
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,090
Don't lie to her, Mr. Pei.

609
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,490
Stay away from Pei.

610
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,080
He's so glib.

611
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,680
Be careful not to be fooled by him.

612
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:40,590
Xiaoxiang has come of age.

613
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,650
It's improper for you

614
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:43,710
to keep her by your side.

615
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,560
[Record of Linglong Heart Disease]

616
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,350
Not that.

617
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,020
In order to save you,

618
00:37:53,150 --> 00:37:54,310
the Sect Leader

619
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,890
used the Power of Linglong Heart.

620
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,230
Linglong Heart? I've never heard of it.

621
00:37:57,350 --> 00:37:58,700
These are all fictional stories.

622
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,900
Don't read them again.

623
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,140
The Power of Linglong Heart.

624
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,740
Linglong Heart? I've never heard of it.

625
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,980
The Power of Linglong Heart?

626
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,610
Xiaoxiang.

627
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,980
Has Master kept me here

628
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,630
because of the Linglong Heart?
