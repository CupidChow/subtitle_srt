00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,970
[Love you seven times]

3
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,920
[Episode 30]

4
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,100
What do you mean?

5
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,180
Chu Kong.

6
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,990
I knew

7
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,660
you would return

8
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,030
as soon as you heard the Divine Prophecy.

9
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,990
But since you're back,

10
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:56,860
don't leave anymore.

11
00:01:59,150 --> 00:01:59,990
You

12
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,530
spread the Divine Prophecy on purpose?

13
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,320
Chu Kong.

14
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,290
I also know about the relationship between you and Cang Hai.

15
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,320
No matter what happens,

16
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,350
you won't

17
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,140
leave her easily.

18
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,150
But now the Divine Prophecy has descended.

19
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,730
Cang Hai will soon turn demonic and destroy the world.

20
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,630
If you remain with the Moluo Divine Clan,

21
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:19,910
not only will you disregard your own safety,

22
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:21,970
you'll also affect the Qilin Divine Clan.

23
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,190
So

24
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,870
I had to do this

25
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,590
to force you...

26
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,700
I know her.

27
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,230
She will never become a demon.

28
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,500
Chu Kong.

29
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,910
Stop being stubborn.

30
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,180
Stay.

31
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,380
Stay in the Qilin Divine Clan.

32
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,560
Take it as a request from me,

33
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:45,970
your older brother.

34
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,240
Brother,

35
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,140
you know my feelings for Xiaotang.

36
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,980
You should know.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,730
Even if you lure me here,

38
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,720
I will still go back to her.

39
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:08,100
Xiaotang and I are engaged.

40
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,110
Whether she's a god or a demon,

41
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,350
I will never let her down.

42
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,860
Since you insist on disobeying my advice,

43
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,420
don't blame me for what I must do.

44
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,510
Guards.

45
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:32,780
Arrest Prince Chu Kong.

46
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,540
Yes.

47
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,980
Chu Kong!

48
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,140
Chu Kong.

49
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:55,930
With this Divine Prophecy,

50
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,860
Cang Hai and the Moluo Divine Clan

51
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,120
will surely become the common enemy of the six realms.

52
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:05,550
[Moluo Empress will become demonic and destroy the world]

53
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,380
By then,

54
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,420
I will lead the Qilin Divine Clan

55
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,730
to become the head of the six realms

56
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,620
and make the world

57
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,930
submit to me.

58
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:33,430
Your Highness.

59
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,250
Control the evil aura in your body.

60
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:37,720
If you let it go on like this,

61
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,630
you'll be devoured sooner or later.

62
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,020
Why should I control myself?

63
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,150
I was born an abandoned child.

64
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,440
Since I am already abandoned,

65
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:51,810
leave me to my own demise.

66
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,780
Xiu Ming.

67
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:17,810
Why are you here?

68
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,400
The rumors outside

69
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,900
are just nonsense.

70
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,260
Don't worry about it.

71
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,950
Don't be so nervous.

72
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,060
The Moluo Divine Clan is the head of the six realms.

73
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,640
Even if the Divine Prophecy is spread,

74
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,550
how many people

75
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,700
dare to provoke us?

76
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,580
Even if Chu Kong doesn't return,

77
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,260
I will always be by your side.

78
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,760
You don't have to worry

79
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,920
about my wife.

80
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,220
You're back.

81
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,590
What took you so long?

82
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,690
The wedding is coming.

83
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,550
I went to the house along the way

84
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,000
and tidied things a little.

85
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,990
You're still

86
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:00,700
thinking about this?

87
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,750
The most important thing now

88
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,240
is our marriage.

89
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,660
Chu Kong.

90
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,390
From now on,

91
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,830
her happiness

92
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,470
is in your hands.

93
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,920
If you don't treat her well,

94
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,390
I won't let you go.

95
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,590
Need you remind me

96
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:34,850
of these things?

97
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,770
Lord Protector!

98
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,510
Lord Protector!

99
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,680
Lord Protector.

100
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
Bad news.

101
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,060
Young Master and Young Miss are dying.

102
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,850
What did you say?

103
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,820
What happened?

104
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,460
Young Master and Young Miss

105
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,220
suddenly vomited blood and fainted.

106
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,140
After checking, the physician said that

107
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,260
their primordial spirits are weak.

108
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,270
They are on the verge of dying.

109
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:27,130
Lord Protector.

110
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,120
Lord Protector.

111
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:29,300
Please go back to them.

112
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,160
If you delay any further,

113
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,110
I’m afraid they will...

114
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,430
You really helped me a lot this time, Protector.

115
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,909
I will remember your kindness

116
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,120
and return the favor.

117
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,260
When the time is right,

118
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,800
I will

119
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,570
give everything

120
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,210
to cure your children.

121
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,830
Move!

122
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:03,360
What brings you here

123
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,230
to see me, Lord Protector?

124
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,060
The current situation is complicated.

125
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,140
All tribes

126
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,260
are watching the Moluo Divine Clan.

127
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,340
If people find out

128
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,680
I often have contact with

129
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:26,010
Lord Protector of the Moluo Divine Clan,

130
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,190
it may stir unnecessary trouble

131
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,800
when the word gets out.

132
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,500
Your Highness, please.

133
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,250
Please save my children.

134
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:52,940
Lord Protector.

135
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,440
What are you doing?

136
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,680
Please get up.

137
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,210
Jin Lian and Jin Luo are dying.

138
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,790
Please save them.

139
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,670
Even if you come to me now,

140
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,810
there's nothing I can do.

141
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,790
You promised me.

142
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,330
As long as I work for you,

143
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,680
you will save my children.

144
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,110
Even if you kill me today,

145
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,080
I will still tell you that

146
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,560
in the six realms,

147
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:37,140
the only person who can save your children

148
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,940
is Chu Kong.

149
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,140
In this world,

150
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,400
Chu Kong is the one and only

151
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:52,070
Jin Qilin at birth.

152
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,390
His primordial spirit has healing properties.

153
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,760
If you want to save your children,

154
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,020
you have to ask him.

155
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,220
So you planned all this.

156
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,300
Jin Lian and Jin Luo took the elixir you gave them.

157
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,860
That's why they lost their energy

158
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,310
and caused their primordial spirits to crumble early.

159
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,220
And you did all this

160
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,700
to plot against Prince Chu Kong.

161
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,570
Think about it.

162
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,590
Actually, I gave you the elixir

163
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,330
with good intentions.

164
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:27,230
How would I know

165
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,260
if this elixir

166
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,090
was meant for children?

167
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:31,730
Also,

168
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,320
Chu Kong is my brother.

169
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,260
How could I harm him?

170
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,940
From beginning to end,

171
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,400
I've been telling you

172
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,490
how to save your children.

173
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:47,990
And the one who made every decision

174
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,950
was you.

175
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,180
As long as Jin Cheng asks,

176
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,990
Chu Kong will surely help.

177
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,160
When his primordial spirit is seriously injured,

178
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,020
Cang Hai will not sit by and do nothing.

179
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,340
By then,

180
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,940
no one can stop my plan.

181
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,270
That rascal!

182
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,280
Father,

183
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,190
if other clans know

184
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,000
about the relationship between the second prince

185
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,030
of the Qilin Divine Clan and the Moluo Empress,

186
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,880
the Qilin Divine clan will surely be implicated.

187
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,150
What should we do?

188
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:51,350
Lead the Qilin army

189
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,780
to meet the tribes now.

190
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,150
Keep a close eye on the Moluo Clan.

191
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,870
If anything happens,

192
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,620
we must take the lead.

193
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,990
We can't let the Qilin Divine Clan's reputation be damaged.

194
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,460
Yes.

195
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,100
I'll go now.

196
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:47,580
♫The circle of life spins quietly♫

197
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,800
♫Our destinies are written in the stars♫

198
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,440
♫Like children who wouldn't grow up♫

199
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,400
♫We keep asking for an answer♫

200
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,200
♫The past fades away like smoke♫

201
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,630
♫I thought I was used to saying goodbye♫

202
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,680
♫Looking back, I know I'll see you♫

203
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,940
♫You're still waiting for me♫

204
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,240
♫Life, cruel life♫

205
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,340
♫It left us scarred♫

206
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,800
♫Memories, sweet memories♫

207
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,920
♫They keep bringing me back♫

208
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,510
♫Do you wonder how I've been?♫

209
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,090
♫Or do you not care at all?♫

210
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,520
♫Your eyes cut me deep♫

211
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,570
♫Like a knife♫

212
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,240
♫For a fleeting moment♫

213
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:34,390
♫Love and hate became clear♫

214
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:36,740
♫Have we met in past lives?♫

215
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,860
♫My heart hurts when I think of you♫

216
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,810
♫That day, I kissed your lips♫

217
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,120
♫That day, you made my soul shiver♫

218
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,700
♫We both want to see the larger world♫

219
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,880
♫Before we die♫

220
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:00,170
♫I wonder what true love is like♫

221
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,250
♫Is love meant to be so painful?♫

222
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:10,010
♫After all that's happened, you're still the one♫

223
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,910
♫I love the most♫

224
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,250
♫The circle of life spins quietly♫

225
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,860
♫Our destinies are written in the stars♫

226
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,310

♫I thought I was used to saying goodbye♫

230

00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,750
♫You're still waiting for me♫

♫For a fleeting moment♫

241
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,380
I didn't know

242
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,140
♫Love and hate became clear♫

243
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,970
I'd be here for so many years.

♫Have we met in past lives?♫

245
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,600

♫That day, I kissed your lips♫

247
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,180
I'm starting to forget

248
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,980
what the outside world is like.

249
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,890
♫That day, you made my soul shiver♫

250
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,560
♫We both want to see the larger world♫

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,590

♫I wonder what true love is like♫

253
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:57,580
Now...

254
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,950
♫Is love meant to be so painful?♫

255
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,860
I should visit the outside world again.

256
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,830
♫After all that's happened, you're still the one♫

257
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,720
♫I love the most♫

258
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,760
You look

259
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,940
so beautiful today.

260
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,310
I...

261
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,200
Here.

262
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,810
Do you remember

263
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,280
the promise I made to the shooting star?

264
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,400
We'll be together

265
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,170
forever.

266
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,040
After tonight,

267
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,040
we'll be a real couple.

268
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:04,860
Come.

269
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,440
We're husband and wife.

270
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,770
We will never be apart.

271
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,820
We'll live and die together.

272
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,150
We'll never let each other down.

273
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,040
I have something for you.

274
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,500
What is it?

275
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:57,820
This is a Love Knot.

276
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,370
I got it from a marriage temple in the mortal world.

277
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,500
Although it's an item of the mortal world,

278
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,840
it works wonders.

279
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,550
It really led me to

280
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,670
a loving partner.

281
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,670
In that case,

282
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,780
I have to go back with you

283
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,620
to thank this marriage temple.

284
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,900
I think

285
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,540
the person you should thank the most

286
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,810
is me.

287
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,530
If I hadn't played the damsel in distress

288
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,990
for you to save me,

289
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,220
how could you have

290
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,440
such a beautiful and kind wife like me?

291
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,380
That makes sense.

292
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,240
Thank you.

293
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,930
I injected

294
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,210
a strand of my primordial spirit into this.

295
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,270
Wear it.

296
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:01,480
No matter where you go,

297
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,940
I'll be able to find you with it.

298
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,300
Then I'll add a strand of my primordial spirit too.

299
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,460
This way,

300
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,170
in our next life,

301
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,810
next-next life,

302
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,470
and the life after that,

303
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,480
you'll always be able to find me.

304
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,260
Holding your hand,

305
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,860
I vow to grow old together.

306
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,020
Empress!

307
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:24,940
Your Highness!

308
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,360
Empress!

309
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,630
Your Highness.

310
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,190
What's wrong?

311
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:29,870
What happened to them?

312
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,140
Tonight is your wedding night.

313
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:32,220
I deserve to die

314
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,630
for disturbing you.

315
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,030
But I have no choice.

316
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,340
Please save Jin Lian

317
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,230
and Jin Luo.

318
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,680
Bring them in.

319
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,410
Lian!

320
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:39,530
Luo!

321
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,170
Are you feeling better?

322
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,590
Thank you for saving their lives, Your Highness.

323
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,230
Take the children to my room and rest.

324
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:50,800
Okay.

325
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,080
Let's go.

326
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,870
It's okay now.

327
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,070
Chu Kong.

328
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,370
Are you okay?

329
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,820
Chu Kong.

330
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,000
Chu Kong?

331
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:10,930
Chu Kong?

332
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,080
Chu Kong!

333
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,050
So you are

334
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,080
the princess that the Moluo Divine Clan never met.

335
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,430
Indeed.

336
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,320
You look just like Cang Hai.

337
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,950
Who are you?

338
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,910
Where is Jin Cheng?

339
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,720
It doesn't matter who I am.

340
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,230
What matters is,

341
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,260
if you follow me,

342
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,060
I can take you away from here.

343
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,200
Bring Jin Cheng to me.

344
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,060
This is your only chance to leave.

345
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,380
To leave,

346
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,900
or not to leave.

347
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:22,540
That's up to you.

348
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,790
It seems that

349
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,950
you still prefer to stay

350
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,800
in this magical barrier of endless darkness.

351
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,640
I'm willing to go with you.

352
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:42,110
Fine.

353
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:45,410
I can take you away now.

354
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,460
But it's not easy

355
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,510
for me to do this.

356
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,660
What can I get in return?

357
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,210
What do you want?

358
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,970
Why are you so nervous?

359
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,610
Actually,

360
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,940
I'm not asking much of you.

361
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,440
As long as you sign the contract with me

362
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:23,310
and complete three tasks for me,

363
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,400
I will grant you freedom.

364
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,910
Of course.

365
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,420
If you want freedom,

366
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,040
you have to pay the price.

367
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,060
I'm sure you understand

368
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,500
such a simple concept.

369
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,460
Of course.

370
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,530
Now that you have signed the soul contract,

371
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,500
you must obey me.

372
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,560
Otherwise,

373
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,590
you'll know

374
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:31,040
what life is worse than death.

375
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,130
Your first task

376
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,970
is to kill

377
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:44,500
the Dixiu Divine Clan for me.

378
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,110
Let the six realms see clearly

379
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:52,030
what fate awaits the Moluo Divine Clan's

380
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:55,250
most loyal vassals.

381
00:27:58,990 --> 00:27:59,990
The Dixiu Gods have been slain.

382
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,420
Good.

383
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,740
Very good.

384
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,460
Now the six realms know that

385
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,100
Cang Hai has turned demonic

386
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,370
and killed innocent people.

387
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,860
The second task

388
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,440
is complete too.

389
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:20,010
What is

390
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:20,760
the third task?

391
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,350
The third task

392
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,080
is to

393
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,100
sacrifice your power

394
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,220
to me

395
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,450
and serve me.

396
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,500
Stop struggling.

397
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:01,490
From the moment

398
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,530
you signed the soul contract with me,

399
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,170
you will never escape

400
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,730
my grasp.

401
00:29:59,080 --> 00:29:59,750
Empress!

402
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,140
Are you alright?

403
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,340
I'm fine.

404
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,320
I just feel

405
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,600
an ache in my chest.

406
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,180
It seems that someone

407
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,920
took half of my power.

408
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,190
Could it be...

409
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,380
Did something happen to Princess Ming Yue?

410
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,620
Empress.

411
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:30,630
The strange feeling you felt

412
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,440
is related to Princess Ming Yue.

413
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,180
I'm afraid she has

414
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,040
fallen into Haoxuan's hands.

415
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,620
Please save her.

416
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,140
Ming Yue?

417
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,040
Who is Ming Yue?

418
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,500
Actually,

419
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,020
I've been hiding something from you.

420
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,070
The Moluo royal family

421
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,660
always gave birth to twins.

422
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,980
You were no exception.

423
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,240
The Queen gave birth to a pair of twin sisters.

424
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,980
One of them was you,

425
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,660
and the other

426
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,400
was Princess Ming Yue.

427
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,570
However,

428
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,080
the Moluo royal family has always been cursed.

429
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,710
If they were same-sex twins,

430
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,090
one of them

431
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,140
would be born with an evil aura.

432
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,700
In other words, a born demon.

433
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,220
You and Princess Ming Yue

434
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,680
were destined from the moment

435
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,760
you were born.

436
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:21,970
One would become a god,

437
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,620
and the other, a demon.

438
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,160
According to the Clan's ancestral instruction,

439
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,660
Princess Ming Yue's soul

440
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,060
must be destroyed

441
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:31,090
before it connects with your power.

442
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,440
But the late Emperor was reluctant.

443
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:35,750
So he ordered me

444
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,720
to lock her up.

445
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,620
I was eager to save my children,

446
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,900
but I fell into

447
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,400
villain Haoxuan's trap

448
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,300
and leaked Princess Ming Yue's whereabouts.

449
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,270
In this world,

450
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,220
Chu Kong is the one and only Jin Qilin at birth.

451
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,360
His primordial spirit has healing properties.

452
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,730
If you want to save your children,

453
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,910
you have to ask him.

454
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,490
I suspect

455
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,760
even the Divine Prophecy

456
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,150
was part of Haoxuan's plot.

457
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,300
So,

458
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,780
for the past 3,000 years,

459
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,050
she had been imprisoned

460
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,740
in a dark dungeon.

461
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,510
How could you do that?

462
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,320
She was just a baby.

463
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,220
How could you be sure that she would become demonic?

464
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,000
I was wrong.

465
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:31,540
After we rescue Princess Ming Yue,

466
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,620
I'll be at your disposal.

467
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:38,070
Forget it.

468
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,090
Get up first.

469
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,920
Thank you, Empress.

470
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,280
Chu Kong.

471
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,470
I'll be back soon.

472
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,160
Don't worry

473
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,350
after you wake up.

474
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,430
I'll come back to you

475
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,910
after I deal with the problem.

476
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:07,910
Come with me.

477
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:08,720
Yes.

478
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:25,900
It must be painful

479
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,330
to suppress all that evil aura.

480
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,430
But who cares?

481
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,800
In this world,

482
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,510
no one cares about your feelings.

483
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,430
Even if you die for others,

484
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,080
you can't get any pity.

485
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:42,250
So,

486
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,270
give it to me.

487
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,300
Let me

488
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,010
release it for you completely.

489
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,030
Let the world see

490
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,420
the true strength of the blood relatives

491
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,160
who have always been vassals!

492
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:15,540
By the way,

493
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,100
I had a dream recently.

494
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,330
In my dream,

495
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:20,150
I saw a lady who looked like me.

496
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:22,840
Is she my sister?

497
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:27,080
I just want to see her in my dream.

498
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,920
Can't I do that

499
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,170
even when she's my only family?

500
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:32,929
No.

501
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:34,540
Your existence

502
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,300
cannot be known by the outside world.

503
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:41,580
Empress!

504
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:42,960
What’s wrong?

505
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,780
Oh no.

506
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,310
Ming Yue's power

507
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,980
has been completely taken from her.

508
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,260
Princess Ming Yue's power

509
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,469
shares the same origin with you.

510
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:56,190
It is almost unrivaled in the six realms.

511
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,900
If she really falls into Haoxuan's hands

512
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,090
and becomes his pawn,

513
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,010
the six realms

514
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,350
will be in danger.

515
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:03,940
No.

516
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,050
I will never allow this to happen.

517
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,300
Rest in peace.

518
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,690
After I absorbed Ming Yue's power,

519
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,660
even the Jin Qilin

520
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,310
will be no match for me

521
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:29,220
from now on.

522
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,860
Wait.

523
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,420
There's still Cang Hai.

524
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,410
If I can absorb Cang Hai's power too,

525
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,410
I’ll be truly invincible

526
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,360
in the six realms.

527
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,660
Cang Hai.

528
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:23,290
You are so insane,

529
00:38:23,310 --> 00:38:24,470
you even killed the innocent.

530
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,340
The Dixiu Divine Clan

531
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,620
was loyal to you.

532
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:30,410
To show their sincerity,

533
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,590
they even sent their prince to you as a hostage.

534
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,440
But you so cruelly

535
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:38,090
killed the entire Dixiu Divine Clan.

536
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,650
It seems that the Divine Prophecy came true.

537
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,370
You are the devil who will destroy the world.

538
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,370
The word "sanctimonious"

539
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,580
must have been made

540
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,200
for you.

541
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,680
Hand over Ming Yue.

542
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,900
Ming Yue?

543
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,470
Is that the name

544
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,300
of another innocent life that you killed?

545
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,260
Haoxuan,

546
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,930
this is all your conspiracy.

547
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,850
Princess Ming Yue must have been under your control.

548
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,380
She pretended to be the Empress

549
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,880
and killed the Dixiu Divine Clan.

550
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,050
Hand over Princess Ming Yue!

551
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,700
Princess Ming Yue?

552
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,350
Everyone in the six realms knows that

553
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,550
Cang Hai has no siblings.

554
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:23,670
You Moluos are cunning.

555
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,980
You made such a ridiculous excuse

556
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,370
to avoid your due responsibility.

557
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:30,820
For the stability of the six realms

558
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:32,530
and the safety of its inhabitants,

559
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,360
the Qilin Clan will lead an army

560
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:35,960
to fight for justice with our lives

561
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,330
and take the lead.

562
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:39,780
Come forth!

563
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,210
Kill the devil!
