00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,960
[Episode 31]

4
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,370
Come on!

5
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,820
Kill the devil!

6
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,860
Empress!

7
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,820
Lord Protector!

8
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,390
Empress!

9
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,590
I've let the former monarch down.

10
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,240
And even more so, I've let Princess Ming Yue down.

11
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,490
Empress.

12
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,110
You must find Ming Yue.

13
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,020
Don't let her take the blame

14
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,160
for the crime of causing disaster to the six realms.

15
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,060
Remember to tell her that I'm...

16
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:04,860
sorry.

17
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,580
Lord Protector!

18
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,140
Lord Protector!

19
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,340
Okay.

20
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,190
Let me see

21
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,740
who is the stronger

22
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,650
of the two sisters.

23
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,240
Sister.

24
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,360
Sister.

25
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,090
Sister.

26
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,100
Cang Hai.

27
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,280
Cang Hai.

28
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:51,380
After I absorb all your powers,

29
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,350
I’d like to see

30
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,390
if there's anyone in the six realms

31
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,760
who could rival me.

32
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,140
Kill me.

33
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,510
Just kill me now!

34
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:34,340
I don't want to help him kill anymore.

35
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,390
As expected of your sister.

36
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,140
Her spiritual power

37
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,580
has already been refined and absorbed by me,

38
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,590
yet she's still so stubborn.

39
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,880
But you know what?

40
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,020
Because of your existence,

41
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,050
she has suffered a lot.

42
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,600
Today,

43
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,690
consider it as atoning for

44
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,180
your sister's sins.

45
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,040
For Chu Kong's sake,

46
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,410
I'll make it quick for you.

47
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,780
Compared to your brother,

48
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,090
you're really much more inferior.

49
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:39,780
Don’t provoke me with these words anymore.

50
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,440
It won’t do you any good.

51
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,100
It's really you.

52
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,060
Chu Kong.

53
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,660
I didn't plan to let you know about this.

54
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,590
But since you witnessed it,

55
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,720
there's nothing I can do.

56
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:11,690
Chu Kong.

57
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,850
If it was in the past,

58
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:16,910
I wouldn't be able to defeat you

59
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,100
on my own.

60
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,760
But it's different now.

61
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,450
I'm blessed by Heaven.

62
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:26,430
Now,

63
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,790
I have the Power of Ming Yue.

64
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,350
I want to test it out.

65
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:37,500
Take this!

66
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,110
As long as the Power of Ming Yue exists in this world,

67
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,670
Chu Kong will be in danger.

68
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,950
Our powers have the same origin.

69
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,710
Only when I die

70
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,630
can the Power of Ming Yue disappear forever.

71
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,820
Xiaotang!

72
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,950
Don't do anything stupid.

73
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,460
Chu Kong.

74
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,180
You must live on well.

75
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,120
There's hope only when you're alive.

76
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,130
You said you would grow old with me.

77
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,060
You...

78
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,820
promised me.

79
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:13,450
I'm sorry.

80
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,890
I lied to you again.

81
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,380
This will also be the last time.

82
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,150
Xiaotang.

83
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,620
No!

84
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,580
No!

85
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,500
No.

86
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,760
Xiaotang!

So,

123
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,940
this is our destiny.

Your Divinity.

129
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,220
Your Divinity.

130
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,430
Greetings, Your Divinity.

131
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,750
Master. Lu Changkong. Your Divinity.

132
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:16,420
Lu Changkong.

133
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,120
Lu Changkong.

134
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,050
Chu Kong.

Chu Kong.

137
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:21,580
Chu Kong! Chu Kong! Master!

138
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,460
Master!

139
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,180
Master!

140
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:24,390
Lu Changkong! Master!

Master! Your Divinity!

142
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,220
Chu Kong.

143
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:28,610
So,

144
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,110
this is the truth from 30,000 years ago.

145
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,750
You erased my memories every time,

146
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,150
and I was forced to fall into this endless loop.

147
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,460
This time,

148
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,820
I must initiate the Tianji Compass.

149
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,700
Why?

150
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,100
W...

151
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,270
Why?

152
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,750
What passionate devotion.

153
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,220
But anyway,

154
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,830
I'm the final winner.

155
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,350
Now,

156
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,910
everyone in the six realms knows

157
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,990
that Moluo's Cang Hai

158
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,100
is the devil who ruined the world.

159
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,520
And I'm

160
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,810
the great hero that led the six realms

161
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,500
in defeating the devil.

162
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,460
Legitimacy belongs to the victor.

163
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,100
History

164
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,940
has always been written by the victors.

165
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,220
Brother.

166
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,440
You won't succeed.

167
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,350
Really?

168
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,450
Chu Kong.

169
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,370
Now,

170
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,960
I'll erase your painful memories.

171
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,110
Everything related to her

172
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,390
will disappear in your world.

173
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,450
Prince Xiu Ming.

174
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,310
Where is Cang Hai?

175
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,040
Cang Hai turned demonic

176
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,950
and wiped out the Dixiu Divine Clan.

177
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,240
Fortunately, Chu Kong took action

178
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,430
and sacrificed half of his primordial spirit

179
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,680
to banish

180
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,780
Cang Hai into the Void

181
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,180
and turned her into ashes.

182
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,460
Prince Xiu Ming.

183
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,440
The Dixiu Divine Clan

184
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,620
has finally been avenged,

185
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,250
and all living beings in the six realms

186
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,290
are finally free.

187

♫Tears stream down my face♫

193
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,190
Prince Xiu Ming.

194
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,790
♫We were the perfect match♫

195
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,020
My condolences.

196
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,610
♫But the unpredictable fate pulled us apart♫

197
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,750
♫Stumbling on the way to you♫

198
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,270
♫I found myself trapped by love♫

199
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:42,940
I only hate

200
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,400
♫I don't regret meeting you♫

201
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:47,450
that I couldn't kill the enemy myself.

202
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:48,450
♫I'll wait for you my whole life♫

203
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:53,000
♫Our love is already water under the bridge for you♫

204
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,790
♫Can you hear my wistful sighs?♫

205
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,670
♫Do you wish we could start all over?♫

206
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:06,500
♫Does the one giving more have to end up with a broken heart?♫

207
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,210
♫You left at sunset♫

208
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,430
♫My heart grew cold because I knew our story ended♫

209
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:24,370
♫I'll forever remember your face♫

210
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,660
Such a long time has passed.

211
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,540
Why isn't she back yet?

212
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:05,740
Xiangzi!

213
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:07,970
Xiangzi!

214
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,050
How was it?

215
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,480
How was it?

216
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,590
How was it, Xiangzi?

217
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,530
I'm fine.

218
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,840
Where on earth did he go for his tribulation this time?

219
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,100
The Goddess of Fate has been investigating all this while

220
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,700
but found nothing.

221
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,470
What's going on?

222
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,760
30,000 years ago,

223
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,270
Haoxuan tampered with the Divine Prophecy

224
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,610
and used Ming Yue to set me up, such that I turned demonic and ruined the world.

225
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,550
As a result, the Moluo Divine Clan

226
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:31,580
was plagued with ten thousand years of suffering and persecution.

227
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,910
30,000 years later,

228
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:34,180
Li was murdered.

229
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,330
Before he died, he hid the truth of the tampered Divine Prophecy

230
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,900
in a nursery rhyme.

231
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,010
His death

232
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,310
must have something to do with Haoxuan.

233
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,090
Xiangzi.

234
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,000
Xiangzi!

235
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,020
Oh no.

236
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,220
Something big is going to happen.

237
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,070
Whenever Xiangzi caused trouble,

238
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,650
she was always like this.

239
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,150
Oh no.

240
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,820
Oh no. Oh no. Oh no.

241
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,360
Oh no.

242
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,720
Cang Hai?

243
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:02,480
You are truly insane.

244
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:04,180
The innocent were massacred by you.

245
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,960
I wanted to send someone to invite you here.

246
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,770
I didn't expect you to come on your own accord.

247
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,870
Where is Chu Kong?

248
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,300
How was your tribulation with him this time?

249
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,490
Where have you been?

250
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,860
His Holiness is asking you a question.

251
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,920
Why are you spacing out?

252
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,550
Your Holiness.

253
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:43,980
I have something...

254
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,750
Xiangyun.

255
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,430
Don't act rashly.

256
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,350
Now, I'm not Cang Hai

257
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,080
and I don't have the Power of Cang Hai.

258
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,690
I can't act rashly and alert the enemy.

259
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,300
Your Holiness.

260
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,080
This is what I want to talk to you about.

261
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,500
Your Divinity.

262
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,820
Why didn't you stay in the mortal world

263
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,160
beside your multiple wives and concubines?

264
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,610
Stop with the nonsense.

265
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,630
Nonsense?

266
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,180
Is what I'm saying nonsense?

267
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,930
I've been waiting for you for so many years.

268
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,360
Is this the attitude you should have with me?

269
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,260
It was just the plot settings.

270
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,660
You should blame the person who wrote the Fate Book.

271
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:23,140
Why are you blaming me?

272
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,660
Tell me.

273
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,790
Was it you?

274
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,690
Why did you write such a nonsensical script

275
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,160
to let me be framed...

276
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:30,740
I wrote...

277
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,660
betrayed, estranged and a victim of an unjustly death?

278
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,460
I-I-I was the one who wrote it.

279
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,850
H-H-His Divinity made me write it.

280
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,380
You...

281
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:37,980
Wait, which script

282
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,740
are you referring to?

283
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:39,460
That's enough.

284
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,380
Since this has already happened,

285
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:44,340
what's the point

286
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,410
in pursuing it?

287
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,550
That's right.

288
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,180
It's just one love tribulation.

289
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,650
Yes.

290
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,520
You're making a scene in appropriately.

291
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,060
Chu Kong.

292
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,800
I just want to know

293
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,870
everything that happened

294
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,980
in this tribulation.

295
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,220
Cang Hai's resurrection is imminent.

296
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,630
If Cang Hai is resurrected

297
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,320
and your primordial spirit hasn't been restored yet,

298
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,880
the six realms will be overturned

299
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:06,580
right before us.

300
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,920
I'm sorry to have worried you.

301
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,340
When I entered the Mortal World Well this time,

302
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,780
there happened to be an anomaly in the stars where the Seven Stars were aligned,

303
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,330
which caused space-time chaos.

304
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,830
When we were experiencing the tribulation,

305
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,130
we also met with some accidents

306
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,660
that almost cost our lives.

307
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,270
That's why we failed this tribulation.

308
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,910
It turns out that such a tragedy happened.

309
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:26,730
Fortunately,

310
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,400
the two of you came back safely.

311
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,640
Next time,

312
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,300
you'll have to be extra careful.

313
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,860
Thank you, Brother.

314
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,140
I'll get going then.

315
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:38,700
Let's go.

316
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,060
Why didn't you wait for me to come back

317
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,680
before you confronted my brother?

318
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,960
It's too dangerous.

319
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,220
I'm sorry.

320
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,020
I was too impulsive.

321
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,610
No matter what happens in the future,

322
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,210
I won't let you face it alone.

323
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,450
I will always be with you.

324
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,690
But what we need to do now

325
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,920
is to think long-term.

326
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:40,070
Do you trust me?

327
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,400
I promised you

328
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:46,700
I'll redress the grievances of the Moluo Divine Clan

329
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:47,700
and clear your name.

330
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,020
I'll also avenge Li.

331
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,140
However, with this matter,

332
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,180
we have to be careful and think twice before we act.

333
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:56,070
If we initiate a war with my brother rashly,

334
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,510
we'll lose more than we gain.

335
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,450
I know.

336
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,580
I know what you're saying.

337
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,140
But

338
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,190
whenever I think about Moluo Divine Clan's situation

339
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,620
over the past 30,000 years,

340
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,860
I can't help but be heartbroken.

341
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,220
I understand.

342
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,280
I understand.

343
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:26,350
So, all the more should we make sure nothing goes wrong.

344
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,010
Do you think our destiny

345
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,470
began since 30,000 years ago

346
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,960
or since the first love tribulation?

347
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:55,600
But now that I think about it,

348
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,420
I don't know when it began.

349
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,710
Whether it's the present

350
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,640
or 30,000 years ago,

351
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,320
I was always destined to find you.

352
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,620
But

353
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:13,360
we still have a lot of things that we haven't had the time to do.

354
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,770
After I redress the grievances of the Moluo Divine Clan,

355
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,980
we'll resume our unfinished wedding.

356
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,470
However,

357
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,280
how can we find the evidence

358
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,030
to prove that Haoxuan tampered with the Divine Prophecy?

359
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,650
If Haoxuan

360
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,160
really tampered with the Divine Prophecy,

361
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,910
he must have been retaliated with the Doom Mark,

362
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,700
which would have spread from his right arm to his heart

363
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,030
and which cannot be removed.

364
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,250
If he really did something like that,

365
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,610
I will make him

366
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,450
account for

367
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,030
his atrocities to the Moluo Divine Clan.

368
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:15,940
Father!

369
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,500
Father!

370
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,700
Father!

371
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,540
Father!

372
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,460
Are you okay?

373
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:22,220
Wake up!

374
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:23,790
Father.

375
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,860
You'll be okay.

376
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,740
Father.

377
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,940
I made a huge mistake

378
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,520
and have sinned.

379
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,130
From now on,

380
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,090
you must not be

381
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,630
as foolish as your father.

382
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,340
In the future,

383
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,700
take good care of your sister

384
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:48,800
on my behalf.

385
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,350
Protect

386
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,550
the Moluo Divine Clan.

387
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,910
Protect

388
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,220
the Empress.

389
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,020
I promise you.

390
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,500
Father.

391
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,180
You can't abandon us.

392
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,460
Father.

393
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,970
Let me blow on your injury.

394
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,320
Then it won't hurt anymore.

395
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:29,620
Father.

396
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,220
Father!

397
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,700
Father!

398
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,940
Father!

399
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,060
Father!

400
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,380
Father!

401
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,680
Lord Protector.

402
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,700
Have you found any evidence?

403
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,490
Not yet.

404
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,310
I shouldn't have trusted you.

405
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,310
You're all birds of a feather.

406
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,360
I'm here to see you with someone.

407
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,570
Who asked you to bring someone here

408
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,620
to the restricted area of the Moluo Divine Clan?

409
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,830
Should I call you Senior Qianren

410
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,590
or Jin Lian?

411
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,350
You're not Xiaoxiang.

412
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,790
Who are you?

413
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,370
I'm Xiangyun,

414
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:39,620
an auspicious cloud that was enlightened 3,000 years ago.

415
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:41,620
I used to be a member of the Moluo Divine Clan.

416
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,980
The people from the Heaven Realm are so sinister and cunning.

417
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,860
What tricks are you playing?

418
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,780
Who on earth are you?

419
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,390
You've grown up indeed.

420
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,080
You don't look as weak as when you were young.

421
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,020
When Luo was bullied as a child,

422
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,570
you stood up for her.

423
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,200
But you were beaten up and bawled your eyes out.

424
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,350
I was the one who helped you get rid of them.

425
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,620
You cried and begged me not to tell your father.

426
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,470
We made a pinky promise.

427
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,670
Have you forgotten?

428
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,080
Empress?

429
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,290
Unfortunately,

430
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,350
my power is still in the Void.

431
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,150
I know

432
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,860
your father was bewitched by Haoxuan.

433
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,560
That's why the tragedy happened

434
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,900
and the Moluo Divine Clan was wiped out.

435
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,870
Welcome back, Empress.

436
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,530
Please lead us

437
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,020
to revive the Moluo Divine Clan!

438
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,140
After going back in time to 30,000 years ago...

439
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,780
did you find out the truth?

440
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,070
I haven’t found any evidence yet.

441
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,380
Is it that you didn't find anything

442
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,980
or that you dare not admit it?

443
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,500
If it really were me,

444
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,580
would you kill me?

445
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,040
Do you think...

446
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,970
I dare not?

447
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:51,930
Notify our clansmen

448
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,810
to stop looking for Jin Luo and Zihui.

449
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,590
What about the great resurrection of Empress Cang Hai?

450
00:32:58,770 --> 00:32:59,900
I’ve already found

451
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,860
another way to resurrect Empress Cang Hai.

452
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:02,850
You may leave.

453
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,420
Yes.

454
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:11,920
Father.

455
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,390
May your spirit

456
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:16,900
protect the Moluo Divine Clan.

457
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,310
I swear

458
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:22,490
I will make Haoxuan pay with his blood.

459
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,790
I will forever protect the Moluo Divine Clan,

460
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,360
the Empress,

461
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,220
and...

462
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,380
Luo.

463
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:42,250
These are some summaries of the recent affairs in the six realms.

464
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,060
Thank you.

465
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,720
I'll take my time to look through them.

466
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,420
Anything else?

467
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,900
No.

468
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,920
Go back and rest then.

469
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,440
Your Holiness.

470
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,130
I have something to report.

471
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,830
I heard that

472
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,010
Prince Xiu Ming is cultivating an ancient artifact.

473
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,350
It seems to be

474
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,380
the Soul-shattering Arrow.

475
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,420
Summon

476
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:17,830
Xiu Ming here.

477
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,330
Greetings, Your Holiness.

478
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,300
May I ask why you

479
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,200
summoned me here?

480
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,500
Prince Xiu Ming.

481
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,090
How's your health lately?

482
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,080
Thank you for your concern.

483
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,990
I'm healthy.

484
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:45,850
Everything is fine.

485
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:48,170
I heard that

486
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:51,150
the Soul-shattering Arrow requires one's blood and bones to be cultivated.

487
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:53,180
It's damaging to

488
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,420
one's primordial spirit and vitality.

489
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,750
Prince Xiu Ming.

490
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,150
Has it affected you?

491
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,810
I don't know what you mean.

492
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:02,380
I've

493
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,590
never heard of the Soul-shattering Arrow.

494
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,260
How dare you!

495
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,940
How dare you cultivate such a sinister thing?

496
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,250
I

497
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,240
will not allow such a filthy thing

498
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,070
to happen in the Heaven Realm!

499
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,060
I dare not.

500
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,150
Your Holiness, please look into the truth of this.

501
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,190
Lucky for you,

502
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,920
I'm the only one who knows about this now.

503
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,800
But if

504
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,940
other immortals find out,

505
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,960
it doesn't matter that you are the prince of the Dixiu Divine Clan

506
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:43,750
or that you have a noble status.

507
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,870
You won't be able to escape punishment.

508
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,460
I understand.

509
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,380
I'll take care of it as soon as possible.
