[Love you seven times]

[Episode 9]

4
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,539
Don't worry, Commander.

5
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,900
The soldiers have started searching.

6
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,740
I heard that the traitor of the Lu family was injured.

7
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:59,100
Believe me. Within a few days,

8
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,130
he'll be brought to justice

9
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,540
and your daughter will come home.

10
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,419
I'm grateful for your help.

11
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,660
It's my pleasure.

12
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,420
I guess you don't know

13
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,140
that Xiangyun and I

14
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,140
are close friends.

15
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,380
Close friends?

16
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,800
I and Xiangyun go back a long way.

17
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,579
Rest assured, Commander.

18
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:31,060
I'll do my best

19
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:32,660
to bring Xiangyun back.

20
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,660
I won't

21
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,500
let anything

22
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:44,090
happen to Xiangyun.

23
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,340
Commander, have a good rest.

24
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,180
I'll take my leave.

25
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,860
I didn't know

26
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,780
that Prince Ning was so sophisticated.

27
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,980
The fiercest dog

28
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,060
doesn't bark.

29
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,140
All encounters in the world

30
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,540
are destined.

31
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,170
It's fate

32
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,200
that brought us together.

33
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,210
It'll also be fate that pulls us apart.

34
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,840
Fate waxes and wanes.

35
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,580
People come and go.

36
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,940
It's all just a dream.

37
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,100
Hundreds of years later,

38
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,330
nothing will be remembered.

39
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,510
We only live for a few decades.

40
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,700
Dreams will burst like bubbles eventually.

41
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,540
That's why

42
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:21,720
we can't give up on love

43
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,380
or escape love tribulations.

44
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,960
I hope it can always be like this.

45
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,390
You're not Chu Kong.

46
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,760
You're just Lu Changkong.

47
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,070
Lu Changkong.

48
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,690
After knowing

49
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,150
that you fell into the water,

50
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:57,490
your father immediately prepared ginger soup for you

51
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,700
in case you catch a cold.

52
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:00,600
Here.

53
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,630
Kong.

54
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,270
Life is short.

55
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,670
None of us can stay around

56
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
for too long.

57
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,730
I do have high hopes for you,

58
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,850
but I won't push you to do anything.

59
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,580
I just wish you a safe and happy life.

60
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,160
As your father,

61
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,460
I wish you could be kind,

62
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,940
wise,

63
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,260
and brave.

64
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:28,820
As a subject,

65
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,800
you should speak up for justice

66
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,530
instead of being a silent coward.

67
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,990
Do you understand what I mean?

68
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,260
I do.

69
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,020
Good boy.

70
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,340
Kong,

71
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,500
after you sneak out,

72
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,810
you must be careful.

73
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,860
Father, don't worry.

74
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:53,930
I'll definitely

75
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,840
bring back the secret edict.

76
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,380
Okay.

77
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,550
My lord.

78
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,020
Father!

79
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,780
My lord.

80
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,320
Stay alive.

81
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,460
Mother!

82
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,580
Xiangyun.

83
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,659
Look at your fiancé.

84
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,270
At this moment,

85
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:51,840
I suddenly realize

86
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,630
that he can never see his family

87
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,960
who'd look at him so gently again.

88
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,140
Immortals live eternally

89
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,480
so they don't understand the pain

90
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,380
of watching those they love die.

91
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,090
From the perspective of an immortal,

92
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,640
it's just an ordinary love tribulation

93
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,520
and I don't need to be sad.

94
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,290
But for mortals,

95
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,460
death

96
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,120
means completely gone.

97
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,780
When this life ends,

98
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,780
everything ends with it.

99
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,820
Everyone's life is unique

100
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,540
and no one can live their life again.

101
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,340
I can't believe

102
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,270
you wrote such a ridiculous story.

103
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,820
Do you have a death wish?

104
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:00,770
I…

105
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,090
I did this for Xiangyun's sake.

106
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,810
One can't find true love

107
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,310
without experiencing pain.

108
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,560
Love stories

109
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,070
need to have ups and downs

110
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,220
to be unforgettable.

111
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,120
Immortal Li,

112
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,380
I didn't know you cared for Xiangyun so much.

113
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,940
For her,

114
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,820
you're willing to risk your life.

115
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,940
She's my best friend.

116
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,460
Darn it.

117
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,730
What are these absurd plots?

118
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,790
I didn't write them.

119
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,180
Has my Fate Book

120
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,460
gone out of control

121
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,540
because Chu Kong and Xiangyun are too powerful?

122
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,500
What should I do next?

123
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,220
Lu Changkong,

124
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,180
where are you going?

125
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:52,810
We're over.

126
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,170
Don't follow me.

127
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,300
Lu Changkong,

128
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,980
I know what you meant,

129
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,570
but you're injured.

130
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,220
I can't leave you alone.

131
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,460
Song Xiangyun,

132
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,500
we'll be complete strangers in the future.

133
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,860
You go your way

134
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,460
and I go mine.

135
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,820
Let us

136
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,300
part ways here.

137
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,700
Lu Changkong.

138
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,030
Has your wound opened up again?

139
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,660
What are you doing?

140
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,580
Checking your wound.

141
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,330
You're weak now.

142
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,580
Let me help you.

143
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,180
Does it hurt very much?

144
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:42,100
I'll be gentle.

145
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,490
Stop. Stop.

146
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:27,820
What are you here for?

147
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,130
Where are you going?

148
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,520
We're going north.

149
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:32,370
North?

150
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,420
Do a routine check.

151
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:34,860
Go.

152
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,270
Who's in the carriage?

153
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,520
Lü He!

154
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,460
Miss Fairy, I'm coming to save you.

155
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,980
This is…

156
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,860
This is the house I prepared for you.

157
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,100
Daily necessities

158
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,620
and everything you may need to live here

159
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,340
have been prepared.

160
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,340
Besides,

161
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,100
it's safe here.

162
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:45,280
Those soldiers

163
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,160
can't find you.

164
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:57,860
Zihui.

165
00:13:59,370 --> 00:13:59,820
Are you…

166
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,300
Are you feeling unwell?

167
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,740
I'm fine.

168
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:04,420
How about this?

169
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,820
Take a rest here.

170
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:07,180
I'll get you some hot water.

171
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:27,700
Zihui.

172
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,740
Come out.

173
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,620
Come out now,

174
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,620
or I'll be angry.

175
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,770
I want to buy your umbrella.

176
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,610
Will you sell it to me?

177
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,220
I want your umbrella!

178
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,560
I'll take your silence

179
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,920
as a yes.

180
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:13,100
He shouted "Miss Fairy"

181
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,580
and jumped into the water to save you.

182
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,000
So it was always you.

183
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,460
You…

184
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:21,340
What are you doing?

185
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,820
It was me who brought you away

186
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,460
that day.

187
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,220
From now on,

188
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,100
you're mine.

189
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,270
Understand?

190
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:30,540
Yes.

191
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,660
I received Miss Yingshi's message

192
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,750
and prepared this lakeside house.

193
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,100
I decorated it the way you like it.

194
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,630
I've also prepared

195
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,640
all the furniture.

196
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,300
Before I realized it,

197
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,370
you'd become the only one

198
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,980
who stayed with me

199
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,110
and listened to me

200
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,850
when I needed help.

201
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:53,870
I was mean sometimes.

202
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,500
Idiot.

203
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,400
But you didn't leave me.

204
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,330
When I was in trouble,

205
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,430
only you helped me.

206
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,420
From beginning to end,

207
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,400
what I need most

208
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,300
has always

209
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,950
been just you.

210
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,250
Looks like

211
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:43,140
we're almost there.

212
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,820
Prince Ning is here.

213
00:16:58,990 --> 00:16:59,940
Your Highness.

214
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:01,990
Since Father is asleep,

215
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,099
you may leave.

216
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,440
Yes.

217
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:08,410
Let's go.

218
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,020
Father.

219
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,010
Don't worry, Father.

220
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,800
I'll handle court affairs

221
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,180
for you.

222
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,010
You

223
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,870
just need to have a good rest.

224
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,720
You look tired, Father.

225
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,070
I

226
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,970
will take my leave.

227
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:25,620
I…

228
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,780
It's been so many days.

229
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,630
Still no sign of Xiangyun?

230
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Well…

231
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:39,980
No.

232
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,910
It's time to give those officials a hint

233
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,500
and spur them into action.

234
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,220
Yes.

235
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,020
Give it to me.

236
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,070
There are even more soldiers in this place.

237
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
I've hidden the carriage.

238
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,270
Let's

239
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,640
find a place to sleep.

240
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,660
Guys,

241
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,000
after searching this house,

242
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,150
we can go back to rest.

243
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,860
Okay.

244
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,220
That's an empty house.

245
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,260
No need to check.

246
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,140
Let's go in and have a look.

247
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,060
That guy is wanted by the court after all.

248
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,700
You guys,

249
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,700
check over there.

250
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:55,420
Yes.

251
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,020
Look carefully. Check every corner.

252
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:06,900
Don't miss anything.

253
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,700
Okay.

254
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:21,930
How's it?

255
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,060
Is anyone there?

256
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,180
No.

257
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
No.

258
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,420
Let's go back.

259
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,220
Let's go.

260
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:28,900
Let's go.

261
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:39,890
Look.

262
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,660
When we were in danger,

263
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,210
you protected me all the same.

264
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,460
It's okay now.

265
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:54,940
But

266
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,700
what should we do next?

267
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,550
They're searching for us everywhere

268
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,830
and will find us no matter where we hide.

269
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,990
The best place to hide is in plain sight.

270
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,700
We'll stay in this yard for now.

271
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,200
When it's safe to go out,

272
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,950
I'll go to my uncle's barracks.

273
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:15,780
What do you say?

274
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,960
Why are we

275
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,450
dressed like this?

276
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,980
Every year when winter starts,

277
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,700
many people leave the capital to go back north.

278
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,060
We'll blend in with them

279
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,980
to leave the capital.

280
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,550
That's a good idea.

281
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:48,660
But

282
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,980
if someone asks

283
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:51,900
about our relationship,

284
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:52,980
what…

285
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,220
What should we say?

286
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,060
Give me your bag.

287
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,890
You haven't answered me.

288
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,430
[Still Inn]

289
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,440
Take care.

290
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:10,900
Please.

291
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:11,940
Boss.

292
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,740
We have guests.

293
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,050
Need a place to stay?

294
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:15,780
Sir.

295
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,540
Two rooms.

296
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,800
[Room Yellow]

297
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,380
You only have one room left?

298
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,620
We have many empty rooms.

299
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,100
But you need to pay more.

300
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:30,020
Don't think I'll forgive you

301
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,980
just because we have to stay in one room.

302
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,380
What are you waiting for?

303
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,140
Let's go.

304
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,060
Go.

305
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:39,940
She's angry.

306
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,060
Sir, your wine.

307
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:44,780
If it weren't for me,

308
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,500
you would've been exposed.

309
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,460
You reacted very quickly.

310
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,140
Sir, the food you ordered.

311
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:04,900
You're back.

312
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:12,980
What's that?

313
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,880
I'll sleep on the floor tonight.

314
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,750
It's okay.

315
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:23,070
I can do it myself.

316
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,130
Fine.

317
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,500
But you'll sleep on the bed.

318
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,220
I'll sleep on the floor.

319
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:29,830
No.

320
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,440
You're injured.

321
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,340
You can't sleep on the floor.

322
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,460
No way.

323
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,350
How can I let you sleep on the floor?

324
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,170
Why did you put it there?

325
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,300
I read it in novels.

326
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,190
If a couple has to sleep on the same bed

327
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,020
before getting married,

328
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,940
they can put a bowl of water between them.

329
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,780
Your injuries

330
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,460
haven't healed.

331
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,580
I can't let you sleep on the floor every night while we're together.

332
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:56,980
I…

333
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,220
It's decided.

334
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,060
Either we both sleep on the bed,

335
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,700
or I sleep on the floor.

336
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,740
Take care, sir.

337
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,860
This is not a pawnshop.

338
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,220
You can only sell things.

339
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,980
Please do me a favor.

340
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,660
Take a look at it.

341
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,980
How much do you think it's worth?

342
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,500
Three taels of silver.

343
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,580
Just three taels of silver?

344
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:28,920
The threads on it

345
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,540
are made of peacock feathers.

346
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,980
Can you give me more?

347
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,140
Even phoenix feathers

348
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,060
are just feathers.

349
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,380
It's neither fireproof

350
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,420
nor stab-proof.

351
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,780
In the whole town,

352
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,500
no one will wear something like this.

353
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,740
Even if it's valuable,

354
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,220
no one will buy it.

355
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,620
So why should I buy it from you?

356
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,820
I…

357
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:51,390
Go away.

358
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:52,270
Sir.

359
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,520
Your jade

360
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,540
is worth much more.

361
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,220
Jade?

362
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:00,460
Sorry.

363
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,460
I won't sell

364
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,460
this jade.

365
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:03,740
God.

366
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,860
I'm done talking with you.

367
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,700
If you can't pay for the room,

368
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:07,700
move out as soon as possible.

369
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,870
Greetings, Your Holiness.

370
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,360
May I know

371
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,100
why you asked for me?

372
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,260
I summoned you here

373
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:06,190
to ask about how Chu Kong has been

374
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,280
in the mortal world.

375
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,800
Is there anything untoward?

376
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,590
You're so busy

377
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,310
but didn't forget Immortal Chu Kong's tribulation.

378
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,920
My brother

379
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:21,390
is good at everything,

380
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,140
but when it comes to love,

381
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,370
he becomes a little dense.

382
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,060
However,

383
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,330
love tribulations

384
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,190
are the key to repairing his primordial spirit.

385
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,650
So I'm very concerned about them.

386
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:34,820
Your Holiness.

387
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,450
You don't need to worry.

388
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,480
Xiangyun and Immortal Chu Kong

389
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,370
have gone through a lot during this tribulation,

390
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,810
but by this moment,

391
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,830
they've already fallen in love with each other.

392
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,100
No one can separate them.

393
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,420
I'm surprised

394
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,480
to know that.

395
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,420
It surprised me too.

396
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,180
Li

397
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,370
can't do anything right

398
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,990
but is full of bad ideas.

399
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,660
The Fate Book he wrote

400
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:01,340
is very thrilling

401
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,260
and full of ups and downs.

402
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,520
I think

403
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,980
after this tribulation,

404
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:08,150
Immortal Chu Kong can recover

405
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,400
his primordial spirit very soon.

406
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,090
I'm so relieved

407
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,300
to hear that.

408
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,090
I'll take my leave.

409
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,540
Why don't we

410
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,670
ask the inn owner

411
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:32,690
to change our bed?

412
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,170
He'll ask for extra money.

413
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,060
Novels

414
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,530
are not reliable.

415
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,140
You shouldn't read

416
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,460
those novels again.

417
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,770
Don't you think

418
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,900
it looks like we're eloping?

419
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,090
You should leave.

420
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,500
I don't know

421
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,860
what's waiting for me in the future.

422
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,500
I understand.

423
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,260
No matter what the future will bring,

424
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,440
I'll be by your side.

425
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:14,380
I'll face everything with you.

426
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,800
[Still Inn]

427
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,660
Miss.

428
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:54,660
Who are you?

429
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,280
Don't panic.

430
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,650
We're here to save you.

431
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,890
I believe you.

432
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,800
Like hell I will!

433
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,740
Don't panic.

434
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,980
To tell you the truth,

435
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,670
Prince Ning sent us here

436
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:12,750
to bring you back.

437
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,330
Prince Ning?

438
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:15,980
Yes.

439
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,120
His Highness is worried about the Song family

440
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,630
and doesn't want Great Chen to lose another important official.

441
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:21,920
So he ordered us

442
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:23,120
to bring you back.

443
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,250
My father?

444
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:26,940
What happened to him?

445
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:28,330
Because of what happened to the Lu family,

446
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,460
Commander Song is now in a perilous situation

447
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,690
with few people on his side.

448
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,120
You helped the traitor escape.

449
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,220
If someone

450
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,660
uses this to accuse Commander Song

451
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,020
of colluding with rebels,

452
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:39,780
the Song family will be doomed.

453
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,460
What are you doing?

454
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,490
You're out for too long.

455
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,460
I'm worried about you.

456
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,270
Did they do anything to you?

457
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,690
I'm fine.

458
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,820
Why did you mess with a defenseless girl?

459
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,250
Who are you?

460
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,380
Are you all right?

461
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,470
We'll spare your life today!

462
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,300
Let's go.

463
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:34,970
Let them go.

464
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,930
You're injured.

465
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,700
They'll tell the court about our whereabouts.

466
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,700
They're just bandits.

467
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,110
Don't worry.

468
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,940
Did they tell you something?

469
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,980
No.

470
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,540
They didn't say anything.

471
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,180
You're still on the mend.

472
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,860
Let's go back.

473
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:00,980
Let's go.

474
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:02,860
Let's go.

475
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,950
Why didn't you fall for it?

476
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:22,690
Are you still taking me as the stupid boy

477
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,630
who lit firecrackers in the house?

478
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,760
What's wrong with being a stupid boy?

479
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,920
At that time,

480
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:29,980
you were not very smart

481
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,220
and believed everything I said.

482
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:33,500
You don't

483
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,760
fall for my little tricks now.

484
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,550
It's disappointing.

485
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,490
Actually, at that time,

486
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,370
I saw through all your tricks.

487
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,940
I just pretended to be fooled

488
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,410
to make you happy.

489

How dare you play me?

492
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,020

00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,060
you are

494
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:51,900

00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,300
Look at that brightest star.

496
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,180

497

No.

It's the Star of War.

499
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,500
It's you.

500
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,860

501
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,340
Yes.

502
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:16,910
It's very bright.

503
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,900
Do you remember us watching the moon together

504
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,020
when we were young?

505
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,700
Of course.

506
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,460
You got drunk and kept yelling.

507
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,020
Then you fell asleep.

508
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,980
Without me,

509
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,980
you'd have fallen off the table.

510
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,180
Actually, I wasn't asleep.

511
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,540
I was afraid you'd push me away

512
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,420
so I pretended to be asleep.

513
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,700
Good for you.

514
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,360
You fooled me again.

516
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,730
You're much better

517
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,180
at playing tricks than me.

518
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,220
I knew it was wrong

519
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:54,620
but I did it anyway.

520
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,740
Because I didn't know what the future would be like.

He'd rather speak up for justice and die than be a silent coward.

00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,490
♫No matter how this love♫

579
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,060
♫How badly it ended♫

580
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,600
♫Who cannot be replaced♫

581
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,990
♫Loving oneself is the key to lifelong romance♫

584
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,420
Sir, wait a second.

585
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:21,980
Your wife

586
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,020
left this for you.

587
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,740
She left you the horse outside too.

588
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,580
She said these are her dowry.

589
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,430
These are dangerous times

590
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,500
and bad things may happen anytime.

591
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:37,870
I wish you and your wife

592
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,420
could stay safe.

593
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:40,910
Thank you.

594
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,700
The world is so big.

595
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,510
Life is full of possibilities.

596
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,480
We parted ways today

597
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,980
and will go down separate paths,

598
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,960
but our story will resume.
