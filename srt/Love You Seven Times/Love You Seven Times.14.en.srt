[Episode 14]

4
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,620
You promised me in the mortal world

5
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:49,130
that you wouldn't get even with me.

6
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,020
Yes.

7
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,610
But I'm not Lu Changkong.

8
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,010
No matter what,

00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,100
I...

10
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,440
took an arrow for you.

11
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,220
Although I'm inexperienced,

12
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,530
I also know that matters of tribulations do not concern the Heavenly Palace.

13
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,300
Well...

14
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,690
Everything I did in the mortal world

15
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,070
was to help you

17
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,670
If I offended you,

please forgive me.

19
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,840
If there's nothing else,

Where is Xiangyun?

23
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,150
She left.

24
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,660
You said that

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,760
the Heart Copying Formula can help her

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,970
improve her power,

27
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,520
but it consumes energy.

28
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,760
So you made me go to great lengths to prepare these cakes.

29
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,350
But why couldn't you even keep her here?

30
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,660
Fine.

40
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,010
Of course I know who you are.

41
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,140
I’m afraid you're the one

who you are.

55
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,580
We have the same mother. We've been through thick and thin together.

56
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,670
We've been through so many hardships together.

57
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,840
We should be the closest to each other.

58
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,090
But why would you rather become another person

59
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,180

What if you run into bad people?

or to make things worse?

115
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,380
These two are sworn enemies.

How can you match them together?

117
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:49,490
What's wrong with that?

118
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,930
Since ancient times,

119
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,480
love, hatred,

120
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,880
greed, and infatuation are regarded as a tour de force.

121

You don't understand.

122
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,940
This is just drama, okay?

123
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,030

No.

126
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,100
There must be obstacles

in the path of love.

128
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,250
The rougher the path is,

129
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,040
the higher the peak will be,

130
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,710
and the deeper the love you'll get.

131
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:15,910
I think

132
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,770
most languishing and unhappy men and women in this world

133
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,980

137
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,880
Don't call my scripts lousy.

138
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,310
If you go on, I won't help you anymore.

139
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:29,540
You...

140
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,360
You've matched a woman

141
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,540
with three men.

00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,610
What are you doing?

143
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,750

why don't we work together

147
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,180
and create an exciting new scene?

148
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,590
You're ambitious and vengeful.

149

00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,860
What kind of rich family is this man from?

152
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:09,100
How is this man connected to dozens of red threads?

153
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,510
It is said that he is a playboy.

154
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,070
He is talented,

155
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
so he has many fans.

156
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,480
He's still a character in the mortal world.

157
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,650
He can't just waste time on love.

158
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,970
I think

159
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,270
we should give him more spare time

160
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,780
to let him do more important things.

161
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,180
It's enough for him to have one confidante.

162
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,900
Remove the rest.

163
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,130
Yes.

[May I see the dusk with Li Wenkang]

168
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,210

169
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,400
there was a rift

170
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,500
and they were separated for years.

If they can reunite,

173
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,360
isn't that a virtuous deed?

174

As long as you are in this world, love will last forever.

The many sorrows are only the endless sound of the river.

A mortal's life is short,

181

but he remained faithful to his love.

182
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,010
There are many things in this world that are unrequited.

183
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,700
I didn't expect Your Highness

184

to be willing to help him.

185
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,070
Why?

In fact, I think

undying love is more precious.

191
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,860
I was just a little surprised.

192
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,160
Maybe

193
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,560
it's because I had a similar experience.

194
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,010
If I could start over,

195
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,060
I also hope someone could have helped me with my matchmaking

196
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,850
and resolved my regret.

197
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,820
Your Divinity.

198
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,130
I'm on duty today.

199
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,990
If there's nothing important,

200
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,720
I want to take a day off.

201
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,640
What's the matter?

202
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,890
The Qixi Festival is coming.

203
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,330
The Marriage Pavilion is very busy.

204
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,200
What does that have to do with you?

205
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:19,820
Xiangyun has been promoted to Fuyuan Fairy.

206
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,980
It's her first time hosting the Qixi Matchmaking Assembly.

207
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,730
I want to go and help out

208
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,760
and also eat at her promotion banquet

209
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,590
to get some luck.

210
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,100
May I...

211
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,470
Yes, you may.

212
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,250
Thank you, Your Divinity.

213
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,270
I'll take my leave then.

214
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,100
Be more productive.

215
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,490
The sooner we end our work, the earlier the feast can start.

216
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,160
Yes.

217
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,850
For this Qixi Festival,

218
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,660
we have to be well-prepared.

219
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,610
We must be well-prepared.

220
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,760
Liu Yueru from Lin'an

221
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,340
matches with Song Fangming from the Security Hall.

222
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,610
I didn't expect you to be better at

223
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,520
matchmaking than your actual job.

224
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,740
Greetings, Your Divinity.

225
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,460
Greetings, Your Divinity.

226
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,950
Rise.

227
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,280
Your Divinity, why are you here?

228
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,060
Why?

229
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,420
You can come,

230
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,450
but I can’t?

231
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,440
That's not what I meant.

232
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,840
What can I do for you?

233
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,580
I have nothing to do.

234
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:36,710
So I came to see...

235
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,970
I’m here to see how you help others work.

236
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,300
It'll help me reconsider

237
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,690
your work arrangements.

238
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,750
Your Divinity, it's too messy here.

239
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,260
Why don't you rest outside?

240
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:55,130
Since you've agreed to help the Marriage Pavilion,

241
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,110
help them until the end.

242
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,540
I...

243
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,990
will sit here...

244
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:07,690
and watch you.

245
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,650
His Divinity is here.

246
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,980
Xiangzi, you should go and say hello.

247
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,900
Sir.

248
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,520
You're in charge of the Marriage Pavilion.

249
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,440
You should go and greet the guest.

250
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,760
Look.

251
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,350
His Divinity gave you an official title.

252
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,020
This means he recognizes your abilities.

253
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
It's more suitable for you to go, right?

254
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,400
You are so smart.

255
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,270
Can you bear to let me face him?

256
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,760
I...

257
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:10,970
Y-Your Divinity.

258
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,380
Chu Kong.

259
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,870
Don't you think that after you came,

260
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,600
everyone has become very reserved?

261
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,380
Really?

262
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,760
Why do I feel

263
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,090
like it's the same as usual?

264
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,810
Doesn't that mean that

265
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,080
everyone is usually afraid of seeing you?

266
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,310
I'm afraid the work that was going to take six hours

267
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,330
will now be prolonged until ten hours.

268
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,040
I don't know how many lovers' fates will get delayed.

269
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,340
This is Xiangyun's first time hosting the Qixi Festival.

270
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,280
If it's delayed,

271
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,660
how would it be accounted for?

272
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,460
If I personally help out

273
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,090
with the small matter of matchmaking,

274
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,240
within an hour,

275
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,340
everything will be finished.

276
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,730
Really?

277
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:26,740
His Divinity is amazing.

278
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,220
Yes.

279
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,210
He sure is something.

280
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,180
What dazzling skills.

281
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,340
Why did you drop two pieces?

282
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,540
Your Divinity.

283
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,640
He is the pillar of his country.

284
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,450
He will definitely go to the battlefield to protect his country.

285
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,609
If I get him involved in romance,

286
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,400
I'm afraid

287
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,270
there will be one more pitiful person in the world.

288
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,700
When one has someone one wants to protect,

289
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,340
one will become stronger.

290
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:45,510
The general fights bravely

291
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,410
to prevent foreign enemies from entering the country,

292
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,390
and also because

293
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,830
among the people he's protecting...

294
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,810
There's the person he loves.

295
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,760
[Cheng Meng] [Yu Qing]

296
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,820
I didn't expect

297
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,730
a mere fairy

298
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,450
to be so sensible.

299
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:30,290
What's with you, Fairy?

300
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,600
Marriage is also very important.

301
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,390
It concerns the common people.

302
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,260
There's no difference in difficulties.

303
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:38,770
Yes.

304
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,200
It's more important than

305
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,540
the six realms' Master of Immortal Plants.

306
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,660
What should we do now?

307
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:59,570
Your Highness. Your Divinity.

308
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,720
Xiangzi owes her accomplishments

309
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:03,820
to the support from the both of you.

310
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,350
It's just right.

311
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,580
Today,

312
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,440
at our humble Marriage Pavilion,

313
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,490
we've prepared a simple promotion banquet

314
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,340
for Xiangzi.

315
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:18,820
It's getting late.

316
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,600
No, no.

317
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:22,300
If you two have something to do...

318
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,620
No, no.

319
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,480
If you don't mind...

320
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:26,190
I don't mind.

321
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:33,750
Your Divinity, will you be staying for dinner?

322
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:41,740
Yes.

323
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,050
Well...

324
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:50,980
Xiangzi.

325
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,260
Prepare more bowls and chopsticks.

326
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,520
Sir, there are so many people.

327
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,110
Do we have room at the table at our Marriage Pavilion?

328
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,210
If there's not enough room at the Marriage Pavilion,

329
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,540
my Penglai Residence is huge.

330
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,140
Why don't we go to my place?

331
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,520
I have a lot of good wine there too.

332
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,830
Or we could go to the Star Platform.

333
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:08,990
What do you think?

334
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,120
This is a tower.

335
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:19,720
There's dust on it.

336
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,980
It's okay.

337
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,220
We have enough room for everyone at the table.

338
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:27,630
We have enough room.

339
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,930
It's been 800 years.

340
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:47,500
I've been keeping this good wine for 800 years.

341
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,860
I couldn't bear to drink it.

342
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,300
To celebrate Xiangzi's promotion to Fuyuan Fairy,

343
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,250
I can part with my treasure.

344
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,180
Sir.

345
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,460
I knew you dote on me the most.

346
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,110
It’s my pleasure.

347
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,730
You can't talk about good wine without me.

348
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,460
This is a 2,000-year-old Floral Honey Wine.

349
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,590
Everyone, have a taste.

350
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,860
2,000 years old?

351
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,560
Floral Honey Wine?

352
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:18,330
Xiangzi.

353
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,280
Try it.

354
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,820
Let's experience it.

355
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:27,860
It's fragrant.

356
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,550
As expected of Prince Xiu Ming.

357
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,690
His Highness is the only one

358
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,680
in Heaven Realm who can get wine of such a good grade.

359
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,210
Your Divinity.

360
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,970
Oh, my red thread.

361
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,100
Zhao Menglu Wine?

362
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:02,780
The legendary Zhao Menglu Wine!

363
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,360
It's over 4,000 years old.

364
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:04,870
This...

365
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,340
4,000 years old?

366
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,810
This wine is older than me.

367
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,830
There are only ten bottles of this wine

368
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:14,370
in the entire Heaven Realm.

369
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,540
Ten bottles?

370
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,270
Then, Chu Kong,

371
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,290
that means that you have less than three bottles.

372
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,870
That's none of your business.

373
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,140
Xiangyun.

374
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,220
I don't think I should be here.

375
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,220
I don't deserve this meal.

376
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,120
I know, right.

377
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,230
It was supposed to be a celebration of my promotion.

Those mortals

As a mortal, there are tears and laughter,

00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,960
Go back to work.

565
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:38,990
[Marriage Pavilion]

566
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:40,670
You...

567
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,600
Why?

568
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,030
Is Luo unwilling to put in a little effort

569
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,330
for my sake

570
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,870
and for the sake of the Moluo Divine Clan?

571
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,490
I'm willing to do anything for the Moluo Divine Clan.

572
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,360
But I

573
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,610
don't want to kill anyone anymore.

574
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,380
You don't want to kill anyone anymore?

575
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,260
But ask around in the six realms,

576
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,530
whether anyone would spare our lives.

577
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,900
They regard us as a devil clan

578
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,150
and wants to kill us all.

579
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,020
How benevolent

580
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:39,140
are they?

581
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:54,120
Don't think you can do whatever you want

582
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,260
just because you're my biological sister.

583
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:59,770
I need you to get the Stone Heart of Nuwa back for me.

584
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,640
Otherwise, I'll

585
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:04,560
personally take action.

586
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,220
Zihui.

587
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,500
Having

588
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,530
met you in this life,

589
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,500
I'm already

590
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,850
very satisfied.

591
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,410
[Tomb of my beloved wife, Xie Yingshi]

592
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:57,910
[Tomb of my beloved wife, Xie Yingshi]

593
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,940
What are you looking at?

594
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,060
I was in a trance.

595
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,420
I mistook you for someone else.

596
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,409
Whose tomb is that?

597
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,610
[Tomb of my beloved wife, Xie Yingshi]

598
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,380
My dead wife.

599
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,500
Your wife?

600
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,659
What

601
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,540
kind of a person was she?

602
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,650
They say she was domineering

603
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:39,500
and willful.

604
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,620
But actually,

605
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,130
she dared to speak and dared to act.

606
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,840
She made a clear distinction between love and hate.

607
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,199
When there was trouble,

608
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,239
she was the first to rush out.

609
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,370
She was cute

610
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:55,929
and honest.

611
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,450
We liked reading the same book.

612
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,520
I liked to watch her eat pig's trotters.

613
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,970
Someday,

614
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,380
when I die,

615
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,990
[Tomb of my beloved wife, Xie Yingshi]

616
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,450
I must be buried with her.

617
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,340
The pig's trotters in South Street

618
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,630
are better than the ones in North Street.

619
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,250
When you first met,

620
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,800
she lived in This Inn

621
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,300
and you lived in That Inn.

622
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,900
She didn't want to go back to the border

623
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:32,380
and wanted to sneak away.

624
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,120
So, you stayed in an inn and waited for her.

625
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,310
Everything

626
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:39,210
was arranged according to

627
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,430
her preferences.

628
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,140
These are all between me and Yingshi.

629
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,310
How do you know about them?

630
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,170
Who are you?

631
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,030
Are you curious?

632
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,180
Because I'm Yingshi.

633
00:35:59,260 --> 00:35:59,740
No.

634
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:01,660
No.

635
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,350
You're not Yingshi.

636
00:36:08,690 --> 00:36:09,440
Miss.

637
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Are you sick?

638
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:14,980
Sick?

639
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:18,900
No.

640
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,180
I'm not sick.

641
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,690
This time, I'm here

642
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:26,910
to ask you for something.

643
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:36,330
Yingshi.

644
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,940
Your beloved lover

645
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:41,570
had long been killed by me.

646
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,830
You met and got to know someone who didn't exist.

647
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,500
You exchanged solemn vows

648
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,260
to be united forever.

649
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,780
My motive from the beginning

650
00:37:02,690 --> 00:37:04,600
is to take your Stone Heart.

651
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:38,360
Are you satisfied?

652
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,210
This should be the best thing

653
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,110
you've done for me.

654
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,100
Why?

655
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,980
You're already back.

656
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,240
Do you still care about that stone?

657
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,380
If the Water God of the Eastern Sea finds out

658
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,290
that the daughter he brought up

659
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,870
is a fraud

660
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:17,200
and even belongs to the Moluo Divine Clan that he hates the most,

661
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,870
do you think

662
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,550
he would kill you or not?

663
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,860
Ever since I stole Yingshi's identity,

664
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:27,890
I knew such a day would come.

665
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,830
Remember,

666
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,990
I'm your brother.

667
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,420
We're biologically connected

668
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,850
and live and die together.

669
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,710
In this world,

670
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:56,630
I'm the only one who truly cares for you.

671
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,320
I'm also the only one

672
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,200
who won't betray you.

673
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,520
Our Moluo Divine Clan has been humiliated for ten thousand years.

674
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:11,920
Revenge

675
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,290
is our eternal mission.

676
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,230
I, Jin Lian, the Protector of the Moluo Divine Clan,

677
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,840
am using the power of the Stone Heart of Nuwa...

678
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:35,560
to pray for the return of the Cang Hai monarch

679
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,890
and for the revitalization of the Moluo Divine Clan.

680
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,580
There is an anomaly in the sky.

681
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,300
The twelve constellations will perform deduction.

682
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,010
Yes.

683
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,140
Again.

684
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:39,320
[The six realms are overturned]

685
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,100
Go report to God Haoxuan now.

686
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:43,790
Yes.

687
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:47,020
[The six realms are overturned]

688
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:58,040
A new Divine Oracle is coming.
