Have you heard that?

00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:52,539
Immortal Chu Kong is having a tribulation with a fairy.

6
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,660
I wonder who that fairy is.

7
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,100
It's so lucky for her

8
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,380
to have a tribulation with Immortal Chu Kong.

9
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,259
Look. They're back.

15
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,940
It hurt so much.

20
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,540
Please calm down.

21
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,540
Please calm down.

23
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,840
Good.

From now on,

25
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:44,430
I'll be my tribulation partner.

26
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,460
What does that mean?

27
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,090
Did…

28
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,390
Did I hear right?

29
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,329
This twist is so twisted.

The Marriage Pavilion

31
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,420

00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,980
It's a blessing

33
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,860
to be Immortal Chu Kong's tribulation partner.

34
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,630

00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,660
Doctor,

41
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,350
how is she?

42
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,670
She's fine.

43
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,180
If she feels tired,

44
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,310
I'll give her some spirit-nourishing pills.

45
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,590
Oh, my red thread.

46
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,850
Your serious face scared me.

47
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,980
Thank you, Doctor.

48
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,990
See you around, Red Thread Master.

49
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:40,440
Take care.

Xiangzi.

51
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,770
I was a fierce tiger

52
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:49,690
but brought food to him every day.

53
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,260
He wasn't grateful at all.

54
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,770
I almost starved to death.

55
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,840
It's okay.

56
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,710
Eat your fill later.

57
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,290
You can have as much as you want.

58
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,960
You have a new identity now.

59
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,190
The God of War appointed you as his tribulation partner.

60
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,820
From now on,

61
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,920
you must take good care of yourself.

The doctor said

64
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,250
you need to be well-fed.

65
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,480
I'll go make you something delicious.

Red Thread Master.

67
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,050
I've heard about what happened in the Fate Bureau.

68
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,930
I'm so happy for you, Brother.

69
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,810
I just wonder

70
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,710
how beautiful that fairy has to be

71
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,020
to be in the good graces

72
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,600
of the God of War who hasn't fallen in love

73
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,260
in 30,000 years.

74
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,730
I'm very curious.

75
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,180
I didn't pay attention

76
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,750
to how she looked.

77
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,170
Nor do I care.

78
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:07,260
I'm just surprised

79
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,580
that after having a love tribulation with her,

80
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,310
I regained part of my primordial spirit.

81
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,650
In the past 30,000 years,

82
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,230
you've suffered tribulations like thunder, freezing, and death.

83
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,880
But none of them helped you regain your primordial spirit.

84
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,820
Do love tribulations

85
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,480
really work?

86
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,270
It's worked so far.

87
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,020
I'll have six more love tribulations with that fairy.

88
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,700
If they can help me repair my primordial spirit,

89
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,460
when Cang Hai is resurrected

90
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,340
as the prophecy says,

91
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,540
the havoc he may wreak on the six realms can be avoided.

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,500
If that's the case,

93
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,990
this matter

94
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,980
is a blessing to the six realms.

95
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,120
I'll have to go through

96
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,700
six more love tribulations with Immortal Chu Kong?

97
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,600
That's what he told us.

98
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,460
Do I have any other choice?

99
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,220
Xiangzi.

100
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,870
Immortal Chu Kong is brave and resourceful.

101
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,760
He's well-respected in the Heaven Realm.

102
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,060
This is a good thing. A great thing.

103
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,560
Good?

104
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,210
Good.

105
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,270
Knock it off!

106
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,010
I'm only 3,000 years old.

107
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,450
He's 50,000 years old.

108
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,640
I'm 47,000 years younger than him.

109
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,320
It's forcing a young fairy to love an old sod.

110
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,580
Besides,

111
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,020
the previous tribulation

112
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,330
told me so much about him.

113
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,860
I'm sure he means no good

114
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,050
and will give me a hard time.

115
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,650
People like him

116
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,140
are heartless and apathetic.

117
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,780
My answer is no.

118
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,900
Tell him to find someone else.

119
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,980
Xiangzi. Xiangzi.

120
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,130
Don't worry too much.

121
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,660
Immortal Chu Kong knows you're timid,

122
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,310
so he ordered me, Immortal Li,

123
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,310
to write your love stories.

124
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:37,700
You?

125
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,940

126
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:40,540

How can you allow this to happen?

133
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:01,150
I care for and respect you.

134
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:01,860
I'm also smart

135
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,060
and adorable.

136
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,890
How can you let me

become fish in the barrel?

Xiangzi,

142
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,050
you might as well be more devoted

143
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,720
and have those six tribulations with Immortal Chu Kong.

145
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,080
I'm not being cruel.

146
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,630
It's just that there are six untied Love Knots

he's only played the field

154

but never made a commitment.

but only finished drawing my eyes.

169
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,860
That's because

170
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,100
you only have her eyes.

Immortal Chu Kong is indeed extraordinary.

187
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,340

00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,550
Yes.

380
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,820
Since the Battle of Cangri…

381
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,270
Forget about it.

382
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,500
Take a seat.

383
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,110
You're

384
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,060
the fairy who will have seven tribulations

385
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:06,730
with Chu Kong, right?

386
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,760
I've heard a lot about you.

387
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,590
I finally met you today.

388
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,810
The Heaven Realm is so big

389
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,030
that I never met you once in thousands of years.

390
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,180
I've been serving in the Marriage Pavilion

391
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,260
and don't know many immortals.

392
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,140
You can come to my Penglai Residence in the future.

393
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,930
It'll do you a lot of good

394
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,010
to make friends with other immortals.

395
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,740
Are you Prince Xiu Ming of the Dixiu Divine Clan?

396
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,430
Yes.

397
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,250
Are you really willing

398
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,270
to have love tribulations

399
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,620
with Chu Kong?

400
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:56,450
Have some tea.

401
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:00,790
Xiu Ming.

402
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,300
Greetings, Your Divinity.

403
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,670
I hit it off with this fairy.

404
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,540
If you have no feelings for her,

405
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,580
just let her off the hook

406
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,390
and spare her those love tribulations.

407
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,440
What do you think?

408
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,870
What brought you to the Xiaoyun Palace?

409
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:45,750
I…

410
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,480
I came…

411
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,310
I came here

412
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,480
to beg for your forgiveness.

413
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,710
Please cut me some slack.

414
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,200
Cut you some slack?

415
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,820
No problem.

416
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:03,810
But the Marriage Pavilion…

417
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,090
Your Divinity,

418
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,850
are you threatening me?

419
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:12,160
Many positions in the Heaven Realm are redundant.

420
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:13,890
As for the Marriage Pavilion,

421
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,130
I'll decide its fate

422
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,370
after I return from the tribulation.

423
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:20,720
What?

424
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,550
You got something else to say?

425
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:24,370
No.

426
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,580
Don't worry, Your Divinity.

427
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,350
I won't let you down.

428
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,920
Nothing will go wrong.

429
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:30,490
I…

430
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,100
I'll leave to get prepared.

431
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,280
What happened 30,000 years ago?

432
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,250
Why can't I recall a thing?

433
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:48,100
[The Fate Bureau]

434
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,300
Immortal Li.

435
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:48,980
Congratulations, Xiangyun.

436
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,930
Thank you.

437
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,200
Everyone envies you.

438
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,560
By the way,

439
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,760
I heard some fairies gossiping about you the other day.

440
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,720
They said you don't deserve Immortal Chu Kong.

441
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,270
It made me so mad.

442
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,980
They should've kept the truth to themselves.

443
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,340
Xiangyun,

444
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,060
don't be upset.

445
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,350
Lucky for you.

446
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,890
The one who writes your mortal fates

447
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,740
is me, your best friend.

448
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,540
Li.

449
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,870
I know I can count on you.

450
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,820
Please let me die in one piece.

451
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,350
Rest assured, Xiangyun.

452
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,090
We're friends.

453
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:26,880
I got you.

454
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,670
Immortal Chu Kong is here.

455
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,500
Your Divinity.

456
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:32,860
Your Divinity.

457
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,390
Your Divinity.

458
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,390
Don't worry, Your Divinity.

459
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,730
I've arranged everything for you.

460
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,240
You'll definitely be satisfied.

461
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,830
I even made a list.

462
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,860
Love in the Dangerous Court.

463
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,890
Martial Art Master and His Sweetheart.

464
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:47,480
And this one.

465
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,520
The Destined Love.

466
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,510
What kind of story do you prefer?

467
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,940
How could you, Immortal Li?

468
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,140
You called me your best friend just now

469
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,870
but switched sides so quickly.

470
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,570
What is that nonsense?

471
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,070
Immortal Li.

472
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:01,930
Yes.

473
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,540
I heard

474
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,480
that you're close to Xiangyun.

475
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,590
Don't worry.

476
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,680
I know the score.

477
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,340
Even if Xiangyun were my sister,

478
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,340
I wouldn't pull strings for her.

479
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:14,730
Your Divinity.

480
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,640
These are all great stories.

481
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,350
Your Divinity.

482
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,690
Give them a thought.

483
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:19,770
Li.

484
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,100
What the heck…

485
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:23,620
Don't look so murderous.

486
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,340
Sir.

487
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,900
When you were young,

488
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,180
you left scratches on Li's face

489
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,960
from time to time.

490
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,840
You've both grown up.

491
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,110
You can't do that anymore.

492
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,840
Li is so inhumane.

493
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,230
How could you say that?

494
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,810
He's not a human to start with.

495
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:40,840
Alright.

496
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,520
Don't be angry.

497
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,470
What's this?

498
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,910
Before you go to the mortal world,

499
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:52,930
you'll be required to drink the Water of Amnesia.

500
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,590
This is the elixir I stole…

501
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,760
I secretly borrowed from the Goddess of Fate.

502
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,430
It can prevent your memory from being erased.

503
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,710
This elixir is called

504
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,510
Anti-Memory-Erasing.

505
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,170
Two drops of it can neutralize a whole glass of the Water of Amnesia.

506
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,720
I'll take care of it.

507
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:13,650
Red Thread Master.

508
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,050
You're the best.

509
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,260
Since I gave you a human shape

510
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,350
3,000 years ago,

511
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,640
you've never left me

512
00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:26,190
for so long.

513
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,110
If

514
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,270
you meet any difficulty you can't overcome,

515
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,040
go to the nearest marriage temple and draw a fortune stick.

516
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,190
I'll do my best to help you.

517
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,500
Sir.

518
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,360
I don't want to leave you.

519
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,640
Silly, I don't want you to leave either.

520
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:52,350
But life is about letting go.

521
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,860
That's the only way to move forward.

522
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,890
It's almost time.

523
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:01,680
Go.

524
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:19,220
It's time.

525
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,590
The descending ceremony

526
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,810
begins now.

527
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,110
Great!

528
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,980
Immortal Chu Kong,

529
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:38,910
will you go to the mortal world with Xiangyun?

530
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,810
Immortal Chu Kong answered with a sharp glance

531
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:48,900
that he will.

532
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:55,790
Got it. Got it.

533
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,230
He will.

534
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,470
Xiangyun,

535
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,460
will you go to the mortal world with…

536
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,820
Xiangyun is so glad

537
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,830
that she doesn't know what to say.

538
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,680
You sure?

539
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,390
Understood.

540
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,820
I hereby announce

541
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,250
that from now on,

542
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,880
you two are tribulation partners.

543
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:28,020
Great!

544
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:33,170
Serve the Water of Amnesia.

545
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:43,910
I added Anti-Memory-Erasing to it.

546
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:47,830
Wait.

547
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,390
Chu Kong.

548
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,600
I'd like to

549
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,440
go to the mortal world with you.

550
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,340
What?

551
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,900
Xiangyun,

552
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,080
do you mind me

553
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,390
going to the mortal world with you?

554
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,110
No.

555
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,750
Well, whatever.

556
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,760
Good.

557
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,070
Let's clink glasses.

558
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,890
Clink glasses?

559
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:13,970
You can't be serious.

560
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:18,750
How about...

561
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:19,760
Well,

562
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:20,910
I'll drink mine first.

563
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:51,160
Allow me to be the first one to jump.

564
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,770
Again?

565
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,580
I've been waiting for this day

566
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:09,930
for 30,000 years.

567
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,000
Everyone.

568
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,400
Take care.

569
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,130
Your Highness,

570
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,470
here is the Water of Amnesia.

571
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:27,620
Are you sure

572
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,000
you want to do this?

573
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,880
Of course.

574
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:33,220
Xiangyun made a point in the letter.

575
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:34,450
God Haoxuan

576
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:36,320
has approved to make her

577
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,500
Immortal Chu Kong's tribulation partner.

578
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
But if I go to the mortal world too,

579
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:40,940
I and Immortal Chu Kong

580
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,560
will fall in love with each other.

581
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,110
But what if Immortal Chu Kong

582
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,950
falls in love with Xiangyun in the mortal world?

583
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,340
Do you think His Divinity is as stupid as you two?

584
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,120
Sorry.

585
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:56,510
When that fairy from the Marriage Pavilion stands next to me,

586
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,030
she's like a green onion next to a daffodil.

587
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,960
Do you think His Divinity will choose her?

588
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,100
Of course not.

589
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,440
Of course not.

590
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:11,470
Go cover for me.

591
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:15,050
Seven love tribulations start on the Star Platform.

592
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,230
Great love stories in Immortal Li's mind form.

593
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,940
You must come and watch them.

594
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,730
I'll be waiting for you guys.

595
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:21,730
Do you hear me?

596
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:22,720
You must come

597
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,460
and watch them.

598
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,080
Do come.

599
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,160
Li is always good at lightening the mood.

600
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,520
Yes.

601
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,050
It's just the basics.

602
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:40,640
The basics.

603
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,310
Did you see someone passing through?

604
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,980
Your old eyes deceived you, Immortal Li.

605
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:54,250
I'm not Immortal Li.

606
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,730
She's the Goddess of Fate.

607
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,030
Li is unreliable,

608
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,170
but my love tribulation

609
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,170
started anyway.

610
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,770
Song Qinwen is a master of both pen and sword.

611
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,500
Lady Wan is gentle and virtuous.

612
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:25,210
I grow up

613
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,110
as the apple of their eye.

614
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,450
Both of them dote on me.

615
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:30,870
Lady Wan gave me a longevity jade pendant.

616
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,990
I don't need to do laundry, make bed, sweep the floor,

617
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,330
or cook.

618
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,750
Even when I play on the slide,

619
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,410
Song will stand at the foot of the slide

620
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,020
to catch me.

621
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,410
I can't be more carefree.

622
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:42,140
So naughty.

623
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:43,140
Xiangyun.

624
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:43,700
Have a rest.

625
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,600
Sit.

626
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,420
[Wan Jun, Madam of the Song family]

627
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:46,300
Are you tired?

628
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,140
No.

629
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,780
Let me wipe your sweat.

630
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,740
Let me get you some water.

631
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,860
Eat something.

632
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,050
Thank you, Mother.

633
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,270
Here, have some water.

634
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,130
Thank you, Song.

635
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,350
[Song Qinwen, commander of the Imperial Guards]

636
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,860
Where are your manners? Call me Father.

637
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,220
Song.

638
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,840
Call me Father.

639
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,820
Song! Song!

640
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,860
You rude girl! Call me Father.

641
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:06,710
Your mother is too good to you.

642
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:07,620
Song.

643
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,170
You're spoiled. Don't let me catch you.

644
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,040
Mother, help!

645
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:10,590
Call me Father.

646
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:12,740
By the way,

647
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,020
[Lu Mansion]

648
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,460
I forgot to tell you something great.

649
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:15,300
Last month,

650
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,060
Song got promoted.

651
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,760
He took over the 100,000 Imperial Guards in the capital.

652
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,470
Now,

653
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,910
everyone calls him Commander Song

654
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:22,960
with respect.

655
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,980
Lu.

656
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,360
Lu, I'm coming.

657
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,060
You've arrived.

658
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,820
This is Song's best friend.

659
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:29,730
Lu Liang.

660
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,870
[Lu Liang, Grand General Protecting the Country]

661
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,040
He's a general guarding the border.

662
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,980
Greetings, Mr. Lu.

663
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,380
They are like minds

664
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:37,200
and thick as thieves.

665
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,550
You don't need to bring a gift.

666
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:39,570
Just take it.

667
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,830
This one is Mrs. Lu.

668
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,640
And…

669
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:45,870
Hello, Mr. Song.

670
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,140
Greetings, Mrs. Lu.

671
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:48,580
Xiangyun.

672
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:50,090
[Xie Zhen, Madam of the Lu family]

673
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,300
Come to see your fiancé.

674
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,290
My fiancé?

675
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,590
As the commander of the Imperial Guards,

676
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,990
my father is responsible for the safety of the capital.

677
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,780
Mr. Lu is a general who guards the border

678
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,320
with troops at his command.

679
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,410
Unless the emperor is an idiot,

680
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:07,210
he'll in no way let these two families be bound by marriage.

681
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:10,610
This kid can definitely become a great general.

682
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,570
As expected,

683
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,900
trouble is brewing from the very beginning.

684
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,870
Li.

685
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,620
You'd better not go too far!

686
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,220
So,

687
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,970
is his name Lu Chukong?

688
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:23,820
No.

689
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,980
Lu Changkong.

690
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:27,090
L-Lu Changkong?

691
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,070
His father came up with this name.

692
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,320
How do you like it?

693
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,380
Isn't it a beautiful name?

694
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,360
Yes, very beautiful.

695
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,500
In the future,

696
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,570
he'll become the greatest general in our country.

697
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:39,730
Like father, like daughter.

698
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,450
Although she's just a little girl,

699
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:42,750
she's very insightful.

00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,850
Greetings, Immortal Chu Kong.

701
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,330
Greetings, Immortal Chu Kong.

702
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,100
If you can hear me,

703
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,270
groan once.

704
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,830
If you can't hear me, groan twice.

705
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,060
Looks like he really drank the Water of Amnesia.

706
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,820
The 50,000-year-old God of War

707
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,580
is at my mercy now.

708
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,700
Sorry, Immortal Chu Kong.

709
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,170
My apologies.

710
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,590
No.

711
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,350
Immortal Chu Kong is revengeful.

712
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,110
After he goes back to the Heaven Realm

713
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,430
and recalls what I did to him in the mortal world…

714
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,460
Immortal Chu Kong.

715
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:32,840
I just wanted to play with you.

716
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,100
I didn't mean to hurt you.

717
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:38,940
Please don't be angry, Your Divinity.

718
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,280
Please spare my life!

719
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,480
It's all my fault.

720
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,020
I deserve a thousand deaths.

721
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:48,650
[Years later]

722
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,740
You're really good at chess.

723
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,220
You've improved too.

725
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,730
What do you think of my drawing?

726
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,550
[Song Xiangyun]

727
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,300
It's a cute cat.

728
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:57,130
But

729
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,850
why did you draw wrinkles on its forehead?

730
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,750
Time flies.

731
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:05,630
In the blink of an eye,

732
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,160
Changkong has become a big boy.

733
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,850
He looks very smart.

734
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:11,909
He'll surely

735
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,610
become a great general.

736
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,800
I don't expect him to amount to much.

737
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:17,300
I just hope

738
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:19,500
he can stay safe and healthy,

739
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:20,250
and when he comes of age,

740
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,090
he can marry a well-mannered

741
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,889
and virtuous wife

742
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,580
who will give us a cute grandson.

743
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,949
Virtuous

744
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,400
and well-mannered?

745
00:34:32,150 --> 00:34:33,620
I see.

746
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:36,190
Immortal Chu Kong, sorry.

747
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:39,219
I have to do this for our happiness.

748
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,500
Lu Changkong.
