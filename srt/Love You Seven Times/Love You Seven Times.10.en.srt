00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,730

Old Master was very upset,

142
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,700
which caused him to become depressed.

143

On top of that there are rumours outside,

144

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,040
to help you.

160
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,340
How are things for our family now?

161
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:32,510
General Lu was well-respected in the court.

162
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,150
After the incident,

163
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,620
many ministers thought that

164
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,640
it was Commander Song

165
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,039
who got jealous of General Lu's capability

166
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,159
and deliberately framed him.

167
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,200
Now,

168
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,030
the Song family is being ostracized,

169
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,690
and the court receives many reports

170
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,190
impeaching Commander Song every day.

171
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:49,710
I know.

172
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,760
Matters of the court

173
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,450
are not all black and white.

174
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,640
Even righteous people like Uncle Lu

175
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,420
can be charged with treason.

176
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:58,780
I'm afraid

177
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,870
the Song family may also

178
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,230
meet its fall soon.

179
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,780

180
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,490
I now have some bearing

in court affairs now.

182
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,940
I will try my best to

183
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,710
protect your parents' lives.

184
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,970
Has it already come to this state?

185
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,600
Indeed, things are not as simple as you think.

186
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,940
Father is seriously ill.

187
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,830
No one can predict what will happen in the court.

188
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,490
I have no way of

189
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,490
promising you more either.

190
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,490
My father has valued his reputation all his life.

191
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,860
Being in this situation now

192
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,100
must be worse than death for him.

193
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,610
Perhaps...

194
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,420
there is another possible solution to try.

195
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,260
What is it?

196
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,870
You can marry me.

197
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,320
This is just a temporary plan.

198
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:02,880
If you marry me,

199
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,960
With my prestige in the court,

200
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:06,860
the Song family will become relatives of the royal family.

201
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,080
To uphold the dignity of the empire,

202
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,240
the Song family

203
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,610
won't end up in too bad of a situation.

204
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,380
In this way,

205
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,700
we can definitely ensure your parents will be safe.

206
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:25,860
If...

207
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:27,870
But...

208
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,980
you'll be at a disadvantage.

209
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:30,750
No.

210
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:31,960
It's not like that.

211
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,410
The Song family's reputation is in a mess now.

212
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,140
You'll be implicated too.

213
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,210
I don't mind.

214
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,070
Do you expect me

215
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,680
to stand by and do nothing while watching

216
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,830
the Song family meet its demise?

217
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,700
It's just...

218
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,530
Right now, the Song family needs to get through this.

219
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:50,700
As for the rest,

220
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:52,130
we can always plan afterwards.

221
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,400
Xiangyun?

222
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,200
Father and Mother

223
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,200
have given me so much in this life.

224
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,680
Exchanging my relationship for the peace of the Song family...

225
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,670
I hope Lu Changkong won't blame me.

226
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:13,380
Alright.

227
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,580
I agree to it.

228
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:19,370
Really?

229
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,460
I'll keep my word..

230
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,190
Today,

231
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,550
I will ask Father for permission.

232
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,760
Don't worry.

233
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,990
They will be fine.

234
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,460
I, Xiangyun sincerely

235
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,940
thank you, Your Highness.

236
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,200
Xiangyun,

237
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,870
I hope you won't blame me

238
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,340
even after you find out the truth.

239
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,580
You hooligan!

240
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,200
Zihui...?

241
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:01,780
How dare you...

242
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,470
Miss Yingshi,

243
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,510
it's not what you think.

244
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,720
You were the one who carried me to the bed.

245
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,520
Nonsense!

246
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,780
Miss Yingshi.

247
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,820
Actually,

248
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,830
I am the stone

249
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,140
you've been hugging these few days.

250
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,180
You are...

251
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,940
Actually, I am a purple stone.

252
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,820
I only transformed into a human

253
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,330
after absorbing the spiritual energy from the heaven and earth.

254
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,190
This...

255
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,810
So, so you are...

256
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,340
I am a stone goblin.

257
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,820
Don't you dare lie to me.

258
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,940
Tell me the truth.

259
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,500
You really are

260
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,820
that purple stone?

261
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,020
Yes.

262
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:45,770
No, no, no.

263
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,940
You...

264
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,760
Although you've become a stone,

265
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,100
and you can't move or speak,

266
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,610
but you can see me,

267
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,000
and can hear me too?

268
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,700
Yes.

269
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,470
So everything I babbled

270
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,500
and said to you every day,

271
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,400
you heard it all? Without missing a word?

272
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,390
Without missing a word.

273
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:00,940
Then...

274
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,710
me bathing and changing every day...

275
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,030
you saw everything too?

276
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:05,770
Yes.

277
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,890
In that case...

278
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,220
Don't, don't!

279
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:23,950
Your Highness came back so quickly?

280
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,010
You look so happy.

281
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,600
I guess something good probably happened.

282
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,540
Xiangyun agreed to marry me.

283
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:34,740
That's really...

284
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,980
Congratulations, Your Highness.

285
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,020
Eunuch Zhao,

286
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:39,770
I'll leave this matter to you.

287
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,420
Yes.

288
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,840
You must choose

289
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,770
a comfortable palace residence for Xiangyun,

290
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,860
and clean it up nicely.

291
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,000
Xiangyun likes begonias,

292
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,750
so we should plant some begonia trees in the yard.

293
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,870
Most importantly,

294
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,130
it must be close to Ningyuan Palace.

295
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,130
Yes, yes.

296
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,700
Your Highness.

297
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:01,890
I hope you don't mind me saying this.

298
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,030
Go ahead.

299
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:06,260
Is Miss Xiangyun serious

300
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,320
about this marriage?

301
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,620
Actually I've been observing

302
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,300
over the past few days.

303
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,420
I'm just a little worried.

304
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,190
Eunuch Zhao.

305
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,210
I think you're a little

306
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,710
too talkative today.

307
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,940
I must have been muddle-headed.

308
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,630
Your Highness, please forgive me.

309
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:31,100
Go announce this good news

310
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,740
to the world.

311
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,960
Yes.

312
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:35,030
What's important is that

313
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,580
we must spread the word to Jinzhou.

314
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,700
I understand.

315
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,260
With the reputation of the General,

316
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,220
and the people's respect for Old General Lu,

317
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,610
we've had many guard armies

318
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,300
of the cities along the way

319
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,320
surrender without putting up a fight.

320
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,070
At this rate,

321
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,520
within half a month,

322
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,230
we should be able to reach the capital.

323
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,260
[Capital]

324
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:22,940
General.

325
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,330
Recently, the enemy has gathered troops near Jinzhou.

326
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,890
[Jinzhou]

327
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,260
But they are not making a move.

328
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,930
I'm not sure what they're planning.

329
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,190
[Jinzhou]

330
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,410
Military report from the capital!

331
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,070
General,

332
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,610
guess what?

333
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,030
After that lousy emperor

334
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,490
found out we were going to launch an attack,

335
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,210
he got so scared that he became bedridden.

336
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,510
He left matters of the court

337
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,380
to Prince Ning,

338
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,570
and even gave him the authority to command the army.

339
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:52,710
Prince Ning?

340
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,460
He's that sickly prince.

341
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,350
The daughter of that thief in the Song family

342
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,850
is just like her father,

343
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:58,960
and just wants glory and prestige.

344
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:00,380
She actually tried to play up to Prince Ning,

345
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,570
and apparently they're getting married in a few days.

346
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,500
Getting married?

347
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,730
Now Prince Ning is in charge of commanding the army,

348
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,090
but he's not making a move.

349
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,220
I feel something is wrong.

350
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:27,290
[Capital] [Jinzhou]

351
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:24,850
The capital.

352
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,740
Jinzhou.

353
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,230
[Huilong Dyke]

354
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,170
Huilong Dyke?

355
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,490
Eight years ago, it was the breaching of the Huilong Dyke

356
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,800
that caused the great flooding of Jin River?

357
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,300
Yes.

358
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:45,450
If the dyke bursts again,

359
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:46,100
then

360
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,630
tens of thousands of people of the Lu Army

361
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,020
will all die.

362
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,080
Countless people who live in the middle and lower reaches

363
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,600
will also die or get hurt.

364
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,460
Although Prince Ning is cruel,

365
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,100
I don't think he'll go that far.

366
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,069
If they want to attack the Huilong Dyke,

367
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,500
they need at least several hundred explosives.

368
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:07,430
It requires many vehicles to transport them.

369
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,290
They can't come in under our noses.

370
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:15,030
He did nothing.

371
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,069
He must know that we are going to attack the capital.

372
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,250
So he wants to delay the battle.

373
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:22,690
But he can only delay it

374
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,099
for at most ten days.

375
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,589
What on earth does he want to do?

376
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,690
He wants to stop me from returning to the capital.

377
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,880
So he used this world as a chess game

378
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,230
in order to

379
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,260
hold me back

380
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:42,520
and make me choose between the people in this world and Xiangyun.

381
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,940
The moon tonight

382
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,690
is very bright.

383
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,700
Lu Changkong.

384
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,900
Did you see it too?

385
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,770
Checkmate.

386
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:53,100
[Jinzhou] [Huilong Dyke]

387
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,220
Eight years ago, it was because the Huilong Dyke burst

388
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,540
that Jin River had a disaster.

389
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,020
Yes.

390
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:56,410
If the dyke bursts again,

391
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,080
tens of thousands of people of the Lu Army

392
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,020
will all die.

393
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,080
Countless people who live in the middle and lower reaches

394
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,330
will also die or get hurt.

395
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,970
Lu Changkong.

396
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,220
This time,

397
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,710
between thousands of people and Xiangyun,

398
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,620
who will you choose?

399
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,220
Search all the convoys and merchant ships

400
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,700
on the way to the dyke.

401
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,820
If I'm not mistaken,

402
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:42,810
the explosives have already been delivered here.

403
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:43,910
What?

404
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,320
[Song Mansion]

405
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,630
Why didn't you discuss it with your parents?

406
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,930
I acted on my own.

407
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,700
No.

408
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,460
I’ll go discuss with Prince Ning

409
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,540
and reject this marriage.

410
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,500
No need.

411
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,250
I'm serious.

412
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:10,910
Nonsense!

413
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,390
Marriage is not a joke.

414
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,900
Even if right now Changkong is...

415
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,460
You can't risk your happiness

416
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,970
for the rest of your life.

417
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,540
Daughter.

418
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,210
Tell me the truth.

419
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,260
Did you hear some rumors

420
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,300
saying something happened to our family,

421
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,140
that's why you're...

422
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,100
Don't worry.

423
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,540
I'm here.

424
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,980
The Song family will be fine.

425
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,700
You can't compromise because of this.

426
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,880
Song!

427
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,010
You overestimated me.

428
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,460
You watched me grow up.

429
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,090
You know me well.

430
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,590
Who can force me?

431
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,140
Besides,

432
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,420
I get along well with Prince Xiu Ming.

433
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,870
He treats me quite well.

434
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,110
We'll be respectful to each other

435
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,860
and support each other.

436
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,890
It's not too bad either.

437
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,370
But the palace is like a sea.

438
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,340
How can you survive with your temper?

439
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,980
Mother.

440
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:15,580
Don't worry.

441
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,890
Even if it's the Cold Palace,

442
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,690
I will make the best out of it.

443
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,560
And Prince Ning said

444
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,100
I don’t need to stay in the palace.

445
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,670
I can come back often to accompany you.

446
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,910
How much do you know about Third Prince?

447
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,580
Let me tell you.

448
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,000
He's actually–

449
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:30,820
Commander Song.

450
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,870
Greetings, Your Highness.

451
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,740
Save the courtesy.

452
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,090
This is not the court.

453
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,000
You two

454
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,200
are my future father-in-law and mother-in-law.

455
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:47,780
You flatter me.

456
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,840
You're too kind, Your Highness.

457
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,200
Please.

458
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,330
Okay.

459
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,080
Your Highness.

460
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,330
My daughter acted recklessly.

461
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,360
Marriage is not child's play either.

462
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,910
Please reconsider it, Your Highness.

463
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,770
You're right.

464
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:16,100
We shouldn't forget the etiquette with regards to this matter.

465
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,790
Although Father has issued an edict to the world,

466
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,430
I still should visit

467
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,430
and present the betrothal gifts.

468
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,890
Stop waiting.

469
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:29,670
Hurry up and present the betrothal gifts.

470
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,970

471
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,110

472
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,320
Please take a look.

473
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,840
These are treasures bestowed by His Majesty.

474
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,980
Your Highness.

475
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,730
Thank you for Your Highness and His Majesty's kindness.

476
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,170
But my daughter is stubborn by nature.

477
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,610
It’s really hard to take on this huge responsibility.

478
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:01,430
Commander Song.

479
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:06,870
Are you worried that I will hurt Xiangyun?

480
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,220
Or do you think

481
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,820
that I'm not good enough for Xiangyun?

482
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,830
I dare not.

483
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:20,330
Good.

484
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,050
Don’t worry, Commander.

485
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:25,870
I will protect Xiangyun forever.

486
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,980
Your Highness, is there anything else

487
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,660
you're here for this time?

488
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,310
Father ordered

489
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,780
for our wedding date

490
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,990
to be set ten days from today.

491
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,150
Ten days from today?

492
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,440
It's a bit hasty.

493
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,970
Father is bedridden with disease.

494
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,200
It's also for good luck to ward off the imminent death.

495
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,040
Today, I'm here to take you into the palace

496
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,050
to discuss the wedding matters

497
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,350
and learn some palace etiquette.

498
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,650
There are many rules in the palace indeed.

499
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,490
You just have to follow them.

500
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,800
I've already talked to the nannies.

501
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,500
They won't give you a hard time.

I will take good care of myself.

505
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,980
When you use magic,

506
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,520
you become a stone of prohibition.

507
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,610
It's really troublesome.

508
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,320
How about I teach you martial arts?

509
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,120
Then,

510
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,450
you can protect yourself

511
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,310

can I master it?

518

It should take as long as five to six years.

519
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,400
If you're exceptionally talented,

520
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,150
it'll still take at least two to three years.

521
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,660

Prince Ning will really blow up the dyke

533
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,080
to turn the war situation around?

534
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,760
Or

535
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,310
is it just a cover-up?

In between Mount Jinchong and Huilong Dyke,

549
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:33,830
there was originally a road.

550
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,180
After the dyke was built,

551
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,350
this place was flooded

552
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:37,540
and there's no longer any road for traveling.

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,390
but the tracks of the carriage are not deep.

573
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,590
There should be no gunpowder in the carriage.

574
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,770
They are trying to mislead us

575
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,040
and confuse us.

576
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,430
Let's wait a bit longer.

577
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:28,010
Okay.

578
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,300
Those over there. Keep up.

579
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,170
Hurry up. Keep up.

580
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,340
Those at the back, don't fall behind.

581
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:42,870
Hurry up.

582
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,790
Stop dawdling. Hurry up.

583
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,460
Be careful.

584
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,220
Ready.

585
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,020
Those at the back, keep up.

586
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:08,210
Release.

587
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,530
There's an ambush! Watch out!

588
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:14,790
Watch out.

589
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,760
Be on guard!

590
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:17,220
On guard!

591
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,080
Light the fire.

592
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:30,800
Release!

593
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,460
Watch out!

594
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:46,770
Kill!

595
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:03,010
Useless trash!

596
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:04,910
You were of no help!

597
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,920
I didn't do my job well.

598
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,730
I deserve to die.

599
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,830
You deserve to die,

600
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,590
but it's not the time for you to die yet.

601
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,130
Miss.

602
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,830
You can try to add a bit of jasmine.

603
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,120
It will be more fragrant.

604
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:28,780
Okay.

605
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:45,420
Your Highness.

606
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,330
Why are you here?

607
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,130
I came to see you.

608
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,380
It smells so good.

609
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:57,840
Who are these for?

610
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:00,870
One for you,

611
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,710
one for Mother and one for Song.

612
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,570
And...

613
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:05,980
one for me.

614
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,100
By the way,

615
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,530
this is for you.

616
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,070
Thank you for stepping forward

617
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,370
to save our family.

618
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,380
Why this one?

619
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:25,330
I think

620
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,950
blue suits Your Highness better.

621
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,590
There is another blue one.

622
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,470
This...

623
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:38,320
was a defective one that I made by accident.

624
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,820
I can't give it to Your Highness.

625
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,480
I'll give this to Song.

626
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,090
It's so beautiful.

627
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,680
It's from Miss Xiangyun,

628
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,710
so I'll definitely treasure it.

629
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,820
Your Highness. Your...

630
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,110
Miss Xiangyun.

631
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,390
Xiangyun.

632
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,930
I have some things to take care of.

633
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:14,930
Go ahead.

634
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:15,600
All right.

635
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:31,270
His Highness loves you so much.

636
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:34,440
His Highness is a gentle person.

637
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,750
He and I are companions.

638
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,080
We can be considered good friends.

639
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,780
Don't say things like this

640
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,300
that'd make His Highness sad.

641
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,160
If His Highness has no feelings for you,

642
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,120
why would he risk his life

643
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,540
to accept the sachet you made?

644
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,600
He likes it so much too.

645
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,740
He kept smelling it too.

646
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,470
His Highness has a weak body.

647
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,740
It's not good for him to smell incense.

648
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,420
Especially the cinnamon you used.

649
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:00,980
It's something that can never appear in Ningyuan Palace.

650
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,140
Yet, he treated it like a treasure today,

651
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,900
holding it in his hands.

652
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,230
H-how could that be.

653
00:34:09,909 --> 00:34:11,120
His Highness

654
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,710
must be having rashes now.

655
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,179
Didn't you say it's a temporary measure?

656
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:24,370
How could it be?

657
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,960
If Xiu Ming really likes me,

658
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,409
yet I marry him for the Song Family,

659
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:35,659
[Ningyuan Palace]

660
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,100
isn't that despicable of me?

661
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,639
But if I don't marry him,

662
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:35,770
what would Song and Mother do?

663
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:37,370
No.

664
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,239
I must make it clear to him.

665
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,350
Third Brother.

666
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:43,820
I beg you.

667
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,380
Let my mother go.

668
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,710
Now that Father has been held hostage by you,

669
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,360
and the officials are being manipulated by you,

670
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,630
you already have everything.

671
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,430
For the sake of our bloodline,

672
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,420
please let me go.

673
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,590
Who do you think you are to me?

674
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,490
How dare you

675
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,020
talk about bloodline with me?

676
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,260
Your life and death

677
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,030
has nothing to do with me.

678
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:19,340
Xiu Ming,

679
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,620
don't go too far!

680
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,460
Don't forget what you've done.

681
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,190
What about Miss Song?

682
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,270
In order to get her,

683
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,330
you took calculated steps

684
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,510
and set various traps.

685
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,140
You proposed to Father

686
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,920
and made Father kill the Lu family.

687
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,840
Now, you forced her family into such a plight.

688
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,980
Isn't it all to make her desperate

689
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,100
and have no choice but to come along with you?

690
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,820
It seems

691
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,180
you know a lot.

692
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:53,820
Xiu Ming.

693
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,000
You're so cruel.

694
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,500
Do you think Song Xiangyun will still marry you

695
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,460
if she knew these?

696
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,250
Why are you so quiet?

697
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,280
I'm right, aren't I?

698
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,380
Xiu Ming,

699
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,570
I advise you to show some mercy.

700
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:20,910
Remember,

701
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:25,040
if I go to hell with my mother,

702
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,850
I will make you the scapegoat.

703
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:39,340
[Ningyuan Palace]

704
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,860
[Ningyuan Palace]

705
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,270
Miss X-Xiangyun.

706
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,420
Why are you here?

707
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:02,480
Are you here for Prince Ning?

708
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,620
Xiangyun?

709
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,090
Xiangyun.

710
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,020
When did you come?

711
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:20,060
You set Song Family up to eradicate the Lu family.

712
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,160
And it was also you

713
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,780
who put our family in such a desperate situation.

714
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:26,100
Xiangyun...

715
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,330
let me explain this to you,

716
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:30,930
okay?

717
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,190
Xiangyun!

718
00:37:54,590 --> 00:38:00,070
[Ningyuan Palace]

719
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,100
Why?

720
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,760
Why?

721
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:26,070
Is it really just for me?

722
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,650
Xiangyun,

723
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,700
I have no other wish in this life.

724
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,750
I only want you.

725
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:42,780
So, this is not a temporary solution.

726
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,400
You've been lying to me all along.

727
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,980
The Song and Lu family

728
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,670
are all under your control.

729
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,140
Xiangyun...
