00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,910
Xiaoxiang!

5
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,140
What are you doing?

6
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,210
You can't use the Power of Linglong Heart!

7
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,140
You can use it.

8
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,270
Why can't I?

9
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,210
It's not the first time

10
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,380
that I've disobeyed you.

11
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:38,940
You…

12
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,340
We finally killed him.

13
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,640
Master.

14
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:58,600
Your hand.

15
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,140
Why did you risk your life to save me just now?

16
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,770
You were in danger.

17
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,210
I couldn't just stand by.

20
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,540
to save me again and again!

21
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,900
Master.

22
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,470
What…

23
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,860
What do you mean?

24
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,060
Do you remember what I said to you?

25
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,240
Promise me

26
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,830

27
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,990

Xiaoxiang.

102
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:40,950
It's the Protector.

103
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,000
He's gotten through the tribulation

104
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,980
and is about to return.

105
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,360
Chu Kong has been back

106
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,990
from the mortal world for some time

107
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:30,590
but hasn't come to visit me.

108
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,030
Has he been held up by something?

109
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,340
His Divinity

110
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,920
has indeed been strange since he came back.

111
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,220
Very mysterious.

112
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,580
He hasn't left the Xiaoyun Palace yet.

113
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,410
You've been paying lots of attention

114
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,100
to the God of War.

115
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,680
I always think

116
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,890
that the God of War's tribulations concern the safety of the six realms

117
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:50,170
and must not be overlooked.

118
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,140
Do you want me

119
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,360
to send for the God of War?

120
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,100
Okay.

121
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,560
Send a message to him for me.

122
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,170
Tell him

123
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,100
that I want to see him.

124
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,550
Yes.

125
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:13,960
Before I went to the mortal world,

126
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,880
I asked you to investigate him.

127
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:17,120
How did it go?

128
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,490
Xiu Ming was sent to the Moluo Divine Clan

129
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,550
when he was young as a hostage.

130
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,210
30,000 years ago,

131
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,530
the Battle of Cangri ended.

132
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,790
All the Dixiu Gods died

133
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,890
with Cang Hai.

134
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:30,460
He came back after the fall of the Moluo Divine Clan.

135
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,690
We don't have records

136
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:37,550
of what he did at Mount Moluo, do we?

137
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:38,810
No.

138
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:40,890
So I checked the historical record

139
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,260
of the Battle of Cangri.

140
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,730
I found this.

141
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,390
It's Cang Hai's magical instrument,

142
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,460
Tianqiong Jade.

143
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,460
By the way,

144
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,750
Xiangyun has come back from the tribulation too.

145
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,390
I gave her my Linglong Heart.

146
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,480
Her heart disease

147
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,870
should've been cured.

148
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,100
She didn't die of heart disease.

149
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,370
After you two killed Xu Wenrui,

150
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,350
Xiangyun jumped off the cliff with your body.

151
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,390
Xiangzi.

152
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,220
Xiangzi.

153
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,770
Wake up. Wake up.

154
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,590
Xiangzi.

155
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,370
You were crying in your sleep.

156
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,140
Did you have a bad dream?

157
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,610
Red Thread Master.

158
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,630
I'll go to work now.

159
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:51,300
Never mind.

160
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,600
No need to hurry.

161
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,270
Sit down.

162
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,360
Just now,

163
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,910
I went to the Fate Bureau

164
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:59,000
and checked the Love Tribulation Fate Book

165
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,020
of you and Immortal Chu Kong.

166
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,910
Oh, my red thread.

167
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,600
It was so touching

168
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,040
that I cried my eyes out.

169
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,100
Three days later,

170
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,300
you'll turn 3100 years old.

171
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,530
Why don't you take this opportunity

172
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,350
to invite His Divinity to meet you on the Magpie Bridge?

173
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:29,950
Red Thread Master.

174
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:31,190
His Divinity and I

175
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,940
are just tribulation partners.

176
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,170
No way!

177
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,090
His Divinity treated you so well in the mortal world.

178
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,180
He even gave you his Linglong Heart.

179
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:05,300
You promised in the mortal world

180
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,720
that you wouldn't blame me.

181
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,360
But I'm not Lu Changkong.

182
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:17,060
If you truly love him,

183
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,790
you should put aside your worries.

184
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,260
It all happened in the mortal world.

185
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,290
Master was good,

186
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,120
but he only existed in the mortal world.

187
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:38,580
Your Divinity.

188
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,220
Your Divinity.

189
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,510
I'll go get you some food and drinks.

190
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,860
Sit down.

191
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,590
Your Divinity.

192
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,170
Don't talk.

193
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,119
How do you feel?

194
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,290
How

195
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,160
do I feel about you?

196
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,530
I mean,

197
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,740
are you feeling all right?

198
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,360
Thank you for your concern.

199
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,360
After coming back from the tribulation,

200
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,910
I've been perky

201
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,230
and energized.

202
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,380
Is His Divinity

203
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,620
worried about me?

204
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,740
Our tribulation in the mortal world

205
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,570
was quite different from other people's.

206
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:48,820
Yeah.

207
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,360
It was so melodramatic.

208
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,920
We both had the Linglong Heart

209
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,250
and all my family died in a massacre.

210
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,740
Even dark magic was involved.

211
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,260
It was indeed

212
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,030
a bit melodramatic.

213
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,310
But not everything about it

214
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,900
was so bad.

215
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,740
To cure the Linglong heart,

216
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,670
we must find another person with this disease.

217
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,060
If we had been unlucky

218
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,450
and hadn't met each other before 20,

219
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,020
we would…

220
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,450
Wait.

221
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,440
You found me with my portrait.

222
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,160
Your Divinity,

223
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,340
did you go to the mortal world with memories?

224
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:23,900
No.

225
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,070
Xiangyun.

226
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,200
Immortal Chu Kong is here too.

227
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,190
What a surprise.

228
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,870
Yes.

229
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,060
What a surprise.

230
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,850
Thank you.

231
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,680
Fuyuan Fairy.

232
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,440
How have you been

233
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,030
after coming back?

234
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,020
I…

235
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,940
After Fuyuan Fairy returned from the tribulation,

236
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,250
her primordial spirit was enhanced

237
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,460
and she's been in good spirits.

238
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,290
I'm glad

239
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:58,530
to know that.

240
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,630
Xiu Ming.

241
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,110
I have something important to discuss with you.

242
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,930
See you at the Penglai Residence.

243
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,660
You haven't answered

244
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,180
my question.

245
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:16,350
Go ahead.

246
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,060
How did you know

247
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,570
that if my primordial spirit was strengthened during the tribulation,

248
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:23,930
Xiangyun's primordial spirit would be weakened?

249
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,190
I care about her.

250
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,910
Every time she came back from a tribulation,

251
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,100
I went to check her pulse.

252
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,230
Xiangyun is cheerful

253
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,550
and adorable.

254
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,040
You like her.

255
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,590
I also like her very much.

256
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,880
Do you think you can provoke me

257
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,210
by saying that

258
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:49,290
to guard your secret?

259
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:51,900
Xiu Ming,

260
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:53,430
you have a jade pendant hanging around your neck

261
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:55,460
which you said was given by the jade girl

262
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,620
who you've loved for tens of thousands of years.

263
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,420
Interestingly,

264
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,330
the devil Cang Hai who attempted to destroy the world

265
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,970
had two magical instruments.

266
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:04,320
One was Tianji Compass.

267
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,030
The other

268
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,390
was Tianqiong Jade.

269
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,170
You guessed it.

270
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:15,900
Right.

271
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,320
The woman I love

272
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,210
is Cang Hai.

273
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,050
Xiu Ming, don't forget

274
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,300
that Cang Hai killed 20,000 Officials

275
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,140
and also all the Dixiu Gods.

276
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,860
She didn't do that!

277
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,900
She would never commit such atrocities.

278
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:39,700
I believe her.

279
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,370
I'll always believe her.

280
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,790
Why?

281
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,980
You're the prince of the Dixiu Divine Clan.

282
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,510
Cang Hai killed all your family.

283
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,240
I was born weak

284
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,400
but only the strong were respected in the Dixiu Divine Clan.

285
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,940
I was despised and humiliated when I was young

286
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,420
and sent to the Moluo Divine Clan as a hostage.

287
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,030
There,

288
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,460
I met her.

289
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,300
Is this

290
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,780
the sacred relic of the Moluo Divine Clan,

291
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,530
Tianqiong Jade?

292
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,690
She and I

293
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,260
could've lived a carefree life

294
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,740
in the Moluo Palace forever.

295
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,310
But I lost everything.

296
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,260
Chu Kong.

297
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,970
You killed her.

298
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,860
Let me put it this way.

299
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,420
Chu Kong,

300
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,620
of all the living beings

301
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,460
in all the six realms,

302
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,550
I only care about her.

303
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,080
After she comes back to life,

304
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,700
even if I had to turn the six realms

305
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,700
into a living hell,

306
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,380
I'd stand with her and protect her.

307
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,030
I'd die for her.

308
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,270
You're crazy.

309
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,440
You owe her that!

310
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,220
If gods get in my way,

311
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,180
I'll kill gods.

312
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,140
If the world stands against me,

313
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,940
I'll shatter the world.

314
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,010
My love for her

315
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,860
can never be understood by an immortal like you

316
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,300
who's lived in praise and glory

317
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,980
since you were born.

318
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,110
Xiu Ming.

319
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,220
We've known each other for over 30,000 years.

320
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,380
As your friend,

321
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,310
I want to relate to you,

322
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,530
but if you make mistakes for her

323
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,760
and hurt innocent creatures,

324
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,380
as the God of War,

325
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,730
I can't neglect my duties to cover for you!

326
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,140
Yes.

327
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,590
You're the God of War

328
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,540
who could wield your sword

329
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,760
at your beloved one to protect the six realms.

330
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:45,120
What do you mean by that?

331
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,460
I'm just saying.

332
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,420
If one day,

333
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,820
you have to choose between the six realms and Xiangyun,

334
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,950
which will you choose,

335
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,540
Your Divinity?

336
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,380
If you're talking about

337
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,540
compromising her primordial spirit to enhance mine,

338
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:03,020
I'll try my best to find a solution.

339
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,980
I don't want to hurt her

340
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,300
to repair my primordial spirit either!

341
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,020
Try your best?

342
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,210
Save me those empty platitudes.

343
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,700
No matter how much you appear

344
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:13,600
to care for her,

345
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,700
when it becomes a matter of life or death,

346
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,740
you'll abandon her

347
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,760
for fame and glory.

348
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,700
That's why I said

349
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,770
a heartless

350
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,180
and condescending immortal like you

351
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,060
can never relate to me.

352
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,700
Xiu Ming.

353
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:43,460
Xiu Ming.

354
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,980
What do you remember

355
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,940
about the Battle of Cangri 30,000 years ago?

356
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,380
If you saw something with your own eyes,

357
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,300
or there's any evidence that proves

358
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,980
Cang Hai died wrongly,

359
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,480
I can look into it with you

360
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,900
to clear her name.

361
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,620
The past is the past.

362
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,300
No need for that.

363
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,140
Please leave.

364
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,110
Your Divinity.

365
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,220
These are all the documents about Cang Hai

366
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,420
I can find.

367
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,260
Besides the official history,

368
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:39,620
[Mysteries of the Moluo Divine Clan]

369
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,900
I also collected

370
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,500
folk tales and hearsay about her

371
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,720
that circulate in the six realms.

372
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,980
You've been in charge of tribulations for a long time.

373
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,280
Have you seen any case

374
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,080
where one tribulation partner's

375
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,760
primordial spirit was enhanced

376
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,860
while the other one's was diminished?

377
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,680
That only happens

378
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,630
when their primordial spirits have the same origin.

379
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,180
You may leave.

380
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,180
Yes.

381
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,560
Goddess of Fate,

382
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,040
what happened tonight

383
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:11,150
must be kept between you and me.

384
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,270
I understand.

385
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:20,940
Primordial spirits from the same origin?

386
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,550
I and Xiangyun are not from the same clan.

387
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,430
I never met her before.

388
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,960
Why are our primordial spirits from the same origin?

389
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:31,060
Is there something I don't know?

390
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:33,840
Could it be

391
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,350
that Xiangyun has another identity?

392
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,030
I must find out the truth.

393
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,220
I don't mind enduring

394
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,180
excruciating pain day and night.

395
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,100
Cang Hai,

396
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,570
as long as I can avenge you

397
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,180
and reveal the truth,

398
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,800
I'm willing to pay any price.

399
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:10,860
Prince Xiu Ming.

400
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,800
The person who killed your family finally died.

401
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,930
All creatures in the six realms

402
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,110
can live in peace again.

403
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,770
Chu Kong.

404
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,130
Did you kill Cang Hai or not?

405
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,600
Miss.

406
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,150
You saved me.

407
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,170
You haven't fully recovered.

408
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,450
Don't talk.

409
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,190
Did you save me at Mount Shengling?

410
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,350
Did you see

411
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,820
a tall man

412
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,300
with a mole

413
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,660
under his eye?

414
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,300
I need to go home.

415
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,980
I'll repay your kindness in the future.

416
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,260
Miss, what's your name?

417
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,300
Knucklehead, stop.

418
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,550
Are you talking to me?

419
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,680
Is this

420
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,080
destiny?

421
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:51,310
Sect Leader,

422
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:54,060
I met a flower fairy on the mountain.

423
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:54,860
Look.

424
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,230
She took my last name.

425
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,100
Her name is Qian Luo.

426
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,220
You don't need

427
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,560
to know my name.

428
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,470
Hundreds of years have passed

429
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,560
since I brought you back from Mount Shengling.

430
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,600
Your mortal friends

431
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,290
have long died.

432
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,580
Impossible.

433
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,930
I need to find him.

434
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,290
Where's my heart?

435
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:36,770
What happened?

436
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,620
My power…

437
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,430
Only half of my power is left.

438
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:51,510
After my magic backfired that year,

439
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,020
I turned into my original form

440
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,950
and stayed by your side to protect you.

441
00:28:57,250 --> 00:28:59,620
To keep the Moluo Gods from finding you,

442
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,940
I conjured a stone heart

443
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,300
and continuously injected power into it.

444
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,990
That was how you survived

445
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:09,530
and looked like a normal man.

446
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,750
Now I have to hide my power

447
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,270
so that my brother can't sense me.

448
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,290
Otherwise, both of us will die.

449
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,980
I wonder how long

450
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,580
these herbs can keep you alive.

451
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,220
Li.

452
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:39,300
Li.

453
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,620
Weird.

454
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,700
Where did he go?

455
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,060
Goddess of Fate.

456
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,680
Where is Li?

457
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,700
Well, now that you mention it,

458
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,940
I haven't seen him for days.

459
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,110
It's strange.

460
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,610
Isn't he always compiling the Fate Book in his room?

461
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,770
Maybe he went out for a walk.

462
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,420
He spent days and nights compiling the Fate Book

463
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,280
a while ago

464
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,260
without leaving his room,

465
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,220
changing his clothes,

466
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,060
or washing his hair.

467
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,660
He almost had mushrooms growing out of his hair.

468
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,140
Sounds miserable.

469
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,700
He's the Scholarly Heaven King in charge of the Fate Book.

470
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:15,460
It's his job.

471
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:17,940
I remember now.

472
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,830
A while ago, he mastered a technique called

473
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,290
Scale Nine Peaks

474
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,900
and yearned for an opportunity to use it.

475
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:27,170
Maybe he's gone traveling

476
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,470
to flex his muscles.

477
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,500
He mastered Scale Nine Peaks?

478
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:32,860
He kept bragging about it.

479
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:33,780
The whole Heaven Realm knows it.

480
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,460
He told me about it five times.

481
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:40,060
Given that he's the Scholarly Heaven King,

482
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,900
he should be proud.

483
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,400
Right?

484
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:46,220
Yes.

485
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,590
Goddess of Fate.

486
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,810
I'll take my leave.

487
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,000
Goodbye.

488
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,980
Your Divinity, you have a guest.

489
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,370
Greetings, Your Divinity.

490
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,980
I asked you a question the other day.

491
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,300
You didn't answer me.

492
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,660
So, in the Shengling Sect,

493
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,220
you had memories of the past,

494
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:21,850
didn't you?

495
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,260
You drank the antidote to the Water of Amnesia

496
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:26,870
before going to the mortal world too.

497
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,290
I just followed suit.

498
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,690
We're even now.

499
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,660
So you asked me to plant vegetables, cook,

500
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,740
and give you massages

501
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,130
on purpose?

502
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,220
I…

503
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,790
When you were Song Xiangyun,

504
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,710
you pinched my face a lot.

505
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,900
I just gave you a slap on the wrist.

506
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,480
A slap on the wrist?

507
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,150
When you were my master,

508
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,700
you almost killed me with poisonous mushrooms.

509
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,620
Let go of me.

510
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,110
No.

511
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,220
I kindly cooked for you.

512
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:58,700
I was

513
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,890
benevolent and compassionate.

514
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,490
You also wanted my heart.

515
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,450
But in the end,

516
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,520
I gave my Linglong Heart to you.

517
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,830
I brought you a plate of crabapple cake.

518
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:53,300
It would look better with a fresh flower

519
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,220
as decoration.

520
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,220
What a pity.

521
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,980
A great pity.

522
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,140
I knew

523
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,450
you wouldn't blame me, Master.

524
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,740
Now,

525
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,990
I'm not your master.

526
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:28,950
I know.

527
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,500
You're neither my master

528
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,700
nor Lu Changkong.

529
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,020
Sorry for disturbing you, Your Divinity.

530
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:38,320
I shall take my leave.

531
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,290
Xiangyun.

532
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,179
Don't you want to celebrate your birthday with His Divinity?

533
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:27,820
Did you invite him just now?

534
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,690
It's obvious that he still cares for me.

535
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,780
But why did he say

536
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,900
that he's no longer my master just now?

537
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:43,659
Male immortals are so hard to understand.

538
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:48,590
Qian,

539
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,830
what do you think His Divinity is thinking?

540
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,790
In my opinion,

541
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,360
it is annoying to be taken

542
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:04,630
as someone else.

543
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,680
I didn't take him as someone else.

544
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,210
He was indeed my master during the tribulation.

545
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:12,230
He can't be jealous of himself.

546
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,680
But he's the God of War.

547
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,170
He's Immortal Chu Kong.

548
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:32,960
[Marriage Pavilion]

549
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,260
Look.

550
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,020
Even the red threads

551
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,460
get knotted sometimes.

552
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,320
But your mind can't get knotted.

553
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,340
You liked to play this

554
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:54,500
when you were young.

555
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,460
Let's play it.

556
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,830
Red Thread Master.

557
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,900
You're bad at comforting people.

558
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,940
That's not how you play it.

559
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:09,300
Then how?

560
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,130
This is easy.

561
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,980
I never know

562
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,460
how to pass this level.

563
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:32,950
Here comes the knot.

564
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:33,890
Sorry. It's His Divinity.

565
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:42,740
Your Divinity.

566
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,180
Your Divinity.

567
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,290
Immortal Chu Kong.

568
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,300
What brings you here?

569
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:56,780
I came to return this.

570
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,050
You came to the Marriage Pavilion

571
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,420
just to return the plate?

572
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:03,700
I…

573
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,620
Do you need an excuse to meet the one

574
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:13,580
you miss day and night?

575
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,060
I'm just asking.

576
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,620
I think, no.

577
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:24,800
I…

578
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,740
I'll go wash the plate.

579
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,560
Untie the knot.

580
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,170
Earlier,

581
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,350
I didn't finish my words.

582
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,220
I don't want you

583
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,020
to just see me as your master.

584
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,390
Do you remember

585
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,120
how we became tribulation partners?

586
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,110
I was impulsive

587
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:11,620
and tied a Love Knot on you.

588
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,770
We've had three tribulations.

589
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,150
I want to know,

590
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,660
as Xiangyun, a fairy,

591
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:22,260
how you feel

592
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,300
about Immortal Chu Kong.

593
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:26,670
Obviously, I like…

594
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,380
Why don't you think it through

595
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,110
before you answer me?

596
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,120
By the way,

597
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:43,880
tomorrow is your birthday.

598
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,870
How did you know?

599
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,700
I…

600
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:53,150
Never mind.

601
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,580
Think it through.

602
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,830
I'll come back

603
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,490
for your answer tomorrow.

604
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,040
Do you mean

605
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,620
you'll celebrate my birthday with me?

606
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,490
Actually, I prepared a gift for you.

607
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,640
I'll give it to you in exchange for your answer.

608
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,190
At 5 pm tomorrow,

609
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,050
I'll come to the Marriage Pavilion to pick you up.

610
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,970
[Marriage Pavilion]

611
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:21,930
Wait.

612
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,890
What's it?

613
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,340
I also have a gift for you.
