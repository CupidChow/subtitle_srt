[Episode 28]

4
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:51,380
Summon the young masters of the Qilin Divine Clan.

5
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,780
Greetings, Empress.

6
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,370
Rise.

7
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,140
I...

8
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:42,690
I...

9
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,170
Miss Xiaotang

10
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,630
is Moluo Empress?

11
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,130
She's old-fashioned, boring,

12
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,190
arbitrary,

13
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,300
bossy, and unreasonable.

14
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,780
I will never like such a person.

15
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,940
Actually,

16
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,100
it's mainly because

17
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,780
I'm too handsome.

18
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,380
Think about it.

19
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,980
If Moluo Empress

20
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,260
falls in love with me at first sight,

21
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,420
that will be my biggest problem.

22
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,530
Second Prince, you're staring at me that way.

23
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,520
Do you have something to say?

24
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,290
I just suddenly feel

25
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,340
that you and my fiancée

26
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,440
really look alike.

27
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,620
For a split second,

28
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,829
I was in a daze.

29
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,579
Your fiancée and I

30
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,329
really look alike?

31
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,980
That's fate.

32
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,180
In that case,

33
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,370
you can stay here for a few more days

34
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,440
and let me entertain you well

35
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,230
as a host.

36
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,540
Thank you, Empress.

37
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,000
My fiancée

38
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:02,700
is very narrow-minded.

39
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,350
If I stay here

40
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,820
for a few more days,

41
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,250
I'm afraid she'll be jealous.

42
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:14,350
Since you care so much about your fiancée's thoughts,

43
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,500
I won't force you.

44
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,120
You should go back.

45
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:44,900
Empress.

46
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,740
Chu Kong is young.

47
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,860
Please forgive him

48
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,460
for offending you.

49
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:50,930
I...

50
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,530
First Prince, don't worry about it.

51
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,020
It's rare for me to see

52
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,610
such an interesting guest like Second Prince.

53
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,730
I'm so glad.

54
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,660
Protector.

55
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,380
Take First Prince to rest.

56
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,490
I have something to say to Second Prince.

57
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,500
The rest of you may leave too.

58
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:08,830
Yes.

59
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,540
Yes.

60
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,330
First Prince.

61
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,780
Please.

62
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,990
Thank you for your kindness, Empress.

63
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,100
Once Chu Kong marries into the Moluo Divine Clan,

64
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,470
Father will definitely value him more.

65
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,610
By then,

66
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,409
the position of the Qilin Divine Clan's clan leader

67
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,380
will be his

68
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,490
without doubt.

69
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,580
It can't happen.

70
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,110
Stop!

71
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,960
Stop!

72
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,570
What's wrong?

73
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,610
Are you going to use Empress's identity

74
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,080
to give me orders?

75
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,630
Yes.

76
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,980
I'm the

77
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,220
old-fashioned, boring,

78
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,820
arbitrary,

79
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,100
bossy, and unreasonable

80
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,780
Moluo Empress you talked about before.

81
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,370
What are you going to do?

82
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,650
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

83
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,270
I wanted to tell you before.

84
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,580
You always said

85
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,290
you didn't want to marry Moluo Empress.

86
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,580
What could I say?

87
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,360
Should I say that I'm the Moluo Empress

88
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:36,290
you always denigrated?

89
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,230
If you had told me earlier,

90
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,659
I wouldn't have said those words.

91
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,700
Don't forget

92
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,260
you promised

93
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,120
that you'll always love me

94
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,950
no matter who I am.

95
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,130
What?

96
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,550
Because I'm Moluo Empress,

97
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,850
are you going to

98
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,750
throw me over?

99
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:56,780
Who...

100
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,520
Who threw me over?

101
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,500
The Moluo Divine Clan sent out invitations

102
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,480
and invited young masters of all clans here

103
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,430
in order to select a husband for you.

104
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,250
And Xiu Ming.

105
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,320
You said that your family and his family are friends.

106
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,600
But he's actually a prince of the Dixiu Divine Clan.

107
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,300
He was specially prepared for you

108
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,710
as your future husband.

109
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,660
Who told you these things?

110
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,550
Are they not true?

111
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,710
Are you

112
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,140
jealous?

113
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,060
Summoning young masters of all clans

114
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,350
is Protector's decision.

115
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,010
Except the Qilin Divine Clan,

116
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:45,080
I didn't see anyone.

117
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:48,500
As for Xiu Ming,

118
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:51,159
I just think of him as my younger brother.

119
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,840
Otherwise,

120
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,040
I wouldn't have gone out of the palace to catch you.

121
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,270
I don't know

122
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,620
if I can believe

123
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,190
what you say.

124
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,490
Also,

125
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,180
I don't know

126
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,650
if my engagement to Xiaotang

127
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,690
still counts.

128
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,300
If you mind this,

129
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,400
I won't force you.

130
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,670
Let's pretend that we never met

131
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,880
and that nothing happened.

132
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,060
In the future,

133
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,620
take care of yourself.

134
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,700
You abandoned me.

135
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:39,820
Yes.

136
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,740
Xiaotang is me.

137
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,860
Moluo Empress is also me.

138
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,820
You can't get rid of me

139
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,830
in this lifetime.

140
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,580
You...

141
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,040
Will you lie to me again?

142
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,210
I concealed my identity before.

143
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,690
Thank you

144
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,440
for forgiving me.

145
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,580
Lord Protector,

146
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,660
you're exaggerating.

147
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,600
I didn't aware

148
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,340
that Miss Xiaotang is Empress

149
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,450
before.

150
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,710
Empress is naughty.

151
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,980
Fortunately, she met Second Prince this time.

152
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,460
Chu Kong has also been willful since childhood.

153
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,540
He doesn't obey Father and Mother.

154
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,590
It was fine

155
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,610
when we didn't know

156
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,910
Empress's real identity.

157
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,550
But now we know it.

158
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,220
We can't act rashly anymore.

159
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,760
Lord Protector,

160
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,700
Empress's engagement

161
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,040
should be taken seriously.

162
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,060
If the Moluo Divine Clan wants to break off the engagement,

163
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,710
the Qilin Divine Clan won't refuse.

164
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,470
First Prince, why did you say that?

165
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:14,640
Second Prince is good at both literature and martial arts.

166
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,880
He's brave and handsome.

167
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,410
He's also a noble.

168
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,690
He and Empress are a perfect match.

169
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,530
Why did you say they acted rashly?

170
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,100
Besides,

171
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,460
Empress and Second Prince love each other.

172
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,100
Isn't it a good marriage?

173
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,820
You're right.

174
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,940
On behalf of Chu Kong,

175
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,320
I'd like to thank Empress.

176
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,940
First Prince.

177
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,290
You're very welcome.

178
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,360
After Second Prince and Empress get married,

179
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,700
we'll be a family.

180
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,580
Oh, no.

181
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,900
Tonight is the first full moon night

182
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:55,130
since Princess became an adult.

183
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,050
It seems that

184
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,950
the secret formation can no longer subdue her power.

185
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,900
Lord Protector.

186
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,700
Just now...

187
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,100
The stars have been changing unusually recently.

188
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,710
Maybe the two things are related.

189
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,600
First Prince.

190
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,260
You must be tired.

191
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,430
Why don't you go back and rest?

192
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,040
Please.

193
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,010
Okay.

194
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,670
I didn't expect

195
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,740
that you're good at archery.

196
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,100
What?

197
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,480
Are you here to show off?

198
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,750
Although I'm a hostage,

199
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,840
I don't give up easily.

200
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,030
Yes.

201
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,740
You're a hostage from the Dixiu Divine Clan.

202
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,990
Your power is weak, and you can't take a hit.

203
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,310
So what?

204
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,350
Do you feel inferior

205
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,650
because of this?

206
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,710
Of course not.

207
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:29,210
Although my power isn't as strong as yours,

208
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,270
I'm willing to sacrifice everything

209
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,550
for Cang Hai.

210
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,280
Even if my soul breaks

211
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,660
and my primordial spirit perishes,

212
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:36,690
I'll do anything.

213
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,860
I guessed right.

214
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,620
You also like Cang Hai.

215
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,740
So what?

216
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,210
Although I'm a prince of the Dixiu Divine Clan,

217
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,580
I've never been valued since childhood.

218
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,700
I was sent to the Moluo Divine Clan as a hostage.

219
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,060
Even my parents

220
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,170
don't care about my life.

221
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,220
Cang Hai is the only person

222
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,100
who never look at me with contempt.

223
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,370
She taught me archery

224
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,430
and celebrated my birthday.

225
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,880
She treats me with sincerity.

226
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,380
She's the warmest person

227
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,940
in my life.

228
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,330
I swore

229
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,580
that I'll protect her forever,

230
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,220
even if I have to sacrifice my life.

231
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:20,730
Let's make a deal first.

232
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,740
I won't let you win.

233
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,060
I won't give up easily.

234
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,340
Princess.

235
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:11,990
Princess.

236
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,780
I don't know why

237
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,560
I can't control myself.

238
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,170
Princess,

239
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,670
you've grown up.

240
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,780
Your power will become stronger and stronger.

241
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,830
You have to learn how to control it

242
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,730
so that this situation won't happen again.

243
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,770
I'll learn.

244
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,150
I'll learn.

245
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,110
Monarch.

246
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,470
I've gotten the little princess settled.

247
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:45,770
There is no little princess.

248
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,620
There is only one princess

249
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,990
in the Moluo Divine Clan.

250
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,680
She is with her mother now.

251
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,460
Yes.

252
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,890
Understood.

253
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,340
From now on,

254
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,420
the Moluo Divine Clan

255
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,320
will only have one princess,

256
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,670
Princess Cang Hai.

257
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:35,790
I thought Prince Xiu Ming

258
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,050
would become Empress's future husband.

259
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,680
But

260
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,940
the Qilin Divine Clan's Second Prince appeared.

261
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,110
Although Prince Xiu Ming is handsome and gentle,

262
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,370
he's too weak.

263
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:44,910
He's not suitable

264
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,700
to be the prince consort of our Moluo Divine Clan.

265
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,000
Exactly.

266
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,170
I heard that the Qilin Divine Clan's Second Prince

267
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,460
has traveled around the six realms for many years

268
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,150
and killed countless demons.

269
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,650
Only such a powerful young master

270
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,280
is worthy of Empress.

271
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,160
That's right.

272
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:57,930
All right.

273
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,660
Let's stop talking.

274
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,420
Let's go.

275
00:16:59,420 --> 00:16:59,900
Okay.

276
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:18,940
It's so late.

277
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:19,900
Why are you still up?

278
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,430
You just came back.

279
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,369
You must have been busy with a backlog of work.

280
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,319
So,

281
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,010
I prepared lingzhi mushroom soup for you.

282
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:31,470
It's good for your health.

283
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,110
Drink it while it's hot.

284
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:34,130
Take a good look.

285
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,150
Between us, who needs to improve health?

286
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:37,620
I appreciate your kindness.

287
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,960
You don't have to do this for me.

288
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,870
Taking good care of yourself

289
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:41,970
is your priority.

290
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,940
I'm just a hostage from the Dixiu Divine Clan who no one cares about.

291
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,780
I'm not good at literature and martial arts.

292
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,000
I can't help you much.

293
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,460
I can only do what I can do for you.

294
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,900
Didn't I tell you before?

295
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,380
Don't sell yourself short.

296
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,700
Everyone has things

297
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,890
they're good at and bad at.

298
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,570
Although your magic is not strong,

299
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:03,980
you're meticulous

300
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,240
and persistent.

301
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,910
Didn't everything you wanted to do

302
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:08,450
succeed in the end?

303
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,620
Even so,

304
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,470
people seem

305
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,420
to prefer talented people.

306
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,060
Am I right?

307
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,540
You're thinking too much again.

308
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:22,360
Talented people are indeed impressive.

309
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,390
But people like you who work hard

310
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,260
will also be admired and liked.

311
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:27,900
Really?

312
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,420
Is there really someone

313
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,890
who will like someone like me?

314
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,090
Of course.

315
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,980
In the future,

316
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,160
you will meet someone

317
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:37,510
who truly loves you.

318
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,900
She'll understand,

319
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,720
love,

320
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,430
and protect you.

321
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:28,330
My Lord.

322
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,940
According to your instructions,

323
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,290
I found a few old servants

324
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,440
who retired from the Moluo Palace.

325
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,220
According to them,

326
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,150
the royal family of the Moluo Divine Clan has always been giving birth to twins.

327
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:39,890
If the twins are a boy and a girl,

328
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,390
they can be safe.

329
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,750
If the twins are of the same sex,

330
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,540
for some reason,

331
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,230
only one of them can survive.

332
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:47,870
But strangely,

333
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,740
in the generation of Empress Cang Hai,

334
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,190
she's an only child.

335
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,880
Keep investigating.

336
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,020
Have you

337
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,980
wiped those people out?

338
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,260
My Lord, don't worry.

339
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,140
They

340
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,370
will never speak again.

341
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,520
Chu Kong.

342
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,530
I'm sorry.

343
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,440
I'm late.

344
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,510
I've been busy

345
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,780
with a huge backlog of work.

346
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,930
After a few days,

347
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,200
I'll spend some quality time with you.

348
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,020
Alright.

349
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,160
Don't worry about me.

350
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,200
Since you came back,

351
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,870
it's just been a few days.

352
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,960
You've lost so much weight.

353
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,650
I suddenly feel

354
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,000
you're quite right.

355
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
The life of the empress

356
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,130
is indeed boring.

357
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:16,910
Let's not talk about

358
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,890
the past.

359
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,900
Do you want to bring up the past?

360
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,500
You...

361
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,060
By the way,

362
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:31,390
when are you going to

363
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,370
tell your parents about our marriage?

364
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,110
When are you going to announce it to the six realms?

365
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,910
What?

366
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,560
You hesitated.

367
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,670
I know

368
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,180
you don't want to be my husband.

369
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,500
There are some things

370
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,380
I don't know how to tell you.

371
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,970
So you're natural Golden Qilin.

372
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,470
Your father wants you to go back

373
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,320
and inherit the position of the clan leader.

374
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,860
No wonder

375
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,540
the first time you mentioned your brother,

376
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,880
your expression was quite strange.

377
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,910
I have no intention to compete with my brother

378
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,110
for the position of the clan leader.

379
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,240
He's the eldest son.

380
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,170
He should be the successor.

381
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,260
I know.

382
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,190
Otherwise,

383
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,320
you wouldn't

384
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,500
have left the Qilin Divine Clan and been to the Mortal Realm to improve yourself.

385
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,980
You wouldn't have written

386
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
and rufused to marry into the Moluo Divine Clan.

387
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,350
Instead, you chose

388
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,790
to get engaged to me when I was unidentified at that time.

389
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,790
Back then, I didn't know who you were.

390
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,930
There was not so much trouble.

391
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,190
Things are different now.

392
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,610
If I marry you,

393
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,870
people will think

394
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,710
the Qilin Divine Clan chose me as the heir.

395
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,900
Brother will be more embarrassed then.

396
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,580
What are you going to do?

397
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:10,880
I can't change my identity.

398
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,120
But don't think about breaking off the engagement.

399
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,610
I have no intention to break off the engagement.

400
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,920
But if we announce our marriage

401
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,190
to the world now,

402
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,370
there will be a lot of unnecessary trouble.

403
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,700
So,

404
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:28,150
the person who is going to marry you

405
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,990
can't be the Qilin Divine Clan's Second Prince.

406
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:33,460
He can't be the Qilin Divine Clan's Second Prince,

407
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,910
but he can be

408
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,710
the chivalrous young man

409
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:37,970
who I fell in love with at first sight.

410
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,130
♫The moonlight must be you♫

411
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,770
♫Laying the groundwork for emotions♫

412
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:45,060
♫Soft but firm♫

413
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,620
♫The mist must be you♫

414
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:52,020
♫Soaking up my emotions♫

415
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,460
For the rest of my life,

416
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,850
♫It's your sigh♫

417
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,680
I'll look at the stars with you,

418
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,320
♫But I can't explain these contradictory feelings♫

419
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,980
travel around the world with you,

420
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,110
♫Actually yearning for me to cherish or delete them♫

421
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,530
and grow old

422
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,710
♫You're just passing by♫

423
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:06,990
with you.

424
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,690
♫My heart ripples along, how fascinating♫

425
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,240
Forever and ever,

426
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,500
my love for you

427
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,780
will never change.

428
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,980
♫I want to ask, who has the maze to great love♫

429
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,620
♫Let me close my eyes♫

430
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:23,210
♫Then I can fly♫

431
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:26,610
♫Fly past you and intersect with you in an instant♫

432
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:30,810
♫Let my heart search and call out for you♫

433
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,080
♫Respond♫

434
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,320
♫I dare not ask, so let me be half awake♫

435
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,830
♫Because when I open my eyes♫

436
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,130
♫I decided in an instant♫

437
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,860
♫Compared to having you♫

438
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,430
♫When I'm thinking of you♫

439
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,740
♫It's more touching♫

440
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,550
What?

441
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,980
You're willing to give up

442
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,700
the identity of the Qilin Divine Clan's Second Prince

443
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,700
and marry Empress

444
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:56,520
anonymously?

445
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,990
I've discussed it with Xiaotang.

446
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,060
But

447
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,610
Father and Mother

448
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,510
might be problems.

449
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,370
Now you remember Father and Mother.

450
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:10,710
You know Father always has high hopes for you.

451
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,980
He's even looking forward to

452
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,370
your marriage with Empress.

453
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,390
Okay.

454
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,020
What is he expecting?

455
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,940
You're going to get married.

456
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,770
But you don't want your identity anymore.

457
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,340
You're ridiculous.

458
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:23,580
Brother, you know

459
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,440
I don't like

460
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,320
complicated politics,

461
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,590
let alone being the future clan leader

462
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,900
of the Qilin Divine Clan.

463
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,940
I like Xiaotang.

464
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,060
But she happens to be the empress of the Moluo Divine Clan.

465
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,500
It can't be changed.

466
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:39,980
So,

467
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,460
I want to hide my identity.

468
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,020
Brother.

469
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,900
Please help me with this.

470
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,060
Fine.

471
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,470
I'll try my best

472
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,980
to persuade Father and Mother.

473
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,410
But whether they'll agree or not

474
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,570
is not up to me.

475
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,620
It's up to fate.

476
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,320
No.

477
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,120
I entrusted my happiness

478
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,020
to you.

479
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,430
Fine.

480
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,660
Let's not talk about this.

481
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,620
Tonight,

482
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,240
Xiaotang will prepare good wine and food.

483
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:19,310
Remember to come.

484
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,130
I'm leaving.

485
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,540
First Prince, I invited you here today to discuss

486
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,840
the marriage of me and Chu Kong with you.

487
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,280
Eldest brothers are like fathers.

488
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,380
Please help us

489
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,410
with our marriage.

490
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,860
You're welcome, Empress.

491
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,050
Chu Kong and I have the same biological mother.

492
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,670
His business is my business.

493
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,870
When I return to the Qilin Divine Clan,

494
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,860
I'll discuss it with my parents immediately

495
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,920
and let it go smoothly.

496
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,420
Thank you in advance.

497
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,400
You're welcome, Empress.

498
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,100
Can you stop being so polite?

499
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,640
We'll be a family in the future.

500
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,960
Thank you, Empress.

501
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,860
In the future,

502
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,630
please help me

503
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,620
tolerate my brother.

504
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,260
Don't worry, First Prince.

505
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,460
I'll treat him well.

506
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,620
Where's Xiu Ming?

507
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:53,630
Why haven't I seen him today?

508
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:55,640
Prince Xiu Ming went out today.

509
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,080
The captain of the guards wanted to follow him,

510
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,200
but he refused.

511
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,070
How could they let him go out alone?

512
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:00,820
Empress!

513
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,280
Empress!

514
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,990
Something happened to Prince Xiu Ming.

515
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,620
Xiu Ming.

516
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,080
He must have forcibly absorbed the spiritual power of herbs.

517
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,220
It backfired.

518
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,440
Now his spiritual power is in chaos.

519
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:34,750
Xiu Ming.

520
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,060
Let me do it.

521
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,630
Xiu Ming.

522
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,190
How are you?

523
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:53,900
Xiu Ming.

524
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,500
I'm fine.

525
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,700
You saved me.

526
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,380
It's nothing.

527
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,170
You're welcome.

528
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,900
You're natural Golden Qilin.

529
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,370
Your primordial spirit can heal people.

530
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,280
But when you save people,

531
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,940
your primordial spirit is consumed.

532
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,460
Are you okay?

533
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,340
I'm not that weak.

534
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,380
I just consumed my primordial spirit once.

535
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,750
I'll be fine after resting for two days.

536
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,690
Relax.

537
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,890
Don't worry about me.

538
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,460
I'll be fine.

539
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,650
First Prince.

540
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,050
Things happened suddenly just now.

541
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,080
I'm sorry

542
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,260
for the unpleasant treatment.

543
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:11,080
What are you talking about?

544
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,540
Didn't Chu Kong say

545
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,650
that from now on,

546
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,480
we'll be a family?

547
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,220
Lord Protector,

548
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,800
you don't have to be so polite.

549
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,770
First Prince, you're right.

550
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,780
Although Second Prince doesn't want to reveal his identity to the six realms,

551
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:26,080
you don't have to worry about it.

552
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,260
The relationship between the Moluo Divine Clan and the Qilin Divine Clan

553
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,130
will not be affected by this.

554
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:33,040
After Empress and Second Prince get married,

555
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,770
the Moluo Divine Clan will respect Second Prince

556
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:36,950
like Empress.

557
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,810
Even though Chu Kong doesn't want to reveal his identity,

558
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:42,790
he's still the legitimate consort of the Moluo Divine Clan's empress.

559
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,740
I'm afraid

560
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,290
he'll still be the Qilin Divine Clan's clan leader.

561
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,490
First Prince.

562
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:57,990
What's wrong?

563
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,220
Lord Protector.

564
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,450
It's a great honor

565
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,890
for the Qilin Divine Clan and Chu Kong

566
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,360
to get so much love

567
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,220
from the Moluo Divine Clan and Empress.

568
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:12,840
First Prince.

569
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,940
You're too modest.

570
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,040
Empress and Second Prince

571
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,680
are a perfect match.

572
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,090
Yes.

573
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,080
I heard

574
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,690
that you have twins

575
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,700
and that they were born sickly.

576
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:36,510
I got a bottle of elixirs by chance

577
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,060
from elsewhere.

578
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,860
It's useless for me to keep it anyway.

579
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,530
Why don't I help you

580
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,070
and give it to you?

581
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:48,600
First Prince.

582
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,770
Thank you for your kindness.

583
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,760
But...

584
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,060
To be honest,

585
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,530
Empress has given them every kind of elixir.

586
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,070
But they didn't work.

587
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,890
I've given up hope.

588
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,710
First Prince.

589
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,990
Please take the elixirs back.

590
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,220
You've tried many elixirs anyway.

591
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,470
Just try again.

592
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,860
What if

593
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,380
it works?

594
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,700
Daddy, you're back.

595
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:47,670
Daddy.

596
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,820
Look at the garland.

597
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,080
Luo.

598
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,090
Do you feel dizzy again?

599
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,350
I'm okay.

600
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,290
I'll be fine soon.

601
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,850
Don't worry, Daddy.

602
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,920
Both of your primordial spirits

603
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:08,250
have been weak since childhood.

604
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,460
You can't run freely

605
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,880
like normal children.

606
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,500
It's my fault.

607
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,389
I haven't been able to find a way to cure you.

608
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,600
Daddy.

609
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,800
Don't blame yourself.

610
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:24,120
Didn't the physician say

611
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,469
that we're just physically weak

612
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,980
and that we can't practice magic?

613
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,460
But as long as we behave ourselves,

614
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:31,810
we can also stay with you forever.

615
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,139
Daddy.

616
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,600
My brother and I will take care of ourselves.

617
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,659
Don't worry, Daddy.

618
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:57,440
You've tried many elixirs anyway.

619
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,710
Just try again.

620
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,120
What if

621
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:01,890
it works?

622
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,010
Lian.

623
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,710
Luo.

624
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,020
Let's try again, okay?

625
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,420
Here.

626
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,840
How do you feel?

627
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,670
Luo.

628
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,810
How do you feel?

629
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,830
Tell me.

630
00:35:57,390 --> 00:35:58,310
Luo.

631
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,260
Daddy.

632
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:05,070
I

633
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,580
feel much better.

634
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,660
I seem to have energy now.

635
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,750
Daddy, look.

636
00:36:17,770 --> 00:36:19,490
I can jump.

637
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,940
We can jump.

638
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,810
We can finally jump.

639
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:25,800
Great!

640
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:27,690
We can finally go out and play.

641
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
We can finally jump.

642
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,270
Daddy.

643
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,700
Look.

644
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,270
That's all for today.

645
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,180
You may leave.

646
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,110
Yes.

647
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,120
Protector, wait.

648
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,750
Empress,

649
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:09,250
what can I do for you?

650
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,800
You look unsettled today.

651
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,270
Did something happen?

652
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,300
Does it have something to do with the two kids?

653
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,030
Yes.

654
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,700
The Dixiu Divine Clan sent a new batch of elixirs.

655
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,530
I've sent someone to deliver them to your mansion.

656
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,040
Don't worry.

657
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:32,170
As long as the two kids are raised well,

658
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,450
they'll be fine.

659
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,330
Thank you, Empress.

660
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,110
Why are you so polite?

661
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,320
I've known Jin Lian and Jin Luo

662
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:44,910
since the day they were born.

663
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:47,820
By the way,

664
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,350
how is

665
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,580
Prince Xiu Ming now?

666
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,780
What happened yesterday?

667
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:58,030
He forcibly absorbed the spiritual power of herbs.

668
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:58,890
It backfired

669
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,470
and hurt his primordial spirit badly.

670
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,540
Fortunately, Chu Kong and I came there in time.

671
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,770
His soul

672
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,190
was almost destroyed.

673
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,080
In my opinion,

674
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:10,740
Prince Xiu Ming became like this

675
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:11,880
because of

676
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,330
you.
