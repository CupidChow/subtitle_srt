[Love you seven times]

00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,850
[Episode 23]

4
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:45,870
Chu Kong!

5
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,650
Chu Kong!

6
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:50,690
Do you know I did it to save you?

7
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,630
Chu Kong!

8
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:52,110
Go.

9
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,050
Chu Kong!

10
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,140
Let go!

11
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,650
Chu Kong!

12
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,080
Chu Kong!

13
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:58,450
Chu Kong!

14
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,480
Xiangyun's acting was so bad.

15
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,220
It's not even half as convincing as mine.

16
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,230
Just go.

17
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,910
Chu Kong.

18
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:32,680
This is the last thing I can do for you.

19
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,900
Chu Kong.

20
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,800
I know you

21
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,490
took the risk to poison the princess for my own good.

22
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:38,910
Brother.

23
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,630
I just...

24
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,500
Just go.

25
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,420
Lanterns for sale.

26
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,800
Lanterns for sale.

27
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,200
She didn't get suspicious of you, did she?

28
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,260
You don't have to worry

29
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,820
about my acting at all.

30
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:24,720
Your Divinity.

31
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,070
When did you find out

32
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,550
her identity is very suspicious?

33
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,820
If I'm not mistaken,

34
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,860
she should be a spy sent by the state of Wei.

35
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,440
A few days ago,

36
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,100
when I was searching the mansion,

37
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,530
I accidentally found the princess's last letter.

38
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,750
Xinran was mentioned in that letter,

39
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,190
so I paid extra attention to her.

40
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:46,370
As expected, I found that there was something fishy about her.

41
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,950
Besides that,

42
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,920
I also found a fake military report

43
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,860
in General's study.

44
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,470
General must have discovered her identity long ago.

45
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,350
In order not to alert her,

46
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,750
he kept her by his side deliberately.

47
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,180
It's sowing discord among the enemy.

48
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,150
He wanted to send fake information to the state of Wei

49
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,460
through Xinran.

50
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,630
Xinran has taken the fake military report with her.

51
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,990
I've sent someone to follow her.

52
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,990
Now every move of hers

53
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,220
is in the palm of our hand.

54
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,260
Who was it?

55
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:35,170
Here you are.

56
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,020
Be more careful next time.

57
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,700
Got it.

58
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:41,060
Let's go play over there.

59
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,780
Mr. Grievance

60
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,540
herds the cows.

61
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,020
He walks the cows at 9 p.m. every day.

62
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,020
The cow headbutted the grain warehouse and the maize is roasted.

63
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,900
His parents want him to switch to fishing.

64
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,700
Mr. Grievance went into the water to gather the fishing net...

65
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,450
Where did these kids come from

66
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,290
in the middle of the night?

67
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,990
Saying

68
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:06,380
fishing and herding cows.

69
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,700
Things like that.

70
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:09,900
It was just nonsense.

71
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,770
It didn't even rhyme.

72
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,730
Protector.

73
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,860
Our people reported that

74
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,560
they met someone who looks exactly like Saintess

75
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,510
in the mortal world.

76
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,210
She's in the mortal world.

77
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,400
She must be with that stone goblin.

78
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,300
Do you want me to go there and search for her?

79
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,030
I'll go personally.

80
00:05:56,909 --> 00:05:58,010
This time,

81
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,660
I must get the Stone Heart of Nuwa.

82
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:28,550
I didn't expect him to come to the state of Qi so soon.

83
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,870
I can't let him find Zihui,

84
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,140
not to mention the Stone Heart.

85
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,800
Luo.

86
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,730
Do you think that I can't find you

87
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,480
since you didn't use the Power of Moluo Divine Clan

88
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,710
and held your breath?

89
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,770
Luo!

90
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:24,910
Luo!

91
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,560
How much longer are you going to hide?

92
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,540
If I hadn't come to the mortal world for tribulations

93
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,820
and recovered your primordial spirit in time,

94
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,430
you soul would have perished.

95
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,770
Stop messing around.

96
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,890
You only went through the tribulations

97
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,700
for your own life.

98
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,220
I have never forgotten

99
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,870
how you treated me.

100
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,820
Why are you acting like

101
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,980
you are my loving brother now?

102
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,980
Fine.

103
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,780
I won't argue with you about that for now.

104
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,150
Where is the stone goblin?

105
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,210
Of course he's somewhere

106
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,900
you can't find.

107
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,289
My patience for you has been used up.

108
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,580
You turned your heart blood into a puppet.

109
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,170
No wonder it was so lifelike.

110
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,860
Do you think I'm still that Jin Luo from before

111
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:07,220
who was at your disposal?

112
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,450
Don't think about controlling me anymore.

113
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,930
You want the Stone Heart?

114
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,440
Dream on!

115
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,570
Do you think you can escape from me?

116
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,940
Greetings, Your Majesty.

117
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,440
Rise.

118
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,680
I got a message from the North.

119
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,280
The state of Wei has started to collect provisions

120
00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:01,150
and send them to Licheng which borders the state of Qi secretly.

121
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,080
The battle between the state of Qi and Wei

122
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,700
has no turning back.

123
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,640
Chu Kong.

124
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,700
In ten days,

125
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,220
lead our soldiers to the North.

126
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,450
Once the state of Wei takes action,

127
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,100
you will lead the troop against the enemy as the vanguard,

128
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,630
and find out the truth of the Wei army.

129
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,530
Zhenyuan army will ambush behind you

130
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,650
and wait to hear from you.

131
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,110
This is Mother's order.

132
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:46,570
I know what you're thinking.

133
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,190
The vanguard army is outnumbered.

134
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,870
There's only a slim chance of

135
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,420
surviving this battle.

136
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,900
If this battle is to no avail,

137
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,460
not only you,

138
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,440
even I

139
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,550
am doomed.

140
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,590
I understand.

141
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,620
All right, rise.

142
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:25,090
How is Xiangyun doing lately?

143
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,060
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

144
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,630
Xiangyun has been resting at home these days.

145
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,220
She looks much better now.

146
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,270
Her Majesty often summons her to the palace

147
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,180
to play Go with her.

148
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,570
Her Majesty told her that

149
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,500
you used to play Go with her a lot too, Your Majesty.

150
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,290
I was little back then.

151
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,940
I just learned how to play Go.

152
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,840
I'd lose eight rounds

153
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,940
in ten.

154
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,320
By the way,

155
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,480
I have to remind you again.

156
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,500
The battle between the state of Qi and Wei

157
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,680
is the battle of our survival.

158
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:33,550
Chu kong.

159
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,760
Don't let me down.

160
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,460
You run away every day.

161
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,530
How many times have I caught you?

162
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,250
Is this the 86th

163
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,800
or the 87th time?

164
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,210
I've told you that

165
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,990
the people you want to see

166
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,040
are long gone.

167
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,570
Even if what you said is true,

168
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,490
that Sect Leader and Qianren have

169
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,330
passed away,

170
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,210
I still want to go back to Mount Shengling.

171
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,050
That's my home.

172
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:33,700
What a stinky and hard stone.

173
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,120
Don't you have a home?

174
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,500
I don't know who you are

175
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,760
or where you are from.

176
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,900
But you have family too, right?

177
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,380
Don't you miss them?

178
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,110
She's injured.

179
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,120
Your Divinity.

180
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,280
Bad news.

181
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,510
His Majesty summoned you to the palace.

182
00:15:05,810 --> 00:15:07,280
Was it for the matter of going into battle?

183
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,990
How do you know?

184
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,640
Did he tell you that

185
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,900
you must win this battle against the state of Wei?

186
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,100
If you lose,

187
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,920
it will the end

188
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:21,690
of his reign?

189
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,340
That's exactly what he said.

190
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:27,510
How did you suddenly

191
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,780
sort everything out?

192
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,550
When you came back from the palace that day,

193
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:33,980
I started analyzing the

194
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:35,770
relationship of interest between

195
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,700
the Empress Dowager,

196
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,130
the Emperor,

197
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,220
and the state of Wei.

198
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,080
We are now caught in a dilemma

199
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,970
among the three forces.

200
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,890
No matter what conflict the Empress Dowager and the Emperor have,

201
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,270
once the battle starts,

202
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,560
the people will suffer.

203
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,180
So I have to go into this battle.

204
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,730
And I have to win.

205
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,780
I can't bear to lose.

206
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,600
How can you go into battle now, given your condition?

207
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,300
You...

208
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,860
No.

209
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,570
If you were you and I were me,

210
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,070
it wouldn't be difficult to fight the enemy.

211
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,500
It's just that we are...

212
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,790
I can do it

213
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,530
if you help me with training.

214
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:17,190
When will you set off?

215
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,450
In ten days.

216
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:29,840
Hey.

217
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,980
Are you sure this is the right sword technique?

218
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:33,950
Yes.

219
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,460
You're a woman trapped in a man's body now.

220
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,760
The Cloud Soft Sword Technique

221
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,760
is gentle yet powerful.

222
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,200
It's perfect for you to practice.

223
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,250
This move is smooth,

224
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,540
smart, and flexible.

225
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,850
It contains...

226
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,610
You don't care about me?

227
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,470
Since ancient times, strict masters bring up accomplished disciples.

228
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,430
It's cruel and fierce on the battlefield.

229
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,870
No one will help you up then.

230
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,210
Alright.

231
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,240
Get up.

232
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,010
Strict masters bring up accomplished disciples.

233
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,680
I don't need your help.

234
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,700
I can do it.

235
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,950
Look carefully.

236
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:39,440
Is this right?

237
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:44,240
It's not bad, right?

238
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,640
Hang in there.

239
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,870
Hang in there.

240
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,600
Miss.

241
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,290
What were you sneaking around for

242
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,240
while I was dozing?

243
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,100
I thought...

244
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,450
You thought I was dead?

245
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,620
I'm not a mortal.

246
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,180
I often hold my breath

247
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,130
to heal my wounds with inner power.

248
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,960
So fussy.

249
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,690
But

250
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,770
what did you intend to do,

251
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,360
sneaking in my room?

252
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,970
Did you come up with a new way to escape?

253
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,050
No.

254
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,340
You wanted to poison me?

255
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,730
Was it sleeping potion or tendon-weakening powder?

256
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,100
What are you hiding in your sleeve?

257
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:01,780
Nothing.

258
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,610
Take it out.

259
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,020
It's really nothing.

260
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,980
Take it out.

261
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,980
Miss, it's inappropriate for men and women to make physical contact.

262
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,300
Inappropriate to make physical contact?

263
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,730
It was you who broke into my room.

264
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,530
You made it look like I was forcing you.

265
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,670
Forget it.

266
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,990
I don't want to fight with you.

267
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,090
Wait.

268
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,800
I'm here

269
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,160
to give you this.

270
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,060
Spiritual...

271
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,020
Spiritual power pearl?

272
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,400
I saw you were injured.

273
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,210
So I used my spiritual power

274
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:32,700
to make this spiritual power pearl.

275
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,380
Here you are.

276
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:42,740
It contains the power of stone goblin, which is sedative.

277
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,400
After you eat it,

278
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,130
your wound won't hurt as much.

279
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,590
Keep it for yourself.

280
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:15,480
[General's Mansion]

281
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,570
When I memorize the Art of War by heart,

282
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,560
I'll see what else you have to say.

283
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,980
Heaven signifies

284
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,700
night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.

285
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:37,320
Earth comprises distances, great and small...

286
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,870
Distances, great and small...

287
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,060
Distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.

288
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,650
Danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.

289
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,860
I know it.

290
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,740
According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.

291
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,130
According as circumstances are favorable...

292
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,120
According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.

293
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,460
According...

294
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,460
All warfare is based on deception.

295
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,560
Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable.

296
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,830
When using our forces, we must seem inactive.

297
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,020
When we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away.

298
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,730
When far away, we must make him believe we are near.

299
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,070
Strict teachers bring up accomplished disciples.

300
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,540
Stop reminding me!

301
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,440
According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.

302
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,980
All warfare is based on deception.

303
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,480
Hence, when able to attack, we must seem inactive...

304
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,620
We must seem unable.

305
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,390
You only went through the tribulations

306
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,080
for your own life.

307
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,710
From now on,

308
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:04,470
protect the Moluo Divine Clan

309
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,220
and the monarch for me.

310
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,290
Protect the Moluo Divine Clan.

311
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,240
Father,

312
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,180
I won't let you down.

313
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,500
I'll retrieve the Stone Heart

314
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,700
and await Empress Cang Hai's comeback.

315
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,400
[General's Mansion]

316
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,400
Slowly.

317
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,410
Slowly.

318
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:44,770
My son is naughty,

319
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:45,890
and he offended you.

320
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,330
Please forgive us, Your Highness.

321
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,140
It's okay.

322
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,780
Kids at this age

323
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,040
are naturally naughty.

324
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,590
You are so kind, Your Highness.

325
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,300
My son

326
00:22:56,330 --> 00:22:57,680
had a leg disease since childhood.

327
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,270
Now that he can run and jump,

328
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,970
he's so happy.

329
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,350
Thanks to the new female doctor at the suburb hospital.

330
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,040
I heard that she has excellent medical skills,

331
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:09,920
so I took my son there to try our luck.

332
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,020
Unexpectedly,

333
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,380
after three courses of treatment,

334
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,520
my son could walk on the ground.

335
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,820
Really?

336
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,840
Can she really cure all kinds of intractable diseases?

337
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:19,910
Yes.

338
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,370
But

339
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,840
she's a bit strange.

340
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,850
Not only she asks for high medical fees,

341
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,380
but she also picks the patients she treats.

342
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,170
Does she

343
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,630
have any fetish?

344
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,860
I don't know about that.

345
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,960
I heard that she's looking for

346
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,760
a ginseng that can run.

347
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:39,660
Is there really such a thing in this world?

348
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,010
It seems

349
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,720
you don't believe me.

350
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,610
Miss,

351
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,150
what is the medicine

352
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,710
you gave me?

353
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,640
Since I could save you,

354
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,040
I can kill you.

355
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,110
Miss.

356
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,190
What exactly do you

357
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,240
keep me here for?

358
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,850
Don't you want to repay my kindness?

359
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,720
Then be good.

360
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,380
From now on,

361
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,230
you can't go any further

362
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,380
than three feet away from that room.

363
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,570
Got it?

364
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,300
Yes.

365
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,450
By the way,

366
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,920
your name is not Qian Mou,

367
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,370
but Zihui.

368
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,190
There are five ways of attacking with fire.

369
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,990
The first is to burn soldiers in their camp.

370
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,920
The second is to burn stores.

371
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,810
The third is to burn baggage trains.

372
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,780
The fourth is to burn arsenals and magazines.

373
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,700
The fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.

374
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:45,210
There is a proper season for making attacks with fire,

375
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,240
and special days for starting a conflagration.

376
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,050
Do you know what season or days they are?

377
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,500
The proper season is when the weather is very dry,

378
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:55,170
and the special days are those when the moon is

379
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:57,510
in the constellations of

380
00:25:57,570 --> 00:25:58,880
the Sieve, the Wall, the Wing or the Cross-bar,

381
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,140
for these four are all days of rising wind.

382
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:00,940
By then,

383
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,640
the fire attack will achieve maximum effect with little effort.

384
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:03,890
How's that?

385
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,430
Was I correct?

386
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,810
You were correct.

387
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,400
But the flame stick's fire

388
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:11,920
is already out.

389
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,820
I...

390
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,610
I was talking to you,

391
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,260
so I didn't notice it.

392
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,700
But my sword techniques and art of war

393
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,460
are not bad, right?

394
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,080
The march and battle is a matter of life and death for our country.

395
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,060
The more confident you are,

396
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:28,470
the more worried I am.

397
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,540
I've remembered everything you said.

398
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,760
I know it's extremely cruel and fierce on the battlefield.

399
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,180
It's not only

400
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,620
about my own life and death.

401
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:40,060
I have the entire state of Qi

402
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,020
and thousands of soldiers behind me.

403
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,500
It's a matter of the people and the state.

404
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,380
I won't trifle with it.

405
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,830
I still have some time.

406
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:48,860
I'll go practice my sword techniques.

407
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:12,760
Your Highness.

408
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,210
Danger.

409
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,420
The enemy of Wei is fierce.

410
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:27,470
They are going gangbusters,

411
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,720
and they've breached Yunhai Pass.

412
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,460
I'm afraid the Qi army can't defeat them.

413
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,230
I can't let Xiangyun take this risk.

414
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:42,930
It seems

415
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,010
I have to give it a try.

416
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:50,020
Hurry up.

417
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,700
What are you doing?

418
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,770
Where are you taking me so early in the morning?

419
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,790
To switch our bodies back.

420
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,170
Why so last minute?

421
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,560
You've got an idea?

422
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,930
I received a secret report.

423
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,990
The Wei army is fierce.

424
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,310
You won't be able to defeat them.

425
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,880
If you go into battle,

426
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,330
you can hardly escape death.

427
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,570
I can't watch you take this risk.

428
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,390
There's a witch doctor in the suburbs

429
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,760
who specializes in intractable diseases.

430
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:13,840
I think

431
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,440
she should have a way.

432
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,140
[Loyalty, Righteousness, Benevolence, and Bravery]

433
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:17,460
That won't do.

434
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,860
If we switch back,

435
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,970
you'll be going into battle.

436
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,920
I can't let you take the risk.

437
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:23,940
Don't forget

438
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,070
I am the God of War.

439
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,440
No matter when we were in the Heaven Realm,

440
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,730
or when we confronted Lu Changkong,

441
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,190
I've never lost.

442
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:53,190
You must be the witch doctor

443
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,270
who can bring people back to life, right?

444
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:57,010
How did they know I'm here?

445
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,720
You two seem to be

446
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,390
from a rich family in the city.

447
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,690
How did you find me here?

448
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,470
Our butler recommended us

449
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,780
to come to see you.

450
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,630
How could their souls be switched?

451
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,280
Can you really cure

452
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,460
our disease?

453
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:37,380
If you don't believe me, why did you come here?

454
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,260
One of you is a woman trapped in a man's body,

455
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,360
and the other is a man trapped in a woman's body.

456
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,590
You just want to switch your bodies back.

457
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,740
Miss Luo, you really live up to your reputation.

458
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,160
Take the 500 taels as deposit.

459
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:01,380
If you can cure us,

460
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,050
I will give you another 500 taels after that.

461
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,740
I can't cure this disease.

462
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,000
Please leave.

463
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,220
Doctor Luo, please wait.

464
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,580
Sparrow Head Ginseng.

465
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,610
Why do you have it?

466
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:23,850
Take this Sparrow Head Ginseng

467
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,590
as the way we repay you.

468
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:30,990
It can help him recover quickly.

469
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,250
But...

470
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,340
I can agree to take you in.

471
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,160
But

472
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,930
you must follow my rules.

473
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,000
Of course.

474
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,690
First, you can't leave the alchemy room

475
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,160
without my permission.

476
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,690
Second, you can't make loud noise.

477
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,310
Since we're sincere about the treatment,

478
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,820
we will follow these rules.

479
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:55,120
I'll get the medicine ready.

480
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,260
Wait for me here.

481
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,020
How long do you plan to keep me here?

482
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:14,320
I've told you.

483
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,090
There's miasma outside.

484
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,850
You'll get poisoned if you go out, given your condition.

485
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,240
In that case,

486
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:23,910
why doesn't it affect you?

487
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,850
I am a fairy.

488
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,540
Of course the miasma can't do anything to me.

489
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,370
By the way,

490
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:32,500
I've put a mute spell on this room.

491
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,190
Nothing can be heard from the outside.

492
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,090
So,

493
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,200
don't try to pull anything.

494
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,460
Take the medicine.

495
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,130
You...

496
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,870
Eat something.

497
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,500
No need.

498
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,960
Luo told me to fast,

499
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,470
or it'll affect the efficacy of the medicine.

500
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,280
So why don't I have to fast?

501
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,450
Maybe the anatomies of men and women are different.

502
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:20,820
Let me do it.

503
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,550
No need.

504
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,110
This medicine needs to be brewed for 20 hours.

505
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,840
Otherwise, all our efforts will be in vain.

506
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,540
Go open the window.

507
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,010
This voice...

508
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,060
It's Sect Leader.

509
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,920
Mute spell.

510
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,390
No.

511
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,140
I have to find a way.

512
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,870
What's with all the noise?

513
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,760
It's just a bit too smoky.

514
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,050
Is the medicine alright?

515
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,030
Put it down.

516
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,940
Who gave you permission to open the window?

517
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,610
It's been centuries

518
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,740
since I brought you back from Mount Shengling.

519
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,380
Those mortals you want to see

520
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,740
died long ago.

521
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:52,720
Didn't she say all the people of Shengling Sect are dead?

522
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,550
Then why

523
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,380
is Sect Leader here?

524
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,950
What is this for?

525
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,130
Drip your blood into the other person's bowl.

526
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,120
Your bodies will be switched back

527
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,389
after taking this medicine.

528
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,600
Are we really going to take it?

529
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,130
A bit sweet.

530
00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:37,020
Your...

531
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,260
Xiangyun.

532
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:14,640
Xiangyun.

533
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,100
We are switched back.

534
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,360
Are you okay?

535
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,430
What's wrong?

536
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,240
It's Shengling Sect's hand gesture.

537
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:03,910
Could there be a disciple imprisoned here?

538
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,220
Who could it be?

539
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,100
It's been centuries since Shengling Sect was dismantled.

540
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,300
Qian Mou is immortal.

541
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,340
Could it be he heard the sound

542
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,490
and he was asking us for help?

543
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,310
You two are switched back.

544
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,410
Yes.

545
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,230
Thank you, Miss Luo.

546
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,410
Since you've switched back,

547
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:35,730
please leave.

548
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,900
Pardon me for not asking you to stay.

549
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,340
Wait a moment.

550
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,460
We'll go get the Sparrow Head Ginseng from the carriage.

551
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,000
We have to find a way to send her away or...

552
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,800
Knock her out.

553
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:09,980
You...

554
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,430
Doctor Luo.

555
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,400
Doctor Luo.

556
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:27,750
Let's go.

557
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,570
Go find Zihui.

558
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,120
Zihui!

559
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,340
Sect Leader.

560
00:37:49,930 --> 00:37:50,770
Xiaoxiang.

561
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,320
Is it good?

562
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,630
I specially went down the mountain to buy this for you.

563
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,430
Thank you, Senior Mou.

564
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:10,570
Sect Leader.

565
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,390
I'm here to help you.

566
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,120
Sect Leader.

567
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,090
I thought I would never see you again.

568
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,780
Don't worry.

569
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,680
With Chu Kong here,

570
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,160
we'll get you out of here.

571
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:35,190
Let's talk some other time.

572
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,420
Luo will wake up anytime.

573
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:38,810
Let's leave here first.

574
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,360
She put a magical barrier here.

575
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,150
We can't get out

576
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,180
if we can't get rid of this formation.

577
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,680
What should we do?

578
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,380
Do you have any idea?

579
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,030
Neither of us has any power now.

580
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,160
Unless the formation maker is dead,

581
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:04,940
or the formation is removed itself,

582
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,150
there's no other way.

583
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,720
It's just a bloody formation.

584
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,020
I'll just remove her flag.

585
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:09,380
Xiangyun.

586
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,240
You can't.

587
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,790
The vine is poisonous.

588
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,760
You think you can escape

589
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,040
with such clumsy tricks?

590
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,180
Who are you?

591
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,830
Why did you imprison Zihui here?

592
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:21,920
What does it have to do with you?

593
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,870
He's our friend.

594
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,940
We must take him away today no matter what.
