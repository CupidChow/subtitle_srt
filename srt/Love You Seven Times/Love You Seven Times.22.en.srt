Do I look good?

9
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,400
Yes, you do.

10
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,060
When His Divinity comes,

11
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,850
he will definitely be mesmerized by you.

12
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,840
I am incompetent.

13
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,100
Please punish me.

14
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:41,540

15
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:42,460
Get up and speak.

16
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,050
Your Holiness,

17
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,570
you asked me to bring a message to Xiaoyun Palace.

18
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:50,260
I have been there a few times,

19
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,730
but was stopped at the door by Immortal Qian.

20
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,260
He stopped you?

21
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,380
Don't even mention about passing the message,

22
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,990
I couldn't even reach the doors of Xiaoyun Palace.

23
00:02:59,340 --> 00:02:59,820
How could Qian

24
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,540
not know that

25
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,380
I am working for you?

26
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,000
You mean...

27
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,450
he didn't mean to stop you,

28
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,770
but it was aimed at me instead?

29
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,210
I...

30
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,320
I didn't mean that.

31
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,060
I...

32
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,050
You may not know,

33
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:20,980
but Immortal Qian

34
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,170
has gotten arrogant

35
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,780
because of his service as the God of War.

36
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,140
These days, he is even in frequent contact with the Marriage Pavilion.

37
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,020
Such a social butterfly, isn't he?

38
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,340
Your Holiness,

39
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:32,829
logically speaking,

40
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,940
the Four Great Heaven Kings are supposed to be on equal footing.

41
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,860
But in reality, others do compare in private.

42
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,380
Look, in the whole Heaven Realm,

43
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,300
you're the only one who is...

44
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,510
So, I'll always...

Alright, say no more.

You're making me dizzy.

But why is His Divinity

53

still not here by this hour?

54
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,980
Did something happen?

55
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,329
Or did he oversleep?

56
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,260
Or did he simply forget about it?

57
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:23,900
It has only been half an incense stick.

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,260
usually comes half a day earlier.

After you returned from your tribulation,

65
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,140
I sent people to invite you over and over again,

66
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,140
but you didn't come.

67
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,290
Why is it so?

68
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,080
Do you have

69
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:58,620
any grievances against me?

70
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,700

00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,340
You actually died

75

for Xiangyun in this tribulation.

76
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,580
Yes, I did.

77
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,780
Then, do you know that

78
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,220
your primordial spirit has suffered a great deal of damage because of this?

79
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,020
Everything that you have gained in the previous two tribulations

80
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,460
has been completely nulified.

81
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,780
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

82
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,940
Every time when Xiangyun returns from a tribulation,

83
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,700
there will be a physician to check her pulse.

84
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,890
If Xiangyun died for me during the tribulation,

85
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,180
her primordial spirit will be damaged.

86
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,950
If this goes on for a long time,

87
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,220
she might perish.

88
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,870
She can help you restore your primordial spirit,

89
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,150
and you can achieve the great cause of killing the devil.

90
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,740
It will be a worthy death.

91
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,140
I didn't tell you

92
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,540
because I was worried that

93
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,900
your kindness

94
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,100
might hold up the bigger task at hand.

95
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,050
I didn't expect it either.

96
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,140
I didn't think that I would end up

97
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,010
needing to sacrifice an immortal,

98
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:39,670
before I can fight Cang Hai.

99
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,930
Chu Kong,

100
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,540
one person alone is less important than

101
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,740
the rest of the world.

102
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,640
What will the people think

103
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,750
if they knew about what happened?

104
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,270
How different are your actions

105
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:58,220
from Cang Hai?

106
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,500
Chu Kong!

107
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,460
Your Divinity,

108
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,340
when I was getting some tea,

109
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,230
I ran into Fuyuan Fairy,

110
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:16,640
who was leaving in a hurry.

111
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,900
Your Divinity.

112
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,540
Red Thread Master,

113
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,020
is Xiangyun here?

114
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,820
Xiangzi just stepped out.

115
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:33,220
Thank you.

116
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:34,980
Wait a minute, Your Divinity.

117
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,550
I...

118
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,540
I just have a question.

119
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,980
I wonder if you

120
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,540
sincerely have feelings for Xiangyun?

121
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,130
Of course I have.

122
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,090
The God of War has a formidable reputation,

123
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,380
while Xiangzi is just a lowly immortal.

124
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,900
I can see that

125
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,020
you're sincere from your response.

126
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,020
But, I am just wondering

127
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,340
how long can these feelings last.

128
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:09,770
I plan to

129
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,780
to cast the Soul-protecting Spell onto Xiangyun.

130
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,100
Soul-protecting Spell?

131
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:19,340
According to ancient history,

132
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,160
the Soul-protecting Spell

133
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,060
is a supreme protection spell

134
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,540
that is casted by one onto another's primordial spirit.

135
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,740
If the receiver's primordial spirit is damaged,

136
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,890
90% of the damage will be transferred to the caster.

137
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,100
Even when one goes through tribulations,

138
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:35,820
it won’t be broken.

139
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,950
This is

140
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,850
my promise of a lifetime to Xiangyun.

141
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,200
I'm relieved

142
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,700
to hear this from you.

143
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,580
Goodbye.

144
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,620
All's good.

145
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,780
Xiangyun,

146
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,230
I'm sorry.

147
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,930
I didn't know we're sharing the same source of primordial spirit.

148
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,440
The restoration of my primordial spirit

149
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,180
was at the expense of your primordial spirit.

150
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,820
I was careless.

151
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,460
If you have any complaints,

152
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,370
just tell me.

153
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,580
I have experienced three cycles of tribulation in the mortal world with you.

154
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,580
Would it not be

155
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,980
too foolish of me,

156
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,460
if I were to misunderstand you

157
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,500
after everything we have been through?

158
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,580
Although

159
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:15,310
I don't know why we have the same source of primordial spirit,

160
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,780
I know you will never hurt me.

161
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,460
You gave me the Linglong heart

162
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,620
not only to cure my heart disease,

163
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,100
but also to restore my primordial spirit.

164
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,670
That's what I'm supposed to do.

165
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,920
Because...

166
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:36,110
I can't bear to let you sacrifice yourself for me.

167
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,820
But Your Divinity, if you want to fight the devil

168
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,340
and protect the people of the six realms,

169
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,640
what should we do

170
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,100
if the primordial spirit cannot be fully restored,

171
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,270
and we are unable to save the world?

172
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:48,600
If I have to sacrifice the woman I love

173
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,140
to save the world,

174
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,930
what kind of God of War am I?

175
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,400
But...

176
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,340
There will definitely be a way.

177
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,410
Trust me.

178
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,700
If one takes green oxalis as medication,

179
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,610
it can help restore and purify,

180
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,680
It can remove the Doom Mark.

181
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,270
Your Holiness!

182
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,380
Your Holiness,

183
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,590
you asked to see me?

184
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,100
You are here.

185
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,240
Your Holiness,

186
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:38,870
what's wrong?

187
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,620
Are you hurt?

188
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,420
It must have been from that time

189
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:43,680
when I was fighting the Moluo Divine Clan

190
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,180
in the celestial region.

191
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,430
I have yet to

192
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:49,460
fully recover since.

193
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:50,620
Well then,

194
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,410
I'll go and find a physician for you right now.

195
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,660
Have you heard of

196
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,300
green oxalis?

197
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,540
Green oxalis?

198
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,440
I... I am just a military officer.

199
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,620
With regards to plants and flowers, I only know to care for them.

200
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,910
I... I don't fully understand them.

201
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,800
I just read a book.

202
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,960
It said that green oxalis is an antidote

203
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:14,680
that can cure burns from the Moluo Divine Clan's spells.

204
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,700
Your Holiness,

205
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,580
do you know

206
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:22,420
where I can find this green oxalis?

207
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,580
It is a sacred insect that grows in

208
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,820
in the Far East Valley of the Heaven Realm.

209
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,820
It got its name because

210
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,910
it is agile and sensitive,

211
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,320
and greenish-blue in appearance.

212
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,580
Don't worry, Your Holiness.

213
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,820
I will go and find

214
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,680
this medicine for you right now.

215
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:55,710
Have you made a wish?

216
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,310
You have to make a wish on your birthday.

217
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,800
Close your eyes. Hurry.

218
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,640
I, Chu Kong,

219
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,580
in the name of the Qilin Divine Clan,

220
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,600
calls upon the primordial spirit of the Star of War,

221
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:22,870
to protect the one I love.

222
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,230
The Soul-protecting Spell failed.

223
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:46,860
I...

224
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,820
What Soul-protecting Spell?

225
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,660
It's a family tradition of our Qilin Divine Clan,

226
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,380
that has been passed down from generation to generation.

227
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,680
If you have decided on someone

228
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:00,370
as your lifelong partner,

229
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,470
then you can plant a unique Soul-protecting Spell

230
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,270
on her primordial spirit.

231
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,500
This was the birthday gift

232
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,420
I planned on giving you.

233
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,340
Perhaps it's because your primordial spirit has been damaged.

234
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,340
That's why...

235
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,430
It's okay.

236
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,700
I'm already very touched.

237
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,890
That won't do.

238
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,400
I have to plant the Soul-protecting Spell onto you,

239
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,030
so as to ensure that your primordial spirit is safe.

240
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:30,010
Only then can I go to the Mortal Realm with you in peace.

241
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:31,700
I'll try again.

242
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:32,660
All right.

243
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,620
Don't you want to know

244
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,700
what wish I made?

245
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,740
My wish is

246
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,600
to be with you every day.

247
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:43,150
Just like today,

248
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,580
I hope we could be carefree

249
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,680
and rely upon each other.

250
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,980
I'd still like to wish you a happy birthday.

251
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,280
Please forgive me, Lord Protector.

252
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,410
I'll cut off my clumsy hands now.

253
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Please spare my life.

254
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,670
You may leave.

255
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,880
I want to be alone.

256
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,180
Thank you.

257
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,740
We are

258
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,820
Shengling's Dynamic Duo.

259
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,180
Lord Protector,

260
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,360
I’ve gathered my men

261
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,540
to thoroughly search Mount Shengling,

262
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,190
but we couldn't find the Nuwa Stone.

263
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,740
Luo,

264
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,350
you took him away, didn't you?

265
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,670
Goddess of Fate,

266
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,050
is Li

267
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:50,950
back?

268
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:52,450
No, he is not.

269
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,420
But, I found this instead.

270
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:57,590
He has already written the Fate Book for the both of you.

271
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,880
[Record of Tribulation of the General and Princess]

272
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,720
He has written it?

273
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,740
So if you and Chu Kong want to go to the Mortal Realm for your tribulation,

274
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,540
you guys can do it anytime.

275
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:05,970
Strange.

276
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,579
Li has always been lazy.

277
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,380
How could he have written the Fate Book in advance?

278
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,180
Well, an immortal has to mature someday, right?

279
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,690
Take a look.

280
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:21,380
Strange.

281
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,880
Why did Li finish writing the Fate Book in advance?

282
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,900
I also found out about something strange.

283
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:27,130
Look here.

284
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,180
The Fate Book of Shengling Sect from that time

285
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,680
is still incomplete?

286
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,210
It is written up till the moment where I gave you the Linglong Heart.

287
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,760
The ending where I jumped from the cliff has been torn off.

288
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,980
Two days ago,

289
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,810
I went to ask about changing fates.

290
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,670
After Immortal Li went missing,

291
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,530
I found out that

292
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,220
the last few pages of the Fate Book of Shengling Sect

293
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,030
was torn off.

294
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,460
At that time, His Divinity and Fuyuan Fairy's

295
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,290
tribulation with the Shengling Sect

296
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,660
hasn't come to an end.

297
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,690
In other words,

298
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,440
Immortal Li tore the blank pages in advance.

299
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,180
Yes.

300
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,430
Isn't it strange?

301
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,880
But Li once told me

302
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,380
he wanted to write your experiences into a novel,

303
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,420
and sell them in the six realms.

304
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,000
Could it be that

305
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,360
he did so in order to avoid

306
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,230
giving away the ending in advance?

307
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,840
[Life of the Master and Disciple at Shengling Sect]

308
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,580
It's Scholarly Heaven King's duty to safeguard the Fate Books.

309
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,040
He can't hide the ending and tear away the last few pages

310
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,880
just to make a quick buck.

311
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,630
Li is not that kind of person.

312
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:42,110
So at that time, the situation should be that

313
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:44,860
Immortal Li had to leave.

314
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,180
So, he had no choice but to

315
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,030
write down the details of the ending with the Shengling Sect

316
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,260
onto the Fate Book.

317
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,900
Yang Xiaoxiang used the power of Linglong Heart

318
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,020
to kill Xu Wenrui.

319
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,010
She then jumped off the cliff with her Master's body.

320
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,420
What's there to hide with such an ending?

321
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,590
After I asked about changing fates,

322
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,780
I found it even weirder.

323
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,220
So I sent people

324
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,620
to look for Immortal Li in the six realms.

325
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:06,720
What's the result?

326
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:08,850
We have yet to yield anything,

327
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,200
but calm down.

328
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,310
Let's wait for a few more days.

329
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,250
Your Divinity,

330
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,990
tell me, is he hiding on purpose?

331
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,890
In the past, he loved playing

332
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,630
crossword puzzles with me.

333
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,540
He must have left some clues

334
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,040
and is waiting for us to find him.

335
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,290
What kind of clues could he have left behind?

336
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,000
This is the Fate Book of the next tribulation.

337
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,720
There's something fishy about this Fate Book.

338
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,380
It starts only after we come of age.

339
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,420
We have to personally go through the tribulation

340
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,620
in order to find clues.

341
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,200
That's not going to work.

342
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,410
Until I manage to plant the Soul-protecting Spell on you

343
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,030
and make sure your primordial spirit is safe,

344
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,700
I am not going to the mortal world to experience the tribulation with you.

345
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,610
But Li is the kind of person

346
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,880
that would lay down at every given opportunity,

347
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,140
and slack off at work if he could.

348
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,220
How could he write have written

349
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:53,350
all the tribulations' Fate Books before traveling?

350
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,280
Something is fishy.

351
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,600
I said no.

352
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,720
Just listen to me on this.

353
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:31,410
[Marriage Pavilion]

354
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:27,290
Li,

355
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,120
others may not understand you,

356
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,790
but I do.

357
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,740
You won't disappear for no reason.

358
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,300
Li,

359
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,070
you mustn't get into trouble.

360
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,140
No,

361
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,100
you must be hiding something.

362
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,510
Is the clue

363
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,380
really hidden in the next tribulation?

364
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,240
Your Divinity,

365
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:54,010
you're here.

366
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:54,780
Nonsense!

367
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,460
Your Divinity,

368
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,200
we've been back for days,

369
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,180
but we haven't seen Li.

370
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,180
I have a bad feeling.

371
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,700
I will tell you immediately

372
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,720
once I have any news of Immortal Li.

373
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,760
Of course, I hope Li is just traveling in the Mortal Realm.

374
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,990
But if something has happened to him,

375
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,470
the longer we delay,

376
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,810
the more dangerous he will be.

377
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,650
All right.

378
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,760
Don’t move anymore.

379
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,950
Come to me first.

380
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:29,320
Let's discuss exactly what we would do.

381
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,470
If the situation reverses,

382
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,950
Li will risk his life for me.

383
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,070
Your Divinity,

384
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,490
this time,

385
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,300
take it as my willfulness.

386
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,080
Xiangyun!

387
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,540
It hurts.

388
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,590
It hurts... so much.

389
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,610
Why was I stabbed?

390
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:19,670
Why does this hand look like a man's?

391
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,760
[Princess of the State of Qi, Xiangyun]

392
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,620
[General of the State of Qi, Chu Kong]

393
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,460
Your... Divinity?

394
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,810
Xiangyun?

395
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,980
No way!

396
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,140
I...I...

397
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,370
Xiang... Xiangyun,

398
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,600
are you alright?

399
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,250
Xiangyun!

400
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,210
Don't close your eyes.

401
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,220
If you are going to be like this,

402
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:51,980
your primordial spirit be damaged

403
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,170
when we return to the Imperial Court.

404
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,420
Don't ever close your eyes.

405
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:54,990
Xiangyun,

406
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,060
I'll get you a physician.

407
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,180
Help!

408
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,130
Help, anybody?

409
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,320
This time, we got the male and female bodies wrong.

410
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,820
I'm afraid there will be more trouble in time to come.

411
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,940
[General's Mansion]

412
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,540
I didn't expect

413
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,100
I am actually pretty cute

414
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,880
in your eyes.

415
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,200
Alright.

416
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,380
Let's get down to business.

417
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,780
As you can see,

418
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,860
we...

419
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,170
might have switched bodies this time.

420
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:08,090
Go on.

421
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,090
You see, the General and the Princess

422
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,880
seem to have a bad relationship.

423
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,200
But for some reason,

424
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,740
I feel terrible.

425
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,060
I feel giddy,

426
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,700
and I am having abdominal cramps

427
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:23,650
in this body.

428
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,060
According to my deduction, she could have been poisoned.

429
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,610
Were you the one behind the poison?

430
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,860
Me?

431
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,870
I'm just speculating here.

432
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,660
I observed your wound.

433
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,140
The Princess

434
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,180
dealt an almost fatal hand.

435
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,360
Exactly...

436
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,090
how much hatred is there?

437
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,180
Could it be that...

438
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:50,040
my magical prowess

439
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,800
affected the Mortal World Well,

440
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:53,500
causing misalignment of the yin and yang?

441
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,930
Did the immortal named Jiu Lu

442
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,600
wrote a solution in the Fate Book?

443
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,030
I remember Li once mentioned a solution.

444
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,070
It's...

445
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,190
Are you sure?

446
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:28,270
Li said so anyway.

447
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,170
Things are already like this.

448
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,760
Why don't we try every possible solution?

449
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,620
No.

450
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,860
I can’t get over the fact that

451
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,380
I am facing my own face.

452
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,690
Let me try.

453
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:19,010
Why don't you close your eyes?

454
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,110
General!

455
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,290
General!

456
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,130
General...

457
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:40,270
Are... are you alright?

458
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,260
General?

459
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,140
No, General...

460
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,020
Don't you come over.

461
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,060
What is it?

462
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,700
His Majesty has summoned you to the palace.

463
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:04,640
I see.

464
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,430
You and Xiangyun have been quite deeply in love lately.

465
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,500
I just wanted to ask...

466
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,760
[Emperor of the State of Qi, Qi Zhi]

467
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:50,060
How dare you let Xiangyun get pregnant?

468
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,920
What does this mean?

469
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,200
Chu Kong,

470
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,130
you have promised me previously.

471
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:56,910
I...

472
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,270
What did I do?

473
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,770
I...

474
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,220
I acknowledge my mistake.

475
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,250
I just...

476
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:14,890
Let's just... make up an excuse now to deal with it.

477
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,200
I made a mistake after drinking.

478
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,750
Forget it.

479
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,990
I won't hold you accountable anymore.

480
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,080
But Chu Kong you must remember,

481
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,780
you swore an oath of allegiance to me.

482
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,990
I would not want to see

483
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:38,670
such a mistake ever again.

484
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,140
It seems that my relationship with the Emperor

485
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,220
is quite exceptional.

486
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,250
I...

487
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,260
will bear it in mind.

488
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,700
Rise.

489
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,050
Don't mess around.

490
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,590
Watch out, my Scale Nine Peaks will hurt you.

491
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,990
Is it a clue left by Li?

492
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,540
Since you're here,

493
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,160
play a game or two with me.

494
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,380
Strange.

495
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,770
How could there be no clue?

496
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,750
[Last Pen]

497
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,980
Suicide note?

498
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,610
So the Princess is not feeling well

499
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,100
because of her pregnancy.

500
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,430
A few days ago,

501
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,570
the General brought back a woman named Xinran.

502
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,560
Not long after, the Princess lost her baby.

503
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,040
In a fit of grief and indignation, she believe that

504
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:16,560
it was the General who has moved on to Xinran,

505
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,960
and poisoned her with an abortion pill.

506
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,260
That's why she hated him so much,

507
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,220
and almost died together.

508
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,200
It seems that something is very wrong with Xinran.

509
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,190
I must not alert her for now.

510
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,520
And there's still Mother,

511
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,380
and Brother.

512
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,360
I see.

513
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,110
Your Majesty,

514
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,500
is there another piece

515
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,790
to your jade pendant?

516
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,400
And on it, there's a carving

517
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,370
of the Nine Peaks?

518
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,460
Why do you ask when you already know the answer?

519
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,700
I just forgot for a moment

520
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,420
what was written on it.

521
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,170
Scale Nine Peaks.

522
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,620
When the late emperor founded the country,

523
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,380
he dreamt of an immortal

524
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,820
using a move called Scale Nine Peaks.

525
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,510
The next day,

526
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,860
the late emperor won a crucial battle

527
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,460
and managed to rule the country.

528
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,090
The immortal showed the way.

529
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,390
The late emperor had a great dream.

530
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:43,140
Indeed.

531
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:45,560
The late emperor got someone

532
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,990
to make two carved jade pendants.

533
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,280
It's a token of royalty, and it has been passed down for generations.

534
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,800
This side of the jade pendant, bearing the Scale Waves,

535
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:56,400
signifies the right to mobilize the elite Imperial Guards in the capital.

536
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,170
As for the other piece,

537
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:05,490
even I have never seen it before.

538
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,330
Why is that so?

539
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,220
The Nine Peaks is not just a token.

540
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,590
It's also the bloodline of the Duan family,

541
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,040
who is Mother's clan.

542
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,160
Those who get to see the Nine Peaks is like seeing the tiger's talisman.

543
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,650
It signifies that Duan's 100,000 Zhenyuan army

544
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,750
will listen to his orders.

545
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,470
Eat slowly.

546
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,260
Okay.

547
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,690
Did you get any useful information

548
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,900
when you met with the Emperor?

549
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:50,460
Yes.

550
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:52,140
I found out that there are two jade pendants

551
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,220
that are of great importance to the state of Qi.

552
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,530
The Scale Waves and Nine Peaks are engraved respectively onto the pendants.

553
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:56,940
I think this is the hint

554
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,020
that Li left us.

555
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,540
If we combine the two jade pendants into one,

556
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,050
we might be able to find the answer.

557
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:07,370
The Emperor only has one piece.

558
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,620
The other piece is in the Empress Dowager's hands.

559
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,520
Even the emperor has never seen it before.

560
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,750
The Empress Dowager

561
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,510
is controlling half of Qi

562
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,940
by virtue of her mother's clan, the Duan Clan.

563
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,840
But she only has Xiangyun as her only daughter.

564
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,740
The current emperor

565
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,530
was adopted by her.

566
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,950
Empress Dowager's maternal clan is strong and powerful.

567
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:28,890
The Emperor has been

568
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,240
governing from behind the curtains since he was young.

569
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,490
But now, the Emperor is able to govern himself.

570
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,830
However, the Empress Dowager refuses to give up her power.

571
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,370
Instead, she has been hoping for her daughter

572
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,800
to give birth to an heir soon.

573
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,680
Once the Princess is pregnant,

574
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,270
regardless whether it is a boy or girl,

575
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:44,730
it will be a boy.

576
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,710
And this boy

577
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,690
will take over the position of the current emperor.

578
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,320
The General swore to be loyal to the Emperor.

579
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,360
So he deliberately neglected the princess

580
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,540
on the orders of the Emperor,

581
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,800
in order to prevent her from giving birth to a heir.

582
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,320
The Emperor and the Empress Dowager are going head-on against each other.

583
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,780
How can we merge the two jade pendants?

584
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:03,980
I have an idea

585
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,510
which we can try.

586
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,350
What is it?

587
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,410
Just listen to me.

588
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,290
Your Holiness,

589
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,440
I found this green oxalis

590
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,860
after scouring through

591
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:26,330
the entire Far East Valley.

592
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:27,780
By the way,

593
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,770
the boy guarding the valley also said

594
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
that this sacred insect

595
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:33,429
only consumes dew in its entire lifetime.

596
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:34,659
It's extremely pure,

597
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,949
and when used as a medicine, and has a restorative and purifying effect.

598
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,670
Even the

599
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,540
the Heavenly Divine Oracle's spells can be removed.

600
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,980
It should not be a problem to

601
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:49,139
cure your burns from the Moluo Divine Clan's spells.

602
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:53,870
Thank you

603
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,920
for making this trip.

604
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:57,790
Not at all.

605
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,070
It's my pleasure.

606
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:02,550
I will take the medicine diligently.

607
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,620
[General's Mansion]

608
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,580
Cui Bi,

609
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,140
the Princess and General want to see you.

610
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,020
They want to see me?

611
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,120
Chu Kong.

612
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,750
Xin'er,

613
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,180
since the General has accepted you as his sister,

614
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,860
we are now a family.

615
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:03,280
Come.

616
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:03,990
Have a seat.

617
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,350
Thank you, Xiangyun.

618
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:09,060
I heard that you summoned me to the palace.

619
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,760
Since you want to enter the palace,

620
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,020
you must dress up nicely.

621
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,480
Your lips look pale.

622
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,920
Why don't you apply some color?

623
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,970
Chu Kong...

624
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,540
Why are you calling me?

625
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,370
Just do as she says.

626
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,340
Ever since I was pregnant,

627
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,490
I have been feeling tightness in my chest.

628
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,440
So I asked the General to get a physician,

629
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,760
who prescribed me some medicine to stabilize my pregnancy.

630
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,620
But on one day half a month ago,

631
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,900
after taking the medicine,

632
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,950
I had unrelenting abdominal pain,

633
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,110
and lost the fetus.

634
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,340
Do you know about this?

635
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,370
Yes, I have heard.

636
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,160
I asked someone to check the prescription

637
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,120
and the residual dregs,

638
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,300
and they turned out fine.

639
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,700
But...

640
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:32,690
this lipstick which I have been using everyday...

641
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,260
When I saw you dabbing on the lipstick just now,

642
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,290
you were very cautious,

643
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:42,920
and only dared to dab on a little bit.

644
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,410
Could it be that

645
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,560
you know

646
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,580
what's behind this mystery?

647
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,380
What is it, Xinran?

648
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,200
How could I know?

649
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,020
Mercury has been added into this.

650
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,300
Mercury?

651
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,460
Is that why

652
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,620
you have been experiencing headaches, ringing ears and poor complexion everyday?

653
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,920
And even miscarried?

654
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,440
Who could be so vicious,

655
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,200
Xinran?

656
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,420
I, Xinran, never did this.

657
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,670
If you don't believe me,

658
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,730
you can search my room.

659
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,860
There is definitely no mercury.

660
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,950
Mercury is difficult to store.

661
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,010
It needs to be made by extracting cinnabar from a garnet jar.

662
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,020
If I were you,

663
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,350
I will definitely destroy all the equipment

664
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,350
after extracting the mercury.

665
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:43,720
What's the point of

666
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,420
searching your room now?

667
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,510
So, on what basis do you suspect Xinran?

668
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:53,030
You can't be

669
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:56,000
framing someone for no reason.

670
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,160
Summon Mr. Zhang.

671
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,760
[Maid Cui Bi]

672
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:03,890
Yes.

673
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,020
Greetings, General.

674
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,620
Greetings, Princess.

675
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,460
I, Zhang Xiaocong,

676
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,160
is the shopkeeper of Zhang's Silverware Shop.

677
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,280
A month ago,

678
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:26,430
this lady

679
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,900
bought a garnet can in my shop.

680
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,360
You're talking nonsense!

681
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,750
What nonsense?

682
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,450
A garnet can is used to distillate.

683
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,200
Only alchemists will buy it.

684
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,140
You're just a little girl. Why would you need a garnet can?

685
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:36,820
It was very strange,

686
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,230
so I remembered it clearly.

687
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:43,810
Yes.

688
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,110
Chu Kong...

689
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,820
Xinran,

690
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:53,330
how have I been treating you?

691
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,990
Why did you kill

692
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,800
the unborn child?

693
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,380
Indeed,

694
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,800
the human heart is not what it was used to be,

695
00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:05,150
and the world is getting worse.

696
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,950
Good people will not be rewarded.

697
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,270
Fang, lock her up.

698
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:15,870
Yes.

699
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,070
Chu Kong!

700
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,090
Please spare me.

701
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,580
It was just a moment of foolishness.

702
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,330
Chu Kong!

703
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,350
Chu Kong!

704
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:23,890
Did you know

705
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,510
I did that to save you?

706
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,460
Chu Kong!

707
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,780
Chu Kong!
