Not to mention the fact that the world currently does not belong to Prince Ning,

41
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,550
but even if it is,

to hold back Prince Ning within the palace.

192
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:27,780
Father,

193
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,980
Commander Song must be drunk

194
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,280
and have started talking nonsense.

195
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,060
Please

196
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,440
forgive him.

197
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,350
I'm not talking nonsense.

198
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,390
I've never been as sober as I am now.

199
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,980
Today, I want to reveal the wolf that you are

200
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,220
in court,

201
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,730
and in front of everyone.

202
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,900
Commander Song,

203
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,180
you must have been instigated by a snitch

204
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,560
in order for you to be this relentless.

205
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,990
If you have a clear conscience,

206
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,300
why don’t you dare to test for the poison right now?

207
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,550
Commander Song,

208
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,480
this is the court.

209
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,360
This is not a place for you to mess around.

210
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,220
Your Majesty,

211
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,910
I beg you to test for poison on the spot.

212
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,340
Summon Physician Zheng from the Imperial Hospital.

213
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,140
Your Majesty,

214
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,580
I've tested with silver needles.

215
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,850
There is no poison in the hair.

216
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,850
Your Majesty is not poisoned.

217
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,690
Physician Zheng, have you checked carefully?

218
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:19,070
Commander Song,

219
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,630
Physician Zheng has practised medicine for over 40 years.

220
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,170
Would he not be able to find out

221
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,740
if the medicine is poisonous?

222
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,230
You...

223
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,340
Li Xiuming,

224
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,910
you must be behind all of this.

225
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,590
If you still don't believe me,

226
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:34,160
I will have to

227
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,460
to prove my innocence.

228
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,340
Commander Song,

229
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,060
do you have anything else to say?

230
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:58,980
How can you still face anyone?

231
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,500
This is clearly a frame-up!

232
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:02,820
It's a frame-up!

233
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,500
Say it!

234
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,700
What rapacious ambitions you have!

235
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,500
Say something!

236
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,460
You may leave.

237
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,370
Your Majesty,

238
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,740
at this point,

239
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,170
I have nothing to say.

240
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:39,910
I...

241
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,530
am willing to atone for my sins with my death.

242
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,390
No need.

243
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,690
Father,

244
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,900
considering that Commander Song

245
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,750
have contributed a lot

246
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,750
to the state of Great Chen,

247
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,040
I

248
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,760
will not pursue this matter.

249
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,280
Your Majesty.

250
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,510
I failed to protect you.

251
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:04,660
It was my negligence.

252
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:07,220
Please sentence me to death.

253
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:13,660
Father,

254
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,520
I think

255
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,410
we can send Commander Song to the Criminal Investigation Bureau first.

256
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,390
We can talk about punishment

257
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,290
after he sobers up.

258
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,620
Your Majesty.

259
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:29,350
Your Majesty?

260
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,300
Yes.

261
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,510
His Majesty has given his orders.

262
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,830
He feels that what Prince Ning said is appropriate.

263
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,570
Escort Commander Song to the Criminal Investigation Bureau.

264
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,080
Thank you, Father.

265
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,490
Thank you, Your Majesty.

266
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:02,390
[Jianzhang]

267
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:13,780
Miss!

268
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,140
Zihui?

269
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,020
How have you been?

270
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,440
How is Yingshi?

271
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:21,560
We're fine.

272
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,280
But after hearing your news,

273
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,500
I was worried something might happen to you.

274
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,680
I'm fine.

275
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,500
But I lost the chimes

276
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,340
that you gave me,

277
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,530
so I couldn't reach you.

278
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,950
I don't have the time to catch up with you.

279
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,340
I have something important to do.

280
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,840
I have to head to Jinzhou now.

281
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,990
Miss Song, wait!

282
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,700
Miss Song.

283
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,470
What is it?

284
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,910
Commander Song

285
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,740
has been sent to the Criminal Investigation Bureau by His Majesty.

286
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,060
What?

287
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,700
Commander Song committed a serious crime

288
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,500
by framing Prince Ning.

289
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,070
Prince Ning begged for his mercy

290
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,490
before his life was spared.

291
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,520
Prince Ning asked me to pass the message that

292
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,590
Commander Song must have been bewitched by a snitch,

293
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,730
or that there must be some misunderstanding.

294
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,980
He hopes that Miss Song can make a trip to the Criminal Investigation Bureau

295
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:03,080
to persuade Commander Song to write a Statement of Repentance

296
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,400
and then take him home.

297
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,910
Remember,

298
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,490
Prince Ning is great at being deceitful.

299
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,330
After you leave the city,

300
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,350
no matter what kind of news you hear,

301
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,200
don't ever come back.

302
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,180
[Jianzhang]

303
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,700
I see.

304
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,680
I'll be right there.

305
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,060
You go first.

306
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:34,000
What?

307
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,470
Will I abandon my family

308
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,140
and not care about their life or death?

309
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,350
This letter

310
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,720
contains all the evidence against Prince Ning.

311
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,170
Please give it to Lu Changkong for me.

312
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:57,980
And this,

313
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,150
please have this too.

314
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,920
Don't worry.

315
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,340
I understand.

316
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,130
Take care, Miss.

317
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,420
Go and report to His Highness.

318
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:29,390
[Criminal Investigation Bureau]

319
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,350
I wonder if Xiangyun

320
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,650
has left the city safely by now.

321
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,050
Don't worry.

322
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,260
Xiangyun will be fine.

323
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,220
My lord,

324
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:22,260
I'm useless.

325
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,840
I can't bear to watch you go first.

326
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,670
How about you let me go first?

327
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,120
My lord,

328
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,380
I want to hear

329
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,350
the song that

330
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:02,140
you used to sing for me.

331
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:04,380
Will that be alright?

332
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:08,920

the Song family's social status

375
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,860
and your reputation?

376

Everyone now says you're a traitor.

00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,260
How can you explain for yourself

00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,700
You should know this better than I do.

381
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,900
The most important thing

382
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,220
is to live!

383
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,990
♫It's like dew and lightning♫

384
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,220
Dad

385
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,680
♫It's like a flawless beauty♫

386
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,500
Wake up, Daddy.

387
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,460
♫It's hard to tell right from wrong♫

388
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:41,420
Wake up!

389
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:45,070
♫We meet and leave each other in a cycle of guilt♫

390
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,780
♫But eventually, we cannot escape♫

391
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,910
♫The feeling of entanglement♫

392
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,370
♫No resentment and no regrets♫

393
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,860
♫I just want to be with you♫

395
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:04,230
♫I will remember your smile even after seven lifetimes♫

♫Regardless of how many cycles, I will only love you♫

397

Xiangyun!

398
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:24,200
[Song Mansion]

399
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,320
Who is it?

400
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,580
This is strange.

401
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,150
There's no one outside.

402
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,260
There's a stone

403
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,220
and a handkerchief with a letter.

404
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,780
Your Highness, the imperial physician has checked.

405
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,750
He said that Miss Xiangyun is fine.

406
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:02,080
It's just that she has to catch her breath,

407
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,980
and thus may need a few more hours to wake up.

408
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:08,910
Okay.

409
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,510
Even if the troops depart immediately,

410
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:23,600
it will take at least four days to reach the capital.

411
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:26,040
If we rush and travel day and night,

412
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,580
it will take three days to arrive at dusk.

413
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,320
How about this?

414
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,000
I'll bring a small troop to the capital first.

415
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,210
Commander Hu,

416
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,380
you shall take the troops to the capital as planned.

417
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,780
Remember to guard against Prince Ning's traps.

418
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,620
Be sure to keep your route and schedule safe and under cover.

419
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:39,800
Got it.

420
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,030
I'll order my men

421
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:41,860
to escort you to the capital.

422
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,070
I'll always follow you

423
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,700
and save Miss Xiangyun.

424
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,220
Go to the capital and get rid of the treacherous king!

425
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,800
Go to the capital and get rid of the treacherous king!

426
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,860
Go to the capital and get rid of the treacherous king!

427
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,860
Go to the capital and get rid of the treacherous king!

428
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:56,380
Go to the capital and get rid of the treacherous king!

429
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,460
Go to the capital and get rid of the treacherous king!

430
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,690
Lu Changkong

431
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,840
sincerely thanks everybody.

432
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,390
General Lu!

433
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,670
General Lu!

434
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,820
General Lu!

435
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,290
Who are you? Take him down!

436
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:11,290
General Lu,

437
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,320
it's me.

438
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,760
Xiangyun.

439
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,080
Xiangyun,

440
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,130
do you really hate me this much?

441
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,630
Xiuming.

442
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,690
No,

443
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,530
you're not the Xiuming I know.

444
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:55,780
You shouldn't be like this.

445
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,100
Since everything started because of me,

446
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,340
let me end it.

447
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:06,570
Xiangyun.

448
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:16,400
Xiangyun,

449
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,810
for you,

450
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,220
I did take the chance to get rid of the Lu family.

451
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,540
I've also knocked down Commander Song.

452
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,420
But whether you believe it or not,

453
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:29,550
your parents' deaths

454
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,660
were never my intention.

455
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,150
I know they are the people

456
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,420
you care the most in this world.

457
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,270
How could I ever hurt them?

458
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,430
I can let them live,

459
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,260
but I can't control their death.

460
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,830
Xiangyun,

461
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,030
please trust me.

462
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,780
Miss.

463
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,260
Cui Bi!

464
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,910
Why are you here?

465
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,310
Are you okay?

466
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,420
Yes, I am.

467
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,340
Thanks to Prince Ning,

468
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,340
my family and I are doing well.

469
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,140
His Highness arranged for us to enter the palace.

470
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,400
He said after you get married,

471
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,950
we can still serve you.

472
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,460
So,

473
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,290
you want to threaten me with them?

474
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,340
If I say no,

475
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,720
would you still believe me?

476
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,110
What about Lu Changkong?

477
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,470
As long as he stops in Jinzhou,

478
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,720
I will spare his life.

479
00:30:03,950 --> 00:30:05,230
Your scheme

480
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,150
won't succeed.

481
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,690
Because you have sent someone to tell him.

482
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,040
So what?

483
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,210
Whether you want to kill or hurt,

484
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,860
do as you please.

485
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,520
Xiangyun.

486
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:41,990
Don't worry.

487
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,680
I don't have the heart to hurt you.

488
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:47,990
But Xiangyun,

489
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,240
there's no turning back for me.

490
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,520
This is a war between me and Lu Changkong.

491
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:56,690
I can't lose.

492
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,650
If he appears

493
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,450
on our wedding day,

494
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,010
I'll kill him.

495
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:04,600
No.

496
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,710
In three days,

497
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,240
we will hold our wedding

498
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,010
as scheduled.

499
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,890
Miss.

500
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:42,580
Your Highness,

501
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,050
this is the draft of the layout of wedding hall

502
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,800
and the sketch of wedding clothes.

503
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,330
We have drawn it up according to your wishes.

504
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,860
Please have a look.

505
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:58,900
[Layout of Feng Nian Yi]

506
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,230
This looks good.

507
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,710
I know by leaving matters

508
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,140
in your hands,

509
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:05,720
nothing will go wrong.

510
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,810
Your Highness, please take care of yourself.

511
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,570
Judging from the weather,

512
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,490
it should be snowing

513
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,720
on the wedding day.

514
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,950
I don't know

515
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,460
if Xiangyun likes snow.

516
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,820
I like it very much.

517
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:45,540
It seems that the first snow in the capital

518
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,960
is about to fall.

519
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,320
Tomorrow,

520
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:52,650
there will be a fierce battle.

521
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:00,930
General Lu,

522
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,980
look who's here.

523
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:03,270
Cousin,

524
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,760
how can you leave me out

525
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,030
from such an important moment?

526
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,840
You still dare to call me cousin?

527
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,310
Did you realize how much you were messing around?

528
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,260
Uncle and I are worried sick.

529
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,830
How did you find me here?

530
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:17,880
I was the one who told Yingshi.

531
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,680
On the wedding day,

532
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,750
Prince Ning must have planted many ambushes.

533
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,750
You are not to go.

534
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:24,640
Cousin,

535
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:26,870
since when did you become so wishy-washy?

536
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,620
I...

537
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,450
I'm just afraid that

538
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:31,740
if something happens to you,

539
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,060
what am I going to say to my uncle?

540
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,460
There's no such thing.

541
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,690
I've been with the army since I was young.

542
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,540
What could happen to me?

543
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,220
Besides,

544
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,700
there's still Zihui around.

545
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,720
I will do my best

546
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,330
to protect her.

547
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,740
Although this fool is usually looks silly,

548
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,320
but he's actually very nimble.

549
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,690
He picked up

550
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,600
martial arts really quickly.

551
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,560
Are you sure you can take good care of her?

552
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,460
Your Highness.

553
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,300
Greetings, Your Highness.

554
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,429
General Lu, please rise.

555
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,820
I've sent someone to investigate in secret

556
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,889
the matter which you had asked about.

557
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:15,070
Xiuming controlled his father

558
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:16,090
and played a trick

559
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,340
to frame General Lu.

560
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,770
Don't worry, everyone.

561
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:20,850
I've collected enough evidence

562
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:22,370
of Xiuming's crimes.

563
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,679
When things settle down,

564
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:27,580
I will overturn things for the Lu family.

565
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:30,420
Your Highness, you are indeed principled and dutiful.

566
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,960
But...

567
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:34,110
General Lu,

568
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,090
many people in the palace recognize you.

569
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,139
I'm afraid you will need to disguise yourself

570
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:40,340
in order to get into the ceremony.

571
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:41,969
Don't worry, Your Highness.

572
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,380
I have my own plans.

573
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:44,260
Please.

574
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,020
Okay.

575
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,100
Lord Protector.

576
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:18,260
Have you found my younger sister, Luo?

577
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,820
I'm incompetent.

578
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,770
We haven't found her yet.

579
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,190
But the Nuwa Stone is about to succeed.

580
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,870
He's going to take the woman he loves and save the day.

581
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,740
Those who do not know have no fear.

582
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,220
A sword has no eyes.

583
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,580
Life or death,

584
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,390
this stone

585
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,470
will soon experience the whole process of falling in love.

586
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,920
The most beautiful thing in the world

587
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,240
is love.

588
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,960
The most heartbreaking thing

589
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,960
is also love.

590
00:35:56,310 --> 00:35:58,990
I can’t wait to see

591
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,270
how it beats for love

592
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,630
and then be broken by it.

593
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:27,980
Li Xiuming,

594
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:31,120
did you really think that I can't do anything

595
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,290
just because you have Xiangyun and the world?

596
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:45,050
[Zhaoqian Palace]

597
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,780
The auspicious time is approaching.

598
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,040
Yes.
