Dear Xiangyun,

Yes, Father. Just give the order to search his house.

39
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,090
a good chance to force Song Qinwen to make a stand.

40
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,500
Besides, it can also make Lu Liang's subordinates

41
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,440
turn against Song Qinwen.

42
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,090

00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,540
Open the door!

196
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,530
Xiangyun.

197
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,610
Mother.

198
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:25,640
Mother.

199
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,950
Let me out.

200
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,090
Mother.

201
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,720
I know it's hard for you,

202
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,010
but it's hard for your father too.

203
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,180
Mr. Lu is his brother

204
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,700
who fought alongside him on the battlefield.

205
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,100
You'll understand in the future.

206
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,600
It's the emperor's order.

207
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,220
He has no choice.

208
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,830
Mother, I know.

209
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,870
I know Father has no choice.

210
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,800
But the Lu family is innocent.

211
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,370
What did Lu Changkong do wrong?

212
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,580
Mother,

213
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,690
I can't watch him die.

214
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:02,460
Mother, let me out!

215
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,520
Mother.

216
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,540
I know you and Kong are close.

217
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,700
But even if I let you out,

218
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,180
you can't change anything or save anyone.

219
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,460
But I have to do something.

220
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,840
Mother, let me out!

221
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,780
Mother, let me out!

222
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:22,460
Let me out, Mother!

223
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,460
Keep an eye on her.

224
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,070
Mother, don't go!

225
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,200
Mother, don't go!

226
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,580
Let me out.

227
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,460
Let me out.

228
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,520
Mother, let me out!

229
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,400
[Lu Mansion]

230
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:13,840
[Lu Mansion]

231
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:34,940
My lord.

232
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,010
The moon tonight

233
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,660
is so bright.

234
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,089
Song, would you like to have a drink with me?

235
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,980
Do you know why I'm here?

236
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,820
Do what you need to do.

237
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,330
Lu.

238
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,300
In my whole life,

239
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,470
I've never done anything

240
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,940
that I'm ashamed of.

241
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,750
I can't wait to see

242
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,820
who is trying to frame me.

243
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,520
Search.

244
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,420
Yes.

245
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:29,990
Uncle Zhong.

246
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,880
It should be here.

247
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:40,730
It may be there.

248
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,540
U-Uncle Zhong.

249
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,500
Uncle Zhong.

250
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,730
There's no such thing as a secret edict.

251
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,250
Is there?

252
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,500
My father tricked me into coming here

253
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:18,710
to save my life.

254
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,560
Right?

255
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,630
Young...

256
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,820
Mr. Song, we didn't find anything.

257
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,200
We didn't find anything.

258
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,140
Detain Mr. Lu and Mrs. Lu

259
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:36,490
for investigation.

260
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,330
Yes.

261
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,180
Wait.

262
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,440
Grand General Lu. Mr. Song.

263
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,710
Why are you here?

264
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,560
His Majesty is considerate

265
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,590
and thinks

266
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,500
that you may need a witness.

267
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,420
So he sent me here

268
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,280
to assist you.

269
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,110
No need.

270
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:11,850
I've searched everywhere.

271
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,000
Since I'm already here,

272
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:16,630
I need to get my work done

273
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,390
and report what I found to His Majesty.

274
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:20,460
Search!

275
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:21,630
Yes.

276
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,870
Miss, you need to eat.

277
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,420
Miss, don't worry.

278
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,020
Old Master and the Lu family are very close.

279
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,360
He'll find a way

280
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,900
to save Young Master Lu.

281
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,090
Cui Bi, help me get out of here.

282
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,190
I can't wait any longer.

283
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,520
Miss, you can't do this.

284
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,630
Get out! Get out!

285
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:20,460
Yes.

286
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,590
Miss Song?

287
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,500
Stop! Stop!

288
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,280
Go after her!

289
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,650
Move.

290
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,540
Move!

291
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,540
Miss, don't make it difficult for us.

292
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,830
Move!

293
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,270
Xiangyun, put it down.

294
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,110
Xiangyun, put down the sword.

295
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,340
Do it for Mother.

296
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,870
Mother.

297
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,030
I've been petulant

298
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,070
since young

299
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,810
and caused you a lot of trouble.

300
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,710
But tonight is different.

301
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,230
I'm not being willful.

302
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,950
I have to save Lu Changkong no matter what.

303
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,890
Have you thought about the consequences?

304
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,140
All I know

305
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,690
is that if I don't go to him tonight,

306
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,350
I'll regret it for the rest of my life.

307
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,790
Mother.

308
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,460
Don't stop me.

309
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:45,820
Xiangyun,

310
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,680
I know

311
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,020
what kind of person you are.

312
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,850
If you want to leave,

313
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,200
no one can stop you.

314
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,320
You must be very careful. Don't be impulsive.

315
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,450
Think about me and your father.

316
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,620
We can't live without you.

317
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,180
Mother.

318
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,930
I'm sorry.

319
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,980
Your Highness, the wind is picking up.

320
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,040
Be careful not to catch a cold.

321
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:44,950
My lord.

322
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:58,700
Lu Liang.

323
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,450
What is this?

324
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,320
What's the point of that?

325
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:17,630
Feng Yuanzhou.

326
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,130
How dare you frame him?

327
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,100
Frame?

328
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:23,750
Commander Song, I'm under His Majesty's orders.

329
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,780
I'm not framing anyone.

330
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,200
You…

331
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:28,050
Even if he didn't do it,

332
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:30,590
someone else would.

333
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:34,460
Who is framing me

334
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,580
won't make any difference.

335
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,480
The emperor wants me to die,

336
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,950
so I have to die.

337
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,790
The result won't change.

338
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,300
Why don't we

339
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,300
put an end to this tonight?

340
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,370
Lu Liang.

341
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,870
Anyone who disobeys His Majesty

342
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,570
will be executed along with his family.

343
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,100
I advise you to confess now

344
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,310
and not implicate the innocent.

345
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,560
Lu,

346
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,620
someone fabricated evidence.

347
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,400
I'll find out the truth.

348
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:40,740
I used this sword

349
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,760
to kill countless enemies

350
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,620
and expand territory for Great Chen.

351
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:50,940
If I can

352
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,200
end my life with it,

353
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,780
I'll have no regret.

354
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,330
The road ahead is dark,

355
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,270
but I'll go down it anyway.

356
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:09,610
Song, you should learn from this.

357
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,590
Don't repeat my mistake.

358
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,390
Lu Liang!

359
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,370
If you die in front of me because of a false accusation,

360
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,670
how am I going

361
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,690
to go on with my life?

362
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,550
Having a confidant like you, I can't ask for more.

363
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,350
Song.

364
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,980
Don't blame yourself.

365
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,630
Lu!

366
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:53,740
My lord!

367
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:55,830
My lord!

368
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,920
My lord!

369
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,420
Lu!

370
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:09,310
My lord! My lord!

371
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,660
My lord!

372
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,780
Father!

373
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:15,930
Perfect timing.

374
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,910
Take him down.

375
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,910
No!

376
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,840
Do you want to disobey His Majesty?

377
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,900
Go, Kong!

378
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,310
Kong!

379
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,050
Kong!

380
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,170
Go, Kong!

381
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:54,830
We shall go together!

382
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,100
We shall go together.

383
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,460
Together.

384
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,320
You audacious traitor.

385
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:11,460
Together…

386
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,940
I'll behead you for justice!

387
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,020
Mother!

388
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:24,770
Mother!

389
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,380
Go to hell!

390
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,180
Go. Go.

391
00:28:49,810 --> 00:28:50,620
Yun.

392
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,080
Young Master!

393
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:56,850
Go!

394
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,060
Come with me.

395
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:08,010
Split up and find them.

396
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,640
They couldn't have gotten far.

397
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:10,390
Yes.

398
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,290
Yes. Here we are.

399
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:13,750
Young Master. Young Master.

400
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,560
At dusk, Old Master asked me to prepare a carriage.

401
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,190
I didn't know what it was for

402
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,390
until I came back.

403
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,770
Young Master, come.

404
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,480
Young Master.

405
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:27,780
Young Master!

406
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,220
You couldn't stop this from happening.

407
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:37,780
Miss Song.

408
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,970
Young Master

409
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,740
can only rely on you now.

410
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,620
You don't need to tell me that.

411
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,570
I'll protect him at all costs.

412
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,110
Over there!

413
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,380
Get up!

414
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:49,640
Hurry!

415
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,190
Hurry!

416
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,220
Don't let them escape.

417
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,530
Hurry!

418
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,530
Lu Fang, get up with us.

419
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,550
Tell Cui Bi

420
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:00,780
that I

421
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:02,890
can't wait for her anymore.

422
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,430
Take care.

423
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,660
Lu Fang!

424
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:12,830
Song.

425
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,340
Do you know what you are doing?

426
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,880
Lu Changkong can't die.

427
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:23,420
Song,

428
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,980
please let me be willful one last time.

429
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,100
Let us go.

430
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,890
Have you made up your mind?

431
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,560
If Lu Changkong dies,

432
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,260
I'll die with him.

433
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:37,900
Go.

434
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,580
Song.

435
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,180
Go.

436
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,640
Go!

437
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:20,950
Yun.

438
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,240
After you leave today,

439
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,230
I don't know when we can meet again.

440
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,150
When I can't protect you by your side,

441
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:35,360
you must protect yourself.

442
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,450
♫Paper cranes from childhood flew in the woods♫

443
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:50,530
♫I can still picture the fence of our old house♫

444
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,820
♫Go up the river of time♫

445
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:54,970
♫I become a kid again♫

446
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,280
♫The crescent moon hanging low on the sky♫

447
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,210
Song!

448
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:06,290
♫Cast light upon the road of growing up♫

449
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,530
You raised me.

450
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,940
I'll repay you in my next life.

451
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:10,560
♫You grew old overnight♫

452
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:16,640
♫Time doesn't talk♫

453
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,000
♫It drew wrinkles around your eyes♫

454
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,100
♫Your children left for somewhere far away♫

455
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:24,090
♫You miss them day by day♫

456
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,360
♫You have nobody to talk to now♫

457
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,270
♫Time is flowing in the hourglass♫

458
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:35,900
♫Winter goes and spring comes♫

459
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,860
♫You paved the way for me♫

460
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,010
♫Your hair has turned gray♫

461
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:44,920
♫Your tea has gone cold♫

462
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:18,980
Your Highness.

463
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,860
The First Prince, Li Xiuzhe,

464
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,110
colluded with Lu Liang, the Grand General,

465
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,380
to embezzle soldiers' pay

466
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,820
and gather private troops.

467
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,500
There's solid evidence

468
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,260
that they wanted to raise a rebellion.

469
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:34,940
He's been deprived of his title

470
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,929
and become a commoner.

471
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:42,020
He'll be sent to guard the Jing'an Mausoleum today.

472
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,780
Without being summoned,

473
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,540
he can't come back.

474
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:51,659
Your Highness.

475
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,670
After he's gone,

476
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,230
you'll have

477
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:59,930
more influence over the court.

478
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:02,900
Your Highness,

479
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,150
congratulations.

480
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,590
Father is not feeling well today.

481
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,220
Send an imperial physician to him.

482
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,580
My lord,

483
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,320
the Lu family was wiped out.

484
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,710
Tonight was a great opportunity.

485
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,470
I didn't expect that little fairy

486
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,360
to meddle in

487
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,440
and save Lu Changkong.

488
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,160
He escaped again.

489
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,490
But don't worry.

490
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,610
I have other plans.

491
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,290
He won't live much longer.

492
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,170
You'd better keep your word.

493
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,590
If you ruin my plan,

494
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,970
I'll make you die

495
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,350
with him.

496
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,540
My lord, I failed you again,

497
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,050
but my loyalty to you

498
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,140
has never changed.

499
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,050
I'll wait for you

500
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:00,390
to prove that to me.

501
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:04,320
Li Yan doesn't deserve to be the emperor.

502
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,750
My godfather told me

503
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,710
that he's despicable.

504
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,640
How could he do that?

505
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,350
I heard that soldiers are searching for

506
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,170
those related to the Lu family with portraits.

507
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,120
Shall we leave for Anliang?

508
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,640
Before long,

509
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:19,230
the soldiers will come to the inn.

510
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:21,590
Miss, let's leave here.

511
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,380
We can't wait.

512
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,380
If I'd known I'd leave so soon,

513
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,430
I wouldn't have teased you.

514
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,480
But you started it by drawing me so ugly.

515
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,770
I'll return your umbrella to you.

516
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,820
We're even now.

517
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,450
So,

518
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,590
she never forgot me.

519
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:50,790
Kill the criminal where he's found.

520
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:51,740
Yes.

521
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,570
Sir, what's going on?

522
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,120
It seems that a criminal wanted by the court

523
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,070
escaped from the city.

524
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,180
Where did he go?

525
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:03,490
I heard that he went north.

526
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,190
The world is not peaceful now.

527
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:08,020
Who knows when we can leave the city?

528
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,230
[Wanted]

529
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,300
Oh no, Miss Fairy.

530
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,070
Hold on. I'm coming to save you.

531
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:18,400
[Song Mansion]

532
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,510
The servants didn't announce me

533
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,900
because I don't want to disturb you.

534
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:30,870
I heard that the traitor from the Lu family

535
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,210
kidnapped your daughter

536
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,460
and escaped,

537
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,330
and that you were worried sick

538
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,400
and fell ill.

539
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,350
His Majesty is very concerned about you

540
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:41,730
and sent me to visit you.

541
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,020
His Majesty is so kind.

542
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,570
I'm fine.

543
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:52,110
Commander Song, take care of yourself.

544
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,750
You're an important official of the country.

545
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,260
Great Chen can't thrive

546
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,760
without your protection.

547
00:38:56,990 --> 00:38:58,200
You must stay in good health.

548
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,020
I'm so ashamed

549
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,950
that I let the traitor escape.

550
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:06,290
Compared to my daughter,

551
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,650
the traitor at large

552
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,020
worries me more.

553
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,420
I…

554
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,020
I deserve death for my mistake.

555
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,510
Don't worry, Commander Song.

556
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,900
The soldiers have started searching.

557
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,840
It's said that the traitor was injured.

558
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,990
Believe me. Within a few days,

559
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,080
he'll be brought to justice

560
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,500
and your daughter will come home.
