[Love you seven times]

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,890
[Episode 7]

4
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,650
Look.

5
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,900
His Divinity is indeed incomparably valiant.

6
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,490
Our Xiangyun is not bad either.

7
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,789
No, you don't understand.

8
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,930
It's about love. Love.

9
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,040
Li is right.

10
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,900
Only love can overcome all obstacles.

11
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,570
The love between Xiangyun and Immortal Chu Kong

12
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,720
is really touching.

13
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,190
Touching?

14
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,340
Come on.

15
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,140
Let's eat together.

16
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,220
It's more enjoyable eating together.

17
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,430
Oh, my red thread.

18
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,630
I didn't expect

19
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,890
Xiangzi would make me proud.

20
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,800
Isn't that because my Fate Book is well written?

21
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,990
Immortal Li, before, you mentioned about those...

22
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,900
those...

23
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,490
exciting plot points.

24
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,510
Have you forgotten?

25
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,610
I can satisfy all your needs.

26
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,840
I'll arrange for it.

27
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,540
Very good.

28
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,090
What exciting plot points?

29
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,260
This exciting...

30
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,860
Greetings, Your Holiness.

31
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,290
You four are so in the mood.

32
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,790
How about

33
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:55,210
I prepare two more plates of melon seeds for you

34
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,100
to watch it again?

35
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:59,590
I have something important to do.

36
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,720
I'll get going.

37
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,360
I'm going back to the Marriage Pavilion.

38
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,220
I'll take my leave.

39
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:05,660
I’ll take my leave.

40
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,790
[Lu Mansion]

41
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,340
Father.

42
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,630
Why are you back so late?

43
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,940
I have something

44
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,260
to discuss with you.

45
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,000
I want to break off the engagement.

46
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,230
You want to break off the engagement

47
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,890
because of what happened at the horse farm today, right?

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,880
I know you don't want to be the Princes' Tutor.

49
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,420
But after what happened at the horse farm today,

50
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,140
of course I understand

51
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,980
His Majesty's attitude.

52
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,590
But

53
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,030
there is no turning back.

54
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,650
I can take the position of the Princes' Tutor for now.

55
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,430
But the Lu and Song families are very close.

56
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,020
Now, we are walking on thin ice.

57
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,780
I don't want to implicate Xiangyun...

58
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,550
or even the Song family.

59
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,589
This concerns the reputation of Xiangyun.

60
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,130
Unless it's the last resort,

61
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,140
I don't want to do this.

62
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,850
Later, when the time is right,

63
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,610
I'll clarify things with her.

64
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,670
You've thought it through.

65
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:34,580
It's not yet to the point of the last resort.

66
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:35,650
But

67
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,110
if the Song and Lu families

68
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,510
cut ties with each other,

69
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,030
I'm afraid we'll be criticized.

70
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:42,990
My lord.

71
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,030

[Ledger]

73
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,010
You may leave.

74
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:49,909
Yes.

75
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,490
Father.

76
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:59,170
I've never seen him in the mansion before.

77
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,340
Is he also a member of the Lu Army?

78
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,140
Yes.

79
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,230
There are so many people in the Lu Mansion.

80
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,020
How can you remember them all?

81
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,350
Father.

82
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,920
Are you hiding something from me?

83
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,390
Of course not.

84
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,680
If it involves the court,

85
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,250
please be cautious.

86
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,420
Did you burn yourself?

87
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,680
Why didn't you let go?

88
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,100
Because you were pouring the tea.

89
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,200
Silly boy.

90
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,220
Let me see.

91
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,540
If His Majesty were the one to pour the tea,

92
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,500
and you were the one to hold the teacup,

93
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,350
would you have let go?

94
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,220
I didn't let go because

95
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,820
I have to be filial as a son.

96
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,580
So I understand

97
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,290
that you are loyal to His Majesty.

98
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,020
But...

99
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,540
Water can't flow backwards,

100
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:15,020
and the cup can't fall to the ground.

101
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,840
Although the emperor's heart is unpredictable,

102
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,780
I have a clear conscience.

103
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,720
You just need to remember that

104
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,490
for everything I've done in my life,

105
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,220
I have lived up to my conscience

106
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,340
and to the people.

107
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:49,780
If it involves the court,

108
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,350
please be cautious.

109
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,750
Young Master, have some fruits.

110
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,450

113
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,260
Help me find

114
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,540
all the ledgers of the Lu Army

115
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,580
for the past ten years.

116
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,340
All of them?

117
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,190
Yes.

118
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,160
Go now.

119
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,060
Only,

120
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,410
I do feel guilty

121
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,550
to you and your mother.

122
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,740
Both father and son are united in mind.

123
00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:43,480
If there are any difficulties,

124
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,700
I will bear them with you.

125
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:41,840
Young Master.

126
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:44,100
You didn't sleep all night?

127
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,230
The sun has risen from the west.

128
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,650
Even Third Brother is at the drill ground.

129
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,450
I'm afraid he's just out to sunbathe.

130
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:10,110
Marksmanship requires a clear mind

131
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,440
to focus on the target.

132
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,950
One's strength

133
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,080
is secondary.

134
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,820
Greetings, Your Highnesses.

135
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,820
Tutor.

136
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:21,640
You don't know.

137
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,210
My Third Brother has been weak since childhood.

138
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,250
He's not cut out for martial arts.

139
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,600
Instead of being out here,

140
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,010
it'd be better for him to go back to the palace

141
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,620
and have a good rest.

142
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,000
We won't know...

143
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,500
until he's tested.

144
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,910
I hurt my hand a few days ago.

145
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,690
Luckily, a lady helped me.

146
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,630
But I haven't fully recovered.

147
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,060
Tutor, I hope you could give me a hand.

148
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,300
Marksmanship emphasizes on the five levels and three supports.

149
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,060
She also told me

150
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,190
to be more careful.

151
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,870
A truly excellent archer

152
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,670
is marked by one's inner strength.

153
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,370
If you can aim at the target without distraction,

154
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,090
you still need to pierce through their armor

155
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,720
to take the enemy's life.

156
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,680
Tutor.

157
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,590
You're right.

158
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,210
Look at him shoot.

159
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,520
He couldn't even recognize his target.

160
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,270
He approached me several times before

161
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,020
and completely understood how I lead the army.

162
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:02,290
He pretends to be weak and sickly,

163
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,680
but he's in fact hiding his skills.

164
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,360
But now, he's not hiding anything and showing off his skills.

165
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:07,390
Tutor, take a look.

166
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,740
How was my shot?

167
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,870
Your Highness is powerful.

168
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,290
I really admire you.

169
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,800
It seems like the Tutor

170
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,310
is bootlicking Third Brother now.

171
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,280
I think so too.

172
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,460
Boring.

173
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:26,800
Let's go.

174
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:27,490
Let's go.

175
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,240
Here.

176
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:40,110
You're very composed.

177
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,240
That's what really

178
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,930
impressed me.

179
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,840
I also have to treat Your Highness differently.

180
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,300
When you are free,

181
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,600
you can come to Ningyuan Palace to play chess with me.

182
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,660
It's only fun if I meet a worthy opponent.

183
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,320
A worthy opponent?

184
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,220
Your Highness is really good at chess.

185
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,180
Lu, you're flattering me.

186
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,330
I was born in the royal family.

187
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,610
I was weak since I was young.

188
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,020
And my mother is not favored.

189
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,910
So, I needed to learn

190
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:19,140
to be observant

191
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,410
and careful.

192
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,770
If you really want to play against me,

193
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,790
I'll play with you.

194
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,060
But life is like chess.

195
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:31,220
After you make your move, you should not regret it.

196
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,120
No regrets.

197
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,030
Of course.

198
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,420
General Lu is right.

199
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,860
General Lu agrees too.

200
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:51,980
Not bad.

201
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,040
General Lu.

202
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,100
General Lu.

203
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,060
General Lu.

204
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,790
Is the leader of the world surnamed Li

205
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,380
or Lu?

206
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:14,890
Get out!

207
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,160
Father!

208
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:00,220
What are you doing here?

209
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,210
The tree of the Lu family

210
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,030
does need to be trimmed.

211
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,320
I have an idea

212
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,700
to help you get rid of this trouble.

213
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,380
With your capabilities?

214
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:19,620
Tell me.

215
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,720
Eight years ago,

216
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,190
Jin River burst its banks

217
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,090
and caused a century-long disaster.

218
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,270
Father allows a large sum of money every year

219
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,290
for the settlement of the refugees

220
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,980
and the families of the dead soldiers.

221
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:36,950
I heard that

222
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:38,960
General Lu arranged the settlement of the refugees

223
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,930
to be in the suburb of the capital,

224
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:42,170
Wenkang.

225
00:14:59,290 --> 00:14:59,930
Xiu Ming.

226
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,460
I only

227
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,870
entrusted this matter to Lu Liang,

228
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,990
and didn't leave any evidence behind.

229
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,100
How did you find out about it?

230
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,340
I'm your son.

231
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,460
Of course I'm thinking for the Li family.

232
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,940
Does it matter how I

233
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,740
found out about it?

234
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,910
What matters is

235
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,750
the Private Army

236
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,590
is rebelling.

237
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,460
That's a grave crime that could be punished by the extermination of the whole family.

238
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,580
Young Master.

239
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,520
Young Master, you haven't slept for two days.

240
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,050
What happened

241
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,430
that made you so worried?

242
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,150
Are all the files from eight years ago here?

243
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,280
Yes, I got them from the Document Office personally.

244
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:59,090
Nothing is missing.

245
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,500
Song

246
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,270
is punishing me until now

247
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:19,830
and wouldn't let me go out.

248
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,170
He wouldn't come to see me either.

249
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,250
Coming.

250
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,180
Not coming.

251
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:34,980
Coming.

252
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:36,580
Not coming.

253
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:39,710
Coming.

254
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:40,980
Lu...

255
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,460
Miss.

256
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,940
Miss.

257
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:47,860
Miss.

258
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,310
I went to the Lu Mansion to ask around.

259
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,130
I heard that Young Master Lu is very busy recently

260
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:53,990
and went out again.

261
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,820
He went out?

262
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,950
After the royal tournament then,

263
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,280
Young Master Lu never came here even once.

264
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,840
Don't tell me he really changed his mind

265
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,430
and ran away with another girl?

266
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,900
What are you talking about?

267
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,410
Lu Changkong is not that kind of person.

268
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,900
If he really ran away with another girl,

269
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,470
then...

270
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,339
I should be happy.

271
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,569
But why do I feel so frustrated,

272
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:19,069
like there's a big rock weighing on my heart?

273
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,380
I can't breathe.

274
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,770
Miss, you've been waiting and yearning

275
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,859
on this crabapple tree for so many days.

276
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,359
After coming back from the drill ground,

277
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,010
you've been constantly mentioning Young Master Lu.

278
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,710
Obviously, you've long fallen in love with Young Master Lu.

279
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:35,580
I...

280
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:36,770
I...

281
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,700
Have I?

282
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,280
Really?

283
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,080
Miss, if you deny it again,

284
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,700
I'm afraid this crabapple tree

285
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,060
will soon be bald from your plucking.

286
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,000
Cui Bi, get me some food.

287
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,020
Miss, you're finally going to eat.

288
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,060
I'll bring it to you now.

289
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:11,720
Miss.

290
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,310
Can you tell me in advance

291
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,970
when you summon me next time?

292
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,440
Hui, I have a good job for you.

293
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,960
What is it?

294
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,060
Go check out the Lu Mansion.

295
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:24,030
Miss Fairy.

296
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,790
[Lu Mansion]

297
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:28,860
Miss Yingshi.

298
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,890
After you fell into the water that day,

299
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,150
are you suffering from any discomfort?

300
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,760
I specially bought some melon fruit and medicinal food

301
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,940
for you to nourish your body.

302
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,620
You are the person

303
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,480
who pretended to be a Lu Mansion's servant and took me away that day.

304
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,530
Why are you here?

305
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,700
Tell me the truth.

306
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:46,200
I'm here because Miss Xiangyun entrusted me

307
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,470
to come inquire about Young Master Lu's recent situation.

308
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,940
Okay.

309
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,640
You work for Song Xiangyun.

310
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,110
She sent you to lure me away

311
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,670
and take the chance

312
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,420
to ruin my date with my cousin.

313
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,350
Right?

314
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:01,060
Yes, and no.

315
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,320
That day, I took you away

316
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,170
out of my own will.

317
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,690
It has nothing to do with Miss Xiangyun.

318
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,450
What great favor did she do for you?

319
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,760
It's sort of like fate.

320
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,530
When I first entered the mortal world,

321
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,130
I was severely beaten up by a thug.

322
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,150
Thanks to Miss Xiangyun's help,

323
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,550
my life was saved.

324
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,080
So I call her my benefactor.

325
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:22,950
That simple?

326
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,300
Then I understand.

327
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:30,590
Lü He.

328
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,500
Got it.

329
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:34,170
Come here.

330
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,050
Miss, why are you doing this?

331
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,380
Stop hitting me!

332
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:39,730
Stop!

333
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,090
Song Xiangyun saved your life.

334
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,830
So you work for and serve her

335
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,160
faithfully.

336
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,410
Now, I also saved your life.

337
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,350
Mr. Zihui, what should you do?

338
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,640
If you need anything,

339
00:20:02,430 --> 00:20:04,000
just let me know.

340
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,870
I, Xie Yingshi, am considerate.

341
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,220
I won't give you a hard time.

342
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,890
You can still stay by Song Xiangyun's side.

343
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:14,120
But

344
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,540
I have your heart.

345
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,530
From now on,

346
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,130
you are

347
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,720
a spy I planted by Song Xiangyun.

348
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,380
If anything happens to her,

349
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,120
you have to report to me.

350
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,850
Most importantly,

351
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,690
try hard to make her cut ties with my cousin.

352
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,520
This...

353
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,360
[Song Mansion]

354
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,890
Why isn't Zihui back yet?

355
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,290
Don't ever do such a dangerous thing

356
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,380
ever again.

357
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,490
Do you hear me?

358
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,570
Do you hear me?

359
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,040
Oh no.

360
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,370
No way.

361
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,090
Am I destined to fall in love with him

362
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,080
because of Li's Love Tribulation Fate Book?

363
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,350
My Young Miss hasn't been eating well.

364
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,970
So has my Young Master.

365
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,290
Your Young Master doesn't know how to take the initiative.

366
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,870
He is so busy.

367
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:23,600
Why couldn't your Young Miss

368
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:26,220
care and ask about his wellbeing?

369
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,850
My Young Miss is grounded by the Old Master.

370
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,170
She can't go out.

371
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,790
Really?

372
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:43,020
I thought that once my Young Master and your Young Miss get married,

373
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,550
we would be reunited.

374
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:49,360
But we can't just watch them break up.

375
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,480
Persuade your Young Master to come to the Song Mansion to apologize.

376
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,360
After all, my Young Master

377
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,140
did nothing wrong.

378
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:00,000
So you just want to see us break up too.

379
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,130
I'll go back and try.

You don't have to do this for me.

566
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,120
I like you.

567
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,760
I know how you feel.

568
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:43,680
But I've only ever seen you as my sister.

569
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,870
I've never thought about you in any other way.

570
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,370
I know.

571
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,220
It's all because of Song Xiangyun.

572
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:53,540
No matter what happens between me and Song Xiangyun,

573
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,000
it's impossible

574
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,030
between us.

575
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:58,630
All right.

576
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,730
Go back to the border first

577
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:01,940
and leave the capital immediately.

578
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,200
How dare you chase me away for Song Xiangyun?

579
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:06,490
I'll leave then.

580
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,780
Miss, are we really going back to Anliang?

581
00:34:17,449 --> 00:34:18,190
What a joke.

582
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,900
It wasn't easy for me to escape out of there.

583
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:20,730
Why should I go back?

584
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:22,489
I'll also be forced into a marriage by my godfather.

585
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,320
How can we come back?

586
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,260
I have my own way.

587
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:42,159
The four of you, protect Miss.

588
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:42,900
Yes.

589
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:45,360
Miss, please.

590
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,600
So

591
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,940
something is about to happen to the Lu family?

592
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,040
His Majesty has asked the Investigating Censor

593
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,490
to secretly take away all the files and ledgers of the Lu family.

594
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,870
Something will happen sooner or later.

595
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,140
It's already come to this.

596
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,680
[Lu Mansion]

597
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,020
Young Master.

598
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,460
You should eat something.

599
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,890
Young Master.

600
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:31,440
If you need anything later,

601
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,480
remember to call me.

602
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,270
Xiangyun.

603
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,360
Why are you here?

604
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,250
I have something important to tell you.

605
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:46,970
Young Master.

606
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,490
Why don't I go to the Song Mansion on your behalf

607
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,310
and invite Miss Song over?

608
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,510
I saw you frequently

609
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,690
holding onto the longevity jade pendant tightly at night.

610
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,780
You must miss her very much.

611
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,740
In my opinion,

612
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,310
you shouldn't mess with her...

613
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,340
Shut up.

614
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:04,210
Go.

615
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,810
Did I not make myself clear last time?

616
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,750
The Lu Mansion may be in danger.

617
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,410
You'd better pack up

618
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,740
and leave the capital immediately.

619
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,210
We grew up together.

620
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:27,180
I really don't want

621
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,900
to make the situation so ugly.

622
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,730
Fine.

623
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,550
Why do you keep pestering me?

624
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,290
I don't want to say anything mean anymore.

625
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:48,530
[Engagement Annulment]

626
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,970
Song told me

627
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,930
the Investigating Censor has secretly obtained

628
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,430
your family's files and ledgers.

629
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,470
I don't think he's bluffing.

630
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,200
You'd better leave here quickly.

631
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,020
Our Lu family's generals have been loyal

632
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:04,460
to their duties for four generations.

633
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,350
How could anything happen?

634
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,290
Why are you still lying to me?

635
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,650
You must have heard something,

636
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,710
so you're cutting ties with me.

637
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,010
You're afraid of implicating my family.

638
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,510
I won't believe what you say.

639
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,370
Xiangyun.

640
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:28,910
Why do you think I'll be faithful to you forever?

641
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,360
Do you really want me to make it clear?

642
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,030
Fine, let me tell you.

643
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,860
Me breaking off the engagement with you

644
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,000
has nothing to do with the Song family.

645
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,080
What do you mean by implicating you?

646
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,900
We grew up together as childhood sweethearts.

647
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,570
But people change.

648
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,800
Look at you now.

649
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:55,060
You hang around in the streets and play in gambling houses all day.

650
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,870
And those little tricks.

651
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,760
I'm tired.

652
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,460
I don't want to play with you anymore.

653
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,480
Okay?

654
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,220
From now on,

655
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:18,770
you have nothing to do with me.

656
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,030
Don't interfere

657
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:24,420
in my business anymore.

658
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:30,830
After I've said all that...

659
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,890
why are you still not leaving?

660
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:38,920
Lu Changkong.

661
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,450
If saying all these and doing all these things

662
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,460
can make you feel at ease,

663
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,370
I'm willing to cooperate with you.

664
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,030
And I won't be an obstacle in your path.

665
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,180
But with regards to breaking off our engagement,

666
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,920
it's not urgent.

667
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,610
If after you get through this

668
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,970
and you still think in this way,

669
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,560
I'll explain everything to Song myself.

670
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:05,860
You...

671
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:07,990
Lu Changkong.

672
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,630
Don't forget that

673
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,430
we made a pinky swear.

674
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,150
You can't die.
