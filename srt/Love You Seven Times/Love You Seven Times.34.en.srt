Let go of me!

00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,010
It's quite lively.

-he really drank the wine.
-Let me go!

11
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,960
So His Majesty

12
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,110
is really the ancient beast, five-tailed horned leopard.

13
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,870
This also means

14
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:54,160
he's still caught up in the romance of the mortal world.

15
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,870
He can't even resist

I

31
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,610
underestimated him too.

We have found Black Leopard Demon's wife.

37
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,970
Where is she now?

38
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,600
In Demon King's Mansion.

39
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,190
I've already asked someone to interrogate her.

40
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,659
She claimed

41
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,800
Black Leopard Demon

42
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,740
is a responsible person who does crystal business.

43
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,050
They love each other deeply,

44
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,970
and they only hid because they were afraid.

45
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,340
I think

46
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,630
what she said

47
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,840
should be true.

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,220
So where did you find her?

50
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,020
At a rouge shop.

51
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,360
That's weird.

53
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,370
yet she was still in the mood to do her makeup?

54
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,030

But in private,

60
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,260

61
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,050

117
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,870
You made it through the heavy guard

118

at the Southern Heavenly Gate,

119
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,350
and managed to enter

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,710
And what makes you think

137
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,300
I will cooperate with

138
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,620

is my sworn enemy.

143
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,440
She took the most important thing from me.

144
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,940
I must take her away.

145
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,440
Is the girl you're looking for

147
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,590
Yes. It's her.

148
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,730
I looked everywhere in the six realms,

149
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:35,560
but I didn't expect

150
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,300
she'd fallen into your hands, Your Holiness.

151
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,350
As long as you hand her over to me,

152
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,490
I'll help you accomplish what you want.

153
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,450
You can have her,

154
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,370
but you must

155
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,900
accomplish what I ask you to do.

156
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,240
There's only one left.

157
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,780

Zihui.

You're going to kill someone again,

165
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,090

There's only one left before

167
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,520
I can activate the Demon-Vanishing Formation for you.

168
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:12,880
Yes.

169
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,000
With the last Golden Core Great Demon killed,

170
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,070
my task will be completed.

171
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,920
Stop working for Haoxuan,

172
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,240
okay?

173
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,960
Have you forgotten again?

174
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,240
Who is the one

175
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,140
that did this to me?

176
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,080
Why are you here?

177
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,110
This is a poison pill.

178
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,640
Only I have the antidote to it.

179
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,220
If you can't complete the task I give you

180
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,710
within a year,

181
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,830
she will drop dead.

182
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,240
By then,

183
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,120
you won't ever retrieve

184
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,670

185
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,960
I know you hate me.

186
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,190
So you have no reason

187
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:11,980
to take such a big risk

188
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,300
for me.

189
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,150
You know

190
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:19,230
what will happen

191
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,540
if I can't complete my task on time.

192
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:24,750
I'll just

193
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,220
be killed by the poison.

194
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,820
I'm always prepared to die.

195
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,130
What difference does it make,

196
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,830
dying earlier or later?

197
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,100
Bear it in mind.

198
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,230
Your life

199
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,820
belongs to me now.

200
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,520
Even if you want to die,

201
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,150
you have to get my permission first.

202
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:56,140
This room is transformed from my spiritual power.

203
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,950
Every magical barrier

204
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,950
is closely connected with me.

205
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,430
Don't you think

206
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,140
you can escape.

207
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,390
Do you know

208
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,520
your working for Haoxuan

209
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,280
is like getting blood from a stone?

210
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,180
You'll suffer the consequences sooner or later.

211
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,800
Don't you think what you said is ridiculous?

212
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,490
Luo.

213
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:20,350
I'm only doing this

214
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,480
because I don't want to lose you again.

215
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,300
Slowly.

216
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,700
Watch the road.

217
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,930
Why did you drink so much?

218
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,620
And you didn't drink with me. So annoying.

219
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,370
Watch your step.

220
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,930
I'll drink with you when we're back home.

221
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,440
Zihui.

222
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,800
You are truly obsessed with this Golden Core.

223
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:12,960
What happened exactly?

224
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:29,880
[Demon King's Mansion]

225
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,860
What happened?

226
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,490
Why is there only one soul left in you?

227
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,630
Looks like

228
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,790
I can only find out the truth

229
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:55,930
by entering his mind sea.

230
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,040
Show yourself.

231
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,000
There's less than three days left before the one year is due.

232
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,450
Why aren't you working on that last Demon Core in the Mystery Forest,

233
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,590
and came to my Changning Palace instead?

234
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,800
Now, all the Golden Core Great Demons in the Mystery Forest

235
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,100
are under the control of Demon King.

236
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,530
You mean

237
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,140
you can't

238
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,600
fulfill your promise?

239
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,700
I'm trying to find a way.

240
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,110
But it will take some time

241
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,040
before I can get the Demon Core from the Demon King's Mansion.

242
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,030
I don't care how you do it.

243
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,050
You must get the last demon core

244
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,800
before the one year is due.

245
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,650
But the circumstances have changed.

246
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,230
Give me one more month.

247
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,660
Don't try to fool me.

248
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,620
There is a limit to my patience.

249
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,580
Fool you?

250
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,300
Jin Luo's life is in your hands now.

251
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,870
How could I dare to be duplicitous?

252
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:23,280
Besides, things have changed.

253
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:24,220
It's not what I want.

254
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,780
I didn't mean to delay it.

255
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,430
Enough.

256
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,970
Go back to the Mystery Forest.

257
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,630
I

258
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,920
only care about the result.

259
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,520
Just give me another half month.

260
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:42,900
Forget it.

261
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,760
I'll think of a way myself.

262
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,560
I'll take my leave.

263
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,850
You're finally awake.

264
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,960
You know what?

265
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,550
Fortunately, I followed you to the Mystery Forest.

266
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,600
There's only one soul left in your body now.

267
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,480
How could you use your divine power in the Mystery Forest?

268
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,820
Do you want to die?

269
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:52,290
Many thanks.

270
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:52,830
Wait.

271
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,020
Don't you know

272
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,360
your primordial spirit is damaged?

273
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,860
You are already this weak,

274
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:01,220
and you are still refusing my help?

275
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:03,860
Why do you have to

276
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,930
carry the weight of the world on your own shoulders?

277
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,570
Wait.

278
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,270
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

279
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,550
Don't you want to know

280
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,110
what I saw

281
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:20,930
in your mind sea?

282
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,220
Get out!

283
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,580
I said get out!

284
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,250
Now!

285
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,480
Got it!

286
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,330
She almost found out.

287
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,330
Now I have incontestable evidence.

288
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,710
I'd love to see

289
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,620
how you can deny it.

290
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,020
Yes.

291
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,020
I pretended not to know you deliberately.

292
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,080
Why did you do that?

293
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,900
Do you know

294
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,220
how sad I've been these days?

295
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,460
I thought you really forgot

296
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,740
everything about us. You...

297
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,360
I'm sorry.

298
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,060
I know I was being selfish, but...

299
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,640
I don't want you to suffer twice.

300
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:47,830
What do you mean

301
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,530
by that?

302
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,690
I heard that

303
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,760
the Demon Realm may have a way

304
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,440
to resurrect Cang Hai.

305
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,960
If so, your Stone Heart won't be needed.

306
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,650
I'm here in Mystery Forest

307
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,390
to practice the Power of the Demon King.

308
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,260
To practice the Power of the Demon King,

309
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,620
I must pass Kuanglong's test

310
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:10,070
and

311
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,590
break off romance.

312
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,310
No wonder.

313
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,290
No wonder Kuanglong sent me to you.

314
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,960
He was trying to test you.

315
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,420
Even though I haven't forgotten you now,

316
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,510
as soon as I attain the Power of the Demon King,

317
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,030
I will still forget you then.

318
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,220
So I didn't want to give you hope

319
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,980
from the beginning.

320
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,040
Because this is the only way

321
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,870
you won't get disappointed or hurt.

322
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,520
But what exactly

323
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,600
are you going through so much trouble for?

324
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,800
Only by getting the Power of the Demon King

325
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,530
can I use the Power of the Demon King

326
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,470
to enter the Void.

327
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,350
Only by entering the Void

328
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,140
can I

329
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,100
get your Power of Cang Hai back.

330
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,490
I can't

331
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,390
afford to fail.

332
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:19,730
I'm sorry.

333
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,210
This time, you suffered from the pain of Soul-shattering Arrow

334
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,190
because of me again.

335
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,190
You even have to take such a big risk

336
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,820
and make such a big plan.

337
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,610
You don't have to do this.

338
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,380
I promised you.

339
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,850
As long as I'm here,

340
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:36,790
I will protect you.

341
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,030
But

342
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,840
in order to retrieve the Power of Cang Hai,

343
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:45,440
you have to take such a big risk.

344
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,200
I'd rather not get it back.

345
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,020
Only by getting your Power of Cang Hai back,

346
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:52,300
combined with my Power of Qilin,

347
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:54,480
can we prevent the tragedy of the six realms from happening again.

348
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,540
Besides,

349
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,080
no one knows what will happen

350
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,710
until the last minute.

351
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:04,950
Right?

352
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,960
You're right.

353
00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:13,250
I won't give up

354
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,030
until the last moment as well.

355
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,530
Even if you forget me,

356
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,010
I will find a way

357
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,330
to remind you of me.

358
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,870
Every day and night.

359
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,600
We'll never be parted.

360
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,730
I hope that

361
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,870
I can be with you

362
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,310
every day and night,

363
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,430
and never be parted in this lifetime.

364
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,530
This is what you said to me.

365
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:19,850
[Mystery Forest]

366
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,320
Your Holiness.

367
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,020
Why are you here in person?

368
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:36,100
I thought

369
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,510
you only care about the new king now,

370
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,560
and you've long forgotten about me.

371
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,730
Your Holiness.

372
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:46,960
You got me wrong.

373
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:50,330
Since you sent me to spy on the old Demon King,

374
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:52,320
I've never dared to slack off.

375
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,300
I kept you updated

376
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,650
every time I got any news.

377
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,800
It's just the new Demon King appeared out of the blue.

378
00:26:58,180 --> 00:26:58,850
Besides,

379
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,720
he's not stupid like the old Demon King.

380
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,140
I was afraid that I might alert him,

381
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,020
so I didn't dare to take any action.

382
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,810
I've been waiting for a chance.

383
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,800
Please forgive me,

384
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,780
Your Holiness.

385
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,130
Rise.

386
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,670
Thank you, Your Holiness.

387
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,590
I do have something

388
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,470
to ask you.

389
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,450
Please go ahead, Your Holiness.

390
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,350
Are all the Golden Core Great Demons in the Mystery Forest

391
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,790
locked in the Demon King's Mansion?

392
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,270
Indeed.

393
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,940
The new Demon King

394
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,610
is meticulous.

395
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,740
In order to avoid any future trouble,

396
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,490
he dealt with the problem from the roots.

397
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:41,830
Now all the Golden Core Great Demons in the Mystery Forest

398
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,610
are locked in the Demon King's Mansion.

399
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,590
I need another Golden Core.

400
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,110
I should do anything as you order,

401
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:52,420
Your Holiness.

402
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,980
But you know that

403
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,980
if I take action in the Demon King's Mansion,

404
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,570
the Demon King

405
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,390
will definitely suspect me.

406
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,470
So...

407
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,780
You're right.

408
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:10,990
If you are exposed,

409
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,350
it won't be worth it.

410
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,400
You are so wise, Your Holiness.

411
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:20,090
If I remember correctly,

412
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,640
you are also a Golden Core yourself, right?

413
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,760
Yes.

414
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,180
I wonder what you...

415
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,040
Why does Haoxuan want the Demon Core?

416
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,770
What's the secret behind

417
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,430
him doing this?

418
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,060
I should

419
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,480
inform Chu Kong about this as soon as possible.

420
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,510
Here.

421
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,200
So Zihui ran away in this direction.

422
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,320
He should be in this forest.

423
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,640
This forest is unfathomable.

424
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,480
It's surrounded by miasma all year round.

425
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,500
It's rare for demons to go there.

426
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,120
It's actually a good place to hide.

427
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,520
But

428
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,700
how could he expose

429
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,980
his lair so easily?

430
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,270
Could it be that

431
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:59,320
he is deliberately misleading us?

432
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:06,100
Xiuming's letter.

433
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,820
Why does Haoxuan want the Demon Core?

434
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:17,990
Also,

435
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,440
could the person behind Zihui

436
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:21,060
be him?

437
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,670
His ambition

438
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,650
has never dissipated.

439
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,090
You knew it?

440
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:32,600
So,

441
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,500
you pretended to die and hid in the Mystery Forest

442
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,150
to keep away from him, right?

443
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,020
I know

444
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:46,870
what you hate to see the most

445
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,620
is fratricidal conflict.

446
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,650
Now,

447
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,050
you can't avoid it anymore.

448
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,460
He has been doing evil deeds for 30,000 years.

449
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,520
I can't let him make any more mistakes.

450
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:04,610
In life,

451
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,260
everything won't go as we wish.

452
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,630
As long as we have a clear conscience

453
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,390
about what we do.

454
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,250
Why are you here in the Mystery Forest, Your Holiness?

455
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,500
Of course some magical barriers

456
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,670
couldn't stop me.

457
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:06,740
It just consumed a bit more divine power.

458
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:16,450
This is the Demon Core of the last Demon Core Great Demon.

459
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,180
I'm here to give it to you personally.

460
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,030
Now that all the seven Demon Cores are collected,

461
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,720
don't waste any more time.

462
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,010
I'll activate the Demon-Vanishing Formation for you

463
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,070
as promised.

464
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,470
But before that,

465
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,060
please give me the antidote first.

466
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,080
Are you bargaining

467
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,120
with me?

468
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,710
You must be joking, Your Holiness.

469
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:48,850
My only value

470
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,470
to you

471
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,410
is to activate the Demon-Vanishing Formation.

472
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:53,990
What if

473
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,780
after the Demon-Vanishing Formation is activated,

474
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,750
you refuse to fulfill your promise?

475
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,260
If so,

476
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,310
what should I do?

477
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:03,530
Please forgive me.

478
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,470
After all, that woman's life

479
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,000
concerns my Stone Heart.

480
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,310
I dare not take the risk.

481
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:16,860
All right.

482
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,720
Thank you, Your Holiness.

483
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,870
There will be a full moon

484
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,600
tomorrow night.

485
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,260
The demonic power will be at its best by then.

486
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,710
I'll activate the Demon-Vanishing Formation

487
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,210
for you as promised.

488
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,510
You should be even more cautious

489
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:33,650
when it's about to end.

490
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,030
No major mistake

491
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,210
is allowed.

492
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,580
Immortal Sun.

493
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,530
We haven't talked.

494
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,320
What's up?

495
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,820
Don't play dumb.

496
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,880
I've been watching you for a while.

497
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,810
You've been stalking His Holiness in secret lately.

498
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,390
Tell me.

499
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,020
What are your intentions?

500
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,140
Why do you say that, Immortal Sun?

501
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,260
I was just bored,

502
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,880
so I took a walk in the Mortal Realm.

503
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:10,960
Fine.

504
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
It's fine if you don't want to admit it.

505
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,219
I can only report this

506
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:16,520
to His Holiness

507
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,699
and let him

508
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:18,980
make his own judgments.

509
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:21,960
Stop.

510
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:22,750
I'm still here.

511
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,469
What’s up?

512
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,179
You're right. I've been stalking

513
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,530
His Holiness.

514
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:29,969
I knew it.

515
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:31,739
I knew it.

516
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,949
I've been watching you for a long time.

517
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,760
You must be up to something,

518
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,120
approaching His Holiness.

519
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,920
Tell me.

520
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:40,469
I followed Haoxuan

521
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:41,690
because

522
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,300
I found that

523
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:45,750
he's been in contact with the Demon Clan secretly.

524
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:46,870
Just now,

525
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,679
I saw him go to the Mystery Forest,

526
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,310
killed a Great Demon, and took his Demon Core

527
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,570
with my own eyes.

528
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,660
You are framing His Holiness now?

529
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,160
How dare you!

530
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,280
I'm telling the truth.

531
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,620
I have a clear conscience.

532
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:04,530
If you don't believe me,

533
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,880
you can investigate it yourself.

534
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,140
If you find

535
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,900
anything false in my words,

536
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,320
you can still

537
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,410
expose me.

538
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,370
I... I'm loyal to His Holiness.

539
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,960
Don't you think you can make

540
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,790
my loyalty to His Holiness waver

541
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,870
with just a few words.

542
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,590
I've never doubted your loyalty to Haoxuan.

543
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:23,900
All these years,

544
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,760
you've been obedient to him

545
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,700
and served him meticulously.

546
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,300
You've always been at his service.

547
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,090
That's what I should do as his subordinate.

548
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,260
So you should know better than anyone

549
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,990
how Immortal Li

550
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,870
died, right?

551
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,910
What kind of person is

552
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,130
the God you've been serving faithfully

553
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,600
all these years?

554
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:48,420
Have you never doubted that?

555
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:00,120
I'm more than loyal to His Holiness.

556
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:00,710
I...

557
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,960
Haoxuan is lucky

558
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,610
to have such a loyal subordinate like you.

559
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,410
But have you thought about it?

560
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,660
If Haoxuan really has the ambition

561
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,710
to endanger the six realms,

562
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,790
are you going to keep ignoring right from wrong

563
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:12,550
and

564
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,620
watch him take more and more wrong steps?

565
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,180
Is that what you call loyalty?

566
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:30,760
Think about it.

567
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:33,780
Are you going to help him

568
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,920
do more sins,

569
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,390
or repent before it's too late

570
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,470
and stop him from making more mistakes?

571
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,410
Sorry for doing you wrong

572
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:58,930
these days.

573
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,980
No.

574
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,670
I also treated you like this before.

575
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,690
I deserve

576
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,880
all that.

577
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,290
Now,

578
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:17,370
the poison in your body has been detoxified.

579
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,140
You don't have to stay here anymore.

580
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:23,640
Go somewhere beautiful

581
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:25,590
and open another clinic.

582
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,330
Keep on curing the sick

583
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,860
and saving lives.

584
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:32,520
Why are you willing to let me go?

585
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,040
Don't you

586
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,550
hate me?

587
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,660
How can I not hate you

588
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,650
for taking my heart?

589
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,520
Since we parted in the State of Qi,

590
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,990
I've been looking for you.

591
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,370
I thought the reason why I looked for you

592
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,540
was hatred,

593
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,040
resentment,

594
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,820
and the Stone Heart.

595
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,960
All of this

596
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,550
was just self-deception.

597
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,710
But later, I gradually realized

598
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,710
you only took my Stone Heart

599
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:04,120
because you didn't want me to fall into the hands of Jin Lian.

600
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,440
You know that?

601
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:08,770
Everything

602
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:10,570
was just a quirk of fate.

603
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,090
If you really want me dead,

604
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:16,070
I would have been killed by Jin Lian long ago.

605
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,330
But

606
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:23,510
I did hurt you.

607
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,680
I...

608
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,640
It wasn't your fault.

609
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,120
You've been through too much yourself.

610
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,350
This time,

611
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,270
if it weren't for me,

612
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,220
you wouldn't have barged into the Demon King's Mansion by yourself,

613
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,280
nor fallen into Haoxuan's hands.

614
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:39,990
So,

615
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,290
you know everything

616
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,420
that I did.
