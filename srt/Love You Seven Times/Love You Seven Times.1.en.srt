Among them, the leader of Moluo, Cang Hai,

141
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,340
had supreme divine power,

142
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,140
and hence was respected as the head of the six realms.

143
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,660
However, according to the Heavenly Divine Oracle,

144
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,860
the empress Cang Hai

145
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,530
will eventually turn into a devil that will exterminate the world.

146
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,720
The people in the six realms were plunged into misery

147

and were in danger.

148
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,970
But at that moment,

a heroic young man with an imposing demeanor

150

descended from the sky

151
00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:34,490
and fought with the devil Cang Hai.

152
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,190
This young man sacrificed half of his primordial spirit

153
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,020
and finally annihilated the devil Cang Hai,

154
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,740
and brought peace back to the six realms.

155
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,700
That's horrifying.

156
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,220

one who loses their position and influence

173
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,980
may be subjected to much indignity.

has finally decided to go to the mortal world.

177
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:46,000
He's going to fall into the embrace of a fairy.

178
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:48,860
Why are you hesitating?

179
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,000

00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,060
Xiangyun, oh Xiangyun.

192
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,500
You sure are clever.

193
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,510
Judging from the situation,

194
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,180
there might

195
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,280
even be some spirit stones left over.

196
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,940
I can bring Red Thread Master and my sisters

197
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,200
on a trip to the other celestial regions.

198
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,300
I'll offer 500.

199
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,980
500?

200
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:13,860
That much?

201
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,260
Okay.

202
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,340
Everyone,

203
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,590
let's congratulate

204
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,420
-this...
-I'll offer 10,000 spirit stones.

205
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,390
10,000?

206
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,430
Who is that?

207
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,660
Who is that?

208
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,870
And I'll add a Nuwa Stone.

209
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,040
[Princess of the Eastern Sea, Yingshi]

210
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,690
A Nuwa Stone?

211
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,790
Why?

212
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,040
Is it not enough?

213
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,350
It's enough.

214
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,460
Of course it's enough.

215
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,450
Princess Yingshi.

216
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,520
From now on,

217
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,680
Immortal Chu Kong is yours.

218
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,980
Let's all congratulate

219
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,420
Princess Yingshi.

220
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,530
Congratulations, Princess.

221
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:38,240
[Mount Moluo]

222
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:41,890
Lord Protector, I'm here to report that

223
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,460
we've finally found the ancient artifact, Nuwa Stone.

224
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,860
It's now in the Heaven Realm.

225
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:48,290
As long as we get the Nuwa Stone,

226
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,630
we will have a chance to revive the monarch Cang Hai.

227
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:52,810
Lord Protector.

228
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,490
[Protector of the Moluo Divine Clan, Jin Lian]

229
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,070
We are always on standby.

230
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,690
We are always on standby.

231
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,740
The Heaven Realm killed my monarch,

232
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,970
slaughtered my people,

233
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,280
and regarded my Moluo Divine Clan

234
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:13,120
as a threat to the six realms.

235
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:16,880
Now,

236
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,350
Monarch Cang Hai is about to return.

237
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,520
It's been 30,000 years.

238
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:23,480
[Guard of the Moluo Divine Clan, Xie Feng]

239
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,150
I've been waiting for this moment for 30,000 years.

240
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,520
[Southern Heavenly Gate]

241
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:38,220
Your Holiness.

242
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,700
The Moluo Clan is approaching aggressively.

243
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,210
[Immortal Sun]

244
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:40,800
I'm afraid

245
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,030
the God of War has to come forward.

246
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,280
In order to restore his primordial spirit,

247
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,220
Chu Kong is currently in seclusion.

248
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,580
If we force him out,

249
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,480
I'm afraid it might backfire.

250
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,390
[Heavenly Emperor Haoxuan]

251
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,140
But now the Heaven Realm

252
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,380
is in danger.

253
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,340
The safety of everyone depends on him alone.

254
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,570
We can't wait any longer.

255
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:23,940
This way.

256
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,450
I remember clearly that they were here.

257
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,680
[Ancient God of War, Chu Kong]

258
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:27,610
You...

259
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,270
Jin Lian.

260
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,490
I just took a nap,

261
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,780
and you've managed to make the Heaven Realm so lively.

262
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:36,050
Indeed,

263
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,030
you're unbelievably stupid.

264
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:40,620
Enough with the nonsense.

265
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,080
Bind.

266
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,620
Hurry!

267
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,700
Keep that safe.

268
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,370
The Book of Marriage Prayers is the secret of the Heavenly Palace.

269
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,290
Jin Qilin?

270
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,450
Chu Kong?

271
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,319
Heaven and earth are turned upside down

272
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,119
right in front of us.

273
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:19,859
Could it be...

274
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:27,700
that he is... the God of War, Immortal Chu Kong?

275
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,580
[Chief of the Fate Bureau, Goddess of Fate]

276
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:06,920
The Heavenly Divine Oracle?

277
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:18,100
[Cang Hai will be resurrected within a thousand years]

278
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:17,730
Within 1,000 years,

279
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,830
Cang Hai will be resurrected.

280
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:22,640
Cang Hai will be resurrected?

281
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,540
Really?

282
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,260
Your Holiness.

283
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,690
If the calculations of the Fate Bureau are right,

284
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,380
the Heavenly Divine Oracle says that

285
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:32,830
the six realms

286
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,540
will face a calamity.

287
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:36,900
Your Holiness.

288
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:37,940
30,000 years ago,

289
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,200
although Immortal Chu Kong

290
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,900
personally killed that demon Cang Hai,

291
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,140
he lost half of his primordial spirit

292
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,690
and even lost all his memories

293
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,420
before and after that battle.

294
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,990
He paid a heavy price.

295
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,980
This time, he failed in his seclusion

296
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,010
and his primordial spirit was damaged.

297
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,880
Besides, after the battle with Jin Lian,

298
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,350
the recovery is becoming increasingly sluggish.

299
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,140
With the current divine power of the God of War,

300
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,420
I'm afraid...

301
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,940
A thousand years are merely a moment's time.

302
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,420
In that case,

303
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,060
isn't the disaster

304
00:19:02,970 --> 00:19:04,780
of the six realms near?

305
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,150
What should we do?

306
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,700
Everyone, don't worry.

307
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,230
Even if the devil comes back to life,

308
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,800
I’m confident I can kill him again.

309
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,740
In that case,

310
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,820
everyone,

311
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:29,930
why are you so worried?

312
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,600
There is the God of War Chu Kong in our Heaven Realm.

313
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,120
There's no need to be afraid of that devil.

314
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:37,580
So,

315
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,260
dismiss.

316
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,460
Chu Kong.

317
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,920
It's been 30,000 years.

318
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,800
You've tried all kinds of methods,

319
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,540
but your primordial spirit hasn't fully recovered.

320
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,490
In these 81 hardships,

321
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,860
you're only without

322
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:06,940
the love tribulation.

323
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,300
Love tribulation?

324
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,480
I know you hate romantic love the most.

325
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,500
But now,

326
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,190
this is the only method you haven't tried.

327
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,180
I

328
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,330
have arranged for the Marriage Pavilion to help find you a match.

329
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,320
If you can overcome this love tribulation,

330
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,810
it might help you restore your primordial spirit.

331
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,040
Don't worry, Your Divinity.

332
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,410
I won't let anything happen to the six realms.

333
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,260
Chu Kong.

334
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:42,940
I'm

335
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,330
still worried about you.

336
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:54,290
Xiangyun.

337
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,700
The Red Thread Master and Immortal Li are worried about you.

338
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:58,650
I'm fine.

339
00:20:59,300 --> 00:20:59,730
By the way,

340
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,540
was that yellow-haired fellow just now

341
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,070
really the God of War of the six realms,

342
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,910
Immortal Chu Kong?

343
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,740
Didn't you say

344
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,060
he's an ancient immortal

345
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,450
who's over 50,000 years old?

346
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,700
I heard that he knows the magic for eternal youth,

347
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,800
which means his magic prowess is unfathomable.

348
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:14,980
Who would have thought

349
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,980
a 50,000-year-old man would be able

350
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,770
to maintain himself so well?

351
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,190
Are you really going to

352
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:21,980
set the two of them up?

353
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:23,620
Well,

354
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:24,940
you heard what the Red Thread Master said

355
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,970
the last time.

356
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,110
If we can't help

357
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,860
Immortal Chu Kong find a match,

358
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,370
our Marriage Pavilion will be gone.

359
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,000
It's a pity that my Nuwa Stone

360
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,980
left me

361
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,140
before I could appreciate it properly.

362
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,970
Instead of being heartbroken about external belongings,

363
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,650
you'd better think about

364
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,780
how to tie this relationship.

365
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,640
With His Divinity's divine power,

366
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,310
perhaps when you

367
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,460
just get close to him,

368
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:52,450
you'll be...

369
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:56,960
What

370
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:58,830
silly plans are you thinking about again?

371
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:00,640
Don't do anything stupid.

372
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,380
How can you call a good deed stupid?

373
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,410
We just need to keep it a secret from Red Thread Master.

374
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,570
Wait for my good news.

375
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:09,780
Xiangyun.

376
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,030
Xiangyun.

377
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:19,470
What are you doing?

378
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,060
What are you doing?

379
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,590
You're so childish.

380
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,470
How dare you steal an ancient magical artifact?

381
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,250
This is the treasure of your Pavilion.

382
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,120
If the Red Thread Master finds out you touched his treasure,

383
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,260
he will cry and make a scene again.

384
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,850
To deal with the ancient God of War,

385
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,050
we must use ancient magical artifacts.

386
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:42,510
I heard that

387
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,230
even if there's zero possibility

388
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,460
for two people who are not meant to be,

389
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,440
as long as they are connected by this Love Knot,

390
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,300
they'll definitely be tied into

391
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,070
an unbreakable bond of love.

392
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:53,840
An ancient magical artifact?

393
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,740
Since we're here,

394
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,420
I'll

395
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,700
help you check this out at least.

396
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,290
Ouch, it's hot!

397
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,400
Something is wrong with this thing.

398
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,740
Something is wrong?

399
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,220
No.

400
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,100
I-I just...

401
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:41,810
It-It-It...

402
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,790
When is Immortal Chu Kong the most relaxed?

403
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:50,280
You should know that.

404
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,410
[Star Platform]

405
00:23:57,810 --> 00:24:00,130
You can try your luck at the Star Platform.

406
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,670
That is the place where the spiritual power of Heaven and Earth is the strongest.

407
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,310
His Divinity occasionally sleeps at the Star Platform

408
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,630
to absorb the spiritual power and restore his primordial spirit.

409
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:17,630
Greetings, Your Divinity.

410
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,540
Greetings, Your Divinity.

411
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,860
Why is someone from the Marriage Pavilion

412
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,370
here at the Star Platform?

413
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,820
I...

414
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,500
am here to repay you for saving my life.

415
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,070
Really?

416
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,210
The way you're repaying me

417
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,510
is really interesting.

418
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,340
You were by my side just now.

419
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,230
If I didn’t stop you…

420
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,220
what were you trying to do?

421
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,810
I-I...

422
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,690
I was...

423
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,270
Who do you think you are?

424
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,160
How dare you act recklessly in front of me.

425
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,740
Please spare my life.

426
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,400
Please spare my life.

427
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,230
I'm innocent.

428
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:18,160
I just saw that you were alone

429
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,270
and seemed lonely.

430
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,700
So I wanted to do something

431
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,520
for you within my capabilities.

432
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,700
That's why I wanted to arrange a blissful marriage

433
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,780
for you.

434
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:28,020
As for why

435
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,140
I almost touched your face just now,

436
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,220
it's because I thought

437
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,640
you seemed familiar

438
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,100
and I had a feeling of reunion.

439
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,780
Familiar?

440
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,670
Stand up.

441
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,390
Raise your head

442
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,670
for me.

443
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,720
I finally found you.

444
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:14,900
Xiangyun.

445
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,520
You auctioned my love

446
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,140
and disregarded the laws of heaven

447
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,210
and violated the divine dignity.

448
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:29,030
Pass my message.

449
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,650
The Marriage Pavilion...

450
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,040
Tear it down.

451
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,640
The Marriage Pavilion can't be destroyed in my hands.

452
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,360
If I fulfill His Holiness' order

453
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,380
and make a contribution,

454
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,290
I wonder if he'll spare the Marriage Pavilion.

455
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:43,570
Whatever.

456
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,210
I'll risk it.

457
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:45,990
Your Divinity.

458
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:27,880
I...

459
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:28,920
This...

460
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:30,420
I don't know

461
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,940
how to untie this Love Knot.

462
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:32,460
I...

463
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:33,690
I know how to.

464
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:43,530
Your Divinity.

465
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:45,950
Are you going to cut off my hand

466
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,370
or slash me?

467
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,260
What do you think?

468
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:22,660
Wait.

469
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:23,910
Don't come over.

470
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,590
If you come any closer,

471
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:27,080
I'll jump.

472
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,100
Your Divinity, consider it carefully.

473
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,940
If I jump into this Mortal World Well,

474
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,420
in the vastness of the six realms,

475
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:35,720
you won't be able to find me.

476
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:38,370
If you jump into the broken Mortal World Well,

477
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,740
and fall into the Mysterious Realm,

478
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,240
or the Boundless Realm,

479
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,260
you could very well die.

480
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:49,900
Don't you know?

481
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,780
Even if I fall into the Boundless Realm or the Mysterious Realm,

482
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,020
I won't let you stop me.

483
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,120
I... Don't move!

484
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,260
I'm really going to jump.

485
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,920
Then jump.

486
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:03,750
I...

487
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:11,330
Your Divinity.

488
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,430
I suddenly thought it over.

489
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,580
I think there might be some misunderstandings between us.

490
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,680
I can explain.

491
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,170
It's not necessary.

492
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:02,880
Thank goodness.

493
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,140
It's the mortal world.

494
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,240
It's the mortal world.

495
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:13,970
How could I

496
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,780
actually control

497
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,200
these two little cute paws?

498
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,660
Wait.

499
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,340
Have I…

500
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,800
become a tiger after getting into a tribulation?

501
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:32,010
A boar?

502
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,690
It's you?

503
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:35,160
Immortal Chu Kong?

504
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:37,470
Immortal Chu Kong

505
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,750
actually turned into

506
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,600
an ugly boar!

507
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,350
You...

508
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,420
Pig Kong?

509
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:44,800
Sorry.

510
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:45,390
Chu Kong.

511
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,870
Immortal Chu Kong.

512
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,450
Immortal Chu Kong.

513
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,910
Wait for me!

514
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,610
Wait for me!

515
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:57,680
Your Divinity.

516
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,620
Your Divinity.

517
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,130
Don't worry.

518
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,640
I won't tell anyone

519
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,170
that you became

520
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,050
a boar.

521
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,690
My glorious reputation

522
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,440
cannot be tarnished.

523
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:19,260
I have to

524
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:21,830
erase

525
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:24,030
her

526
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:25,450
memory!

527
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,220
Oh no.

528
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,960
I forgot that during tribulations,

529
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:35,930
immortals can't use their magic.

530
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,130
Looks like

531
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,500
I have to be his bootlick

532
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,840
to stay alive.

533
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:44,850
Your Divinity.

534
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,150
Your Divinity.

535
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:53,410
Your Divinity.

536
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,330
Your Divinity.

537
00:32:59,590 --> 00:32:59,960
Go.

538
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,340
Go away.

539
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,330
Don't come near me.

540
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,080
Your Divinity.

541
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:15,910
What are you doing?

542
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,230
Don’t follow me.

543
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,190
I need to go back.

544
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
Be careful, Your Divinity!

545
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,220
How dare you!

546
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,510
Are you afraid that you won't die tragically enough

547
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,220
when you go back?

548
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,550
My leg is cramping.

549
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,800
Stay still.

550
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,790
Let me pull you up.

551
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:02,770
Let's have a look.

552
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:03,190
Let's go.

553
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:23,890
Perfect timing.

554
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,280
In tribulations,

555
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,450
when my mortal body dies,

556
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,420
I'll be returned to my immortal self.

557
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:28,650
Don't be afraid, Your Divinity.

558
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,670
I'll protect you with my life.

559
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,330
Go away.

560
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:32,910
Don't ruin my plan.

561
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:37,900
Don't worry.

562
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,980
I won't let them hurt you.

563
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,860
Can you...

564
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:47,500
Your Divinity.

565
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,370
Calm down.

566
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:49,970
Get lost!

567
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,070
Your Divinity.

568
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,090
Get lost!

569
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:56,420
Your Divinity, don't go over there.

570
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,100
Don't make trouble for me.

571
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:58,850
Immortal Chu Kong.

572
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,020
Be good.

573
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,260
Don't try to be a hero.

574
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,050
It's time for me to show my loyalty.

575
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:16,740
Your Divinity.

576
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,280
You should believe

577
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:21,100
that I'm loyal to you now.

578
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,320
You mess things up

579
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:23,600
all the time!

580
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,720
When I return to Heaven Realm,

581
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,100
I'll settle the score with you.

582
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,530
Isn't this

583
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,830
too disgraceful?
