Last time,

89
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:11,090

90
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:12,740

91
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,140
They won't dare to do it again.

92

102
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,350
he became the biggest beneficiary.

103
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,780
But as far as I know,

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,590
he has always been loyal and devoted

105
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,740
to Master Yang.

106
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,350

108
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,900
Master Yang was gentle.

109
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,910
In the martial world,

110
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,120
he had no enemies.

111
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,780
But if we have to talk about people he had disputes with, there were

112
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,940

113

and Jinwu Sect's Leader, Xu Wenrui.

115
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,220
Go and investigate...

116
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,240
if any of them

117
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,980
are secretly raising warriors of sacrifice.

118
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,980
Yes, sir.

119
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,850
Don't tell me Xiaoxiang

120
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,700
is experimenting with explosives again?

121
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,440
She is experimenting with her cooking

122
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,090
to cook delicious food for me.

123
00:07:48,659 --> 00:07:50,250
She’s so devoted to Sect Leader.

124

That's great.

127

Then...

128
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,270

have fallen in love with Sect Leader?

130
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,580
In the whole of Mount Shengling,

131
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,130
there are 70 to 80 disciples in the sect.

132
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:07,330
With Sect Leader's literary and military skills,

133
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,880
he's able to manage this many people so well.

134
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,900
The love between a man and a woman

135
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
is naturally

136
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,300
not difficult for him to handle too.

137
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,740
Love between a man and a woman

138
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,260
is just a game between two people.

139
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,390

140
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,140

145

148
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,500

149

You've improved.

150
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,700
Then,

151
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,030
do I get a reward?

152
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,320
Sect Leader.

153
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,020
Why hasn't there been any changes

154
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,280
to Xiaoxiang's Linglong Heart?

155
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,460
All we need to do is to let those with a Linglong Heart

156
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,360
have their lips and teeth touch.

157
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,420
The heart will then glow.

158
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,040
It seems

159
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,900

the woman's heart

164
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,340
is the most puzzling mystery in the world.

165
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,220
It's not just the back and forth between two people.

166
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,930
The path to one's heart

167
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,340
is no less that a battle between thousands of troops and horses.

168

169
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,370
Don’t underestimate the enemy.

170
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,700
A battle between thousands of troops and horses?

171
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,420
In that case,

172
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,880
with the matters of love,

173
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,830
military tactics

174
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,980

175
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:54,660
That's right.

176
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:56,730
I think

177
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,740
you should know her preferences

178
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,460
to attract her secretly

179
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,300
and get closer to her gradually.

Tell me about it.

185

00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,600
Why is Master so serious?

193
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,490
Is he

194
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,410
going to confess?

That's great.

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,470
Why did you give her a pig instead of

a cat or a dog?

225
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,100
Will any lady like pigs?

I know her well.

00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,590
Because to her,

00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,270
a pig represents a special person.

we get Xiaoxiang to change its name?

Forget it.

When Xiaoxiang sees what you did for her,

248

she will definitely be very grateful

249
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,220

What is this again?

This

253
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,260
is the Braised Pork I made.

254
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:51,060
I didn't expect it

255
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,460
to be easier than frying, boiling and roasting.

256
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,540
I succeeded in one try.

257
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,150
This...

258
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,250
Don't tell me this is...

259
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,460
Its meat

260
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,380
is fresh and tender.

261
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,180
It's just the right balance of fat and lean meat.

262
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,460
It'd be a waste not to use it to make

263

I think Sect Leader

273
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,720
has no appetite.

274
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,190
I'll eat it if he doesn't want to.

275
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,340
It shouldn't go to waste.

276
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,120
Don’t eat it!

277
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,760
I think Sect Leader must be angry today.

00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,860
That day, at Leyi House,

282
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,800
was Master...

283
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,020
was he mad at me?

284
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,280
Of course not.

285
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,290
But Master used the excuse of practicing his swordsmanship

286
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,550
to shred all the crabapple flowers I picked.

287
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:34,900
I didn't even get to make my crabapple cakes,

288
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,480
and I had to sweep the whole afternoon instead.

289
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,040
And today,

290
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,950
to make this dish of Braised Pork,

291
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,980
I spent the whole morning just plucking out its hair.

292
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,100
But he didn't even have a bite.

293
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,540
Xiaoxiang.

294
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,510

00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:57,670
Stinky?

296
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,580

297
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,500
Master.

298
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,870
Stinky!

299
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,130
I knew you gave Stinky to me.

300
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:23,380
But my room is too small.

301
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,600
So I left it in the Vegetable Shed

302
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,910
and asked Uncle Liu to take care of it for me.

303
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,450
By the way...

304
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:30,740
Master,

305
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,930
you didn't have lunch.

306
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:33,000
Have a snack to tide you over

307
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:34,160
and have some tea.

308
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,070
Got it.

309
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,060
Sect Leader.

310
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,790
The dish of Braised Pork Xiaoxiang made

311
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:48,760
was actually made with the pork belly

312
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,460
I asked Uncle Liu to buy the day before.

313
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,200
She said she had to boil it

314
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,000
and pluck its hair.

315
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,420
It took her a lot of effort.

316
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,570
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

317
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,490
What a waste.

318
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,620
Sect Leader, maybe

319
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:05,660
you should

320
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,260
try to stand in her shoes and think about how Xiaoxiang feels.

321
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:11,830
Then maybe you can win her heart.

322
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,260
What you just said

323
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:19,700
makes sense.

324
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,900
Usually, I've always asked Xiaoxiang to cook for me.

325
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,980
Then I'll personally work the kitchen knife

326
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,300
and make her a family feast.

327
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,720
That’s a good idea.

328
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,680
Chief is willing to condescend

329
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:39,840
to cook for Xiaoxiang.

330
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:41,030
It's simple

331
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:42,330
and sincere.

332
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,720
I'm sure you can win Xiaoxiang's heart.

333
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:47,770
She will like it.

334
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,140
Right?

335
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,000
Am I right?

336
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:11,810
Sect Leader.

337
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:12,750
Well,

338
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,420
kitchen knives and swords are not used

339
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,830
in the same way.

340
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,680
Sect Leader.

341
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,710
How about

342
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,720
you let us help you?

343
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,260
Yes.

344
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,750
Is it that hard?

345
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,660
Sect Leader.

346
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,300
I’m fine!

347
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,220
No one is allowed to come and help!

348
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,440
I can do it by myself!

349
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,840
So Xiaoxiang's expertise in explosives

350
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,470
was imparted from Master.

351
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,790
This is so easy for me!

352
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,660
So easy...

353
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,420
Master,

354
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,900
you made all of these?

355
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,430
Yes.

356
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,740
These are all dishes

357
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,330
that Master specially made for Xiaoxiang.

358
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,350
This is Stir-fried Chicken with Crabapple Flowers.

359
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,700
This is Steamed Linglong Buns.

360
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,510
This is Mushroom Soup.

361
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,330
Come on, Qian Ren and Qian Mou.

362
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,300
Sit down with us and have a taste.

363
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:51,700
Thank you, Sect Leader.

364
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,450
Thank you, Sect Leader.

365
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:57,700
But

366
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,430
why are the pieces of chicken

367
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,830
red?

368
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,490
Are they not cooked?

369
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,890
I stir-fried them with some crabapple flowers,

370
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,100
so I think they were stained.

371
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:10,500
I stir-fried the chicken myself.

372
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,880
They must be cooked.

373
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,110
Forget it.

374
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,700
How about

375
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,490
we have the main dish first?

376
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:28,460
Here.

377
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:28,860
Okay.

378
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,980
This dish of Steamed Linglong Buns...

379
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,460
It's...

380
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,590
Xiaoxiang.

381
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:46,360
Have some soup first.

382
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,600
Yes.

383
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:51,230
Here, let me get you some soup.

384
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,060
This Mushroom Soup is especially delicious.

385
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,820
Here.

386
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,180
Thank you.

387
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,640
This Mushroom Soup is so delicious.

388
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:09,660
The Mushroom Soup made by Master

389
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,180
is indeed delicious.

390
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:10,990
Here, Sect Leader.

391
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,150
Let me get you a bowl too.

392
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,180
Here.

393
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,620
Here.

394
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,180
Mou.

395
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,930
This soup should belong in Heaven.

396
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,470
What a privilege to taste it in the mortal world.

397
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,030
It's delicious.

398
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:31,780
I'll have one more bowl.

399
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,980
It's delicious.

400
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,660
It's delicious.

401
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,620
It's delicious.

402
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,860
Master.

403
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,560
Where did you buy the mushrooms?

404
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,940
Let's change the subject.

405
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,040
I heard an explosion at the back of the mountain today.

406
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,180
What happened?

407
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,920
Next subject.

408
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,500
Are we still in the mortal world?

409
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,050
Ask the one on your right.

410
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,540
Ren.

411
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,880
Lu Qianren!

412
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,080
What time is it now?

413
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,450
What time is it?

414
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,950
I-It's around 7p.m. to 9 p.m.

415
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:28,260
Here.

416
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,260
One pill for each person.

417
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,640
If you take this medicine

418
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,120
and persevere until the sun rises tomorrow,

419
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,510
you should be fine.

420
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,060
Everyone, let's chat.

421
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,440
Don't close your eyes.

422
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,200
If you close them,

423
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,550
they might be closed forever.

424
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,540
Senior Ren.

425
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:02,030
I didn't expect

426
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,520
your surname to be Lu.

427
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,480
Fang’s surname is also Lu.

428
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,120
Many of our sect's disciples are surnamed Lu.

429
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,830
Because our ancestors

430
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,590
all came from the military.

431
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,850
They followed a general surnamed Lu

432
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,800
and received his help.

433
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,430
So everyone

434
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,250
used the surname Lu.

435
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,680
I still remember when I was young,

436
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,820
we had no food for years.

437
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,820
Master brought us here from outside.

438
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,880
When you were young?

439
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:40,610
At that time,

440
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,560
wasn't Master also just a child?

441
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,350
Yes.

442
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,370
But Sect Leader

443
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,990
was already full of great wisdom

444
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,820
and decisive at that time.

445
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,140
It was as if he has lived for tens of thousands of years.

446
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,060
I

447
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,370
usually call it

448
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,830
precocity.

449
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,260
So, is Senior Mou's full name

450
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,250
Lu Qianmou?

451
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:13,410
No.

452
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,660
I'm just Qian Mou.

453
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,230
I was a commoner.

454
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,630
I was brought back from the bottom of the mountain.

455
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,810
Yes, he was brought back from outside.

456
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,060
I'm...

457
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,100
a swordsman who traverses the dark,

458
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,130
Qian Mou.

459
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,700
I'm...

460
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,890
a physician who walks under the sun, Qian Ren.

461
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,860
We are...

462
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,700
Shengling's Dynamic Duo!

463
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,730
Master.

464
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,640
Are you not feeling well?

465
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,040
The mushrooms were not cooked thoroughly.

466
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,330
They were so poisonous.

467
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,750
Master.

468
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,650
Thank you for your family feast.

469
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,430
This is my happiest day

470
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,090
since I've been at Shengling Sect.

471
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,170
Did you like

472
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:31,850
my cooking?

473
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,620
Yes.

474
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,540
In that case,

475
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,180
tomorrow, I'll...

476
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:46,880
Master!

477
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:47,700
Master!

478
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,060
Sect Leader!

479

No!

480

No!

482
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,500
No!

483
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,620
Master, no!

484

No!

485

No!

486
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,310
What a bunch of fools.

487
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:06,700
Dummy.

488
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,900
Dummy!

489
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,460
I'm here.

490
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,090
Here! Here!

491
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:22,220
Come here.

492
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:23,730
Hurry and come here.

493
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,050
You're the one talking?

494
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:31,580
Little Stone Goblin.

495
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,900
I knew you could hear me.

496
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,900
Not many people here know I'm a goblin.

497
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:41,860
Don't worry.

498
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,530
You're the only one

499
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,860
that can hear me talk.

500
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,160
I'm the only one that can hear you talk?

501

Don't tell me this is...

Sect Leader.

504
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,140
On the mountain,

505
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,440
I met a flower fairy.

506
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:58,650
Look.

507
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,480
She has my surname now.

508
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:03,370
Her name is

509
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:04,260
Qian Luo.

510
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,140
Qian Luo?

511
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:09,540
Sect Leader.

512
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,310
Qian Luo is also a girl.

513
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,860
If there's anything

514
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,980
about Xiaoxiang that you want to understand,

515
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,090
you can ask her for advice.

516
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,120
What does a flower know?

517
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:19,550
I’m enough

518
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,030
as Sect Leader's adviser.

519
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:25,740
Adviser Qian Mou.

520
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,330
The past few pieces of advice you gave me

521
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,780
were really

522
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,050
helpful indeed.

523
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,680
Sect Leader.

524
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,000
While I was poisoned for the past few days,

525
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:44,870
in the room,

526
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,880
I've been diligently

527
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,050
reading through a ton of romantic novels.

528
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,360
I finally found

529
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,080
the foolproof method to success.

530
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,150
Look.

531
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:02,300
The key to the transplantation of the Linglong Heart is

532
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,590
to make the other person possess

533
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:07,260
immense love for you such that they'd sacrifice their life for you.

534
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,630
This feeling is not fondness,

535
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,620
but

536
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,460
love.

537
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,180
But if you like someone for a long time,

538
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,840
doesn't it become love?

539
00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:16,890
No.

540
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:17,910
Look.

541
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,120
Life on the mountain of Shengling Sect

542
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,780
is too mundane.

543
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,570
Even if you treat Xiaoxiang really well,

544
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,330
she'd develop a little fondness for you

545
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,170
at most.

546
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:31,300
Only in critical moments

547
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,680
of life and death

548
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,370
would she become emotional

549
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,720
and would her heart beat faster.

550
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,390
Only then would she develop feelings of love for you.

551
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,130
Why do I always feel like

552
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,240
there's a trap in front

553
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,480
waiting for me to jump into it?

554
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:57,430
No.

00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,320
familiar?

577
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,860
Impossible.

578
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:37,310
This is my new book I wrote.

579
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,580
Forget it.

580
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,670
I’ll trust you one more time.

581
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,320
The first thing I have to do...

582
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:52,130
is to be stabbed?

583
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,070
No, no, no.

584
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,659
Sect Leader.

585
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,110
It's just acting.

586
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,370
Look.

587
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:12,850
The blood bag is ready.

588
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,440
The blood bag?

589
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,230
When you get attacked by the sword,

590
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,330
hold onto your wound

591
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,430
and shout out loud.

592
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:26,030
At that moment,

593
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,780
when the disciple who plays the thief receives the signal,

594
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,320
he'll slice the blood bag open.

595
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:32,740
Hold onto the wound

596
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,870
and shout out loud.

597
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,260
Sect Leader.

598
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,550
You can’t

599
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,620
be so stiff.

600
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,900
Although Xiaoxiang is young,

601
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,290
she's not stupid.

602
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,130
Sect Leader.

603
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,380
Your acting skills

604
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,020
won't be able to fool her.

605
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,620
Sect Leader, watch this.

606
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:03,660
Sect Leader.

607
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,360
Pay attention to the details of my hand.

608
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,540
You must hold onto the wound with strength.

609
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,240
The more miserable you look,

610
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,610
the more touched she will be.

611
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,380

612
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,110

613
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
For you...

614
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:33,950
it's all worth it.

615
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:35,730
I...

616
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,580
I love you.

617
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,040
Master.

618
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,190
I love you too.

619
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,340
I love you too.

620
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,510
Master, please be okay.

621
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,570
I can’t live without you.

622
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:56,870
Sect Leader.

623
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,220
Do you understand?

624
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,460
I am the great God of War of the six realms.

625
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,350
This time,

626
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,260
how did I end up

627
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,680
becoming an actor in such an exaggerated tragedy?

628
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,030
They even despise my acting as poor.

629
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:12,960
Well done, Immortal Li.

630
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,050
You are adding more abrupt plot points again.

Sect Leader.

632
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,420
This way of shouting does indeed

633
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:31,000
tarnish your noble image.

634
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,500
How about

635
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,790
we do a two-man act?

636
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,070
Yes.

637
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,320
You just need to be attacked by the sword

638
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,320
and the disciples will be responsible for the shouting.

639
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:49,260
Are you...

640
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:55,490
questioning my acting skills?

642
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:57,740
No, no, no.

643
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,980
Let's just act according to this book.

644
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,420
Before nightfall,

645
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,620
dozens of Shengling Sect's disciples

646
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,690
were gesturing around in this street,

647
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,340
as if they were discussing something.

648
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,140
They said that

649
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,200
the Sect Leader will take his favorite disciple down the mountain for shopping tomorrow.

650
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,810
But I don’t know why

651
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,730
they're going through all this trouble.

652
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,990
It wasn't easy for him to get Xiaoxiang to his side.

653
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,950
It's normal for him

654
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,500
to be more cautious.

655
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:29,830
Have all the manpower been arranged?

656
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:31,700
Don't worry, Young Master.

657
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,490
We have dozens of elite disciples at Baihe Hall.

658
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,030
It won't be a problem

659
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,450
to save Miss Xiaoxiang.

660

Mount Shengling

661
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:39,620
has many traps.

662
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,420
It's easy to defend but hard to attack.

663
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,730
We've been waiting here for over a month

664
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,820
but nothing's been achieved.

665
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,100
This time,

666
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:47,960
we must seize the chance.

667
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:51,110

668
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,420

the disciples will take action.

672
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,150
Then, you'll stand here,

673

and Xiaoxiang

674
00:38:58,910 --> 00:38:59,950
will stand here.

Then, she can see your perfect side profile.

677
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:04,140
You have to memorize your lines and positions.
