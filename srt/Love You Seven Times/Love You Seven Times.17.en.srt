he probably has the memories of the Heaven Realm.

196
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,880
He also took Lu Changkong's stories.

197
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:34,200
Is it just because he likes Xiangyun?

198
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,260
I'm afraid

199
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,630
things are not that simple.

200
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,100
Based on

201
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,340
the experience of the immortals who went down for tribulations,

202
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,980
the personalities of the immortals when they went to the Mortal Realm

203
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,820
usually reflect

204
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,220
the basic personalities of the immortals.

205
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,060
Xiu Ming.

206
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,940
What is the real you

207
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,300
like?

208
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,580
Mr. Pei.

209
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,380
Where are you going?

210
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,700
Are you

211
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,170
the chief of the Medicine Pavilion,

212
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,620
the great Physician Qianren?

213
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,410
I was just about to look for you and thank you.

214
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,340
I don't deserve to be called

215
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,160
a great physician.

216
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:37,140
Why?

217
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,020
I was seriously injured.

218
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,060
If I had been treated by another doctor,

219
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:41,920
perhaps

220
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,020
I would have died.

221
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,310
You're highly skilled.

222
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,000
You deserve to be called a great physician.

223
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,490
Your wound hurts again?

224
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,340
I'll get some poultices

225
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,340
and apply them to your wound later.

226
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,100
It'll stop hurting soon.

227
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,100
I

228
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,430
appreciate it.

229
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,340
Mou.

230
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,440
Where are you going?

231
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:08,960
Mr. Qian Mou.

232
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,260
You're the chief of the Shadow Hall, right?

233
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,620
Although I haven't seen you before,

234
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,320
your prestige

235
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,340
has been known in the martial arts world for a long time.

236
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,340
Really?

237
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:20,930
Of course.

238
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,280
I heard

239
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,950
that the Shadow Hall strives to help the weak.

240
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:26,170
You rob the rich and give the money to the poor.

241
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,590
You always do good deeds without telling them your names.

242
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,300
Rumor has it that Chief Qian Mou has a good heart

243
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,020
and that his martial arts skills are only second to those of Sect Leader.

244
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:36,470
Really?

245
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,440
The way you used your sword just now is not simple.

246
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,500
You put your internal power in the body of the sword.

247
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,100
From the hilt to the tip of the sword,

248
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,980
the way you used the sword was quite steady

249
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,620
and swift.

250
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,340
Xiuming.

251
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,160
Where have you been

252
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,820
all my life?

253
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,140
If there is a chance,

254
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,000
let's learn from each other.

255
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:05,490
OK.

256
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,620
I'll get some poultices for you.

257
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,990
Mr. Pei.

258
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:38,170
What are you doing here?

259
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,490
I'm waiting for you here.

260
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,960
I know you just came back from the vegetable plot.

261
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,040
You must be tired.

262
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,820
So I brought you some food.

263
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:48,060
No need.

264
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,100
I'm not hungry yet.

265
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,460
I'm going to send the vegetables I just picked

266
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,190
back.

267
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,260
Xiaoxiang.

268
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:57,390
Xiaoxiang.

269
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,440
Don't you want to ask me something?

270
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,460
You mean

271
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,830
the past?

272
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,150
But I can't remember

273
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:07,200
what you said.

274
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,980
Well, Xiaoxiang,

275
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,950
don't you want to see your family and friends?

276
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,030
You know where my family is?

277
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,320
That's great.

278
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,090
I'll tell Master about it

279
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,380
and ask him to take us down the mountain.

280
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,300
What do you think?

281
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,700
Xiaoxiang.

282
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,100
You trust Chu Kong so much.

283
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:25,740
Of course.

284
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:26,700
He is my master.

285
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:27,870
What if

286
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,870
you find your family?

287
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,980
I can

288
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,500
bring them to the villa.

289
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:37,360
There are mountains and water here.

290
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,670
And they don't have to worry about what to eat and wear.

291
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,460
I promised my master

292
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,180
that I'll serve him forever.

293
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,340
Is Pei Xiuming

294
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,420
a fox?

295
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,180
Saying a few words

296
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,700
can win a girl's heart?

297
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,220
Not just girls.

298
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,330
You and I were also blinded by him.

299
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,180
Yes.

300
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,370
Let's go and report it

301
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,330
to Sect Leader.

302
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:16,870
No need.

303
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,150
If you remember something,

304
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,960
I'll go down the mountain with you.

305
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,220
What is this?

306
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:35,800
This...

307
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,420
This

308
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,700
is the biggest, roundest,

309
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,620
and ripest fruit

310
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,900
I picked this morning.

311
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,220
It must taste sweet.

312
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,340
If there's nothing else,

313
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,490
I'll leave now.

314
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,770
Okay.

315
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,570
Master.

316
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:30,690
Why are you here?

317
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,300
I'm enjoying the scenery.

318
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,320
You're enjoying the scenery?

319
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,730
Master.

320
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:40,950
This is for you.

321
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,370
I don't want to eat it.

322
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,140
Stay away from Pei.

323
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,620
He's a slick person.

324
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,040
Be careful not to be fooled.

325
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,460
No way!

326
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,360
But what Mr. Pei said is really weird.

327
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,990
I didn't take it seriously.

328
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,380
I

329
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,510
only listen to you.

330
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,819
Good.

331
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,150
But the fruit

332
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,319
was specially picked by me for you.

333
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,589
Master, you really don't want it?

334
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,790
Master, wait for me.

335
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,890
Chu Kong.

336
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,860
You did everything you could

337
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,380
to take Xiangyun away and keep her around.

338
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,220
You want her to be the medicine

339
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,620
which helps you stay alive and restore your primordial spirit.

340
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,620
But you never thought

341
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,660
that your Linglong Heart

342
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:53,610
is also her medicine.

343
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,970
[Medicine Pavilion]

344
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,780
Pei Xiuming and Xiaoxiang

345
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:02,220
are getting closer and closer.

346
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,680
I don't think

347
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,500
Pei Xiuming

348
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,540
has other intentions.

349
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,970
He just wants to take Xiaoxiang away.

350
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,530
We should listen to Sect Leader

351
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,820
and keep an eye on him.

352
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,400
The rival

353
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,620
of Sect Leader is already here.

354
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,680
Why doesn't Sect Leader understand?

355
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,940
Exactly.

356
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,420
Who are you talking about?

357
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,120
Sect Leader.

358
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:39,920
Sect Leader.

359
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:49,690
We're talking about

360
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,620
Xiaoxiang.

361
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,150
It's Xiaoxiang who doesn't understand.

362
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,550
Why doesn't Xiaoxiang understand?

363
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:55,020
Exactly.

364
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,420
Exactly.

365
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,220
Xiaoxiang...

366
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,940
Sect Leader, why are you here?

367
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,540
I almost forgot.

368
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,780
I just got the fruit

369
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,090
yesterday.

370
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,020
After one night,

371
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,340
why do I feel

372
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:12,690
it's a little withered?

373
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:19,000
Ask people from the Medicine Pavilion to help me think about

374
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,900
how to ensure it won't go bad

375
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,570
for a thousand years.

376
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:24,880
A thousand years?

377
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,300
Sect Leader.

378
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,500
I'm

379
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,350
only responsible for asking this question.

380
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,490
As for how to solve it,

381
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:34,630
you can think of a way yourself.

382
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,960
How can I solve it?

383
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:44,960
You just said

384
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,220
Xiaoxiang doesn't understand.

385
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,470
It's also a problem.

Thank you.

You never let me down.

390
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,040
Making Xiaoxiang understand

391
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:35,610
is harder than preventing the fruit

392

393

395
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:47,360
Didn't you hide

396
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,030
ten kilos of romantic novels?

397
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,460

398

Everyone in the mountain knows it.

399

Really?

400
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:02,680
Yes.

401
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,260
Just ask Xiaoxiang

402
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,710
to read those romantic novels.

403
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,210
She'll understand.

404
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,190
Yes.

405
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,600
The one who should understand is your sect leader.

406
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,690
What did it say?

407
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,550
Nothing.

408
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,820
Nothing.

410
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,350
There are so many novels.

411
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,000
They're enough for you to read for a while.

that these titles are so familiar?

I found some clues to the thing you asked me to investigate.

428
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:45,980
Recently,

429
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,700
Xu Wenrui, the sect leader of the Jinwu Sect,

430
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,570
has been secretly investigating Xiaoxiang's whereabouts.

431
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,260
Arrest him!

433
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,130
Why is it him?

434
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,440
I remember you told me before

435
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,630
that he didn't get along with Master Yang, right?

436
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:01,980
Yes.

437
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,550
It is said

438
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,390
that they met each other a few months ago.

439
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,460
Master Yang thought

440
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,880
he was evil-minded

441
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:11,250
and was up to no good.

442
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,100
Later,

443
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,640
they had an argument.

444
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,050
So Master Yang and his family kept away from Xu.

Their whereabouts are mysterious.

448
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,580
They don't have a specific base.

449
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,010
Ask our disciples to keep an eye on it.

450

Is there any news

455
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,080
He behaves himself.

456
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,390
He rests in the guest room every day.

457
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,480
Sometimes,

458
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,120
when he meets Xiaoxiang,

459
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,370
they have a chat.

460
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,170
But they're just pleasantries.

461
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,220
Is there anything else?

462
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,220
He hasn't been to the Medicine Pavilion and the Shadow Hall

463
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,180
for investigation.

464
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,250
He hasn't asked about the devices outside the villa either.

There must be something wrong.

472
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:40,380
He secretly sent people to investigate Xiaoxiang's whereabouts.

473
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:43,290
Could it be that he had something to do with

474

I think I heard Sect Leader calling you.

500

I didn't hear it.

501
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,690
Maybe Xiaoxiang is reading the romantic novels she took

502
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,960
with Sect Leader.

503
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,120
What kind of books

504
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:21,090
did he give Xiaoxiang?

A few days ago,

00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,660
I heard some disciples say

513
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:48,380
that the reason why we stayed in the room every day

514
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,780
must be

515
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,870
that we were doing pair practice nonstop.

you didn't teach me how to do pair practice.

They said...

522
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,360
They said doing pair practice is a good idea.

532
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,960
Is it because I don't have aptitude

539
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,110

576
00:29:58,250 --> 00:29:58,970
Then,

577
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,100
about pair practice...

578
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,350
Master.

579
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,060
When will you teach me how to do pair practice?

580
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,420
Look over there.

581
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,020
Master.

582
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,670
[Leyi House]

583
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:24,460
Sect Leader.

584
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,020
Don't stand on ceremony.

585
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:27,860
Master.

586
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,620
No.

587
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,860
What's wrong, Xiaoxiang?

588
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,090
Maybe I'm too stupid.

589
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,870
I asked my master to teach me martial arts.

590
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:58,030
He always made excuses to refuse.

591
00:30:59,110 --> 00:30:59,920
He even

592
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,320
avoided me.

593
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,490
You want to learn martial arts?

594
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:07,910
There are so many disciples in the Shengling Sect.

595
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,560
Everyone knows some martial art skills

596
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:10,780
except me.

597
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,860
When I went down the mountain and was in danger,

598
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,100
I could only stay there

599
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,540
and waited for my master to protect me.

600
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,690
I can teach you martial arts.

601
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,150
I can also protect you.

602
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,060
Really?

603
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,620
Mr. Pei.

604
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,620
Can you teach me how to do pair practice?

605
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,220
Pair practice?

606
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,150
Where did you hear that?

607
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,870
I heard it from other people.

608
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,950
They said it's a good way to learn martial arts quickly.

609
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,320
So,

610
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,260
you asked Sect Leader

611
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,300
to teach you how to do pair practice?

612
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,020
What's wrong?

613
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:02,820
Nothing.

614
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,820
I can teach you how to do pair practice.

615
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:08,620
Okay.

616
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,940
But

617
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,200
you're a beginner.

618
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,940
At the beginning,

619
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:18,470
you should start from the basics.

620
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,300
Sect Leader.

621
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,460
Why haven't you

622
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,400
called Xiaoxiang

623
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:36,020
to your room

624
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,820
recently?

625
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,000
Are you tired of

626
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:40,790
serving me alone?

627
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,860
No.

628
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,280
Of course not.

629
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:44,840
I

630
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,520
like to serve you.

631
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:47,830
But

632
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,020
these days,

633
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,710
Xiaoxiang is not by your side.

634
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,890
You

635
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,800
don't smile often.

636
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:56,890
Really?

637
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,170
She doesn't come here often and annoy me.

638
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,740
I'm happy about it.

639
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,010
Got it?

640
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:14,490
Yes.

641
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:15,970
Well...

642
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,140
Sect Leader.

643
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:20,570
But you like the food she cooks.

644
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,330
I like like the food she cooks?

645
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,300
Do you think I live too long?

646
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,350
Anyway,

647
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,500
I

648
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,200
don't like Mr. Pei.

649
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,620
Go on.

650
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,150
Mr. Pei

651
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,210
always

652
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,380
wears a fake smile.

653
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,130
When he meets someone,

654
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,990
he is honey-tongued.

655
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,660
He gets along

656
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,690
with everyone.

657
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,930
Even Xiaoxiang

658
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,070
made friends with him.

659
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,890
I've reminded her.

660
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,190
But she didn't listen.

661
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:09,989
In the future,

662
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:13,300
if she suffers from this,

663
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,420
I

664
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,090
won't take care of her.

665
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:18,040
No, Sect Leader.

666
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,389
You have to take care of her.

667
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,659
Sect Leader.

668
00:34:21,139 --> 00:34:21,739
Sect Leader.

669
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,460
Sect Leader.

670
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,320
Bad news!

671
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,380
Why are you panicking?

672
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:28,040
Xiaoxiang was learning flower arrangements in Mr. Pei's courtyard.

673
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,900
At first, they kept their distance.

674
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:31,489
I had been watching them.

675
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,460
But not long after,

676
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:33,460
they

677
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,670
entered the guest room together.

678
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,969
I was worried something might happen,

679
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:39,880
so I knocked on the door.

680
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,370
But Xiaoxiang said...

681
00:34:41,889 --> 00:34:42,840
What did she say?

682
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,820
But Xiaoxiang said...

683
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,850
What did she say?

684
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,230
But Xiaoxiang said

685
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,460
don't interrupt their

686
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,400
pair practice.

687
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,460
Pair practice?

688
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,660
Mr. Pei.

689
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,820
How long is this going to take?

690
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,900
Hang in there, Xiaoxiang.

691
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,880
I can't hold on.

692
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,070
Pei Xiuming!

693
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:23,640
Master.

694
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,500
You

695
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,320
were practicing the horse stance?

696
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,230
Yes.

697
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,650
Xiaoxiang wants to learn some martial art skills.

698
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,030
But she's a beginner.

699
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,380
I

700
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,370
can only start from the basics.

701
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:40,610
What’s wrong?

702
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,460
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

703
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,340
Practice for 30 minutes every morning, noon, and night.

704
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,510
You'll learn some simple steps soon.

705
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,300
Master.

706
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,930
Why did you

707
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,460
attack Mr. Pei?

708
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:02,520
Mr. Pei wants to teach you martial arts.

709
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,590
I have to test

710
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,200
if he's qualified.

711
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,620
But it seems that

712
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,930
it's not necessary.

713
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,650
Master.

714
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,390
Are you going to teach me martial arts?

715
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,340
That's great.

716
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,200
From now on,

717
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,290
I'll only do pair practice with you.

718
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,510
Xiaoxiang.

719
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,790
Actually, pair practice

720
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,300
is not like what you think.

721
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,420
Xiaoxiang.

722
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,720
It's me.

723
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,740
Your Senior Ren.

724
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,180
Please open the door.

725
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,180
No!

726
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,360
Why didn't I realize

727
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,870
that

728
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,500
it has that meaning?

729
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,200
I...

730
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,860
Master, do pair practice with me.

731
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,080
Then,

732
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,610
about pair practice...

733
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,640
When will you teach me how to do pair practice?

734
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,630
So embarrassing.

735
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:36,950
How is she?

736
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,520
She still doesn't want to come out?

737
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,980
No matter who came, she didn't come out.

738
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,500
But the roast chicken,

739
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,320
roast leg of lamb,

740
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:47,270
and chestnut cakes

741
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,090
were all taken in.

742
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:58,260
Sect Leader.

743
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,380
Do you still remember

744
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,610
how Pei Xiuming

745
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,490
got into the villa?

746
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,420
Prince Xiu Ming,

747
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,520
are you pretending to be pitiful?

748
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,060
You

749
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,460
need to pretend

750
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,900
you're very weak

751
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,680
and that your heart disease are getting worse.

752
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:17,610
If Xiaoxiang knows,

753
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,580
she'll not only stop being angry

754
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,180
but also

755
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,520
be worried about your health.

756
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,330
She'll even be heartbroken.

757
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,950
You want me to pretend to be pitiful?

758
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:30,870
If so, I'll be

759
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,680
like Pei Xiuming.

760
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,080
Sect Leader.

761
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,890
There are many strategies in love.

762
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:37,880
How could you say

763
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:39,220
you're like Pei Xiuming?

764
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,540
Master.

765
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,490
Master.

766
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,460
Why are you in a wheelchair again?

767
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,100
Are you not feeling well?
