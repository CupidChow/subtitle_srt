[English subtitles are available]

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,900
[Love you seven times]

3
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,970
[Episode 15]

4
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,020
A new Divine Oracle is coming.

5
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,300
Another Divine Oracle?

6
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,740
I will never allow anyone to hurt you again.

7
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,590
Cang Hai monarch,

8
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,970
I knew you would come back.

9
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:34,740
This Stone Heart

10
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,170
is not the Stone Heart of Nuwa.

11
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,030
It's yours.

12
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,740
Jin Luo.

13
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,380
Why?

14
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,910
Because he loves me.

15
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:03,850
Do you know

16
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,990
you're the Saintess of the Moluo Divine Clan,

17
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,260
my sister?

18
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,490
Of course I remember.

19
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,580
That's why I hate my identity.

20
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,660
I hate what you made me do.

21
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,780
You're the one I hate

22
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,820
the most!

23
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,610
The love Zihui gave to me

24
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,140
was something I've never received

25
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,460
from you,

26
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,540
the Moluo Divine Clan,

27
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,010
or anyone else since I was young.

28
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,540
So,

29
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,660
as long as he can live,

30
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,940
it doesn't matter if it's a heart I have to offer.

31
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,130
It's no big deal.

32
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,510
Tell me.

33
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,960
Where's

34
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,540
that Stone Heart?

35
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,770
Don't dream about ever finding him.

36
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,050
You won't have the chance to find him either.

37
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,140
Because you

38
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:00,210
will vanish soon.

39
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,150
You lunatic.

40
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,390
Brother.

41
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,750
Follow me to Purgatory.

42
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,110
Because that's

43
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,150
where you should be at.

44
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,820
Where am I?

45
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,909
Why am I here?

46
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,880
Why can't I remember anything?

47
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,420
What

48
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,700
exactly happened?

49
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,730
Your Divinity.

50
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,710
Just now, the Moluo Divine Clan was causing trouble.

51
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,210
Thus, the Fate Bureau's Official

52
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:21,110
was confused during the deduction of the Divine Oracle.

53
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,610
Fortunately, God Haoxuan personally came to the Fate Bureau

54
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,020
and suppressed the power of the Moluo Divine Clan with his divine power.

55
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,500
The new Divine Oracle is here?

56
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,220
Yes.

57
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,900
His Holiness also invited you to Changning Palace.

58
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:47,530
[The six realms are overturned]

59
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,510
The resurrection of Cang Hai

60
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,710
will overturn the six realms.

61
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,790
A great catastrophe of Heaven and Earth.

62
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,340
30,000 years ago,

63
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,460
Cang Hai revolted.

64
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,140
At that time,

65
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,540
you used the power of Qilin's God of War

66
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,780
to kill the devil

67
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,540
and freed the six realms from danger.

68
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,270
And now,

69
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,730
Cang Hai is about to be resurrected.

70
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,920
If the Divine Oracle is right,

71
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,290
disaster will be brought to the six realms

72
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,780
and the consequences

73
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,390
will be unimaginable.

74
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,820
As the Heaven Realm's God of War,

75
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,160
I know I have the duty to protect everyone in the six realms.

76
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,660
According to the previous Divine Oracle,

77
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,550
within a thousand years,

78
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:24,610
Cang Hai will be resurrected.

79
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,730
We don't have much time.

80
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,240
But your primordial spirit is damaged.

81
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,650
Your fighting power

82
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,130
is not as strong as before.

83
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,600
If you can't restore your primordial spirit as soon as possible,

84
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,540
this battle

85
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,140
might be much more difficult

86
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,010
than we estimated.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,080
I understand.

88
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,140
I will go to the Mortal Realm for my tribulation as soon as possible

89
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,330
and restore my primordial spirit.

90
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,720
Your Holiness.

91
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,150
What's the matter, Immortal Sun?

92
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:20,680
Your Holiness.

93
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,490
I heard that

94
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,140
just now, at the Fate Bureau,

95
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,220
you used your divine power alone

96
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,680
to suppress the power of the Moluo Divine Clan,

97
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,760
and your primordial spirit

98
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,120
has been damaged as a result.

99
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,020
I'll go get the physician here now.

100
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,659
No.

101
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,110
Chu Kong is about to go to the Mortal Realm for his tribulation.

102
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:47,780
Now is

103
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,360
the moment when the Heaven Realm is weak in defense.

104
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,950
If the news of my injury gets out,

105
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,280
the Moluo Divine Clan

106
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,780
will definitely make a move.

107
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,260
We should

108
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,070
prioritize the big picture.

109
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,440
Your Holiness.

110
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:09,100
If you need anything,

111
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,330
feel free to order me at any time.

112
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,789
Lord Protector.

113
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,419
The twins of the Moluo Divine Clan

114
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,060
are connected by fate

115
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,660
and live and die together.

116
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:49,700
Your...

117
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,100
Your primordial spirit...

118
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,340
My primordial spirit

119
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,010
is about to dissipate.

120
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:58,980
Now,

121
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,470
we can only take a risk

122
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,940
and go to the Mortal World

123
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,230
and experience a tribulation to turn things around.

124
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,740
Lord Protector.

125
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,060
Xie Feng.

126
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,610
While I’m not here,

127
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,880
you must protect our people.

128
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,720
Don’t act rashly.

129
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,550
When I return,

130
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:30,200
we'll work towards our greater cause again.

131
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,610
Order received.

132
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:02,710
Where are you?

133
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:03,550
No need for the formalities.

134
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:03,940
Sir.

135
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:05,250
No need for the formalities.

136
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,700
Xiangzi.

137
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,730
The mortal tribulation script

138
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,240
for you and Immortal Chu Kong

139
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,490
is almost done.

140
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:14,920
So soon?

141
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,300
I still have a bunch of red threads that I haven't dealt with.

142
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,340
Put them aside first.

143
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,160
Get ready.

144
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,340
Hurry up.

145
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,980
But...

146
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,580
Shouldn't a Fuyuan Fairy

147
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,580
help

148
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,300
the fated ones find their match in the world?

149
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,180
I just got the title

150
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,340
and I'm already going to the mortal world

151
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,940
and neglecting my work.

152
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,340
I don't think that's good.

153
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:37,330
Oh, my red thread.

154
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,590
You even want to help others?

155
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,170
Help establish the fate you have with His Divinity first.

156
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,420
What fate

157
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,970
do I share with him?

158
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,860
It'll take a long time

159
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,340
to explain...

160
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,100
the fate you two share.

161
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:55,580
Zanzi.

162
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,180
Hold this for a while.

163
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,340
Back...

164
00:10:59,490 --> 00:10:59,960
Excuse me.

165
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:04,550
Back then,

166
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,580
before I enlightened you,

167
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,660
you were just a wandering auspicious cloud

168
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,810
in the Heaven Realm.

169
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,060
At that time,

170
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,420
your favorite place to be at was

171
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,700
Xiaoyun Palace.

172
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:21,630
The God of War was always plagued with bloodshed

173
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,190
and there was a lot of killing.

174
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,510
Few people dared to approach him.

175
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,820
You were the only one,

176
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,180
without any fear or worries,

177
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,820
who stood by his side for thousands of years.

178
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,180
Your devotion

179
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,850
moved me.

180
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,790
Your love

181
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,340
touched me.

182
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,290
That's why I enlightened you

183
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,590
in hopes of setting you two up

184
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,740
and to facilitate the fate

185
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,940
that you were somehow destined

186
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,340
to share.

187
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,340
Sir.

188
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,460
Is what you just said

189
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,780
all true?

190
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,870
Of course.

191
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,340
But...

192
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,300
But...

193
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,820
about how I came to be here,

194
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,100
why do you always say something different?

195
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,220
It's been 3,000 years.

196
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,500
I've guarded the Xiaoyun Palace,

197
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,720
seen the land in the mortal world,

198
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,460
and even declared good fortune to the state of Qi

199
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,700
and made it rain in the state of Wu.

200
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,250
Right.

201
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,980
Once, when you were drunk,

202
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,100
you even told me

203
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,860
that after you used the latrine

204
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,620
and felt relieved

205
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,760
and was a good mood,

206
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,330
I was an auspicious cloud that you enlightened at the latrine's doorstep.

207
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,480
With regards to how you enlightened me,

208
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,180
how about

209
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,340
you make up more stories?

210
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,330
It's the true story that I'm telling this time.

211
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,620
Really.

212
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,890
You have to believe me.

213
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,620
Excuse me.

214
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,100
Excuse me.

215
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:50,490
Then, Xiangzi,

216
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,580
be well-prepared.

217
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,790
The setting this time is

218
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:56,930
that you have a congenital heart disease,

219
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,220
the Linglong Heart.

220
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,750
I...

221
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,550
am sick?

222
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,750
Yes.

223
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,850
You might not survive past 20 years old.

224
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,470
But there is a cure,

225
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,100
that is to let Xiangzi

226
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,650
have another Linglong Heart.

227
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,340
Then, make her fall in love with you

228
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,340
and voluntarily offer her heart to you

229
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,360
so that you can extend your life.

230
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,610
Then the love tribulation will be over.

231
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:21,710
By then, if you don't want to stay,

232
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,630
slit your throats

233
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:23,940
and the both of you will be back,

234
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,110
with your primordial spirit restored.

235
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,190
A happy ending for everyone.

236
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,460
Well,

237
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,430
is 20 years enough?

238
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,280
It's an emergency.

239
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,110
20 years...

240
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:33,740
that's about right.

241
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,580
But is there any way

242
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,700
to make sure that she falls in love with me?

243
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,300
Don't make me test it out.

244
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,060
That’s easy.

245
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,310
All we need to do is to let those with a Linglong Heart

246
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,340
have their lips and teeth touch.

247
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:43,990
The heart

248
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,340
will then glow.

249
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,140
When the glow is strong

250
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,060
and so bright

251
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,340
that night seems like day,

252
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:52,260
you can let her offer her heart with a piece of mind.

253
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,460
Well...

254
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,680
Your Divinity.

255
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:56,610
Are...

256
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,000
you not satisfied?

257
00:13:59,220 --> 00:13:59,820
How about this?

258
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,780
I'll add one more condition.

259
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,360
I'll make the Linglong Heart possess half the power of an immortal.

260
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,600
Half the power of an immortal is equivalent to innate inner power.

261
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,170
Since your birth, you'll be invincible.

262
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,710
This way, it'll be easier for you to experience the tribulation too.

263
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:11,760
Let's do this then.

264
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:17,370
However,

265
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,280
add one more condition for me.

266
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,350
What else do you want?

267
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,860
Make her obedient.

268
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,430
It'd be best if

269
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,140
she does my bidding.

270
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,920
This desperate love affair...

271
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,210
This time,

272
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,680
don’t let me down again.

273
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,160
Yes, Your Divinity.

274
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,520
To have our lips and teeth touch?

275
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,110
[Seal]

276
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:03,510
[Seal]

277
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,820
Your Divinity won't let the Heaven Realm see

278
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,050
that you're greatly satisfied.

279
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,980
Immortal Li.

280
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:06,160
Prince Xiu Ming.

281
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,320
Are you here to borrow books again?

282
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,580
I think the trip to the mortal world this time

283
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,900
is quite interesting.

284
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,060
I’d like to find a few

285
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,530
books about tribulations to read.

286
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:14,600
The books about tribulations are over there

287
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,390
in the second cabinet.

288
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,630
Thank you.

289
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:49,830
Greetings, Your Divinity.

290
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,650
Where are you going?

291
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,640
I-I think

292
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,690
I just happened to have lost something.

293
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,240
I was going back to look for it.

294
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,720
On my way here,

295
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,590
I happened to

296
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:06,430
have found a bottle of the antidote to the Water of Amnesia...

297
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:10,710
the Anti-Memory-Erasing.

298
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,190
How could this be mine?

299
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,190
I have always followed the rules.

300
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,840
To go to the mortal world for a tribulation with you,

301
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,980
I must have a full bowl of the Water of Amnesia.

302
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,140
That's great.

303
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,490
He...

304
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,380
Hurry and come with me.

305
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,160
I'm coming.

306
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,980
When immortals go to the mortal world to experience a tribulation,

307
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,860
by convention,

308
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,820
a mortal dies

309
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,790
and an immortal body rises,

310
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,420
and the primordial spirit will be restored.

311
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,440
But when it's two immortals with primordial spirits of the same origin,

312
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,840
and one voluntarily sacrifices one's life for the other

313
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,060
during the tribulation,

314
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,340
one will be offering part of one's primordial spirit

315
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,930
to replenish the other's primordial spirit.

316
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,030
One win and one loss.

317
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,550
As one falls, the other rises.

318
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,780
I'm at your disposal.

319
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,900
Why is her primordial spirit damaged?

320
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,700
The one who keeps offering one's primordial spirit

321
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:21,770
will eventually

322
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,900
lose all of one's primordial spirit.

323
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,940
So this is why Xiangyun's primordial spirit was damaged.

324
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,020
The auspicious hour has come.

325
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:42,180
The ceremony for descending to the mortal world...

326
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,220
No need for the hassle.

327
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,430
Drink this cup of Water of Amnesia

328
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,400
and hurry to the Mortal Realm with me.

329
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,470
I’m in a rush.

330
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,850
Why?

331
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,180
Do you want me to feed you?

332
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,700
No need.

333
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,310
I'll do it myself. I'll do it myself.

334
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,060
Drink it.

335
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,520
I will take Xiangyun to the Mortal Realm now.

336
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,620
Have a safe trip.

337
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,460
Did His Divinity

338
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,700
drink the Water of Amnesia?

339
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,760
Sir, don't you think that

340
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,000
when His Divinity looked at the Fuyuan Fairy,

341
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,830
there was happiness in his eyes?

342
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,540
Happiness in his eyes?

343
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,980
There's also a little affection in his eyes.

344
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:43,790
Affection?

345
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,420
Yes.

346
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,020
Strong affection.

347
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,700
[Yujian Faction, Madam Yang] [Yujian Faction, Master Yang]

348
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:11,990

[Shengling Sect's Leader, Chu Kong]

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,060
I beg you.

352
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,430
Don't kill me.

353
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,220
Don't...

354
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,050
Don't kill me.

355
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:22,980
Don't...

[Medicine Pavilion's Chief, Qian Ren]

358
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,700
Don't kill me.

359
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,780
Don't kill me!

360
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:29,760
It's her.

361
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,160
Take her away.

362
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:35,970
Yes.

363
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,220
No! No!

364
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,010
Who was so bold

365
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,810
to kill the head of our Yujian Faction?

366
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,460
Chief Chen.

367
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,440
We just checked the corpse,

368
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,500
but found no clues.

369
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,460
Wait.

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,110
Please follow the rules

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,740
Miss Xiaoxiang

382
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,790
is missing.

383
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,230
I think

384
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,290
she was taken away by those who attacked our master.

385
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,320
Uncle Yang and Auntie brought Xiaoxiang to the south to seek medical treatment.

386
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,410
On the way, they settled at this Manxiang Guesthouse.

387
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,430
Apart from the disciples in the Sect,

388
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:51,820
are there any outsiders who know about this?

389
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,740
The matter of the Sect Leader heading south

390
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,380
wasn't deliberately kept as a secret.

391
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,590
If someone had the intent to find out,

392
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,460
it wouldn't had been hard to find out.

393
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,740
But our Yujian Faction

394
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,100
has always kept a low profile.

395
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,160
We shouldn't have such enemies.

396
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,300
Maybe their target

397
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:10,590
is not the Yujian Faction,

398
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:12,970
but Xiaoxiang.

399
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:14,780
Well...

400
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,780
Miss Xiaoxiang

401
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:19,860
is just a lady who was raised in her private boudoir.

402
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,640
Usually,

403
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:23,340
she's protected by Sister-in-law and Mr. Pei.

404
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,220
She has never shown her face in the martial world.

405
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,580
How could she have offended any killers?

406
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,750
Innocent people get into trouble

407
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,300
because they harbor treasures.

408
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:42,590
I'm willing to look for Xiaoxiang on behalf of the Yujian Faction.

409
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,140
Even if I have to search the entire martial world,

410
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,920
I will definitely find her.

411
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,950
Let me thank you

412
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,750
on behalf of the Yujian Faction.

413
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,100
Who do you think

414
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,720
this Mr. Pei is,

415
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,880
that Chief Chen is so respectful to him?

416
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:07,700
He

417
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,000
is a family friend of Master

418
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:11,020
and the only son of Hero Pei of the Baihe Sect,

419
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,860
Pei Xiuming.

420
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,700
You just joined the Sect.

421
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:14,810
It's normal that you don't know him.

422
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,350
He and Miss Xiaoxiang were childhood sweethearts

423
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,350
and grew up together.

424
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:20,890
If it weren't for Miss Xiaoxiang's heart disease,

425
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:21,970
they probably

426
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,620
would have gotten married long ago.

427
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:43,940
Sect Leader.

428
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,140
These past few years,

429
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,010
you've been using the power of the Linglong Heart

430
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,930
[Shengling Sect's disciple, Fang]

431
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,650
and the exhaustion it caused on your body

432
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,110
has been progressively greater.

433
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,350
This time,

434
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:52,350
I think

435
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,540
you'll have to sit on a wheelchair for a few days.

436
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,400
It doesn’t matter.

437
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,150
Sect Leader.

438
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:59,900
If that lady

439
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,840
is really the one with the Linglong Heart that you’re looking for,

440
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,600
then it'll be wonderful.

441
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:10,420
Sect Leader.

442
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,300
This lady

443
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,120
has a Linglong Heart indeed.

444
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:18,700
Really?

445
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,210
Then, Sect Leader,

446
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,370
I'm right.

447
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,610
You don’t have to die.

448
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:23,900
Fang.

449
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,040
Why are you spouting nonsense?

450
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,970
I'm not.

451
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,690
Didn’t you say

452
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,300
that people with a Linglong Heart

453
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,110
can barely live past 20?

454
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,140
The Sect Leader is already 19 years old.

455
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,900
We need to hurry and find this lady who would offer her heart

456
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,710
and extend Sect Leader's life.

457
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:40,370
Xiangyun.

458
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,810
I've been looking for you for such a long time.

459
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,790
I didn't expect

460
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,640
we would meet in this way.

461
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,920
Did she wake up?

462
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,900
She woke up for a moment.

463
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:54,940
But

464
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,860
she seems to have forgotten everything.

465
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,910
She doesn't even remember her own name.

466
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:01,600
She was trembling uncontrollably.

467
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,170
So I made some medicine for her

468
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,070
to calm her nerves.

469
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,450
Help me. Help me!

470
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,060
Help me.

471
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:10,620
Help me.

472
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:11,780
Let me do it.

473
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,220
Help me.

474
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,020
Let me do it.

475
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,030
If this lady's Linglong Heart

476
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,810
can really beat for you,

477
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,040
in other words,

478
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,470
if she truly falls in love with you,

479
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,910
then she can offer her heart to you

480
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,640
and extend your life.

481
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:57,910
But

482
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,540
we only have one year's time.

483
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:03,670
One year?

484
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,380
Isn't that enough?

485
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,180
That's not what I meant.

486
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,450
Sect Leader, you have both talent and good looks,

487
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,690
with bright eyes

488
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,770
and a beautiful face.

489
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,940
If you want to win her heart,

490
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,350
it must be a piece of cake.

491
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,350
I'm just thinking about

492
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,790
how I should make the medicine

493
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,610
to help her regain her memory.

494
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,630
Regain her memory?

495
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,220
That'd be good.

496
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,900
If she could remember that

497
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,300
it was Sect Leader

498
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,640
who killed the killers in the restaurant

499
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,660
and saved her,

500
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,140
naturally,

501
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,390
she'd be willing to repay the kindness.

502
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,570
But if she really regains her memory,

503
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,320
she will definitely remember the tragedy of her family being wiped out.

504
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,600
By then,

505
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,690
she'd definitely traverse the martial world to seek revenge.

506
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,090
Let her stay in Shengling Sect from now on.

507
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,300
Tell them that

508
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,120
she will be my last disciple from now on.

509
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:01,900
Yes.

510
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:04,870
Sect Leader.

511
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,220
Sect Leader.

512
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:17,920
The Yujian Faction

513
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,950
has taken the bodies of Master Yang and his wife

514
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,130
back to their faction.

515
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,580
Got it.

516
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,180
Sect Leader.

517
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:29,890
Don’t you usually

518
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,140
not give a care about the affairs of the martial world?

519
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,550
Why are you

520
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,920
so concerned this time?

521
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,510
I spoke too much.

522
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,370
Are there any clues about

523
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,060
the identities of the killers?

524
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,540
Their clothes were plain

525
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:48,070
and the swords on them

526
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,110
are commonly found in the market.

527
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:51,450
Their moves were wide and open.

528
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,730
You can't tell which sect they're from.

529
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,360
Do you remember

530
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:57,780
that when we broke into Manxiang Guesthouse,

531
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,580
those people had no intention of retreating?

532
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,600
Even when they collapsed, they didn't make a sound.

533
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,660
They are...

534
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,780
warriors of sacrifice?

535
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,150
I'm afraid...

536
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,340
it's not that simple.

537
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,780
Young Master.

538
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,980
I asked around the martial world according to your orders,

539
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,390
and learned that

540
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,530
there's a group of Shengling Sect members

541
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,640
who was looking for Miss Xiaoxiang with this portrait

542
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,660
of her.

543
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,590
Shengling Sect?

544
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,760
The Shengling Sect

545
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,520
is based at Mount Shengling not far away from here.

546
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
Legend has it that this mountain is shrouded in clouds and mist

547
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,660
and has many traps.

548
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,490
This sect is very mysterious

549
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,500
and rarely participates in matters of the martial world.

550
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:57,400
What kind of a person

551
00:30:58,150 --> 00:30:59,080
is Shengling Sect's Leader?

552
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,190
I only heard that

553
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,500
the Sect Leader has been practicing dark magic since childhood.

554
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,930
He was born with incredible inner power,

555
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:08,510
but has a weak constitution.

556
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,860
As for his real name,

557
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,260
no one knows.

558
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,980
You don't know that

559
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,740
the story I wrote this time

560
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,310
is full of bizarre twists and turns

561
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,860
with just the right amount of exaggeration.

562
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,080
Do you want to take a look?

563
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,520
Linglong Heart?

564
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,330
Fate of offering one's heart?

565
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,870
Uncle. Auntie.

566
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,330
I have something

567
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,800
I want to discuss with you.

568
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,180
Go ahead.

569
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,380
I've sent someone to find out the whereabouts of Physician Luo.

570
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,890
She's in Shu now.

571
00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:43,750
Then what are we waiting for?

572
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:45,010
Let's go now.

573
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,050
Xiaoxiang's Linglong Heart

574
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,620
can barely last for two years.

575
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,320
We can't waste even a moment.

576
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:52,260
Okay.

577
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,180
Fly!

578
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,850
I thought I could protect Xiangyun and keep her far away from you

579
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,170
and have a peaceful life.

580
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,220
I didn't expect

581
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,810
you would kidnap her by unscrupulous means

582
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,710
to be the supplement that would prolong your life.

583
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,940
Chu Kong.

584
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:22,020
Why...

585
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,070
Why...

586
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,100
Why did Prince Xiu Ming go experience a tribulation again?

587
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,310
Pei Xiuming.

588
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,200
Yang Xiaoxiang.

589
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,820
They grew up together

590
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,760
as childhood sweethearts.

591
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:43,480
As they say, a couple will live a harmonious life if the woman's older than the man.

592
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,350
This setting

593
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:44,980
and this background...

594
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,460
Isn't this the story that I wrote

595
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,630
about childhood sweethearts becoming a quarrelsome couple?

596
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,430
There are indeed

597
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,450
a lot in common.

598
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:58,590
But someone as noble as Prince Xiuming

599
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,290
experiencing a tribulation according to my Fate Book

600
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:03,030
isn't plagiarism.

601
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:03,920
A reference.

602
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,440
It's at most a reference.

603
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,340
But the three of them

604
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,080
are dealing with love at Shengling Sect.

605
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,830
Maybe

606
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:13,350
it'll be more cruel than the story I wrote.

607
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,100
When I promote it later,

608
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,730
I can say that both immortals

609
00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:18,160
used my Fate Book.

610
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,580
Then, won't I become famous?

611
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,450
When I write it into a book for sale,

612
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,980
my pockets will be filled with spirit stones.

613
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,140
You sure are

614
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:28,180
making a lot of calculations.

615
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,680
[Mount Shengling]

616
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,820
It's only been half an hour since I haven't seen you,

617
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,500
and you're already climbing around

618
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,739
and wreaking havoc?

619
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,460
You don't know how to be tender towards women at all.

620
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:38,880
Tender?

621
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:41,909
What does the word "tender"

622
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,940
have to do with you?

623
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,360
Other disciples

624
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:48,040
are obedient, sensible,

625
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,150
and respect their masters.

626
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:50,480
Look at you.

627
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,699
You're like a wild monkey from the back of the mountain

628
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,420
who sneaked into Shengling Sect.

629
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,460
Master, you were clearly the one who said

630
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,830
you wanted to eat the crabapple cakes

631
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,060
made by me.

632
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,650
That's why I came to pick flowers.

633
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:01,140
I'm...

634
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,540
doing this all for you.

635
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,280
This is all for me?

636
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,540
Then what about two days ago, when you went to the Medicine Pavilion

637
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,200
and stole the thousand-year-old Lingzhi Mushrooms for roasting,

638
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,300
or when you went to the greenhouse to get Golden Silk Clivia for fried rice?

639
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,900
All that was for me too?

640
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,760
That was all to improve my cooking skills

641
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,220
so that I can cook more delicious dishes for you.

642
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,400
Then what about you secretly raising a few wild pigeons in the house?

643
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:27,630
The bedding was even accidentally stained by bird poop.

644
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:29,740
Qian Ren was just done washing it.

645
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:31,550
The blanket is still drying off on the empty floor.

646
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,640
That's because I want to

647
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,920
raise more tender pigeons

648
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,090
for you to boost your vitality.

649
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,880
Stop torturing me.

650
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,240
Don't talk about boosting my vitality.

651
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:47,160
I'm afraid that I'll die earlier

652
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,660
than your pigeons.

653
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:49,800
You were clearly the one

654
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,110
who wanted to eat the crabapple cakes,

655
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,300
but you wouldn't let me pick flowers.

656
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,510
Then what should I do?

657
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,530
[Crabapple Cake]

658
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,890
How should I make crabapple cakes

659
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:11,930
without crabapple flowers?

660
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,130
Crabapple flowers!

661
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:41,160
They smell so good.

662
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:05,850
What's going on?

663
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,410
Again?

664
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,900
I just made the medicine.

665
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,970
What's going on?

666
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,160
How many times has it been in a month?

667
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,170
Exactly.

668
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:14,870
That's too much.

669
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,120
The roof is still intact.

670
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,620
It doesn't need to be repaired.

671
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,510
In one month,

672
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,680
there were 8 big explosions

673
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:24,780
and 18 small explosions.

674
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,140
Our junior Xiaoxiang

675
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,540
is actually

676
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,900
an explosives expert at such a young age.

677
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,960
To be the Sect Leader's last disciple,

678
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,870
one has to be special in some way after all.

679
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,670
Too special.

680
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,030
Master.

681
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:44,980
I specially made

682
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,580
this warm family feast for you.

683
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,100
This is Charcoal-roasted Chicken.

684
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:51,060
This is Toasted Buns.

685
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:51,980
And this

686
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,480
is Smoked Mushrooms.

687
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,150
Master.

688
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,380
Why don't you...

689
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,730
try them?

690
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,190
Xiaoxiang.

691
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,720
I really won't insist

692
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,450
on you cooking anymore.

693
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:19,370
After all, with my current constitution,

694
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,220
I really can't withstand such torture every day.

695
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,470
Master.

696
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,080
I've let you down.

697
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:29,160
But

698
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:29,860
I'll do my best.

699
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,250
There's really no need.

700
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,740
I only have one request.

701
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,500
You must

702
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,460
definitely,

703
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,910
with all your might,

704
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,880
make the crabapple cakes.

705
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:40,900
Got it.

706
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,380
Just now, before dinner,

707
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,690
you said you made crabapple cakes.

708
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,110
Where are they?

709
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,670
I followed the recipe strictly.

710
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,290
I accidentally

711
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,900
put too much water because my hand trembled.

712
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,430
There was too much water,

713
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,740
so I added some flour.

714
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,760
But I added too much flour

715
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,620
so I added more water.

716
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:18,550
Listen.

717
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,900
Listen to the strands of white hair

718
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:23,910
growing out of my scalp

719
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,550
one by one.

720
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:29,880
Master.

721
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,100
I'm useless.

722
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,230
Forget it.

723
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,470
I've been here at Shengling Sect for more than a month.

724
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,490
I can't do anything well.

725
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,800
I'm not good at studying or practicing martial arts.

726
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,960
I'm so useless.

727
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:46,270
You...

728
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,370
Don't be like this.

729
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,400
Shengling Sect is like a home to me.

730
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,560
I like the life here.

731
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,070
I like you too.

732
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,320
What did you say?

733
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,300
I said

734
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,760
I like you.
