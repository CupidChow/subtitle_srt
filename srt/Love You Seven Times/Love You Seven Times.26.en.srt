[Episode 26]

4
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,530
Maybe I'm nagging.

5
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:48,229
But,

6
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:50,520
I'm doing this for your own good.

7
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,229
In my opinion,

8
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,590
Prince Xiu Ming may be more anxious than me.

9
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,930
It has been over a thousand years since Prince Xiu Ming

10
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,490
was sent to our Moluo Divine Clan as a hostage.

11
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,490
You've been very attentive to him.

12
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,150
No wonder Prince Xiu Ming cares about you so much.

13
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,010
He...

14
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,370
You should know that

15
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:09,340
I just treat Xiu Ming

16
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,310
as a friend.

17
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,900
I originally thought that

18
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,410
since you and Prince Xiu Ming grew up together,

19
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,870
if you can get married,

20
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,160
that'd be quite nice.

21
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,890
It seems that

22
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,150
you have no such intention towards Prince Xiu Ming.

23
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:24,660
I will get someone to send out invitations now

24
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,240
to invite the young masters of all clans

25
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,430
to the Moluo Palace.

26
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,660
It is said that

27
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,780
the Second Prince of the Qilin Divine Clan...

28
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,240
Right.

29
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:32,660
By the way,

30
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,690
why haven't Jin Lian and Jin Luo

31
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,000
come to the palace recently?

32
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,900
How's their health?

33
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,120
Jin Luo and Jin Lian's

34
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,500
primordial spirits have been weak since childhood.

35
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,810
Despite trying all kinds of elixirs,

36
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,100
nothing helped.

37
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,640
We can only do our best.

38
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,260
But your divine power is strong.

39
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,260
You can definitely give birth to a strong son

40
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,490
and continue the bloodline of the Moluo Divine Clan.

41
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,610
Our Moluo royal family has always been born as twins.

42
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,350
But when it came to me,

43
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,720
I became an only child.

44
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,650
As a result, I've been alone since I was a child.

45
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,400
If I could be like Jin Lian and Jin Luo

46
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,790
and have a sibling,

47
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,020
then you

48
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,880
wouldn't be nagging me all day long.

49
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,530
Empress, you must be joking.

50
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,900
I won’t nag you anymore then.

00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,550

52
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,670
Wait.

53
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,579
Do you know

54
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,880
where the best marriage temple

55
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,190
in the six realms is?

Empress.

57
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,290
A marriage temple is just a place for mortals

58
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,590
to pray for their marriages.

59
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,230
As the Moluo Empress,

60
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,950
you don't need to go to some marriage temple.

00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,890
Are you okay?

193
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,200
It hurts.

194
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,820
This...

195
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,730
It really

196
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,620
hurts.

197
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,290
I...

198
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:20,600
Wait.

199
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:21,730
I...

200
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:17,890
He just...

201
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,640
left like that?

202
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,390
He looked quite handsome.

203
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,540
The level of his martial arts skills was just right too.

204
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,270
But...

205
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,400
he doesn't play by the rules.

206
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:39,970
But

207
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,950
he was able to remain unmoved when he saw a beauty.

208
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,380
That’s a strength too.

209
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:47,710
He's worthy of being the man I like.

210
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,570
You're awake.

211
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,570
I...

212
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,720
I didn't mean it.

213
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,920
My friend.

214
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,690
Where is this place?

215
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,180
This is where I rest

216
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,420
during my usual travels.

217
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,750
You passed out due to the poisoning,

218
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,150
so I let you settle here temporarily.

219
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,990
Thank you for saving my life.

220
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,860
I...

221
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,360
Sit here first.

222
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,710
My friend.

223
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:45,190
Why

224
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,590
do I feel a little dizzy?

225
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,880
You are lucky.

226
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,760
You survived the Scorpion Demon's attack,

227
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,080
but your body hasn't been detoxified of the poison yet.

228
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,120
So during this period,

229
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,550
you'll naturally feel a little weaker.

230
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,670
I'm a little Flower Spirit who has just shapeshifted into a person.

231
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,940
I haven't had time to see the vast world.

232
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,860
I...

233
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,610
don't want to die yet.

234
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,430
My friend.

235
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,340
Someone as courageous,

236
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,900
helpful,

237
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,380
chilvarous,

238
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:17,510
and kind-hearted as you

239
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,830
won't just stand by and watch,

240
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:22,440
right?

241
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,340
You...

242
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,980
Don't cry.

243
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,220
Since I saved you,

244
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,130
naturally, I won't leave you

245
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,230
to die alone.

246
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,050
Thank you for your great kindness.

247
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,000
I have nothing to repay you with.

248
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,370
I can only...

249
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,920
S-S-Stop!

250
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,100
You...

251
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,100
Sit down. Sit down.

252
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,640
Since you're awake,

253
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,079
then

254
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,220
I'll let that Scorpion detoxify you.

255
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:31,880
You...

256
00:17:32,370 --> 00:17:33,150
You...

257
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:35,050
Empress.

258
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,350
You can't just watch me die.

259
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:39,990
Don't worry.

260
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,110
With me here,

261
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,210
I won't let anything happen to you.

262
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,000
Give me the antidote.

263
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,810
If I give you the antidote,

264
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:49,150
then I'll really die.

265
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,430
You have integrity.

266
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,710
Unless you let me go,

267
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,410
you

268
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:04,640
won't get the antidote.

269
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,110
You won't give it to me, right?

270
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,790
Fine.

271
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,370
I'll cut open your Internal Core...

272
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,090
and detoxify her all the same.

273
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,540
What's wrong?

274
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,330
My friend, help me.

275
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,940
Help me.

276
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,160
Thank you for saving my life.

277
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,930
Don’t thank me just yet.

278
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,010
I've only temporarily

279
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,470
suppressed the poison's toxicity.

280
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,580
If nothing goes wrong,

281
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,690
it'll last for one to two years.

282
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,420
I must catch that Scorpion

283
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,930
and cut open his Internal Core,

284
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:07,510
and let him know what he deserves.

285
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,140
I feel so dizzy.

286
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,780
It's so hot.

287
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,820
It's so hot.

288
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,500
Your Highness.

289
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,130
Are you going to look for Empress personally?

290
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,280
Cang Hai has left the palace for some time.

291
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,480
[Dixiu Divine Clan, Xiu Ming]

292
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,150
I'm really worried.

293
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:18,970
Your Highness.

294
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,310
You've always been weak.

295
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,700
Empress is most worried about your health.

296
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,320
If anything happens to you,

297
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,910
I'm afraid it'd only make Empress more worried.

298
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,310
Besides,

299
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,150
even if you really go personally,

300
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,330
I'm afraid you won't be of much help.

301
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,760
I...

302
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,330
But don't worry, Your Highness.

303
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,000
I’ve already sent more men.

304
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,220
I think we'll find Empress soon.

305
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,760
You should just wait in the palace in peace.

306
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,430
Or...

307
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,190
you might miss the Empress again.

308
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:50,730
Then...

309
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:53,200
I'll have to trouble you.

310
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:56,610
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

311
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:02,070
Didn't you just escape?

312
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,140
Why are you back?

313
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,830
I left the love token my lover gave me

314
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,020
in the Demon-lock Bag.

315
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,470
Do you mean your longtime lover, the Spider Demon?

316
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,010
Yes.

317
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,440
If she finds out

318
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,170
I lost the self-made love token

319
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:18,160
she gave me,

320
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,950
she'll break my eight scorpion legs.

321
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,550
I took such a big risk

322
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,870
all for you.

323
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,770
You can't just stand by and watch.

324
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,620
Keep your voice down.

325
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,350
I will find a way.

326
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,840
Go back first.

327
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,820
Okay.

328
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,450
Yes.

329
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,120
I'll go.

330
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,230
My friend, have a seat.

331
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,130
Did you make all these?

332
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,510
I made these myself.

333
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,700
Have a taste.

334
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:26,910
How is it?

335
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,520
Did you...

336
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,050
really make all these dishes?

337
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,550
If you wanted to act like you made these dishes,

338
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,100
you should have at least switched out the plates.

339
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:00,590
I've eaten at Zuixian Restaurant

340
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,130
plenty of times.

341
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:03,560
How can I not recognize them?

342
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,720
I...

343
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,390
It was because my time was limited...

344
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,660
and my cooking skills are limited too.

345
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,310
So I can only

346
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,060
personally go down the mountain

347
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,760
to buy your favorite dishes from Zuixian Restaurant.

348
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:16,390
All right.

349
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,020
I appreciate

350
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,210
your kindness.

351
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,780
But

352
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,360
there's still poison in your body,

353
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,040
so you shouldn't work so hard in the future.

354
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,880
In the mortal world's romance novel, it's said that

355
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,040
a life savior's kindness

356
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,260
is repaid either through labor

357
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,470
or marriage.

358
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:37,640
If you

359
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:38,870
don't want me to work too hard,

360
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:40,060
could it be...

361
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,300
My friend.

362
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,620
Are you okay?

363
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,620
Are you okay?

364
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,420
I suddenly feel that

365
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:55,250
your way of repaying kindness with labor

366
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:56,870
is quite good.

367
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,980
That's it then.

368
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,590
My friend.

369
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:08,990
I made this Crabapple Flower Wine myself.

370
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,090
I really made this myself.

371
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:11,790
Try it.

372
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:13,770
Okay.

373
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,030
The wine is fragrant

374
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,570
and leaves one longing for more.

375
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,520
I didn't expect

376
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,700
a Flower Spirit like you

377
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,210
to have quite some skills.

378
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,500
Of course.

379
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,030
This Crabapple Flower Wine

380
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,550
is my specialty.

381
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,750
If you like it,

382
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:36,330
there'll be more than enough for you.

383
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,380
By the way,

384
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,850
let me make a toast to you.

385
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,550
Here.

386
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,550
The first toast

387
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,620
is for saving my life.

388
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,230
It's nothing.

389
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,620
My friend.

390
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,210
The second toast

391
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,950
is for

392
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,180
taking me in.

393
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,030
It's nothing.

394
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,750
My friend.

395
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,300
The third toast

396
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,840
is to thank you in advance for detoxifying me.

397
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,790
Fine.

398
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:09,590
Come on. The fifth toast

399
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:10,780
is for...

400
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,340
Come on. My friend.

401
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,530
Cheers to the eighth toast.

402
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,070
This tenth toast...

403
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,030
My friend.

404
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,170
It's fate that we meet.

405
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,720
Here's another toast to you.

406
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,460
Cheers.

407
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,310
My friend, cheers!

408
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,860
I can't drink anymore.

409
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,280
My friend.

410
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:34,940
Here.

411
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,520
This toast...

412
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:37,790
This toast...

413
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,630
My friend.

414
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,860
This toast is...

415
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,250
to thank you for being so handsome.

416
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:47,870
Cheers!

417
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,390
My friend.

418
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,630
My friend.

419
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,390
Little Flower Spirit.

420
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,100
The wine you made...

421
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,360
I...

422
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:52,520
It's quite delicious.

423
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:58,520
I can't take it anymore.

424
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,900
I'm going to bed.

425
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,270
You can keep drinking.

426
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,100
See you.

427
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,850
You have superior swordsmanship.

428
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,220
I think you must have been learning it since you were young.

429
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,120
My swordsmanship

430
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,110
has been taught by my brother since I was young.

431
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:11,700
I didn't expect

432
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:13,490
you to have a brother.

433
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,800
You must have a good relationship with your brother.

434
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,530
Yes.

435
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:17,810
My brother and I

436
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:19,410
were close since we were little.

437
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,870
Unfortunately...

438
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,510
Unfortunately?

439
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,530
What's unfortunate?

440
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,400
Even if we are biological brothers,

441
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:30,740
we can't always be as carefree as we were

442
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,890
when we were little.

443
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:37,630
Isn't it nice to have a brother?

444
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,850
What's with that face?

445
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:43,870
Are you envious?

446
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:45,880
Of course.

447
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,620
It doesn't matter what happens when you grow up.

448
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,160
You had a brother to practice swordsmanship

449
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,340
and play with since you were little,

450
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:53,790
unlike me.

451
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,880
I've been alone since I was young.

452
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,580
Even when I'm bullied,

453
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,740
I don't have siblings

454
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,100
to stand up for me.

455
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,230
How about this?

456
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,240
I'll teach you some skills.

457
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:15,100
As long as you learn even just a little from me,

458
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,600
you'll be fine when you run into those ordinary demons

459
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,700
in the future.

460
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,260
My friend.

461
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,560
Are you really going to teach me?

462
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,650
Enough with the talking.

463
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:25,620
Come on.

464
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,660
Watch carefully.

465
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,830
This move is called the Floating Clouds and Flowing Water.

466
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:38,970
Are you okay?

467
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,550
I...

468
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,740
I sprained my ankle.

469
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,730
Sit down quickly.

470
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,860
Which foot?

471
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:48,580
This one.

472
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:49,970
Wait.

473
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,860
I'm fine.

474
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,690
Don't move.

475
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,220
If you hurt your muscles and bones,

476
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,130
a little Flower Spirit like you

477
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,510
will be crippled in the future.

478
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:57,750
Wait.

479
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,430
I...

480
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:01,830
I...

481
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:04,170
was faking it.

482
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,690
Fine.

483
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,600
How dare you lie to me?

484
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,090
I...

485
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,500
I'm sorry.

486
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,000
I-I didn't mean it.

487
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,180
It's just that

488
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,250
practicing swordsmanship is too tiring.

489
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,310
Forget it.

490
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,780
I'll let you go this time.

491
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,660
But if you lie to me again,

492
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,970
I will teach you a lesson.

493
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,860
My friend.

494
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:07,900
I brought you your clothes.

495
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,560
W-What are you doing in here?

496
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,670
Get out now!

497
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:24,580
My friend.

498
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,330
I’ll put your clothes there.

499
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:26,950
I got it. I got it.

500
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,060
Take it yourself then.

501
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:28,540
Get out first.

502
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,940
Get out.

503
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:01,780
Thank you, Empress.

504
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,640
Hurry and leave.

505
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,720
I will...

506
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,220
You two are indeed in cahoots.

507
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,490
You found out.

508
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,670
Who are you?

509
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,970
How dare you lie to me?

510
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,780
What is your intention?

511
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,250
It doesn't matter who I am.

512
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,620
What matters is that I like you.

513
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,080
As long as you obey me,

514
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,390
I promise

515
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,530
you'll enjoy a prosperous

516
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,560
and easy life.

517
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,190
Bah!

518
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,750
I'm not involved this time, right?

519
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,070
I'll take my leave.

520
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,120
You are so powerful,

521
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:22,330
yet you usually pretend to be

522
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,950
a vulnerable Crabapple Flower Spirit.

523
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,950
It must be really inconvenient for you.

524
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,020
It seems like

525
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,440
you still don't want to obey me.

526
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,080
In that case,

527
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,910
let's forget it.

528
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,540
Why are you back?

529
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,960
It's not my style...

530
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,330
to say no to a fight.

531
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:40,930
What's wrong?

532
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,380
Again?

533
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,460
This was Empress's divine power.

534
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,500
I can’t be wrong.

535
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,040
Follow me out of the palace

536
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,170
to receive Empress.

537
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:57,620
Let’s go.

538
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,140
Lord Protector.

539
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,850
Your Highness, do you need me

540
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,860
for anything?

541
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,520
Have you

542
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:09,590
discovered the whereabouts of Cang Hai?

543
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,640
It seems that

544
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,480
Your Highness has hit the nail on the head.

545
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,450
I did indeed discover Empress's divine power,

546
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,760
and I'm bringing some men to look for her.

547
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,490
I'll go with you.

548
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:24,820
Your Highness.

549
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,110
It'd be better for you to stay in the palace.

550
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,070
Lord Protector.

551
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,010
I want to bring Cang Hai home personally.

552
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:35,910
Please.

553
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,140
All right.

554
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,830
Since you insist,

555
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,250
come along with me.

556
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,830
I just needed you to seriously injure Chu Kong

557
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:54,450
so that he couldn't visit the Moluo Divine Clan upon invitation.

558
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,920
Why couldn't you even accomplish such a simple task?

559
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:58,900
When I

560
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,460
was going to launch a sneak attack on the Second Prince that day,

561
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,600
I found a woman

562
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,790
with strong powers by his side.

563
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,140
What did you say?

564
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:17,770
[Second Prince of the Qilin Divine Clan, Chu Kong]

565
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,020
Did you say there was another woman

566
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,640
with Chu Kong?

567
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,990
Yes.

568
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,740
The Second Prince and that woman

569
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,160
seemed to have a close relationship.

570
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,420
It was because that woman was injured

571
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,400
that the Second Prince didn't catch up with me.

572
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:34,520
You may leave.

573
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,100
Yes.

574
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,250
I didn't expect that Scorpion

575
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,680
to be more powerful than I thought.

576
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,300
Aren't you two accomplices?

577
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,840
Why didn’t he help detoxify you?

578
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,870
These demons

579
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,090
always bully the weak and fear the strong.

580
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,020
This time, an act turned into reality,

581
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,160
and I was really poisoned.

582
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,950
I doubt he'll listen to me.

583
00:38:41,970 --> 00:38:42,970
He might

584
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,960
even take advantage of this situation while I'm poisoned

585
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,260
to take revenge.

586
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:48,400
I...

587
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,020
The demons are cunning

588
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,430
and bring disaster to the six realms.

589
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,140
You volunteered to work with him.

590
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:55,270
This is just karma.

591
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,180
Not all demons are bad.

592
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,290
There are exceptions.

593
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:03,500
Fine.

594
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,400
I deserve it.

595
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:06,690
I'll just die, at most.

596
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,720
There's nothing to be afraid of.

597
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:12,030
What nonsense are you talking about?

598
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,200
Since I promised to detoxify you,

599
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,200
I won't sit by and watch.

600
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,200
Thank you then.

601
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,140
All right.

602
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,190
I'm going to find that Scorpion.

603
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,070
Stay at home alone.

604
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,230
If you can't find the Scorpion Demon,

605
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,350
don't delay it.

606
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:56,020
At least let me see you again

607
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,290
before I die.

608
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,640
If you say something like that again,

609
00:40:01,530 --> 00:40:03,590
I'll teach you a lesson.

610
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:08,000
Then you must be careful.

611
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,560
Don't hurt yourself.

612
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,320
In this world,

613
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,410
few things can

614
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,850
hurt me.

615
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:18,900
All right.

616
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,020
Be good and stay at home.

617
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,350
Don't cause me any more trouble.
